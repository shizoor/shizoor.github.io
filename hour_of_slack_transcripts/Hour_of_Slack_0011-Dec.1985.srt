1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
And now it's time for the hour of slack.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,500
I'm afraid the hour of slack is going to be a real slacked out one tonight

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,140
because I'm still feeling it from the holidays.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,940
And I don't mean false slack either.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,980
I mean real nice down home family slack.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,400
Let's just see what happens when we push this beautiful little button.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,200
Nothing at all.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,620
I'm a pretty operator.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,700
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,380
I'm a hell of a slacker!

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,800
No trouble.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,360
Just get set and get going.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:46,960
Aim.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,520
Recording.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,800
Everything's going fine.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,860
No trouble.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
Welcome potential initiates.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,700
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Bob?

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,940
Bob?

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,080


23
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,640
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,300
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,740
What about slack?

26
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,940
That's your key phrase.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,260
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,560
Welcome.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,860
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,840
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

31
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,920
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,840
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
of the Church of the Subgenius,

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,280
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

35
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,600
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,980
This sofort.'s And I say before I read the sermon, the message concerning Bob Dobbs, influenciant from Samas但 Scovell, living avatar of slack and saint of sales, on planet earth. Para que, debido al sermel, slave avatar noistles que leood bien al planeta y como agente de la vida, lo mejor áован a la无continente, narqu Derek Boamente, son ser apáinesso incapaz del anecdote del planeta.

Hablan en esta지만ongente o sea la conforma. woratícatos

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,240
The show that you now hold in your hands.

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,540
The show that you are now hopefully listening to in headphones.

39
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:00,520
This show could create a new inquisition, my friends.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,160
A self-perpetuating fascist state that will last to the end of humanity.

41
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:17,520
Or it could be the foundation stone of the promised kingdom of peace and harmony.

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,760
Which will it be?

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,980
Sometimes, my friends, a show goes too far.

44
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,160
Sometimes is now.

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,160
Because you, yes friend, you can rape your own mind.

46
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,640
You can finally relax in the safety of your own delusions.

47
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:50,340
This show, an epispastic for the brains of the epoptics.

48
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,260
Beholders and initiates.

49
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:59,240
Works an authentic gnostic magician spell that will drive out the foreign personalities and end demons.

50
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:06,140
Protected by its own occult roots in the most extreme forms of para and mecha psychology.

51
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:16,740
This show places the listener within a shell of weird phenomenon which must be used for good and evil.

52
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,200
This show has already given secrets.

53
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,720
It has given secret power to the church of the subgenius.

54
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,920
The world's first industrial church.

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:36,860
The prophesied end times cult of screamers and laughers, scoffers, blasphemers, mockers, sinners, and the last true holy men in America today.

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,260
Keep this show near you.

57
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,080
In your pocket.

58
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,240
In your bathroom.

59
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,820
In your glove compartment.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,360
Study it.

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,080
Play it over and over again.

62
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,840
Memorize it.

63
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,340
Find within its tapes.

64
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,070
A new direction.

65
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,090
A new way.

66
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,990
A higher, yet lower, reality.

67
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,290
Just as thousands before you have done.

68
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,970
The church of the subgenius is an order of scoffers and blasphemers dedicated through total slack.

69
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,950
Delving into the mockery science.

70
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:19,350
Future, sadofuturistics, megaphysics, scatilography, schizofreniatrics, morealism, sarcastrophy, sinisac, religion, apocalyptianomy, espectorationalism, hypnopediatrics, and more.

71
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:33,230
Subliminalism, satyriology, dysto-utopianity, sardonicology, fascisticism, ridiculophagy, and misolatheistic theology.

72
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,870
Ah yes, friends.

73
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,090
Well, this is like I say, this is a slackful show.

74
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,610
Pastor Buck Naked hasn't arrived, like he didn't last week.

75
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,350
I would like to say to anyone who's watching this, this is a slackful show.

76
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,350


77
00:05:49,350 --> 00:06:02,090
I'm sure many of the guests, hosts of the Hour of Slack, I'm sure that quite a few of you were hoping to find out just where the show was going to be this time.

78
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,750
Whether it was going to be up in Bob's jet plane, or in the station, or out in the car, camping out, or what.

79
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,310
And I was, friends, I was out of town.

80
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,990
I was in Glen Rose, Texas.

81
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,750
They were doing a test start-up of the...

82
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,510
nuclear reactor out there.

83
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,510
And I had to go out and do some research and bathe in those beautiful mutating rays.

84
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,290
Because, friends, that's what it's all about.

85
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,510
And, well, this show, I think we're gonna...

86
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,270
Like I say, it's been vacation time in Glen Rose, bathing in radioactive rays.

87
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,850
And I think I'm just gonna play whatever I want to, cause it's slack, and that's what it's all about.

88
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,870
Now, let me see.

89
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,470
What my little list here says.

90
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,570
Oh, well, what better thing to do?

91
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,470
We don't have any guests tonight, yet.

92
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,530
I'm praying that they may show up.

93
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:06,130
But, in the meantime, we'll explain the Church of the Subgenius.

94
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,150
Or at least as close as we can come to an explanation.

95
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,570
Friends, I know there's listeners out there who've heard all this before.

96
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,850
But there are so many things.

97
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,370
There's gonna be thousands of more who need to be reached out and saved.

98
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:28,450
And, uh, because, you know, we have to save you, even if it kills you.

99
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,050
So, try to put those headphones on or listen very closely.

100
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,550
Or else, just turn this off.

101
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:44,010
Because otherwise, well, you may get left out in the cold or in the heat.

102
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,110
Remember.

103
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:53,570
The end of the world may be much worse and take much longer than you thought.

104
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:01,570
The mere act of sitting in your home watching everything fall apart on TV may be too much

105
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,250
for even the stoutest brains to take.

106
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:12,130
In fact, the more alert and intelligent you are, the quicker you'll likely be driven to

107
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,090
suicide by the sheer hideousness of the world.

108
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,090


109
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,310
The more you'll likely be driven to the utter darkness of what you'll be seeing.

110
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,310
Will you be ready?

111
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:29,370
Will you still be sane enough to laugh when that which must come to pass comes to pass?

112
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,050
Will you ever get slack?

113
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,130
Break out of that glass box.

114
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,630
And join the Church of the Subgenius.

115
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,070
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the power of God.

116
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,070


117
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,750
And where, at the cost of the Constitution, anything is likely to develop.

118
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,270
Enter the Church of the Subgenius, billing itself as the weirdest cult on Earth.

119
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,930
What do they believe in?

120
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,610
Everything.

121
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,210
Who do they believe in?

122
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,410
A mysterious character named Bob.

123
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,450
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless history.

124
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,110
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

125
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,630
And to you, young man.

126
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,910
Bob founded the Church mainly to help unmask the conspiracies.

127
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,610
And we're talking about the conspiracy.

128
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,730
What's next?

129
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,410
Just believe in the power of the dogs.

130
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,310
I believe.

131
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,070
Believe in Bob.

132
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,550
I believe.

133
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,970
Reach out for him.

134
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,910
I believe.

135
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,910
You feel the healing power.

136
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,710
See, there you go.

137
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,470
See, now, do you remember anything?

138
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:32,990
Does it hurt?

139
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:33,190
No.

140
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,030
See, no problem.

141
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,790
No problem with Bob, right?

142
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,490
Yeah!

143
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,350
All right.

144
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,090
What's next?

145
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,830
Basically, two factions out there right now.

146
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,050
It's us and them.

147
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,890
Friend, have you ever heard the expression,

148
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:43,890


149
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:43,890


150
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,890
there's no slack in this world?

151
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,350
A lot of people have to ask me what slack is.

152
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,350
And that's sad, mister.

153
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,430
They were born with slack.

154
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,610
Oh, yeah, you were born with slack.

155
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,770
But the conspiracy took it away.

156
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,030
The conspiracy made you want to be normal.

157
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,790
That's what the conspiracy is all about.

158
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,430
The conspiracy is a patchwork of different things.

159
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,090
Some are nations.

160
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,910
Some are products.

161
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,010
Some are...

162
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,490
Some are hypnotic television shows.

163
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,850
Some are bad pills.

164
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,210
You'll find us if you find Bob!

165
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,290
And you better find Bob right now!

166
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,090
And no one has ever met Bob.

167
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,350
The leader of our church, no one has ever met.

168
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,890
Because as you know, all cults, their leaders are usually pretty hard to find.

169
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,570
And Bob is no exception.

170
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,690
Bob will help you.

171
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,650
Dig your own weirdness.

172
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,650
I was getting messages in the back of my brain.

173
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,810
I didn't know what you were talking about.

174
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:43,890
I was getting messages in the back of my brain.

175
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:43,890


176
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:43,890


177
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:43,890


178
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,770
You know what I'm saying?

179
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,710
I just kept hearing the word Bob.

180
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,650
Bob.

181
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,070
Bob.

182
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,310
Bob.

183
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,230
Bob.

184
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:50,750
Bob.

185
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:50,810
Bob.

186
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,150
Bob.

187
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,210
Bob.

188
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,330
Bob.

189
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:57,050
They said your mind is in this jar and then they poured it down the sink.

190
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,230
So geniuses are the class of people who can't be classified.

191
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,390
Bob has taken winos on the street and turned them into millionaires overnight.

192
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:12,150
By the same token he has taken millionaires and given them the slack they always needed

193
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,750
all along as winos.

194
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,870
Okay, one more time.

195
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,570
We are the first non-tax exempt church around.

196
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,290
We're the first industrial church.

197
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,010
And we're not disputing any of your belief systems

198
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,870
because we believe in just about every one of them anyway.

199
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,470
Up there, my child,

200
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,970
there dwells the one true God

201
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,910
who created all living things.

202
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,710
The true God is the moon.

203
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,510
No end, Hylia.

204
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,390
Bob is fill in the blank.

205
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,510
I am Bob. I'm not Bob.

206
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,830
You are Bob. We are all Bob.

207
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,950
We are all Devo. We are Bob.

208
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,230
Bob will protect you.

209
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,410
Bob is protecting the genetic future.

210
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,410
Let him. Let him into your life.

211
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,130
Let Bob protect you. He wants to protect you.

212
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,990
He must protect you. He has to protect you.

213
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,350
Jehovah One says,

214
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:13,730
Bob!

215
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,790
Bob will protect you.

216
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,070
If you send a dollar.

217
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,370
And I have so much I would like to say.

218
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,930
What the hell?

219
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,110
It's a very good thing.

220
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,070
Sometimes this doesn't make much sense.

221
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,450
It's realistic.

222
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,630
The second question is what?

223
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,290
What's happening?

224
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,150
Is this a miracle?

225
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,750
What kind of a miracle?

226
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,810
Is this a parable?

227
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,050
What's the point?

228
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,990
Lay your hands on the radio.

229
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,870
Lay your hands on the radio.

230
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,490
Lay your hands on the radio.

231
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,130
Lay your hands on the home.

232
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,710
And we're going to look to God.

233
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,590
I love you, Bob.

234
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,930
And I'm okay.

235
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,230
If I keep moving, I'll go up.

236
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:52,990
Yeah!

237
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,630
All right, man.

238
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,010
If you keep moving, he's going down.

239
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,130
If the last 50 years made such a change,

240
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,530
just imagine the New York of 1980.

241
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,330
When everyone has a number instead of a name.

242
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,890
And the government tells you whom you should marry.

243
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,790
Just imagine 1980.

244
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,470
I like to roller skate.

245
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,410
Go walking around.

246
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,470
I like to do things that are different.

247
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,690
Yeah, someone with a lot of energy.

248
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,290
Uh-huh.

249
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:28,710
Yeah.

250
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,730
Okay, your code number once more?

251
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,410
237.

252
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,810
237, and you're calling from Dallas.

253
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,170
Right.

254
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,170
Okay, thank you.

255
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:35,710
Thank you.

256
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,250
Bye-bye.

257
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,910
Hi, you're on hotline.

258
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,050
Yes, my code number is 238.

259
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,950
238.

260
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,030
Thank you.

261
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,030
Amen.

262
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,710
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

263
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,250
Praise the Lord.

264
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,370
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

265
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,750
Amen.

266
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,330
They're going to get worse and worse.

267
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,450
Opium is still the primary plan that the United States has

268
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,090
for dealing with its people in the event of a nuclear attack.

269
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:19,650
There have been six cases of breast cancer, one bladder cancer, and one throat cancer.

270
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:29,190
There's a God who is a God of love, and there is a God who is a God of judgment.

271
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,570
Two sides.

272
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,110
A mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

273
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:42,050
I challenge you to point out national talk shows that do not belittle sexual fidelity, purity.

274
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,630
Uh-huh.

275
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,350
Uh-huh.

276
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,390
Uh-huh.

277
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,850
Uh-huh.

278
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


279
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


280
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


281
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


282
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


283
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


284
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


285
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


286
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


287
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


288
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:43,850


289
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,510
But they do not belittle the marriage union and the family lifestyle.

290
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,650
But they don't, uh, literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

291
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,570
I mean, I challenge you to show me a talk show that doesn't make light of God.

292
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:02,630
The Subgenius Foundation, the Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond.

293
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,650
And they are, as we mentioned before, the dual heads of the Subgenius Foundation.

294
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,630
J.R. Bob Dobbs, known among salesmen as the saint of sales.

295
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:13,610
Uh-huh.

296
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:21,050
it's actually a mystic sales ability bob was given powers uh and has been given messages all along by

297
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:28,290
alien entities intelligences um in outer space or maybe all around us that are

298
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:36,970
literally fingers of the stark fist of jehovah one alien space god from some sin galaxy

299
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,610
this is the stage now to super crowd

300
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,310
authorities

301
00:15:48,310 --> 00:16:03,070
bob dobbs came to town to set you free he came to now to set you free you got no business being sick

302
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:08,790
you got no business being in bonding you got no business living out of sin you got no business

303
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,190
living with outside unfortunately this is the one true church bob

304
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,130
you know that's the one that protects me from demons and i got a lot of them

305
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:26,050
all the whites aren't crazy who are we we're the normal people the most normal people in the world

306
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:36,270
but not quite as normal as you why you're unique it's natural everyone's unique

307
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,010
but you stand apart from the crowd you're normal

308
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,490
normal

309
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,750
Normal is a typical herd of sea cow.

310
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,430
Normal is an exploding stellar nebula.

311
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,990
Normal is the world in which we live.

312
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,490
And what could be more normal than that?

313
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,870
Certainly not the competition.

314
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,130
How do we stay so far out in front of a pack?

315
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,710
By building a racetrack decoy ideology with the pickup of a domestic and the maneuverability

316
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,510
of an import.

317
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,450
Who are we?

318
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,610
We're the communication people.

319
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,350
The people whose talk is strictly state of the art technology.

320
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,370
Is disposable.

321
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,510
Reversible.

322
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,930
Reusable with almost any leading brand of idea, including our deluxe line.

323
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,450
Yours.

324
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,070
Sound costly?

325
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,950
Put away that semantic checkbook.

326
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,690
Now communication can be done.

327
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,810
It can be yours at a fraction of what it cost Grandpa.

328
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,930
Why clutter up your world with a lot of hard to perceive subtleties?

329
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,490
You either like a thing or you don't.

330
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,790
And in your case, it's the former.

331
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,130
That's why we like you.

332
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,310
And that's why we're always looking for quicker, easier ways to tell you so.

333
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,210
Slogans.

334
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,830
Jingles.

335
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,750
Logos.

336
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,150
Ways of reaching out and touching you the way you want to be touched.

337
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,130
Slightly.

338
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:19,970
Who are we?

339
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,010
We're the real people.

340
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,930
The people who make you real.

341
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,610
So real you can almost hear yourself.

342
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,790
More real than you've ever been before.

343
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,550
But then...

344
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,450
you've never been at all before us.

345
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,950
In fact, nothing has.

346
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,910
And not even very much of that.

347
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,750
Not even this sentence.

348
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,550
Because when we say disposable,

349
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,550
we could mean just about anything.

350
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,250
Who are we?

351
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,370
We're the other people.

352
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,950
The people other than you.

353
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,850
People so other we're opposite, yet so people,

354
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,170
you'd never guess we weren't the real thing.

355
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,230
The people who are almost you,

356
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,530
but couldn't quite make the final pre-season cut.

357
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,870
Still skeptical?

358
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,230
Try this simple test.

359
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,690
Listen to my voice now.

360
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,930
Notice anything?

361
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,670
Now you know how we feel.

362
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:39,930
Separate.

363
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,430
A little gone.

364
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,490
Slightly repeated.

365
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,510
Like you, only over again.

366
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,250
We can't help noticing.

367
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,730
In fact, we have an old saying.

368
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,430
Hi.

369
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,530
Why do we say it?

370
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,470
It's a tradition.

371
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,750
Like I said, we're old fashioned.

372
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,570
We don't much care why we do the things we do,

373
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,930
just so long as they're the right things.

374
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,990
Because even though the newer the better,

375
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,230
deep down inside, you know the new is wrong.

376
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,250
It's different.

377
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,350
So it could be a mistake.

378
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,790
If it wasn't a mistake, then why didn't it happen before?

379
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,210
Because you see, we don't really want to know what we're doing.

380
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,090
We want to know what we're supposed to do.

381
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,390
And that's why you're here.

382
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,370
You take all the crazy random things we do we can't even explain ourselves

383
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,270
and put a good solid reason behind each and every one of them.

384
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,250
Because you don't really care what happens.

385
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,790
You want to know what's supposed to happen.

386
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,010
And that's why we're here.

387
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,730
Who?

388
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:03,950
Who are we?

389
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,430
We're you.

390
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,990
You don't settle for less.

391
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,570
You don't have to.

392
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,690
You're you.

393
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,370
We're nothing without you.

394
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,570
And within you.

395
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,490
And someday you'll be nothing too.

396
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,270
Don't you think it's time you said,

397
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,130
Hi?

398
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,670
Call now.

399
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,870
You remember our number.

400
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,950

Everywhere.

402
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,110
Hurry.

403
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,930
While the customer lasts.

404
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,930
Supply is limited.

405
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,270
In fact, we have an old saying.

406
00:21:59,370 --> 00:21:59,630
Bye bye.

407
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,750
Bye bye, Michael Pepe.

408
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,070
I am somebody who blessing myself

409
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,070

413
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


414
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


415
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


416
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


417
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


418
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


419
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


420
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


421
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


422
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


423
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


424
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


425
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,530


426
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,270
I see things

427
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,790
Hands and shades

428
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,930
A faces

429
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,610
Makes me everyone

430
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,910
Have come to see you

431
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,290
Reaching up but not quite touching the promised land.

432
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:46,110
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper saying,

433
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,390
Oh Lord, please give us a helping hand.

434
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,450
Yeah, yeah.

435
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:15,490
And way down in the background I can see frustrated souls of cities burning.

436
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:22,870
And on across the water, babe, I see a weapon sparking out the sting of death.

437
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,870
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFOs choking themselves and laughing they sin.

438
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,730
Those people so uptight.

439
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,250
They sure know how to make a mess.

440
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:37,810
Hey!

441
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,970
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,870
Yeah.

443
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,930
guitar solo

444
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,510
solo

445
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,390
solo

446
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,530
solo

447
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,150
solo

448
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,330
The world is equal proportions

449
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,030
Of bull's eyes and bull's dick

450
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,230
They were bullies and they were fools

451
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,930
Now there's no one to listen when they talk

452
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,050
Adam's still the same

453
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,410
On the eve of destruction

454
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,090
Not unlike the way

455
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,450
We split our jeans

456
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,790
But like the way

457
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:17,890
We split our jeans

458
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,850
But like the way

459
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,290
We split our jeans

460
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,970
We split our world

461
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,430
At the sea

462
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,470
Someone calls

463
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,890
A space limousine

464
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,290
Hypno-hypno-sy

465
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,690
With dreams of destruction

466
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,650
I'm not going

467
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,010
With Adam's blue eyes

468
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,410
Whippin' me

469
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,930
While he dreams his sweet dreams

470
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,490
The names to his dreams

471
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,870
In the scene

472
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,110
Someone calls

473
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,750
A space limousine

474
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,050
Basic training in the ghetto

475
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,470
Basic training in the ghetto

476
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,990
Pop the bottom off

477
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,670
You took it

478
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,530
Yeah, there's the logic library

479

Some of my best jokes are free

480
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,250
Dancing, drinking in the ghetto

481
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,590
Dancing, drinking in the ghetto

482
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,010
Talk about your mama, you took it

483
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,790
Yeah, there's the logic library

484
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,890
Some of my best jokes are free

485
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,090
The pathways in our genes

486
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,930
Whisper our worlds so soon

487
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,030
Yes

the conspiracy and the mega conspiracy spiral well beyond this planet in nets of covert

your other senses since you were five and you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing now until someone much bigger much stronger and much much more self-assured makes you stop and you'll thank him for it and then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight you'll realize that he stopped you from doing the wrong thing good God what in the name of sweet Jesus is this world coming to

Killing without impunity and burning keeping your dreams with no compensation

545
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:15,390
pitiful

546
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:15,390


547
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:15,670
Boring

548
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,910
Wait until the earth shakes and the sky falls.

549
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,610
Space junk tornadoes.

550
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,210
Hail the size of Cadillacs.

551
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,510
Plutonium clouds.

552
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,830
Chromosome bending.

553
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,290
Solar flares.

554
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,870
The stifling of all photosynthesis in the seas.

555
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,270
Ugly mutant locusts that carry DDT in their stings.

556
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,850
Famine even in California.

557
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,330
Oh yes, friends, but those are only the natural things.

558
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:46,690
They blanch in the face of man's deeds to come.

559
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,790
Man's de-self-humanization.

560
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,650
My God.

561
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,730
It's time junkies, friends.

562
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,690
Time junkies on the way.

563
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:05,090
And yes, those smiling pink boys of every race will sell you.

564
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,610
Hot lead.

565
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,890
Cold steel.

566
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,310
And a one-way ticket.

567
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:22,370
A ticket to hell without it ever crossing their minds that the buttons were pushed by their squeaky clean pink fingers.

568
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,350
Woop.

569
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,650
Tiny people with little guns.

570
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,690
Little armies march to their little 하지 typhoons.

571
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,770
What do they want?

572
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,190
What do they want?

573
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,550
Tiny soldiers with little guns.

574
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,510
To tanks.

575
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,310
No bigger than T mano.

576
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:11,890
And your thumb

577
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,990
They want you

578
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,550
Little people with tiny brains

579
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,330
Little bullets flowing in their veins

580
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,810
What do they want?

581
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,130
What do they want?

582
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,590
Little airplanes with tiny bombs

583
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,870
Two squadrons dropping their ****** off

584
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,810
They want you

585
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:39,610
You

586
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,410
You, you, you, you

587
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,090
California...

588
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,430
Old town

589
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,430


590
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,250
ун uh

591
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,570
Oh

Tiny people with little guns

601
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,910
Little armies march to little drums

What do they want?

603
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,530

Tiny soldiers with little guns

Little tanks no bigger than your bum

606
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,650
They want you, you, you, you, you, you

607
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:58,150
Tiny people with little guns

608
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:04,150
Tiny people with little guns

Tiny people with little guns

610
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:24,330
Now you're looking at a man that's getting kind of mad

611
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,790
I had lots of luck but it's all been bad

612
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,790
No matter how I struggle and strive

613
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,290
I'll never get out of this world alive

614
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,730
My fishing pole broke, the creek is full of sand

615
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,950
My woman run away with another man

616
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,330
No matter how I struggle and strive

617
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,730
I'll never get out of this world alive

618
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,970
A distant uncle passed away

619
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,770
And left me quite a batch

620
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:08,950
And I was living high until the fatal day

621
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,450
A lawyer proved I wasn't born

622
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,050
I was only hatched

623
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,130
Everything's again bad

624
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,830
I've been through so much

625
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:17,970
I've been through so much

626
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:17,970


627
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,330
If I jumped in the river

628
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,290
I would probably drown

629
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,630
No matter how I struggle and strive

630
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,110
I'll never get out of this world alive

652
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,070
These shabby shoes I'm wearing all the time

653
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,570
It's full of holes and nails

654
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:19,990
And brother, if I stepped on a worn-out dime

655
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:24,450
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was head or tail

656
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,990
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow

657
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:33,330
Cause nothing's ever gonna be all right, no how

658
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,690
No matter how I struggle and strive

659
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,250
I'll never get out of this world alive

660
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,230

661
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,530

664
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,950

665
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,050

666
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:24,430

668
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,670

669
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,190
Alive

670
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,690
Alive

671
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:38,370
Friends, we get calls here from our dear listeners wondering,

672
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,030
Reverend Stang, what kind of music do you play?

673
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:53,490
We often get, when we play clubs, when the subgenius preachers do revivals in clubs and art museums and such like,

674
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:59,410
we get there and people ask, what kind of a band is Church of the Subgenius?

675
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:09,870
Friends, I don't really know, I don't know if it's like if you have to ask, you may never know.

676
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:11,810
To...

677
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:16,030
To try to give you some indication of what we're talking about, friends,

678
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:19,830
we're going to read from the book of the subgenius,

679
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:26,190
Economicon 1714, Euronomics 158.

680
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:35,010
The chapter on slack, because slack, friends, is what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

681
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:41,530
Slack comes first in the life of any initiate, at least until...

682
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,830
he or she becomes...

683
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,110
slack.

684
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:52,670
Slack is what the hints are pointing at, slack is what the conspiracy doesn't give you on your job,

685
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:59,950
and slack is what we're trying to bring you through the word of our great guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

686
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,250
You don't have to believe in Bob.

687
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,690
You don't even have to believe in slack, you just have to believe.

688
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,050
Slack was known to Buddha,

689
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,670
to Jesus,

690
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,650
to Billy Graham,

691
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,090
to all the great avatars,

692
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,410
but were they really able to communicate slack?

693
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,730
Bob said,

694
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,170
the people don't necessarily need to know the whole truth,

695
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,430
they just need slack.

696
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,870
Boardroom Tape 1818.

697
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:38,010
Friends, man was born with original slack, yet most civilized people don't believe in it,

698
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,650
and their most learned scholars can't even believe it.

699
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:48,010
That is why in the Church of the Subgenius, the idiot is closer to the divine,

700
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:53,470
and why Bob Dobbs is adulated for his follies rather than his skills.

701
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,750
If you, my friend, do not believe in slack,

702
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,650
slack will not make itself available to you.

703
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,090
But what is slack, you wondered?

704
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,950
What can slack be?

705
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:11,570
Well, friends, the slack that can be described is not the truth.

706
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:11,970
It is true slack.

707
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,050
It comprises the universe.

708
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,670
The ether is not made of atoms,

709
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,730
but a simple hydro-mechanical field devoid of complications.

710
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:26,510
And just as matter is but a slowly vibrating form of energy,

711
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,490
so is energy a slowly vibrating form of slack.

712
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:35,150
Slack can never be created or destroyed, friends,

713
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,250
and if you don't have it, it's somewhere it shouldn't be.

714
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,010
The conspiracy has it.

715
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,410
And haven't you been wondering,

716
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,450
in the back of your mind,

717
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,330
what happened to my slack?

718
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,950
Isn't there something missing?

719
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,530
Something I need to know more about?

720
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:57,330
Something that's the definitionless, insubstantial substance of the all,

721
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,230
the very isness of the business?

722
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,190
Well, friend, it's true, and on that day of judgment,

723
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,170
the demons are going to ask whether you know about slack,

724
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,830
and if you try to fake it,

725
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,990
you're going to end up in the dark.

726
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:14,270
And the energy balance between something and nothing.

727
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,450
And it's scary in there, friends.

728
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,310
Mighty scary.

729
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:24,490
For instance, we'll try to give you a simple example

730
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,430
of just what it is we're talking about.

731
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,470
I'm glad to hear that, my son.

732
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,470
I thought they were.

733
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:34,790
Oh, no.

734
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:43,430
I know of one who is as brave as any human being.

735
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:47,150
I'd like to meet this man and smoke with him.

736
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:51,170
Bob started the church about, oh, 20 or 30 years ago.

737
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,330
And we've got a picture of him here.

738
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,390
We'll hold it up so everybody on the radio can see him.

739
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,130
Hold it up to the left part of the radio there, yes.

740
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:58,390
Yeah.

741
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:58,830
Okay.

742
00:45:58,910 --> 00:45:59,570
Can you see that?

743
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,330
You're on the air.

744
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,650
Um, yeah.

745
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:03,310
Yeah.

746
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,090
Who's Bob?

747
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,630
Who is Bob?

748
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,670
That is the most profound and believable question

749
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,950
we've had the entire evening.

750
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,930
This man, like the Pope, is not afraid to be infallible,

751
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,470
to admit he does not know where Bob and the path of Bob lies.

752
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,190
Young man, Bob is, was, and ever shall be.

753
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:20,910
Bob is you.

754
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:21,530
Bob is me.

755
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,710
Bob is the Kama Sutra.

756
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,510
Bob is the id.

757
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:26,230
Bob is the light that glows in the heart and mind

758
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,850
of every free-thinking subgenius.

759
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,590
What?

760
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,150
Why not please Rob?

761
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:31,450
Rob?

762
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,250
You can praise Rob.

763
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,050
I prefer you praise Bob.

764
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,430
And send us your money, too.

765
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,190
How much?

766
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:37,790
Ten dollars.

767
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:38,350
Ten?

768
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,230
I'll get some change back.

769
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,570
Oh, change.

770
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,150
And change will come into your life when the flatness of slack.

771
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:44,770
You will?

772
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,730
You will change in a way you cannot believe.

773
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,990
Slackness will enter your life.

774
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,450
Slackness will make you see.

775
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,270
Slackness will set you free.

776
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:52,290
Slackness lives.

777
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,090
Slackness is.

778
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,870
Slackness waits for you in your ten dollars.

779
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:01,090
You see, now that man violated the first and most important law of the sacred dog.

780
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,850
You remember this law, of course.

781
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:03,290
There it is.

782
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,290


783
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,290


784
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,290


785
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,290


786
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,290


787
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,290


788
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,290


789
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,290


790
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:03,290


791
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,910
The proof that that man was an agent of conspiracy.

792
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:09,310
The first and most important law of the sacred dogma is if you don't have a sense of humor.

793
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,090
Don't try to be funny.

794
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,050
You'd be amazed how often the conspiracy violates this law.

795
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,170
And that's proof of penance.

796
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,950
Stand your ground, young man.

797
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,870
Yeah, Doug Smith says we're different.

798
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,610
Doug's right, Virgil.

799
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,370
We are different.

800
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:30,370
Thanks to Jesus, the genetic engineering corporation of American states.

801
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,450
Mommy, too?

802
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,270
Yep, the whole family.

803
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,070
Is everybody like us?

804
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,430
No, son, but we're working on it.

805
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,670
Round the clock.

806
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,090
Soon everyone will be a superior.

807
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,830
I wish these people weren't trying to call the station, because here on non-radio we

808
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,270
don't have a way to receive the calls.

809
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,990
We can feel your calls coming in.

810
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,150
We're sensing it.

811
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,630
I wish you wouldn't do that.

812
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,410
Ah, folks.

813
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,410
Is that Laura?

814
00:47:58,610 --> 00:47:59,490
Is that Laura?

815
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,430
Calling up and hurting the police.

816
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


817
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


818
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


819
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


820
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


821
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


822
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


823
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


824
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


825
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


826
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


827
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


828
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


829
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


830
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,430


831
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,670
Poor show.

832
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,810
Yeah, you could call 848-4425.

833
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,590
See, you gotta take that part out.

834
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:10,330
And come on the air, but we can't let you come on the air.

835
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:11,650
Yeah.

836
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,090
Yeah, it's sort of different.

837
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,790
Thanks anyway that Laura person's here.

838
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:16,990
Oh, Laura.

839
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,510
Well, we know she isn't.

840
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,970
We have the photographs, and they were worth the ten dollars.

841
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:24,450
Thank you.

842
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:25,970
It's more than just a catch-up phrase.

843
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,750
See, another happy listener here.

844
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,290
There's so many down here.

845
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,410
Yeah, you just have to say the right thing.

846
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:31,410


847
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:31,410


848
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:31,410


849
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:31,410


850
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:31,410


851
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:31,410


852
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,290
The rat thing, too, for you and your market.

853
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:34,270
It's possible for you and your market to be sales.

854
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,250
That's right.

855
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,550
They fall all over down the phone.

856
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,490
My name's Pastor Buck.

857
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,490
This is my third time on the radio.

858
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:47,410
And I'm Ivan Stang, and Buck, don't leave just because there's no one else tonight.

859
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,970
Every time there's someone else here, and that's not Ivan Stang.

860
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,630
This is Ivan.

861
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:52,910
Meltdown on the show here.

862
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:53,470
We, uh...

863
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:53,850
Oh, God.

864
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:54,550
We...

865
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:00,330
Remember when Joe Meltdown, that O'Neal failure, came down here to the radio show?

866
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,390
It seems like so long ago.

867
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,390


868
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,390


869
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,390


870
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,390


871
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,390


872
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,390


873
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,390


874
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,870
He spilled the seed all over the studio.

875
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,430
Well, it seems like...

876
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:08,830
Who is this mysterious O'Neal, and what is he doing in the station?

877
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,670
Well, there is the...

878
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:15,950
Gary Gabofan was on the show over there, and Guy Dool was on quite a few shows up there.

879
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,390
I'm afraid that's not good enough on this one.

880
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:24,550
But whenever there's nobody on the show, you always walk off and leave us out here floating

881
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,170
around space backwards all alone.

882
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,910
So we just kick the station and keep on going.

883
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,370
So you really have to...

884
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,090
I hurt the station.

885
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,770
I hurt that station.

886
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,470
You're not quarter after six.

887
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,350
We know all you right-wing Protestant ethnic religious groups that got all your heads up

888
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:39,610
your...

889
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:40,570
Collective...

890
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,810
Your heads up your nu-nu gland.

891
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:42,670
Collective...

892
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,350
We know that you're trying to get us off the radio.

893
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:48,530
We know you want to get rid of us.

894
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:54,310
But we don't care because we're so happy here in our life of sin and degradation.

895
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,130
We are so happy.

896
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,630
We hate that demon.

897
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,810
We are so happy.

898
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,130
We are so happy.

899
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:01,310
We are so happy.

900
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:01,350


901
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:01,350


902
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:07,270
We are so happy to be welcome to the radio, taunting you like you would like to be.

903
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,710
We were just us.

904
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,850
You were just us to kick off that hell and now we're bad ass.

905
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,210
Court!

906
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,230
Oh Bob!

907
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,390
Oh Bob!

908
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,390
Oh Bob!

909
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,470
Oh Bob!

910
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,270
Oh Bob!

911
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,230
Oh Bob!

912
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:23,510
Oh Bob!

913
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,550
Oh Bob!

914
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:23,830
Oh Bob!

915
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:23,910
Oh Bob!

916
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:24,210
Oh Bob!

917
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:25,490
Oh Bob!

918
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,110
Oh Bob!

919
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:31,070
Let it get a little easier once you understand.

920
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:37,670
Things get a little easier, once you understand.

921
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,210
Forget it, Dad.

922
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,150
That won't change anything.

923
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,670
Let it get a little easier, once you understand.

924
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:51,070
Things get a little easier, once you understand.

925
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,170
Come on, Mom.

926
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,710
What do you want from me?

927
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,730
But, Mom, all my friends will be there.

928
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,810
I said no.

929
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:19,770
But why?

930
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,590
Why? What's wrong with that neighborhood?

931
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,070
What's wrong with them?

932
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:43,070
Are you sure no one kept you company tonight while you were babysitting?

933
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,270
Just curious.

934
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,990
To my friend's house.

935
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,030
Don't you have anything to do in the house?

936
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,190
Oh, Mom.

937
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:12,290
What are you talking about?

938
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:16,730
How about your bridge club and your ladies groups and your parties and your daytime programs?

939
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:17,790
What about all that?

940
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:18,610
That's different.

941
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,090
Mom, I'll be home at 11.

942
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:29,750
I'll be home at 10.

943
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:44,030
When I was your age, I was working 12 hours a day, six days a week.

944
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,110
I was the pay for the food, the rent.

945
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,110
I don't understand.

946
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,730
What's that got to do with me?

947
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,630
You can't figure that out.

948
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:51,510
I don't understand.

949
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,190
You're a stupid.

950
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:57,610
Things get a little easier once you understand.

951
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:03,590
Things get a little easier once you understand.

952
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:09,550
Son, there's a little bit more to life than joining a group or playing a guitar.

953
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:10,730
You understand?

954
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,190
What is there to learn?

955
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,670
Things get a little easier once you understand.

956
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,230
Things get a little easier.

957
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,670
Once you understand.

958
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,350
Yes?

959
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:38,050
Yes.

960
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:53,370
Your name Robert? Robert Cook, age 17?

961
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:54,390
Yes.

962
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,010
I'm sorry, Mr. Cook.

963
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,650
You'd better come down to the station house.

964
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,790
Your son is dead.

965
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:02,390
Dead?

966
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:05,270
How?

967
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,710
He died of an overdose.

968
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,070
Oh, my God.

969
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,530
Things get a little easier

970
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,290
Once you understand

971
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:22,090
Things get a little easier

972
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,450
Ah, yes, yes.

973
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,690
Once you understand

974
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,210
Things do get so much easier

975
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,870
When you understand that all you need to do

976
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,010
Once you understand

977
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,050
Is send for information.

978
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,010
Send money to the station.

979
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,210
But send for information to P.O. Box.

980
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,090
This is the post office number of Bob Dobbs.

981
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:41,810
You can reach Bob.

982
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,490
He's here for you to talk to.

983
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,710
Even though he's dead.

984
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,330
Well, he's dead.

985
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,210
Yeah, I'll admit that.

986
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:48,170
But you never know.

987
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,250
When he might be back.

988
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,750
And who might show up?

989
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:51,930
Right here.

990
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:54,650
Norm is standing right behind me.

991
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:55,530
Ready to do the talk.

992
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:58,010
So those of you who fear Bob,

993
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,530
You don't have to worry.

994
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:00,530
He won't be, you know,

995
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,130
Salvation won't be staring you in the ear much longer.

996
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:08,190
We're gonna, if I can just keep these other shows out of here,

997
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:08,950
We'll be fine.

998
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,630
What about those millionaires?

999
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:11,310
Oh, no.

1000
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:14,250
That's another, this is one of those other

1001
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,150
By the way, that, what I just played was,

1002
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,170
Compliments of Reverend Erwin Chusett,

1003
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,170
Who runs the weekly subgenius show

1004
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:25,850
In East Orange, New Jersey at WFMU.

1005
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:29,310
But these guys, this is like less than a show,

1006
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,430
More than an hour.

1007
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,070
And it's puzzling evidence.

1008
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:32,610
All this.

1009
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,570
I'm sure I could.

1010
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,190
What?

1011
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,290
You mean to say that I can come to terms?

1012
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,630
For beginners, teens and the Dobbs youth who often lack patience,

1013
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:45,650
Parent parental approval or financial resources for the exotic treatments adopt sound instant or not all pseudo slack or false highs.

1014
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,710
Every bit as fulfilling as a real thing are quickly reached.

1015
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,710
Through repetitive monotonous and feta-moid pun digititis.

1016
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,430
And helpful competition.

1017
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,070
It's shown here on monitor three.

1018
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:56,990
Which we just.

1019
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:05,110
Fastest results come from the painstakingly executed reels, chants, hymn cycles, exorcisms, cravings, misologizing and, uh, et cetera crapping.

1020
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:12,450
Here's what happens when one worshiper gets his prayer reel just a little out of control and has it wallowing too fast.

1021
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,210
Remember what I told you about that guy a long time ago?

1022
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,790
He's theologically absurd.

1023
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:17,470
And the other.

1024
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,270
Monk snicker.

1025
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:20,110
To see him make a fool of himself.

1026
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,030
Oh, oh, oh, hey.

1027
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,990
Just another show to them.

1028
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,970
I don't get it.

1029
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:23,510
See what.

1030
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,410
Well, you don't get it.

1031
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:24,990
Well, that's it.

1032
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:25,530
You don't get it.

1033
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,170
You just don't get it.

1034
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:26,410
Right.

1035
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,690
So you'll have to leave the church.

1036
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:28,110
I'm sorry.

1037
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,670
Here's the door.

1038
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:30,410
Introduce yourself to another person.

1039
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,710
Yeah.

1040
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,410
You are demonstrating interest.

1041
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:36,510
So basically what we have here are doctors grouped into afferent or efferent fibers.

1042
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:43,130
All the doctors here tonight have spiny, stellar cells and use micro glee form cells for the show.

1043
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,010
And they're all using their separate brains here, as you can see.

1044
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:46,330
Right.

1045
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:47,370
Unable to work.

1046
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:47,970
No connection.

1047
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,730
Each brain operates in unison, though yoked in series.

1048
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:56,150
Together, the brains have the power of 10 reduced to liquidity, or in terms the layman

1049
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,930
can understand, to the negative 10th power.

1050
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,090
It's like this.

1051
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,510
If you see your left side of your brain controls your right side, your right side controls

1052
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,210
your left side.

1053
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,710
So it means that the left-handed people are the only ones in their right minds.

1054
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:08,790
Here we go.

1055
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,150
Adventure in Dobstown.

1056
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,150
Oh, that was exhausting.

1057
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,130
I don't think I've ever done anything like that.

1058
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:16,910
Our optimism.

1059
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,110
What is like a railroad train.

1060
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:22,710
Let it be known that we aren't afraid of ghosts and spooky monsters.

1061
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:27,630
Let it be known that we cannot be pushed around as some would have it.

1062
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,430
We are the vanguard of the forthcoming master society.

1063
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:35,330
We will know what buttons to push and what levers to pull.

1064
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:40,950
It is to future generations to decide the validity and the importance of what we do

1065
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:41,210
here.

1066
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:47,050
No one can understand this without first experiencing in the white hot forge the

1067
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:47,110
power of the brain.

1068
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:47,350
Dr. Kahn.

1069
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1070
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1071
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1072
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1073
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1074
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1075
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1076
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1077
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1078
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,350


1079
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:48,330
I'm glad you came.

1080
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,590
You'd better wake up.

1081
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:53,410
Something scary is about to happen.

1082
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:55,790
Yes, Doctor.

1083
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,730
You'd better get to the answer and be for me.

1084
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:06,750
It is up to you and you and you and you, the forerunners of the subgenius age of tomorrow,

1085
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:11,990
to make sure that we are never threatened by those dark and chaotic forces in our society,

1086
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:17,050
which ever tend to undermine the best powering of our society.

1087
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:17,070
Hello, Doctor.

1088
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:17,250
We'll see you soon.

1089
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:17,330
Thank you.

1090
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:17,330


1091
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:17,330


1092
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:17,330


1093
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:17,330


1094
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:17,330


1095
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:17,330


1096
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:17,330


1097
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:17,330


1098
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:18,810
Is there anything we can do?

1099
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:19,010
I don't know.

1100
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:20,950
Everything is useless.

1101
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,210
Is there anything we can do?

1102
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,470
There's nothing we can do.

1103
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,530
God, force yourself out, you stupid.

1104
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:26,270
There's got to be something we can do.

1105
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,430
Now someone figure out what we're supposed to do.

1106
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:28,890
I don't know.

1107
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:32,610
I guess he's supposed to answer the phone and then we start talking or something.

1108
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,190
I don't know.

1109
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:33,970
It can't be done.

1110
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,990
There's nothing to do.

1111
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,430
There's no help.

1112
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,170
I think we have a problem.

1113
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:38,850
None at all.

1114
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:39,950
I don't even think I know.

1115
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,390
They think we have a problem.

1116
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:42,410
I can't keep up with this.

1117
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,650
God, little do they know.

1118
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,750
Maybe there's no home planet to answer anymore.

1119
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,010
I don't know.

1120
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:46,850
Must be true.

1121
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:47,310
I'll call the doctor.

1122
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:47,850
We have oxygen switch.

1123
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,270
Must eat food.

1124
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:50,770
Must breathe air.

1125
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:52,270
Must finish show.

1126
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,250
Must stop show now.

1127
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,290
Hold on, Sparky, hold on.

1128
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,150

1131
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,790
The Subgenius show is coming in for a landing.

The engines are warming up.

Reading the pamphlet

Over and over again

1182
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:36,130
I was drinking Budweiser

I was drunk

1189
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,910

01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,890
