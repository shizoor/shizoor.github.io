1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,140
It was another normal night and I got done fighting with my wife

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,920
So I went down to the bar and just made all take and roll

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,620
Since I was a little kid they've been the two best friends

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,540
That a man could ever hope for in this world

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,180
Now I'm a normal guy and I work all day for my money

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,840
And I fear the good lord like I know I should

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,540
I ain't no new age coot but I gotta get this off my chest

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,260
And put this tragedy behind me now for good

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,940
I remember getting drunk and I remember falling down

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,580
And someone laid me on a pool table and I'd have been consumed

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,480
Then through the blinding lights two creatures stared into my eyes

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,940
Was that the jukebox or a flying saucer

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,520
Spent right through my eyes

14
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,320
And I'd tell myself this couldn't have been

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,300
No member of the human race

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,620
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,480
Well it hit me like trouble in the back of my head

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,160
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,620
And when I woke up lord I wished that I was dead

20
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,180
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,720
It must have been an abduction lord

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,280
Cause I don't know what happened

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,880
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue

24
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,500
Now I think I'm gonna look crazy

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,360
But I know that it wasn't them

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,020
Say the things that they can't do and never do

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,520
Well when at last I woke up

28
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,280
Both my legs they had been broke

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,120
And both my eyes were black

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,000
And my ears was ringing bad

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,280
I'd seen enough of nasty things

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,760
But this was the worst case

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,640
Of intergalactic relations I've ever had

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,660
And I'd tell myself this couldn't have been

35
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,660
No member of the human race

36
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,020
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space

37
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,740
Cause it hit me like a shovel in the back of my head

38
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,500
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,520
And when I woke up lord I wished that I was dead

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,740
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

41
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,020
It must have been an abduction lord

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,480
Cause I don't know what happened

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,200
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,860
Now I think I'm gonna look crazy

45
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,680
But I know that it wasn't them

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,720
Say the things that they can't do and never do

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,100
And never do

48
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,880
I'm gonna tell y'all a story you ain't gonna believe

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,300
It's about UFOs, big rigs, and barbecue

50
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,520
Well I'm squishing armadillos out on interstate

51
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,700
ten

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,360
Heading out of Houston once again

53
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,740
And I seen some shooting right across the sky

54
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,400
All covered in fur with one big eye

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,180
So I stomp on my brakes when my baby won't whine

56
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,300
I'm having me a close encounter of the diesel kind

57
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,820
Then the spaceman spoke and sounded sorta funny

58
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,160
Kinda like a Yankee bank up all that money

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,140
You know what he told me?

60
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,580
He said

61
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,520
Well UFOs are big rigs

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,720
That come from outer space

63
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,160
Stopping off at the truck stop earth

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,180
Looking for some food to eat

65
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,280
Can't get no weenie weenies

66
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,220
Out the basket great unknown

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,500
UFOs are big rigs

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,580
Birds from home

69
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,100
Now that furry flying salsa boy

70
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,840
Said he was looking for some barbecue

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,860
So I took him down to Dreamland BBQ in Tuscaloosa, Alabama

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,220
You know what we got?

73
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,040
We got

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,280
Bibbs white bread and ice cold beer

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,700
He was eating so hard he didn't even stare

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,780
And that boy was ugly too

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,960
Said the waitress reminded him of someone who was

78
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,860
Far far away

79
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,500
Took another right pill another long day

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,420
Everybody now

81
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,960
UFOs are big rigs

82
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,860
That come from outer space

83
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,240
Stopping off at the truck stop earth

84
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,140
Looking for some food to eat

85
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,260
Can't get no weenie weenies

86
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,260
Out the basket great unknown

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,680
UFOs are big rigs

88
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,460
Birds from home

89
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,100
Come on boys

90
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,340
I think I seen Mr. Spock over there

91
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,700
Hey

92
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,040
And that space alien said something that was music to my truck driving carbuncle butted ears

93
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,120
Let me tell ya

94
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,700
Well out past Mars ain't no speed limit

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,720
Said he owns his race truck

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,200
He ain't gonna rent it

97
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,100
And his back was aching

98
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,240
Could he somewhere get him a massage?

99
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,420
But stood in sapphire space

100
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,960
And loved the rise

101
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,060
Well UFOs are big rigs

102
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,260
That come from outer space

103
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,600
Stopping off at the truck stop earth

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,580
Looking for some food to eat

105
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,680
Can't get no weenie weenies

106
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:20,680


107
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:20,680


108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:20,680


109
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:20,680


110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Getting old, mean and weenies

111
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,680
Not past the griddle, no

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,800
Yeah, UFOs and big rigs far from home

113
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,740
Oh

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,180

115
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,620
Oh yeah

116
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,420
And that boy shot out of here faster than Richard Petty

117
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,080
Yeah

118
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,660
Look out, Antony's got

119
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,320
I bet you can think of Dave Nemo and the Rose

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,240
Hold it off the side of the sun

121
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,440
Hold it off the side of the sun

122
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,900
You may not wanna stay and see how we take care of a turncoat

123
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,260
Christiana's kind of far away

124
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,640
So come along with me

125
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,300
We can dance and trip and be anarchists

126
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,180
We gotta get the manual and put it in the oven till it cooks

127
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,020
We're gonna take the ashes to the wasp zone

128
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,240
Yeah

129
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,020

Yeah

136
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,440
Yeah

137
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,520
Yeah

140
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,760
World of Anarchy Camp

141
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,580
Reckless abandonment

142
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,000
Random acts of dumbness

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,820
We'll be rewarded if you see somebody taking charge

144
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,200
But sure

145
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,660
You'll be rewarded if you see somebody taking charge

146
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,000
expected to beat them.

147
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,580
Everyone who's going will be

148
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,740
participating. No one who is someone

149
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,660
will ever get to know

150
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,080
the joys of anarchism.

151
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,720
Destruction of

152
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,680

153
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,580
So come along with

154
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,280

155
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,660
Salad days and

156
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,940
nights on the anarchic

157
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,440
bus.

158
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,020
Gonna pick up indigents and crusties

159
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,520
and a half a dozen nuts.

160
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,920
And we're

161
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,860
never coming home.

162
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,960
Underwater basket

163
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,340
weaving.

164
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,560
Methamphetamine symposium.

165
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,580
African

166
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,800
killer spelling bees.

167
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,660
Bowling in ice hockey

168
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,140
rinks.

169
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,400
Anarchy camp's never a nerd.

170
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,860
You think we don't know that?

171
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,720
Not much fun till someone gets hurt.

172
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,600
So we're greasing up the rusty bird

173
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,660
ramp. Time to make

174
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,640
some reservations for next

175
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,720
year's Anarchy Camp.

176
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,000
What was that? No FX?

177
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,780
And before that was

178
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,180
Reverend Mojo

179
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,380
Nixon.

180
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,120
And before that, Hank Floyd.

181
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,020
Hank Floyd.

182
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,180
Man, I'd forgotten about them.

183
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,900
I unearthed that just recently

184
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,700
and freaked out.

185
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,940
Hank Floyd? Redneck

186
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,980
UFO rock.

187
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,380
So an unusual

188
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,780
genre.

189
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,960
Redneck UFO USA.

190
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,260
Right here

191
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,780
in our own

192
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,380
backyard.

193
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,980
For actual show purposes

194
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,160
of course, we use the show.

195
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,020
We use our beloved

196
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,900
intro.

197
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,020
Generic music composed by the immortal

198
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,500
Hans Salter.

199
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,980
Hans

200
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,800
Salter.

201
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,140
I'm here performed for you by the

202
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,920
Merseyside

203
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,620
Common Music

204
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,600
by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra.

205
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,480
And when those

206
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,140
started playing this

207
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,820
monster movie music.

208
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,740
This is incredible. What is this?

209
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,800
Is this the new avant-garde music?

210
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,820
I'm trying.

211
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,400
Welcome to the subgenius radio

212
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,340
ministry hour of slack.

213
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,240
Ta-da.

214
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,380
With your favorite horror hosts

215
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,100
Papa Joe Mama

216
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,720
Dr. Joe Gordon Gordon

217
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,860
and the scary

218
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,320
Dr. Howell

219
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,160
No.

220
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,340
Why do you care about me?

221
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,300
The back that flips at close

222
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,260
appeal has left

223
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,180
the brain.

224
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,040
The owl that calls upon the night.

225
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,300
Speaks the unbelievers

226
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,780
right.

227
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,000
One of today's listeners

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,080
will be dead by the end of the broadcast.

229
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,380
Will it be you?

230
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,080
Or will you just be sitting there

231
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,360
melting slowly as our

232
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,260
hatred swamps

233
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,220
across you?

234
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,040
Remember the incredible melting

235
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,860
man? Yes, he.

236
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,060
The repulsive monster movie where the guy just

237
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,920
turned into a blob of

238
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,420
globs.

239
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,720
Well, that could happen.

240
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,680
Especially at temperatures

241
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,420
excessive of the normal range

242
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,360
for the human organism to function.

243
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,840
Like today's teacher.

244
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,620
Such as here.

245
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,840
My sentiment exactly, Dr. Howell.

246
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,860
This is a wonderful place for people to come

247
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,280
and slowly melt down to their

248
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,840
basic protoplasmic

249
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,620
selves.

250
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,580
In the words of Edgar Allan Poe,

251
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,640
a mass of loathsome and detestable

252
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,400
putrescence.

253
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,700
Ah!

254
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,640
Better kept Hollywood secrets.

255
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,380
But they'd clean it up.

256
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,320
Yeah, I think we need to get off the putrescence.

257
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,700
Now we're getting our banner here.

258
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,980
You know, our banner

259
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,820
is known on land and sea.

260
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,860
When people see our banner,

261
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,780
they flock to us

262
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,000
because of what our banner

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,520
promises.

264
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,160
As we hold our banner high, I think you've got it upside down.

265
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,260
Oh, well.

266
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
Isn't the red hand supposed to be

267
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
pointing the other way?

268
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,500
Well, you've heard of the black hand.

269
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,220
Well, no, this is the red hand.

270
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,200
You've got to try the original.

271
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,080
The cozy nostril.

272
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,800
Oh, careful.

273
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,200
The subgenius secret mafia.

274
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,440
The importance of this

275
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,320
bloody hand banner

276
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,200
is so that we can

277
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,800
adjust ourselves

278
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,440
without embarrassing the audience.

279
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,020
Absolutely.

280
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,020
You don't want people looking at your feet

281
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,000
while you're doing a show.

282
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,920
Then they can see if you're fidgeting.

283
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,800
Yeah, there's a lot of things

284
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,840
that the audience doesn't need to see.

285
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,020
It would ruin the show.

286
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,780
I've got my pocket

287
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,900
Loutreman here, by the way, lads.

288
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,020
Very good. You notice that Papa Joe's

289
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,720
hands are never above

290
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,500
the table.

291
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
I've actually got a spare set below.

292
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,720
A manipulative fellow.

293
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,300
Then there's that third arm.

294
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,160
It doesn't have the digits.

295
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Oh, there you go.

296
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,180
It's kind of got the elephant's trunk.

297
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,420
The elephant's knees

298
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,520
then fell on his knees.

299
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,620
What became of the monk?

300
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,360
That's why you should always keep some peanuts in your extra...

301
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,420
pocket there so it'll be distracted.

302
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,200
Or peanut butter, actually.

303
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,060
You can keep that.

304
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,960
You can just smear it in your shorts

305
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,020
and it takes them away.

306
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,660
It activates the wet-dry vac

307
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,340
and just pulls those right out.

308
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,580
Well, how long has it been

309
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,940
since you visited the Big Top, Papa Joe?

310
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,760
I saw the trapezes flying

311
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,500
and the lions coughing and waltzing.

312
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,660
Well, once they started

313
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,360
and they instituted the safety net,

314
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,880
it took a lot of the enjoyment away from me.

315
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,160
But the lions,

316
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,620
they helped.

317
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,760
Because a few of those escaped.

318
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,320
You may have caught that news item where...

319
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,180
Siegfried and Roy were mangled and mauled, you mean?

320
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,600
Yeah, that was the best magic act ever.

321
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,460
Yes, yes.

322
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,180
I would have to agree with you there.

323
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,860
Some payback.

324
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,700
Most convincing.

325
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,260
It was like he really got mauled right there.

326
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,980
It was amazing.

327
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,900
And you know, they never could figure out

328
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,820
how that lock got somehow...

329
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,120
Someone seemed to have filed it loose.

330
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,520
Well, there was a story

331
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,620
that a little dwarf came and filed it loose.

332
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,680
A little dwarf named Sting.

333
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,540
Stumpy, wasn't he?

334
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,760
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

335
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,640
Come on, you guys.

336
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,340
All right.

337
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,720
Okay.

338
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,660
We're sorry.

339
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,680
It's a rumor.

340
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,100
It doesn't deserve the dignity of being offered.

341
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,900
Besides, who would be called Stumpy?

342
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,920
I mean, that's not even a real name.

343
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,760
No one would voluntarily.

344
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,900
That's part of the sickness of the entire thing.

345
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't crush that, Sting.

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,520
Just pass me the Ivan.

347
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,780
Stangor likes Stumpy.

348
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,620
Stangor is...

349
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,820
Stumpy is a little helper of Stangor.

350
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,040
Stangor is manifesting itself.

351
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,820
Original Stumpy.

352
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,320
Stumpy can fit in small places.

353
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,640
Stumpy doesn't mind.

354
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,660
Stumpy doesn't mind.

355
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,620
He doesn't mind if you call him Stumpy.

356
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,400
He knows he's Stumpy.

357
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,720
Now we're in trouble, Dr. Howell.

358
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,360
We're going to have to put both of the personalities back in.

359
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,240
I don't know how to put the kibosh on this.

360
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,780
Here it is.

361
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,640
Stumpy can hide in Stangor's backpack.

362
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,520
Will somebody slap Stang, please?

363
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,300
Stumpy can hide in Stangor's loincloth.

364
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,760
Let him get out of his seat when you're trying to find out

365
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,220
who's got the brain beneath the shell

366
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,260
or constantly moving around.

367
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,880
Obviously, Stumpy does not have the brain beneath the shell.

368
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,020
No.

369
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,280
He's got something beneath it, but it's not the brain.

370
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:45,900
Yes.

371
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,340
He has the testicle.

372
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,580
Well, Dr. Howell.

373
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,320
Now that you're in the land of the burning heart of America,

374
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,500
how do you feel being here in wonderful Ohio?

375
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,400
Well, I used to live in wonderful Illinois,

376
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,260
so it's not as strange and alien as it might seem.

377
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,280
Moreover, I visited wonderful Missouri back in the 60s

378
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,720
where I spent some of my time with actual hillbillies.

379
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,160
They themselves so identified themselves.

380
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,300
I, too, lived in Missouri.

381
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,880
And no finer people ever lived.

382
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,300
I might say.

383
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,660
I still am.

384
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,160
I didn't know they had hills in Missouri.

385
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,700
In the Ozarks, near the Current River.

386
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,500
Do you know it?

387
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,800
The closest town, and there aren't really any towns,

388
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,060
is the tiny hamlet of Grandin, Missouri.

389
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,560
But I'm talking about the woods and the slopes of the mountains

390
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,660
and the people who live there.

391
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,220
Near a place called Bay Nothing.

392
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,860
It's the name of a bay in the Current River.

393
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,340
What do they have there, Howell?

394
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,840
Nothing.

395
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,800
Not much.

396
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,660
But they have...

397
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,380
They have a great zest for life.

398
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,520
And they know old arts that others have forgotten.

399
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,140
What sort of old arts?

400
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:02,020
Well, they know how to prepare a homemade needle for a wound-up Victrola,

401
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,880
which plays old tango and foxtrot records.

402
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,740
All sorts of things like that.

403
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,360
They really do have ringer washing machines on their porches

404
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,200
where they also have their rockets.

405
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,220
I know some hillbillies in Missouri.

406
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,460
They're great people.

407
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,040
The Drummond brothers.

408
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,800
Remember the Drummond brothers?

409
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,420
Oh, yeah.

410
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,680
Sphinx and...

411
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,320
Yeah, and that guitar picker they had.

412
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,060
They was the chicken diddlers and git fiddlers.

413
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,420
Yeah.

414
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,080
They had a band.

415
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,420
Anyway, the other night I was getting a kind of a Bay Nothing whiff from this place.

416
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,040
The Swingin' Love Corpses.

417
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,360
That was their other...

418
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,860
Yeah, that was...

419
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,200
The guys in drag with the long hair, right?

420
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,660
Yeah.

421
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,340
They turned into a bunch of sissies, didn't they?

422
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,840
Yeah, that's what I heard.

423
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,620
One of them just stayed in Austin and...

424
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,540
They wanted to go pro, so they had to do that.

425
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,880
They're just having a little fun.

426
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,020
Well, I heard Philo was...

427
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,540
You know, kind of that way from the beginning.

428
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,840
You mean like Anderson Cooper?

429
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,440
Yeah.

430
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,260
Philo is on his way here.

431
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,740
He went Anderson Cooper on us.

432
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,680
Philo will settle everyone's hash here.

433
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,020
Philo has been on his way here for at least a month now.

434
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,700
Well, he had to take special side trips into picaresque Fred Flintstone's bedrock village

435
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,120
and New Orleans, Louisiana.

436
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:09,920
Is that still on there?

437
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,620
This is the subgenius payback for not being here in a timely manner.

438
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,440
You're the one who's talked about the most.

439
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:15,820
Yes.

440
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,000
Hey, do you know if...

441
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,200
Do you know if Flintstone's bedrock village is still open, Dr. Howell?

442
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,000
That's just it.

443
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,860
It's not open.

444
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:28,060
It's a hideous ruin of Fred Flintstone's hometown with everything punched in and vandalized

445
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,140
and sightless dinosaurs staring out over the desert.

446
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:38,340
Oh, like the Six Flags in New Orleans where it's now just a ghost park with graffiti and...

447
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,040
I'm glad I saw it when it was still open.

448
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,280
I've got some nice fresh postcards of Flintstone Village, which I can turn to when I have a

449
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,440
craving to see the place.

450
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,380
Dr. Howell, you were raised on Flintstone vitamins, weren't you?

451
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,120
I was not.

452
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,680
I never took a single one.

453
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,820
You weren't a Flintstone kid?

454
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,980
Certainly not.

455
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,640
In fact, we never watched the Flintstones while it was on the Truth Detailer.

456
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,180
An absolute travesty of paleontology.

457
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,180
But I have to tell you, there is a rumor going around that you were a Flintstone child

458
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,300
and you did take Flintstone.

459
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,560
Well, everyone should learn how to nap flints.

460
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,420
Our primitive ancestors did this and you'll never know when you need a good flintstone

461
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,420


462
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,420


463
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,420


464
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,420


465
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,420


466
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,020
imization.

467
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:17,700
Forget it.

468
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,700


469
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,700


470
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,700


471
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,700


472
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,700


473
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,700


474

475
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:17,940

482
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,580
Again, it's Betty.

483
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,320
It's Betty.

484
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,480
You like Betty, huh?

485
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,580
The lure of the unknown.

486
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Yeah, let's say hands for Betty.

487
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,420
Potter Nostril and Abnorm Nihil are Betty.

488
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,760
They're Barneys, we could say.

489
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,980
More than you do of Betty.

490
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,660
Those are Barneys.

491
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,140
Betty's hot water is a scrawny skrank.

492
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,140
What's the matter with you?

493
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,760
I like Wilma because she had a more revealing costume.

494
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,120
It was as simple as that.

495
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,680
Really?

496
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,960
She had that shoulder, you know, that strap-less side.

497
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, but she was more into fat guys,

498
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,900
and I thought Betty being interested in little dwarves,

499
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,000
that was kind of hot.

500
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,880
You know, somebody told me that we weren't all going to talk at once,

501
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,640
but apparently that...

502
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,400
That person lied.

503
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,160
Yes, obviously, and it was staying.

504
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,080
You didn't know our ancient, most hallowed traditions,

505
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,720
which is all to yell simultaneously at the top of our voices.

506
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,440
Yes!

507
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,040
You're right, Dr. Howell, you're absolutely right.

508
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,360
I hate that.

509
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,640
Yeah.

510
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,300
All right, well, all right, I'll just wrap up here.

511
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,800
That's good, yes.

512
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,080
Well, I'll just talk about stuff here and not pay any attention to anybody else.

513
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,500
It reminds me very little of the time when I was living in Bolivia.

514
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,640
Well, if you talk at the same time, then people might actually hear what you're saying,

515
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,900
and it's better to talk simultaneously.

516
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,300
If I talk at the same time you are, I don't have to listen to what you're saying,

517
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,860
or staying, or howling.

518
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,600
I can just talk.

519
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,980
We might have to think about what we're about to say,

520
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,580
and that would just be counterintuitive to the entire subgenius process.

521
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,160
Do not engage brain before putting mouth in gear.

522
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,480
That's not true, Dr. Howell.

523
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,680
Put us on the trail of the screaming forehead.

524
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,980
It's spew before you think in our church.

525
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,680
Remember that.

526
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,360
We could lose our skeletons in Kadabra.

527
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,060
It would be horrendous.

528
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,820
The lost skeleton of Chupacabra?

529
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,520
Well, if you're...

530
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,220
Well, I thought Chupacabra was alive and not lost in.

531
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,180
We may have to take a shot of porheadazine in order to remember that correctly.

532
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,480
I'm not that familiar with it.

533
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,340
But Chupacabra isn't dead.

534
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,780
He's in Austin.

535
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,840
I saw him a week ago.

536
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,560
Chupacabra?

537
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,340
In fact, slanted.

538
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,520
Vanderbob will tell you that Chupacabra's not dead,

539
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,780
so how can we have his skeleton?

540
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,200
Dr. Howell, there is no Chupacabra skeleton.

541
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,440
Why must there be only one?

542
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,300
There have to be at least two, the sire and the mayor.

543
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,500
Wasn't he the one that built the Xanadu and made the sacred ode decree?

544
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,080
Something like that.

545
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,720
Yes, yes.

546
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,340
It was done during a...

547
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,800
That was Kublai Cabra.

548
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,400
The golden edge of your tarnished recollection.

549
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,200
I'm afraid the reality is somewhat more gritty and well-urbanized.

550
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,160
Well, the coot part is sort of...

551
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,260
Well, that's universal.

552
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,400
Yes, yes.

553
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,540
Unfortunately, the entire palace disappears the moment the dreamer awakes, so stay asleep.

554
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,800
And what's worse, all the money they paid you also disappears.

555
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,460
Exactly.

556
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,040
It turns into leaves or worse.

557
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,400
I thought that disappeared when you bought the drugs that brought on the dream.

558
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,100
Well, ideally, you get those without paying.

559
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,340
Well, actually, if you're good at getting into trance states, you get the dream without getting drugs.

560
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,600
You just run in circles in the blazing sun until you fall down.

561
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,500
It's good enough for the oom-bushman.

562
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,780
It ought to be good enough for you.

563
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,420
I mean, why do you put drugs...

564
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,060
That itself is the dream and not an actual stressful physical activity.

565
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,820
Well, this is one of the reasons people need to dig deep and bring forth their money to the Church of the Subgenius.

566
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,360
The dream of the Subgenius Cathedral is still a live dream.

567
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:08,280
And, of course, people get all caught up in the architecture and who's going to build it and how much it's going to cost.

568
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,460
Look, the important part is that the atmosphere within the Church of the Subgenius,

569
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,100
it will be filled with church air.

570
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,380
You will experience Bob when you enter that cathedral.

571
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,800
Did anybody bring any church air to this jungle?

572
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,220
Oh, yes.

573
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,860
Oh, really?

574
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,400
Oh.

575
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,800
There was a big balloon flying over the campgrounds.

576
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,720
Well, that was very thoughtful and foresighted of you, Michael.

577
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,060
How come nobody ever tells me about these things?

578
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,480
The problem is that people don't realize that Bob is the center to which all must flow.

579
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,260
If you look at the luck plane, Bob is that incredible little point that pulls the luck plane down.

580
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,120
And you...

581
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,860
When you give to Bob, you create a ripple in the luck plane that draws you towards that nexus that is Bob.

582
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,900
And eventually, you will fall down into the singularity of Dobbs and be blessed.

583
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,900
Well, he takes all your slack.

584
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,020
That's how he gets his slack.

585
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,840
Yes, but you get slack giving it to Bob.

586
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,520
When he's done with you, you're a slackless husk.

587
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,240
Look at me and see what he's done.

588
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,840
That man has so much slack in a Swiss bank account, you would not believe it.

589
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,980
And one of the major trends...

590
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,380
He mentions how the luck train...

591
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,060
...is not to discuss our very private, personal business...

592
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,080
Yes, but calling himself a slackless husk, I mean.

593
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,160
To those uninitiated, they just don't realize that the main attraction to the luck plane isn't that it brings us so much luck,

594
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,640
but that it actually takes luck away from those who are not subgenies.

595
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,320
That's right.

596
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,820
Because that's why you surf the luck plane.

597
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,060
And it also makes you feel more lucky because as you're just having an average day, they're having a terrible day.

598
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,780
And then if they're having a really terrible day,

599
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,940
you're having an exceptionally wonderful day.

600
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,520
That you're beginning to explain the workings of the slack plane, Doctor.

601
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,320
And I'm very glad you brought that up.

602
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:57,420
Well, one thing we might mention is that although we consider it intensely desirable to follow the path of surfing the luck plane at all times,

603
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,480
you know, imitating the world's most slackful man, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

604
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,560
one thing about surfing is that every now and then, inevitably, you wipe out.

605
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,360
So you should expect that once in a while.

606
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:11,760
That's right.

607
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:17,000
And get back up on your board and stop whining and complaining, especially to us.

608
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,420
No, whining and complaining is the slack for some of us.

609
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,440
We really don't care about butt hurt one bit.

610
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,560
In fact, if your butt hurts, we're glad because it means ours doesn't.

611
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,240
It tans the leather of your spirit.

612
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,340
It toughens this sinew of your psyche.

613
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,020
If one of those sharks comes up and takes your arm or your leg while you fall off that surfboard,

614
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,880
well, you're just supposed to get back on and surf the hell out of it.

615
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,760
They'll probably make a Hollywood movie out of it.

616
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,140
It's admirable then.

617
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:43,420
It's sexy.

618
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,900
And then you will be famous and can overdo yourself on false drugs and lose your slack

619
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,960
and become the husk of Ivan's stand.

620
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:58,140
The one who's missing the testicle or whatever other appendage lost when he fell off that surfboard.

621
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,180
It was a luck shark that got him.

622
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,480
Perhaps it was a sacrifice to the great unknown.

623
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,300
Well, it was a sacrifice to Dobbs, wasn't it?

624
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,840
Well, that little seed is going to worm its way through the pink world

625
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,760
and help contaminate the world.

626
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,160
And help contaminate their bloodlines and help present what can be the future.

627
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,800
And if Dobbs has the testicle of Stang,

628
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,960
does he need anything else?

629
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,420
Given time.

630
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,840
Well, that begs the question, what is in the testicle of Stang?

631
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,760
Well, only Bob knows because he's...

632
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,260
The last testicle of a subgenius.

633
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,840
Ivan Stang.

634
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,320
Well, there's the first testicle and then there's the last testicle.

635
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,200
The undescended...

636
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,880
As G. Gordon Gordon put it,

637
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,980
yeah, you've got one...

638
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,940
One nut like Hitler and one like Stalin.

639
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

640
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,620
Well, it's true.

641
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,180
Very funny.

642
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,180
Hitler.

643
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,120
Well, there's only...

644
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,360
They were wonderful subgeniuses.

645
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,160
What's wrong with having one nut like Hitler?

646
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,020
I just feel...

647
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,160
I personally, I just feel sorry for all the one penis.

648
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,180
It's the missing nut that activates the hatred that causes those things to happen.

649
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,240
That's why Stang, you know, got his religion.

650
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,020
It was the hatred.

651
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,300
One and a half penises.

652
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,240
People are all...

653
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,760
Turn on this thing about Christian love and religion.

654
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,860
It's brotherly love.

655
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,840
You know, that does bring people together.

656
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,340
But what really brings people together, let's be brutally honest here, it is hatred.

657
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,060
Hate.

658
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,460
It is a unified hatred.

659
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,420
It's when all your country hates one particular minority or one particular race or one particular country.

660
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,740
That's what brings people together.

661
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,340
What would the Middle East be without the Arabs hating the Jews and the Jews hating the Arabs?

662
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,200
That's what makes it such a vibrant country.

663
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,620
Well, like Lebanon, where the Maronites hate the Jews and the Jews hate the Shia.

664
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:41,760
I hate the Shia.

665
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,160
The Maronites and the Shiites hate the...

666
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,260
And, you know, I'm a Christian over there.

667
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,280
That's a real Christian.

668
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,540
They don't just sit over there and pray when they're attacked.

669
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,720
No, they take out their machetes and they attack back.

670
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,620
I mean, it's a game.

671
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,020
It's like...

672
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,660
We're not for the K-machete.

673
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,680
Yeah, and what kind of marriage are you going to appreciate?

674
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,060
The one where it's sort of like, oh, we never fight.

675
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,460
We just love each other all the time.

676
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,060
Screw that.

677
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,920
No, we want the real marriages.

678
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,300
The Jackie Gleason marriages.

679
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,760
One of these days, Allison, pow, to the moon.

680
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,860
This is the type of religion we want.

681
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,760
Well, it is the type.

682
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,860
It's the type of religion that we want.

683
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,120
We want that pure burning hatred that levels city blocks, that shuts down filling stations.

684
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,420
You know, there's another word for that hatred.

685
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,440
It's called passion.

686
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,300
Passion.

687
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,140
Do you want a passionless religion?

688
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:23,820
No.

689
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,380
Do you want a passionless marriage?

690
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,420
I've got a passionless marriage.

691
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,060
There's no problem with that.

692
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,240
Well, but you are married in the religion of the passion.

693
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,540
You've got to have a church.

694
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,920
You have to marry a subgenius in a subgenius church in order to maintain the passion of hatred that keeps that love alive.

695
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:39,700
Oh.

696
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,580
Well, I made a mistake.

697
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,360
You made a mistake, didn't I?

698
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,240
To be in a passion, some good may do, but no good if a passion is in you.

699
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,520
Wasn't that December 7th you made that mistake?

700
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:50,980
Yes, yeah.

701
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,340
I told you, that was not the island.

702
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,600
It was farther to the east.

703
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,060
It was Ding Dong's day, you know, and we were celebrating the Battle of Blood River,

704
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,980
and we were a little hungover when we were looking for the island.

705
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,860
It wasn't my fault.

706
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,460
Did that feature the pirates of Blood River?

707
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,320
No, no.

708
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,800
It was the Battle of Blood River between the Boers and the Zulus in 1834.

709
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,540
That one.

710
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,220
Yes.

711
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,760
People don't realize that Gordon Gordon started World War II with his flying tiger brigade bombing the wrong island.

712
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,640
Yes, and puzzling evidence single-handedly lost the Vietnam War.

713
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,600
That's true.

714
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,140
That was terrible.

715
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,020
That's actually true.

716
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,760
Absolutely true.

717
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,340
And in so doing, he won it, but for the wrong side.

718
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:28,840
Yes.

719
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,620
Someone had to.

720
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,800
Anyway.

721
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:37,080
But my wife was in Vietnam, and, you know, they still remember puzzling evidence in Vietnam.

722
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,940
They asked her, do you know of the American with the one brow?

723
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,500
The unibrow.

724
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:42,960
Unibrow.

725
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,020
She said, oh, yes.

726
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,840
Very charming.

727
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,340
I think they have a beard named after the unibrow.

728
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,560
Unibrow beard, yes.

729
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,680
He's a good egg.

730
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,260
He's doing my show while I'm gone.

731
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,760
A good egg?

732
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,620
A good egg?

733
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,680
A good egg.

734
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,760
Oh, I thought you said egg.

735
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,820
They're throwing good eggs at him right now, I'm sure.

736
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,460
Yes.

737
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,020
Poor Dr. Evidence.

738
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,880
What day is it anyway?

739
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,900
He's already done it.

740
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,960
Yes, it's Thursday.

741
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,360
That's California time.

742
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,800
Today is Thursday?

743
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,400
Thursday and Tuesday.

744
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

745
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,260
I'm sorry.

746
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,940
It's Tuesday.

747
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:12,860
That's better.

748
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,240
That feels better.

749
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,080
I was looking at the wrong side of my watch.

750
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,280
But in Taiwan, it is Wednesday or Monday.

751
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,960
What happened to Stang?

752
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,580
Did he die over there in the corner?

753
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:27,500
I was just thinking, I can't wait to hear the recording of this show, so I'll know what was said.

754
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,600
He's enjoying a peaceful rest.

755
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,260
That's because Stang transcribes him for the conspiracy.

756
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,260
I was thinking, I need to, I should have brought my really, really long headphone cord.

757
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,700
Is Dr. Howell going to be autumn?

758
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,080
To plug him?

759
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,320
To there.

760
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,840
Is Dr. Gordon going to be too close to the mic?

761
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,640
Well, he'll mix and roll in the mystic mud in the manner of the ancient sorceress.

762
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,540
During subgenius mind control experiment 2200.

763
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,320
The audience will be waiting while we...

764
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,820
Let me old deaf guy.

765
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,360
2012.

766
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,440
Who's the old deaf guy?

767
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,400
I'm the old deaf guy.

768
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,420
Hey, I'm different too.

769
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,300
What are you talking about?

770
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,460
What?

771
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,440
Shut up.

772
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,560
And fade out.

773
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,460
Gentlemen, please.

774
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:10,980
Please.

775
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,180
Please.

776
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,540
It's okay.

777
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,160
It's...

778
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,640
The man has been playing a video game for so long that he has lost track of reality.

779
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:25,080
And when he gets a little upset, this avatar of his comes popping out with a blazing hammer or something.

780
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,740
It just starts leveling off at people.

781
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,960
On the reality channel.

782
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,620
I admit being old.

783
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,700
I'm proud of being old.

784
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,800
Because when you're old, you don't have to worry about all that shit that you people worry about, like getting old.

785
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,580
Well, I...

786
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,000
You've got a point there.

787
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,400
I don't care.

788
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,100
When you're old, you're still...

789
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,320
When you're young, you've just got a couple of layers on top of that.

790
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,520
Once you're old, you don't worry about getting old.

791
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,560
We don't worry about the nation.

792
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,960
Now, Papa Joe Bob has got many years before he doesn't have to worry, because he's so young.

793
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,420
And we...

794
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,060
Not resilient.

795
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,200
Even rubbery.

796
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,400
And we know that the end times will come in our lifetime, so the older we are, the quicker it'll be here.

797
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,500
That's exactly right.

798
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,180
And that's why I'm hanging in here.

799
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,820
It could be, according to some, that the age you are when the exits come is the age you will be throughout the rest of eternity.

800
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,680
There's no...

801
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,160
That is not fair.

802
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,960
No kidding.

803
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,520
No, I am not signing up for that.

804
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,300
I'm leaving right now.

805
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,180
But there's time control.

806
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,540
I thought that was the whole concept of time control.

807
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,620
I want a young body, Doctor.

808
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:16,980
How?

809
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,900
I want a new liver.

810
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
I want a heart without slinkies in it.

811
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,400
Come on.

812
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,660
Well, maybe they'll fix you up.

813
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,920
I want to go back to the time of conception.

814
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,540
That's how I want to spend my eternity.

815
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Swimming around in that wonderful yeast.

816
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,780
The yeast is red.

817
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,220
There'll be a feast of yeast.

818
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,220
I just want a frump stick that never goes out.

819
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,520
Me and all my pals competing to be the first one to cross the finish line.

820
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,240
I want a frump stick that just burns forever.

821
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,860
Who will win?

822
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,800
Born up by buoyant fungus bubbles.

823
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,640
Forgetting all our woes and troubles.

824
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,640
It's us against the womb.

825
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,960
Woes and troubles?

826
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,280
I didn't know.

827
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,640
One egg.

828
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,580
A million adversaries.

829
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,480
Reverend Susie, the flimsy has an excess cigarette that never goes out.

830
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,700
She can be baptized with it.

831
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,640
It stays lit.

832
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,620
Didn't she set the baptismal pool on fire one year with that damn thing?

833
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,960
That was in Cleveland.

834
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,780
Yeah, that was in Cleveland.

835
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,280
It's not only...

836
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,120
That's in the...

837
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,120
It's flaming the entire Holga River.

838
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,140
Any cigarette that Susie puts to her lips is an X-rated cigarette.

839
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:16,400
Burn on big river.

840
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,640
Burn on.

841
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,660
Burn on big river.

842
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,900
It becomes the sexiest of cigarettes.

843
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,000
Pater Nostril is approaching.

844
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,740
Howl sounds overmodulated.

845
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,880
Howl sounds too loud.

846
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,240
Overmodulated?

847
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,980
Oh, I'm so sorry.

848
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,140
No, no, nothing's going through here right now.

849
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,100
I never meant to overmodulate.

850
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,200
You'll have to edit this part out.

851
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,600
Show us.

852
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,120
That's because his thoughts are overmodulated.

853
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,460
His thought patterns are overmodulated.

854
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,640
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

855
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,320
I can barely hear you.

856
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,720
What he thinks is overmodulated.

857
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,620
Well, if I get too close, it's loud.

858
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,140
No, you just talk louder.

859
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,860
No overmodulation.

860
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,620
Okay, how's that?

861
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,700
Well, everybody knows howl's the screamer.

862
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,040
He's the one with the plate currently.

863
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,500
Oh, okay.

864
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,860
But can they hear me now?

865
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,360
Not when you turn your face away.

866
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,220
Then I can't hear you.

867
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,240
You can't hear if I talk in the corner.

868
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,580
I hide a style of my face in time.

869
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,220
Howl with the voice of Wally Cox.

870
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,140
Can you imagine him screaming at someone?

871
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,020
I really do think that perhaps we should reconsider the situation.

872
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,340
The situation that you have placed us in.

873
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,220
Please, don't shout at me like that.

874
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,100
The wicked through the bridegroom.

875
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,780
What is that man talking about?

876
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,920
Will not seek after God.

877
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,500
What is he talking about?

878
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,140
God is not at all in his thoughts.

879
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,700
If we knew what we were talking about, we wouldn't belong here, would we?

880
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,380
His ways are always grievous.

881
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,140
My judgments are far above out of his sight.

882
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,180
If I could hear what anybody was saying up here, I might be able to participate.

883
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,880
As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

884
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,640
But unfortunately, I can't hear anything.

885
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,180
Not even Dr. Howl.

886
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
I need earphones.

887
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,000
Where are my earphones?

888
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,140
We don't have earphones on this junkyard.

889
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,300
I always got earphones on KPFA.

890
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,700
Why don't I have earphones here?

891
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,280
How did you get them in this land here?

892
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,980
Out at the back of Beyond, of course.

893
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,000
Oh, I forgot.

894
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,040
They don't have earphones.

895
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,400
He's trying to get past that Bluetooth phase.

896
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,980
I thought Gordon had the green tooth in his mouth somewhere where he could hear all this stuff.

897
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,040
Green tooth?

898
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,880
You have the green tooth?

899
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,280
When you smiled, I thought I saw it.

900
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,520
Sally, you don't have to pity, though, to go into the ball.

901
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,640
I can't hear what you're saying, Doctor.

902
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,140
Well, then you're green.

903
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
The green tooth isn't plugged in.

904
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,020
Watch out, or I'll air my third nostril and you'll be in real trouble.

905
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,940
There's no need for any of that.

906
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,260
Oh, I get a green tooth.

907
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,160
It's like a Bluetooth that hasn't been brushed in a long time.

908
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,460
Well, something like that.

909
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,680
And it's implanted directly into the mouth, so when you speak and hear, you hear it both simultaneously.

910
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,720
It helps for subgenius preachers to hear what they're saying.

911
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:39,060
Oh, you know, the great thing about being deaf is that you don't have to listen to nearly as much blither, blather, and garbage.

912
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:39,980
Well, the purpose is...

913
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,080
Like, for instance, I haven't heard anything you guys have been saying this whole time.

914
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Imagine my luck.

915
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,600
You're the one who's enjoying this show the most.

916
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,100
That's why.

917
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,220
So far.

918
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,560
But you'll have to go over it later.

919
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,840
I can't hear what he's saying.

920
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,000
That's when the real pain will eat its way into your brain.

921
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,320
No, this is when you're supposed to go,

922
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,480
More monitor! More monitor!

923
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,940
It's over-modulated.

924
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,360
Well, I'm sorry. I over-modulated.

925
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,080
I have to admit it. Everyone says it's true.

926
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,740
That's why he's the modulator of this panel.

927
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,740
Yeah, usually...

928
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,160
Or the overlord. The over-modulator.

929
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,540
When you're on the Puzzling Evidence show, I'm straining to hear you over Philo.

930
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,120
Of course, Philo pretty much obliterates all other noise.

931
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,320
Well, that's because Philo...

932
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,440
Except when Wellman is playing his five soundtrack albums at once.

933
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,300
Well, that's the method.

934
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,060
The tried and true method of our radio broadcast.

935
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,700
See, that's one of the things that Puzzling Evidence did in Vietnam.

936
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,340
He is a decoder, and he would help...

937
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,240
Yeah, but you would error.

938
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,920
...cypher everything.

939
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,840
...earphones on his show.

940
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,280
And he does the same thing now on his show.

941
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,900
He makes it impossible for the enemy to understand what's being said.

942
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,340
...the lack of earphones.

943
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,200
Unfortunately, he's a little too efficient.

944
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,060
Especially being old and deaf.

945
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,500
It works also for sub-G9.

946
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,160
I really don't like the lack of earphones.

947
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,960
Or the lack of beer.

948
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,180
It's bad. Bad.

949
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,600
The beer fear.

950
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,560
I think my beer is here, actually.

951
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,680
I ordered some.

952
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,040
How euphonious.

953
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:08,100
You know, the Russians, they have a special steam bath type process

954
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,760
in which they whip you with sage.

955
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,680
And then they just take a bunch of brushes and pour beer over hot rocks.

956
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,540
And you are bathed in the vapor.

957
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,660
And then you're tossed down in the snow to roll around like a bear.

958
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,420
And then a very grim-faced looking woman with her hair in the bun

959
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:28,440
switches you with hazel twigs while you run shrieking and howling through the snow.

960
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,480
Well, didn't you guys hear?

961
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,200
That's our new tradition at 7 a.m.

962
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,780
We're going to start at 6.30 a.m.

963
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,940
I'm going to have the pond filled with dry ice.

964
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,720
Yeah, there are.

965
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,620
We'll all dive into it after being whipped with sage.

966
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,420
No, no, no, no.

967
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,520
You've got to be whipped after you jump into it.

968
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,360
Stinging nettles.

969
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,300
Before people pay their registration fee, you should come out and tell them.

970
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,940
And I did bring the wasp.

971
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,780
It's barely the same.

972
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,720
Well, not that we'll need it.

973
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,160
But other than that.

974
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,840
The wasps will come anyway.

975
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,600
But I do have wasp attractor.

976
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,080
And it's not really beer.

977
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:05,920
Unfortunately, Dr. Stang, there is no dry ice available on the eastern shore to the United States.

978
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,960
It's more like Cyclone B.

979
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,980
But other than that, it's just like that process.

980
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,060
What is that guy talking about?

981
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,900
Is he stinging?

982
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,300
Is he saying anything?

983
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,200
I can't hear him.

984
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,700
No, no, no.

985
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,380
We're not saying anything.

986
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,780
We're not saying anything.

987
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,220
Well, you said we could all talk at once.

988
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,260
No, I said we can't.

989
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,920
We shouldn't all talk.

990
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,220
He said we should all think at the same time.

991
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,360
Well, you should tell that guy next to you and never stop talking.

992
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,280
I mean, that's just the basic problem.

993
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,060
No, think at the same time.

994
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,940
How can we get a word in when he won't stop?

995
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,300
It's not think.

996
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,720
Do not think at the same time.

997
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,800
But talk at the same time.

998
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,280
Correct.

999
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:29,980
That's what.

1000
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,300
I'm getting a little confused.

1001
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,740
I think we should just go home.

1002
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:37,940
There are several subgenius traditions that I wish to God had never been invented.

1003
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,680
Had Philo never.

1004
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,280
Ever uttered the word anti-music, the world would be a much better place.

1005
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,560
There's no going back.

1006
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,380
And if puzzling evidence had not sat in on that first subgenius panel discussion and

1007
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,420
sterno, we would be comprehensible now.

1008
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:02,460
But instead, everything got off on this insane, let's kill the audience approach.

1009
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,800
And hence, we're not on network TV, but in a little campground.

1010
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,600
Well, I would like to.

1011
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,800
I would like to say something.

1012
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,380
I would like to say something here.

1013
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,280
But look, we're surrounded by subgeniuses instead of pinks.

1014
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,140
So I guess we win.

1015
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,580
Well, hey, I was wanting to say something, if I may, that when you have a group of subgeniuses together,

1016
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,260
nobody waits and takes their turn to talk.

1017
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,280
You all talk at once.

1018
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,380
That's the subgenius.

1019
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,780
You can hear five different conversations at once.

1020
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,960
Now, see, this in a nutshell is the difference between an evangelical and a holocaustal.

1021
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:39,600
Only Ivan Stang would actually think that the subgenius ever could be optimistic enough to be on network TV.

1022
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,520
The reality is, is if they comprehended us, we would all be in concentration camps right now.

1023
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,160
No, no.

1024
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
I don't agree.

1025
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,300
I don't agree on the concentration camps.

1026
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,820
We would be arrested by now.

1027
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,600
We would probably be lined up and shot.

1028
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,140
You would be in jail for the last ten years at least.

1029
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,080
From 1998, just for defrauding the audience.

1030
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,680
I mean, that would be the given.

1031
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,300
Future head of the Bob Stoppo over there.

1032
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,180
Why don't we all trade sentences?

1033
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,040
You know, I say a sentence, then G. Gordon Gordon says a sentence.

1034
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,640
And Stang says a sentence.

1035
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,220
And then Papa Joe Mama says a sentence.

1036
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,240
Do we have to listen to each other's sentences?

1037
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,380
The exquisite corpse of radio.

1038
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,700
Oh, okay.

1039
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,900
But you just started, right?

1040
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,080
That was my sentence.

1041
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,720
My sentence is that I can't hear what anybody's saying.

1042
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,240
Oh.

1043
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,300
My sentence is that I'm stuck here on this panel.

1044
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,660
You beat me to it.

1045
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,740
But I've been sentenced to do hours of slack every week for eternity.

1046
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,740
The true sentence.

1047
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,940
This is the audience there.

1048
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,780
They had to listen to it.

1049
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:41,960
But you don't.

1050
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,340
You retired, remember?

1051
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,300
Legume has to produce the hours of slack now.

1052
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,580
You don't have to do this anymore.

1053
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,480
I don't even know why we're up here doing this.

1054
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,360
You know, there was a point.

1055
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,020
Each person's sentence does not need to begin with my sentence is.

1056
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,100
We're going to aim for a sort of naturalistic give and take.

1057
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,300
Manly sparring, pushing and shoving, you know.

1058
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,720
How about the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog?

1059
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,840
That's my sentence.

1060
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,860
Very vivid.

1061
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,160
Well, I'm just always going to remember that golden age of the subgenius reign.

1062
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,740
That brief two days in which Reverend Katar Legume was in charge of the church.

1063
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,280
Say what you will, but for that brief, shiny moment in subgenius history,

1064
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
the trains did run on time.

1065
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,040
Yeah, but they went backwards.

1066
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,560
They went straight to the showers.

1067
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,600
Every one of them.

1068
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,500
Well, you know, there was a point there.

1069
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,060
I went, hey.

1070
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:37,720
You know.

1071
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,940
You know, both of these guys have said a lot more than a sentence.

1072
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,000
Did you notice that?

1073
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:42,800
I mean, they're like.

1074
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,060
It's really impossible to regulate, but it was an idea.

1075
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:50,120
It was a nice try, Dr. Howell, but I just don't think it's going to work because they don't make sentences.

1076
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,260
They just declaim.

1077
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,140
They just spout.

1078
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,780
Well, we are here to spout.

1079
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,500
Yes, but.

1080
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,540
Spout subgenius doctrine.

1081
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,680
For surely every inane comment we happen to make, perhaps though driven by a bubble of gas in the inside,

1082
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,480
is.

1083
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,860
Destined to become subgenius doctrine.

1084
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,760
That's anti-iracibility doctrine.

1085
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,260
Anything subgenius says is automatically doctrine.

1086
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,160
Extending brass.

1087
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,300
I'm high E-pop.

1088
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,960
Who let the chipmunk in?

1089
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,800
Is there a chipmunk?

1090
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,420
Forget that that's a two-edged sword.

1091
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:29,340
That means everything every other subgenius says subsequently is also subgenius doctrine.

1092
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,880
Well, that's why we're enjoying total gridlock in the church right now.

1093
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,680
Well, thousands of years from now, and this has to be turned into some sort of profit-making,

1094
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,140
machine.

1095
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:47,220
They'll put together a little committee of Jesuits who will go through each of these little pieces of information and edit it down and come up with the official version.

1096
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,580
No, no, I'm tired of this idea of marching into the future.

1097
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:54,480
This church worked best when it was limping along like a dinosaur with hemorrhoids.

1098
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,560
So you want to be here now, eh, doctor?

1099
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,620
It's gotten worse, if anything.

1100
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,560
That's what I'm wondering.

1101
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,680
The hemorrhoids are bigger, the limping is worse.

1102
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,300
But it was the great era of the golden subgenius when the church was lerping along on a wing and a prayer.

1103
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,160
And that was it.

1104
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,620
That's what the audience is for.

1105
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:15,480
The audience is to grab hold of that hemorrhoid and pull it out and expand on it.

1106
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,360
No, no, we want to go back to the old ways.

1107
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,020
We don't want to shove that hemorrhoid back in.

1108
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,820
The old hatred ways we want to go back to.

1109
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,100
This church of the subgenius, PC, light and sweetness.

1110
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,740
God, we'll be having bake sales the next thing you know.

1111
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,600
That's not a bad idea.

1112
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:29,860
Oh, I want a cookie.

1113
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,340
That's an idea.

1114
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:30,780
Bake sale.

1115
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,860
I want a cookie for dogs.

1116
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,080
Bake sale.

1117
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,880
Give me one of those.

1118
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,280
Oh, no, I'll have the cake.

1119
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,580
I'll have the Lady Connie finger cake.

1120
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:37,520
I see it.

1121
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
This church is going down the tubes.

1122
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,560
Can I have a Yut-Sauce brownie?

1123
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,260
Wink, wink.

1124
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,600
I just like...

1125
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,340
Have a half baked idea sale.

1126
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,040
Half baked idea sale.

1127
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,060
We've got that.

1128
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,560
I mean, we've been trying to sell that for what, 30 years?

1129
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,660
We've been giving that away for the last hour.

1130
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,580
Yeah, that's the super sale.

1131
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,980
What, the half baked idea?

1132
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:53,440
Yeah.

1133
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:53,720
Yeah.

1134
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,720
Maybe that's our next venture into publishing, the subgenius recipe book.

1135
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,320
An outgrowth of this annoying Bob's Food Porn website, perhaps.

1136
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,300
Yes.

1137
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,440
I think that would be very good.

1138
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,180
Connie's cake recipes.

1139
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,900
And reveal the horrifying truth about what and how subgeniuses eat.

1140
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:21,900
Princess, we have been working on a bizarre recipe book called The Gastronomical Astronaut.

1141
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:22,740
Well...

1142
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,160
She's a very inventive cook, and every now and then she comes up with something that

1143
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,480
needs a name, because it had no name.

1144
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,360
But it's good, and it's worth writing down.

1145
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:33,780
Subgenius culinary idea.

1146
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,740
I've actually come up with something Middle Eastern sounding like, gajwoosh bad me.

1147
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,220
Oh, I always went for something brown so far.

1148
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:40,380
Gastronomic Magellan.

1149
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,460
A vascular dogama.

1150
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,340
What was that name again?

1151
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,580
Has no name?

1152
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,740
I want to write that down.

1153
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,400
Has no name?

1154
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,080
That's the name?

1155
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,120
Has no name.

1156
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,560
Has no.

1157
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,260
Has no name.

1158
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,000
Has no.

1159
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,640
Has no.

1160
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,420
Has no.

1161
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:51,440
Has no.

1162
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:51,440


1163
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:51,620
Has no.

1164
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:51,680
Has no.

1165
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,760
Has no.

1166
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:51,880
Has no.

1167
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:51,880


1168
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:51,920
Has no.

1169
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,920
Has no.

1170
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,060
Have no name.

1171
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,060


1172
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,060


1173
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,060


1174
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,720
What do you mean, tune people to vote for him?

1175
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,000
Yes.

1176
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,660
Like, Lars and Pierce...

1177
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,700
They'll have a billboard in the back.

1178
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,920
The electronic billboard that shows...

1179
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,260
Yeah, that across there, their eyes are...

1180
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,080
What, Scandinavian?

1181
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,780
I had no idea that that was...

1182
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:06,780


1183
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:06,780


1184
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:06,920
What, Scandinavian?

1185
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,620
I never noticed that.

1186
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,400
Reverend Stang used to offer to sell the Church in its entirety...

1187
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,660
I thought it was just the way it was so cold that their brows ringled...

1188
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,800
...to somebody for a certain price and the price would go up as the Church became better

1189
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,800
known.

1190
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,100
Yes, what people don't realize is now that ever growing number...

1191
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,380
...it's actually a negative number.

1192
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,280
That's what we will pay for someone to take the church off our hands.

1193
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,900
The question is who will be wise enough to step up and assume the responsibility.

1194
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,180
Lagoon did it for two whole days before he realized.

1195
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,600
Before he cracked like a rotten orange.

1196
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,600
You know, if this was all being recorded on 4-track, I could make two shows out of it.

1197
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,300
A man folded like a cheap, cheap chair.

1198
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,580
That would be one show, and this would be another show.

1199
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:48,720
And I think Lagoon basically chickened out is what I think.

1200
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,480
Then you have two tracks that would probably be the more popular track.

1201
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,580
He just didn't have the nut to keep the church going.

1202
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,920
But how easy it is to indulge in the luxury of hindsight.

1203
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:56,860
Yes.

1204
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,160
When you're not actually there in the heat of battle.

1205
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,940
That's true. That's true.

1206
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,500
And the heat of battle on the Internet was most furious when the word came out.

1207
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,520
We call that heinysight.

1208
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,340
It was a flame war that left many pixels singed.

1209
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,880
Well, flames come out of many heinys in the church of subgenius, usually with a lighter held up to it.

1210
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,520
Yeah, well, at least you don't shoot.

1211
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,020
You know, when was the last time we had a pyroflagellation contest?

1212
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:22,920
Like some people.

1213
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,080
Oh, that's right. That guy got his face burned off.

1214
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,240
How come we don't have the blood wrestling in him?

1215
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,340
Oh, that's right. That guy got his collarbone burned.

1216
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,000
Well, we can't have pyroflagellation.

1217
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,500
Well, we can't have leg toast.

1218
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,820
I mean, there's a burn ban in lots of parts of the United States because of the drought, you know.

1219
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,340
So you can't really have pyroflagellation on a large scale.

1220
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,780
And don't forget the alcohol drinking contest that went down the drains when Kitty Dukakis won first place.

1221
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,980
What, the alcohol drinking contest?

1222
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:48,480
Yeah.

1223
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,180
I don't think we started that yet.

1224
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,140
I don't think it was.

1225
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,620
Maybe not.

1226
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,520
I don't think so.

1227
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,160
Wrong alcohol.

1228
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,480
Maybe tonight.

1229
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,020
The losers of the alcohol drinking contest are all here.

1230
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:03,240
The winners of the alcohol drinking contest are all laying in the woods somewhere.

1231
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:03,900
Or dead.

1232
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,260
It's like the biggest losers of alcohol drinking.

1233
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,540
The winners are dead.

1234
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,820
The best way to win is to die of alcohol poisoning.

1235
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,640
That gets harder to do as you get older.

1236
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,020
I know.

1237
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,480
The liver gets acclimatized to that.

1238
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,940
John Barleycorn.

1239
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,100
Must die.

1240
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:22,940
He must.

1241
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,000
Because he is the evil that drags us down.

1242
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,560
Well, alcohol does work as a preservative.

1243
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,600
And frop is the church sacrament.

1244
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,780
And we should not be drinking alcohol.

1245
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,780
It destroys brain cells.

1246
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,780
It hurts your liver.

1247
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,340
Nobody ever got hurt smoking frop.

1248
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,480
But then again, take a little wine with ice.

1249
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,760
Is this a normal conference?

1250
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,940
No, I'm just simply talking about...

1251
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,380
Is this some Al-Anon?

1252
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,220
No, you people.

1253
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,100
You people.

1254
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,740
You don't understand.

1255
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,580
Frop is what it's all about.

1256
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,160
They say, oh, no, it's not.

1257
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:57,920
But it is.

1258
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:58,480
It is.

1259
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,140
Without frop, there is no church sacrament.

1260
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,960
Without church sacrament, there is no holy transition to the realm of magic and imagination.

1261
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,740
If it's real frop, you only need one hit.

1262
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,900
And you're cooked forever.

1263
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,240
Forever, yes, that's right.

1264
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,380
Where can I get some?

1265
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,960
You're going to have to keep huffing it.

1266
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,700
Yes, but nobody has real frop.

1267
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,000
All we got is false frop.

1268
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:25,480
Well, since the Chinese subjugation of Tibet, it's been harder to get.

1269
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,180
But that's not...

1270
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,580
Say it's impossible to get.

1271
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,340
No, it's not impossible, but...

1272
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,800
Well, when the saucers get here, we can go free the Tibetans.

1273
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,460
We'll be able to wallow in trough of all the Yeti crap.

1274
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,620
We had two agents following the Dalai Lama around.

1275
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,140
The kind that only grows on the droppings of certain Tibetan holy men.

1276
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:46,120
Well, yes, but we had two guys following the Dalai Lama around, collecting his poop as he...

1277
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,700
It's the crap of Yetis and the gray...

1278
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,160
The graves of Tibetan holy men.

1279
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,400
So what we have to remember, one of us has to remember...

1280
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,440
I knew we got it wrong.

1281
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:02,040
Before we leave Earth, or we're really going to be sorry, is to rob all the graves of the holy men of Tibet...

1282
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,940
My grave robbing days are behind me.

1283
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,140
...and all the Yeti latrines, or whatever they use.

1284
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,460
Middens. I think the Yetis use middens.

1285
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:14,940
I resolve not to dip my hands in unconcentrated Earth to retrieve human remains ever again.

1286
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,120
What about Yeti remains?

1287
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:16,940
Again?

1288
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,600
Well, I don't know about Yetis.

1289
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,920
No one knows where the Yetis burial ground may be.

1290
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:32,620
No, no, no. Look, if you do it backwards, if you grow your frop on the crap of Tibetan holy men and the graves of Yetis, it becomes anti-frop.

1291
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,360
Terrible.

1292
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,260
Which makes you never, ever able to get high or even experience fun.

1293
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,600
Why would anyone want to do that?

1294
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,720
It doesn't even let you think.

1295
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,000
Because they get confused.

1296
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,080
Imagine...

1297
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,580
Well, I don't want to name names.

1298
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,840
Imagine any of the other person.

1299
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,520
Yeah, okay.

1300
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,920
Trying to grow their own frop.

1301
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:56,120
Of course, the first thing they do is dig up a Yeti and then find some holy man's latrine and do it all back-asswards.

1302
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,600
Where they put the crap in the holy man's latrine.

1303
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,780
That's interesting.

1304
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,880
They'd be pulling the frop out of their exit wound instead of packing it into their exit wound.

1305
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,600
Some of these people get mixed up.

1306
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,780
You know, they read the book of the subgenius too many times.

1307
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,400
And they start getting reversed.

1308
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,060
They can't tell Yakatizma from Yakatizma.

1309
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,600
How can you read the book of the subgenius too many times?

1310
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:18,680
Well, that's...

1311
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:18,680


1312
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,100
Well, that's why you have the book of the subgenius.

1313
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,300
How can you do that?

1314
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:20,960
You can't do that.

1315
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,280
That's why you have the hour slack.

1316
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,720
The hour slack is to make you say, I've got to read this somewhere because I can't follow it.

1317
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,500
It's too confusing.

1318
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,460
And they'll say, me, it's nine o'clock.

1319
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,740
I think you're supposed to read it until you have it memorized.

1320
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,440
And once you've got it down and memorized, you don't have to read it anymore.

1321
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,560
We were so close.

1322
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:33,940
Yes.

1323
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,320
All you have to do is mention his name and the recordings all die.

1324
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:47,760
This year, an incredible event occurred when the actual flesh and blood daubs, the inspiration for the famous glyph,

1325
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,480
was...

1326
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,280
Was uncovered.

1327
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,980
I didn't know it was covered.

1328
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:59,040
It was covered by the veil of obscurity and mystery, which has concealed it heretofore.

1329
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,240
But to our uneasy view, it was presented.

1330
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:10,400
And sure enough, it's exactly like the picture of dots that was made from it.

1331
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,640
Oh, you're talking about that photograph that...

1332
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,080
That photograph of Bob that showed up.

1333
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:15,860
The pre-Dobbs head.

1334
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,780
But that blew my mind.

1335
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,380
When the...

1336
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:18,500
When the...

1337
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:18,660
When the...

1338
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,120
Mine too.

1339
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,780
When the X's come, will the veil be rent?

1340
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,800
That really took away from the mystique.

1341
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,080
Have you seen it?

1342
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,520
No, I'm avoiding it.

1343
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,460
I do not want to see it.

1344
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,200
But you don't want to go in there before that happens.

1345
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:28,640
You can't...

1346
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,700
You can't unsee it.

1347
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,000
If you remember what happened to Ptolemy...

1348
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,780
Is that the head of Medusa, as far as I'm concerned.

1349
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,140
Yes.

1350
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:35,700
Sad, sad case.

1351
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,500
After he invaded the Holy of Holies, his career went...

1352
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,680
Straight down.

1353
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,320
Yes.

1354
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,400
Up to then, he was the most brilliant general Rome ever produced.

1355
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,360
And then he came to the Holy of Holies and said,

1356
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,060
What do you Jews have in there?

1357
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,060
Oh, well, we can't go in there.

1358
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,680
It's too holy.

1359
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,460
Well, nothing's stopping a Roman from going in.

1360
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,900
So we went in, and he looked around, and he said,

1361
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,360
Meh.

1362
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,820
And he came out.

1363
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,500
And then, the last thing, his head was being cut off in Egypt.

1364
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,600
Dr. Howell, I don't believe he said, Meh.

1365
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,200
Well, he wasn't impressed, is the story.

1366
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,820
I mean, I think you have to be one of the people whose temple it was to say, Meh.

1367
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,280
Or, Meh.

1368
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,260
It's somewhat reminiscent of that wannabe mayor of San Francisco,

1369
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,580
who had the bright idea of coming clean with the audience.

1370
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,740
Can you enlighten us on that one, Dr. Howell?

1371
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,040
Who came clean with the audience?

1372
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,960
He wanted to become mayor of San Francisco,

1373
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,820
and so the radio DJs suggested he shower naked with them,

1374
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,620
and they could do a live telecast.

1375
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:35,940
Oh, yes.

1376
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,740
That actually happened.

1377
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,840
That was our idiot mayor, former police captain, Frank Jordan,

1378
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:47,440
who famously took a disgusting nude shower with shock jock,

1379
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,240
disgust.

1380
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,500
I'm not a jockey.

1381
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,280
Just a thing to do to win a mayoral election.

1382
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,360
The hearts and minds.

1383
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,460
And the photos that came out were unsparing.

1384
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,420
Only in California.

1385
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,440
Especially the ones put out by the opposition might have been photoshopped a little bit.

1386
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,800
And, of course, the wife is the one who said,

1387
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,960
Oh, yes, you should do it.

1388
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,140
It'll win over the hearts and minds.

1389
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:07,180


1390
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:07,940
It'll be fun.

1391
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,700
Well, the excuse about he just bent over for the soap is never really.

1392
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,180
You should have realized that he had a body that only a wife could love.

1393
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:15,860
I mean, pardon me.

1394
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,860
If Dennis Kucinich had tried that,

1395
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,480
that he might be president by now.

1396
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,760
Instead of married to that incredible babe.

1397
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,260
That coach who's now serving live, he tried it,

1398
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:25,980
and that didn't work out too well for him.

1399
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,880
For a moment, I thought you were talking about Chicken John's run for the mayoral office of San Francisco.

1400
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,700
But Chicken didn't make any mistake like that.

1401
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,280
Although he did go on Fox News and try to present his platform

1402
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,420
and was interrupted with boings and recorded sound effects.

1403
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,640
Oh, I thought those were coming out of his third nostril.

1404
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,840
Well, maybe that was what the viewers were saying.

1405
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,320
Maybe the viewer was intended to think by the so-and-so at Fox News.

1406
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,580
Well, who did the boings?

1407
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,600
The Fox News people?

1408
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,400
I can't believe that Fox, the arbiter of fair and balanced news,

1409
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,180
would interrupt someone's serious political discussion with compromising sound effects.

1410
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,720
Well, you don't know Chicken John.

1411
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,760
Or maybe you do.

1412
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,280
Well, yes, but I don't think a professional news network like Fox would do something like that.

1413
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,720
He was trying to explain how you could power your car on coffee grounds and everything.

1414
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,300
And he powers his car on coffee grounds.

1415
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,260
Chicken John does?

1416
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:17,620
Yes.

1417
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,580
I didn't know that.

1418
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,140
Yes.

1419
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,920
I thought it was old sawdust and something else.

1420
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:22,920
Garbage.

1421
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:28,000
But coffee grounds, he has a plenty because his girlfriend owns a string of coffee houses.

1422
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,880
So he has quite a few coffee grounds.

1423
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:35,120
Nonetheless, his vehicle is very pleasant smelling to ride behind.

1424
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,880
Unless, of course, you're decaf.

1425
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:43,840
Well, they recently discovered that diesel exhaust does cause cancer.

1426
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,480
So every time you see a huge truck belching,

1427
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,940
a black cloud, you can resent it even more now.

1428
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,840
Now, great.

1429
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,420
Now they're going to add that to the list of complaints about the Holocaust.

1430
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,960
But diesel, the smell of diesel is third world perfume.

1431
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,260
Don't you understand that, Dr. Howell?

1432
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:05,000
Down in South America, when you smell diesel, you know civilization is nearby.

1433
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:09,620
I thought it was those guys driving the dynamite trucks that put out the oil fire.

1434
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,340
Well, no, not really.

1435
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,300
It's what moves everything down there is diesel.

1436
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:15,840
You know?

1437
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,460
People's bicycles are not going to be able to get out of the oil.

1438
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:17,460


1439
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:17,460


1440
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:17,460


1441
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,480
They're even diesel powered.

1442
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,320
They're very big.

1443
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:19,900
It's manana power.

1444
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,240
Except in Brazil, of course, where everything's powered by alcohol, cane alcohol.

1445
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,300
And now we have to have a new paradigm.

1446
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:27,800
Cane alcohol?

1447
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,520
I have to have some new motion power.

1448
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,560
I thought that was the old paradigm.

1449
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,200
Now, how many subgeniuses have run for office?

1450
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,440
Not many have been that crazy.

1451
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,340
Well, there is Governor Ratnar.

1452
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,220
Ratnar is always running for Congress in Kentucky.

1453
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,040
Did anybody see that somebody created a pedal powered helicopter?

1454
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,480
And won the prize that was being offered for creating a pedal powered helicopter?

1455
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,800
No.

1456
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,460
Where?

1457
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:53,900
When?

1458
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,180
What?

1459
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:54,760
Recently.

1460
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,880
I saw the design on a 1966.

1461
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,720
Pedal powered helicopter.

1462
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,540
Don Ross.

1463
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,140
Human powered.

1464
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,660
They were offered a prize.

1465
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:06,640
Just as years ago, they offered a prize for the human pedal powered flight, which they

1466
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,220
did create and win.

1467
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:08,800
Right.

1468
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:13,800
That was a sticker in the Odd Rods sticker series of 1970, Don Ross.

1469
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,020
It was called Whirly.

1470
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,860
And it shows the distinction.

1471
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,020
Yeah.

1472
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,560
It's a great creature with the pedal powered helicopter.

1473
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,400
You don't remember that, Dr. Howell?

1474
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:22,840
No, I don't.

1475
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,460
I think it was.

1476
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,560
Actually, I think it was sticker number 66, if I remember correctly.

1477
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,140
I think the man is shooting us a line of the old bovine stuff, Dr. Howell.

1478
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:36,340
On X Day, we should be seeing heliopters, which are living beings.

1479
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,120
They're one of the only animals that has a wheel.

1480
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:47,020
But the heliopter actually is an animal that has chopper balls.

1481
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:53,700
And the blades that grow on it, it's technically a separate creature.

1482
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:58,580
The blades themselves have their own DNA on the heliopter.

1483
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,860
Weren't those blades originally designed to ward off parasites?

1484
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:06,940
They could rotate at high rates of speed and chew up the parasites, but they now have the

1485
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,520
kind of coincidental effect of also chopping up pinks as it mows into the audience.

1486
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,280
Those were the parasites that were involved to originally get rid of them.

1487
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:15,560
Ironic.

1488
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,540
Yes, but heliopters have a lot of teeth on the front, too.

1489
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:18,840
Yeah.

1490
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,180
Yeah.

1491
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:24,540
I mean, they're quite vicious, unless you've got the heliopter repulsion powder.

1492
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:30,800
Whenever I hear these stories about some old person that just drives their car into a crowd

1493
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,360
of people, I always wonder, really, was that an accident?

1494
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,780
Or what was that person thinking?

1495
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,960
They just lost it for a minute, Papa Joe.

1496
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,580
They were thinking, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

1497
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,040
I think they were thinking, I'm going to get those pinks.

1498
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,880
I'm going to get them.

1499
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,700
But they always say the same thing when they're apprehended, which, well, I thought the accelerator

1500
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,380
was the brake.

1501
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,240
It was where the brake pedal was.

1502
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:56,600
All of a sudden, you make that mistake after a lifetime of driving?

1503
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,600
I thought my AK-47 was a truck.

1504
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,220
Well, what was exactly a lifetime of driving?

1505
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:07,900
I've been driving for 73 years, and I've never had an accident like this before.

1506
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,720
Those people just seemed to jump in front of me, officer.

1507
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,060
I just can't imagine how it happened.

1508
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,500
My first step grenade was a pineapple, and I was only trying to share some fruit with

1509
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,660
the little poor children.

1510
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,480
As someone who's old and driving, I resent some of these remarks.

1511
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,040
All right, we're just fun in your show.

1512
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,240
We've already forgotten.

1513
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,180
We're just joshing.

1514
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,340
Yes, I've already forgotten.

1515
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:32,880
I'm sorry.

1516
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,900
Where are we?

1517
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,420
What is this?

1518
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:34,960
Who is this?

1519
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,400
Is this a show?

1520
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,000
No, what am I doing here?

1521
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,200
I'm confused.

1522
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,320
Is this Cleveland or Fort Worth?

1523
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,100
Just remember, for every-.

1524
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:44,900
Are we in Dallas yet?

1525
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,060
Pedestrian killed by old people, there's a hundred of them killed by young people with

1526
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,680
cell phones.

1527
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,060
You mean irradiating their brains with microwave radiation?

1528
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,780
With that they were killing themselves.

1529
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,200
No, I'm referring to the ones they run over on crosswalks and the bikers in the bike lanes.

1530
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:04,460
You can cook your anterior frontal gyrus with a steady-

1531
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:09,120
Well, listen, I don't care what anybody says about old people, but young people with their

1532
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,980
cell phones are the greatest danger on the road and on the sidewalk.

1533
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:20,640
I thought it was illegal to go yak, yak, yakkin' on a cell phone while veering wildly all

1534
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,400
over the highway.

1535
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,900
It's encouraged in Texas.

1536
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,320
It's sort of a way of life.

1537
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,860
Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

1538
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,600
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1539
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:41,580
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped

1540
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,560
envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1541
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:43,960
Yes, sir.

1542
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1543
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1544
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1545
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1546
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1547
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1548
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1549
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1550
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1551
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1552
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1553
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1554
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1555
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1556
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1557
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:43,960


1558
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,560
I'm Bob Dobbs, and you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry.

1559
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:52,520
Bob, post office box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1560
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,100
www.subgenius.com.

1561
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,260
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1562
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:09,580
Friends, we're glad you listened to the show and we're even more glad that some listeners

1563
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:13,460
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1564
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:13,960
We're so grateful that you listened to this show and that you're even more grateful that

1565
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:13,960


1566
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:13,960


1567
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:13,960


1568
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,360
you're now a part of that world.

1569
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:28,540
If you love Bob and want some of the Slack back to rebound, you should go to subgenius.com

1570
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:36,420
or the catalog store pages, and help out financially as best you can.

1571
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:42,800
We know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses

1572
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,960
to make their own situation worse.

1573
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:43,960


1574
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:51,960
worse. But some of you still have jobs. Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only

1575
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:59,680
once a month from enough of you. Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference. All we're saying is

1576
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:08,400
that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay dogs. We also take checks and money

1577
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:23,420
orders to Subgenius Foundation, P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1578
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:28,640
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
