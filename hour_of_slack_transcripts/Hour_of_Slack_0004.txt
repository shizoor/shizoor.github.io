We'll be tuning in again next Sunday at 10 o'clock.
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
No trouble.
Get set, get going.
Amen.
Recording.
Everything's going fine.
No trouble.
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.
Bob?
Bob?
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind
every time you say, see, hear, or think.
What about slack?
That's your key phrase.
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.
Welcome.
Welcome.
I'm Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.
Before the sermon, a message concerning stops,
living avatar of slack, and saint of silence on planet Earth.
Are we controlled by secret forces?
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.




Almighty and everlasting bomb who came down among us to make heaven under earth,
lighten our darkness.
Oh, instrument of God, grant us thy peace.
Almighty bomb who destroyed all rebels and created angels.
Behold his glory.
Behold the truth that abides in us.
Reveal that truth unto that maker.
I reveal my inner self unto my God.
Unto my God.
Unto my God.
Dear friends, we have returned once again to the subgenius hour of slack radio ministry.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang with Pastor Buck Naked, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, Buddy West,
and a number of guest stars here to accept your pledges as our amazing volunteer test drive begins.
Because...
Ahem.
You can tell just what you need around these parts here in Texas,
far out away from those Sodom and Gomorrahs of New York and L.A., the pink coasts.
We need to protect that which is native to our land, friends,
such as K&ON, the non-station that's not like those others,
and it's the only one where you're...
You're gonna get the pure message of slack and the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs at all on the air in Dallas, Texas.
Right, doctors?
Yeah.
Oh, is there anyone else here on the show?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Sing live.
Here.
Which, uh, which microphone are you on, Buck?
This one right here at the true number.
Okay.
Well, since it's all mononucleosis, I can't tell which ear it's going in.
But, friends, that's right.
All right.
The drive begins at midnight tonight, and, uh, we'll start talking about money.
You know, we love to talk about money because this is a church, a subgenius church.
Listen to that lovely harp music there.
Uh, Buck, that's beautiful.
That's Buck on his auto harp, joined by Reverend Glenn Carlson of the Super Electric.
Oh, look out!
Yeah.
That was those...
Those sounds you hear are some of the bills that come into this station.
Okay.
These guys aren't on the air for free.
They don't play ads.
And, uh, they play...
Well, you know, when you turn this station on, you don't know what you're gonna hear,
whether it's gonna be a...
Nope, it's gone.
Folks, hello, doctors?
Is there anyone else here?
Is this station completely empty?
No, you've got the microphone.
All right.
Folks, I'm just gonna have to shake into this endless box of cassettes.
Oh, yeah, everybody.
I've gotta do everything myself around here.
This is ridiculous.
I don't even know how to turn these machines off.
Look at this.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
I'll do it.
Folks, this could be some sort of a conspiracy.
Stop.
That's it.
Thank you, dear friends, for...
contributing your prayers towards the breaking of that cassette recorder.
And you see, it's things like this that...
that prove that, uh, that this station needs money
because people like us come in here and...
we can't get the machines to stop running and we just...
we start hitting...
Red Room Stang, I'd like to break in here for just a second and, uh...
Please.
During the next show, the show after Hour of Slack,
um...
we're, uh...
he's gonna play a tape and it's gonna tell exactly why...
K-N-O-N is under siege.
And, uh, the station has been, uh...
socked with some, uh...
some, uh, unusual problems that we're gonna...
let you know about, uh, from without.
This is the serious message.
Yes, this...
this is the, uh, message of...
I love it.
Right.
This is the actual, uh, pressure that, uh...
some forces within society are putting on K-N-O-N.
I don't know exactly how specific they can let you know what's going on.
The conspiracy, Buck, is never a very specific entity.
Right.
You know...
I'd like to remind our listeners that it's all one conspiracy.
That, uh, Coke and Pepsi are on the same side.
They want to take away your Slack.
They want to take away our station.
That's incredible.
They just want it all.
That's what I've been hearing.
There's apparently something very mysterious in here.
They've got two...
they've got two stations right by here now
and they want to make it three and...
I mean, what the heck?
They want it all.
They want...
it all, friends.
I think they're trying to shut us up more than they're trying to.
Abnormal!
Abnormal.
Abnormal.
Probably better than morons.
That's what they want.
Yes!
Your time shall triumph!
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.
But only if...
you send your checks
and your lovely...
Well, what is the deal with the, uh...
the situation?
With the amazing...
Dig through the Bibles in here and the pamphlets.
Right, you send five dollars to KNON, you get their newsletter.
And, if you mention this show,
you get a free subgenius pamphlet.
Number two.
That's right.
The new one.
And, uh...
For twenty dollars, you get the bumper sticker and the newsletter.
Friends, this is an amazing bumper sticker that will bring you a great deal of trouble
from the conspiracy as soon as they see you.
So you know it's a romantic, sort of amazing thing to do.
The only thing that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.
But only, only if you do.
Buck?
Yeah.
What do they do?
They do...
I mean...
Okay, twenty dollars, bumper sticker mailed to you.
Plus the pamphlet, right?
Subgenius pamphlet number two?
That's right.
All right, Doug, this is brand new, though.
This is not what you've already got.
This is something you haven't seen yet.
Thirty dollars, you get the bumper sticker, the pamphlet, and the t-shirt.
For forty dollars, the bumper sticker and the t-shirt will be mailed.
Or whatever.
Otherwise, I guess it's gonna walk over to your house or something.
Anyway, real important, mention Hour of Slack so we know which show you're listening to.
I don't know if that'll be...
Actually, we don't care.
We'll smell your money.
We're with you.
As long as it smells like it's for Bob.
The material may not be reproduced.
Two zero five.
Over twenty one years.
Because people like you are helping us stay on the radio.
You can't buy a miracle, but you can certainly stand behind a miracle ministry.
I'm like a bunch of...
I'm like a bunch of...








That's what all I care about.
And you know, the only thing that can stop you is the miracle.
Keep your hands on the radio right now.
Right.
Really, now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks, or do you have...
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state is antichrist, but I'm telling you that preparations
are being made, and that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand, and
that if you plan to get saved, you had better do it now.
There will be a miracle within.









a day not in the too far
distant future in which
Antichrist will be revealed
and the mark of the
beast will be introduced
and people will have a number
in their hands and in their
foreheads.
Our demand for energy will be met
from our own production and our own
conservation.
Also in your
literature, I noticed connections
with aliens.
And the
god of wrath who visits
us every once in a while and talks to
we gotta drop this name in here, Bob Dobbs.
The high muckety muck.
Never behold, he cometh with clouds
and every eye shall see him.
Space vessel, identity unknown.
I could show you a flying saucer
and you'd swear it was something that I got
from Eric. You'd show me a real flying
saucer and you'd say I got it from Eric.
I give you a thousand
dollars to your religion if you can produce one
flying saucer. At least, Joe,
that is my opinion of what I think.
And I've seen a lot of
saucer people, and, uh,
but I can't talk about it, you know, because
back in the zoo.
So we just gotta
wait, you know, until 1985
and then, oh yeah, freeze those
cats in the street.
The crew of the UFO is an especially
designed robot humanoid.
Disintegrated, Captain.
Human. Come on.
Woof!
Woof!
Are we not men?
Zob!
Wobbly, wobbly.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
Everyone makes a mistake.
Let it go, Bob.
Whoa, boy.
They say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, baby.
Food is galloping.
Maria, you're...
What?
What's the use of pretending?
I can't stand this anymore.
Doctor, please.
Please, doctor.
Chandler said you went over to Georgia Street to see that doctor.
Yeah, that's right, Ed.
Short visit.
Poor guy.
Pretty bad, huh?
Well, the guy's really a mess.
The beatin' it walked up to the epileptic and said,
Oh, I don't hear the music, but go, baby, go!
I hope you like that, Nod.
I hope you like that.
I try to make the audience a part of the entertainment,
and they go along with it all just great.
That chatter with the doctor is no phony bit, really.
It's just the way it happens.
You like it?
Make me take off my clothes and make me go out normal.
I have to go outside and change before I come here.
Do you love your parents?
Yeah, I love them, but they're...
In culture schools across the land,
mere infants are taught all about contraceptive techniques
and are provided with a plastic phallus in the classroom.
Well, I don't worship, Reefer.
To me, it's just another thing to do.
Hey, Jones, we just got in this African sensimedia hash.
Thought maybe you'd like to smoke some.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Haven't you ever done it yet?
Come on, now get up and break and smoke some, please.
I would gladly smoke some!



Orny?
Ahem.


I'm not done talking to you.
Wait.
The triple keyboard operates an echo chip.
Resonating balls made of foam.
And something that rather resembles a mercury xylophone.
I'm getting tired.
I don't know if I can keep up.
But I believe I actually enjoyed it.
To the last mutant, mutant, mutant.
That's me!
Civilized men were so frightened by talking apes.
Let it get away, doctor.
But how does one control a 400-pound gorilla?
I'm a doctor, not an animal trainer.
I'm a doctor, not an animal trainer.
That thing's got the balls.
Oh, as long as my middle finger.
Oh, no!
You think the unthinkable.
This radiation is beautiful.
Yes, that is beautiful.
Please, please, please, cover your faces.
That's the doomsday bomb.
Do you know what that means?
Do you know what that means?
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Illusions, illusions.
I'm still the admiral who pretended aboriginally he was a respectable stemming.
Great.
He was an outlaw.
Our Slack radio ministry.
Here are the numbers to call.
The old classic number, 823-7490.
Or you can try 823-8801.
823-8883.
If all numbers are busy, well, heck, we won't give that one out yet.
So 823-7490 or 823-8801 or 823-8883.
Light up the phone bags for us.
Our Slack.
We need.
Yes.
We need gifts for the pledge drive.
And we do have volunteers to take your calls.
That's right.
And not all of this money goes to the Church of the Subgenius.
In fact, none of it does.
This is all strictly to keep the station on the air so that you can hear all those other shows that I'm sure some people would rather hear.
Because this is, at times, a dangerous show to listen to if you're trying to understand exactly what's going on.
You have to listen very closely.
That's the tricky part.
You have to listen very closely.
Not for Joe.
Heavens are Quakers, a second said, when Bohemian lips, a third said, when he know, when hold hard a jiffy, when he is agnostic and determined to.
The next one said, when the angel of death kicks the bucket of life.
Still another said, when the wine's at wit's end.
And still another, when lovely woman stoops to conk him.
One of the littliest said, me, me said, when papa, papa at the harbour.
One of the wittiest said, when he yate hee, I blew cooken, and he's mere, he's self so sooken.
Still one said.
When you are old, I'm grey, fall full with sleep.
And still another, when we dead a walkner.
And another, when he's just only after having been semi-sized.
Another, when, yea, he hath no bananas.
And one, when those pigs, they begin now that they will, flies up into the luft.
All were wrong.
So Shem himself, the dictator, took the cake.
The correct solution being.
I'll give it up.
When he is a.
Yours to the rending of the rocks.
Sham.
Shem was a sham.
And a low sham.
And his lowness creeped out first via foodstuffs.
So low was he that he preferred Gibson's tea time salmon, tinned as inexpensive as pleasing,
to the plumpest roe heavy lax, or the friskiest par of smoked trout that ever was gaffed between Leaslip and Island Bridge.
And many was the time, he repeated in his bottle-ism, that no jungle grown pineapple ever smacked like the whoppies he shook out of Ananias's can.
And the
great things that just goes on and on and on and on and on.
That's, um, that's from Finnegan's Wake.
And it's, uh, it's a big book.
Great big thick book.
People read it.
They get lost inside of it.
And we've got special signals attached to the tapes that we play on this show that reach out and lock onto your mind.
Ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha.
It's funny, isn't it?
Ha ha ha ha.
This is, uh, Reverend D.K. Jones, uh, in New Jersey.
Great, great subgenius.
A song called Midnight Rambler.
I don't mean just black knights.
I mean you black-hearted men and women.
I'm Midnight Rambler.
Yes.
All Midnight Rambler's faces are not black.

Yes, brother.
He had him, you know, last night.

Oh, Mr. Bell, why did they have him out?
Well, he was in jail.
Uh-huh.
He was in jail.
Yes.
Yeah, in jail.
Yes.





And now, Mr. Jordan, where's your husband?
Where's your husband?
My husband didn't get home last night.
He told me not to tell you.
Oh, well, he don't have to tell me.

No, I'm just talking to you.
He's got to tell Jack.
And you're out to tell him what to do.
Tell him what to do.
Tell him what to do.

Well, you know, he's got a good answer for himself.
Yeah.
He's got a good answer for himself.

That's right
Don't waste any time
We don't know what radio is

We know we're all screwed up

We'd be a lot better off
If you were here to tell us what to do

You don't want to use those words on the radio
You can call us up and tell us what to do
If you're stupid or anything

Dr. Hal said the bad words
Yeah
All I do is write a letter
And say anything
And some of those other guys helped

What are you talking about?
They should be thrown off the radio
Because they play stuff like this all the time
Hey, I'm clean
I'm innocent
They're trained operators
I demand a fair trial
That's right
They play those old records
They play old records
And then make trial by tape
All over themselves

That was, uh
That's a
That band
The guy that does that
Puts out a magazine
That is quotes from senile people
He works in an old folks home
And he records their wisdom
And puts out a magazine
And puts out a magazine
of it. He also has this band called
the Duplex Players, which
we just played. Picnic
Ape. He records these guys and then
uses them
as lyrics to these beautiful songs.
You see, they don't let anything go to
waste in America today.
Ah, yes.
Folks, call in with that pledge.
823-7490.
You've got to do it.
You've got to do it.
Otherwise, you'll never
hear this.
Ah, yes.
That's very interesting.
That's not interesting at all.
Ah, yes.
That's very, very interesting.
That's not interesting at all.
Ah, yes.
No, no, no.
Ah, yes.
That's very interesting.
Ah, yes.
Very, very interesting.
That's very, very interesting.
Very, very interesting.
Very, very interesting.
Very, very interesting.
I think we're very close to isolating the molecules.
I think we're very close to isolating the molecules.
I think we're very close to isolating the molecules.
That's very, very interesting.
Still there are mice.
Still there are mice.
Still there are mice.
Look what's coming out of that hole in the ground.
A little bullfrog.
That's very, very interesting.
Do anything musical.
Okay, let's run that testing.
Very interesting, folks.
Very interesting.
Okay, friends, now the board's just not lighting up.
Now we need to give these numbers out again, and let's have those pledges.
823-7490, friends.
823-8801 and 823-888.
823-888.
Remember, you're not just pledging it for Bob.
You're pledging it for the station that keeps Bob on the air.
So let's have that board light up.
Let's have them pledges.
Those $1 pledges.
Those $50 pledges.
Those $100 pledges.
Those $10,000 pledges.
Folks, we only need a few of them.
We only need 10 pounds of $100 bills to keep this station going, friends.
We only need six $10,000 pledges.
But I'll tell you what.
It is getting very serious, and it involves legal situations.
And we're not just asking you to give money for Bob.
In fact, this is one of the few times when we're asking you to give Bob's money to somebody else.
That's right, friends.
And that's usually against our religion.
That's how serious the situation is.
And this, well, you know what happens when this station goes off.

Listen
I
Oh
In the last powerful days of another way of life,
when everything happened in cars,
when sullen, desperate men would do anything for a tank full,
in the troubled years of the Hundred Year Gas War
and the terrible food insurrection,
when armies mixed mustard and gas and relished war,
in those frightened times,
private citizens often had to do the terrifying work of real police,
apprehending criminals and solving tricky moral problems.
They had private eyes, but public fists,
full tanks, but clean consciences,
and tonight's story is only typical.
Car Hook.
Starring Dirk Yost.
Ogre as Dick Private.
Private Dick.
Tonight's chilling story.
Roller Maidens from Outer Space.
Saturday morning.
I'd just locked myself out of the office for a cool weekend
and promised to be gin-soaked and hand-rubbed.
At least, that's what I figured she'd meant when she said,
let's get drunk and refinish my furniture.
Anyway, it was the way she said it, you know.
Real husky, like a lead dog in a snow job.
And I wasn't about to be left out in the cold.
Damn nation.
Ah, well.
I figured it wouldn't hurt just to answer it.
A private Seamus is always hungry.
I hadn't been exactly flush,
and this might just be the ace in the closet
that put some pizza in the pantry.
Go ahead, something said to me.
Answer it, she'll wait.
So I did.
Only to wind up holding the anchovies
in more ways than one.
Dick Private, private detective.
Uh, Mr. Private.
That's right, pal.
My name is Regular Boynton.
My wife, uh, Ethel and I have been opposites.
I've been at you for many years on, uh, another network.
Oh, yeah.
The Ethel and Regular Show, I've heard of you.
What's the matter?
Swallow your car keys?
Uh, no.
Lock yourself out of the house?
No.
Want to know how to make an attractive bookend
out of a shoebox and a brick?
No, uh, nothing that exciting,
but, uh, look, look, look, you've got to get over here.
Well.
Right away.
Uh.
You're just a couple of channels away.
Uh, you can make it.
Nobody ever made it before.
No, come on.
It's really weird over here.
Well, it ain't no Swiss picnic over here, pal.

You don't under, uh, under, uh, understand.
It's, it's terrifying.
Uh, nothing is normal.
Wow.
We all seem to be, uh, uh, dreaming the same dreams.
Wow, that's terrific.
And there's all these strange balls of light in our neighborhood.
Hold it.
Glad to.
Now hold it up to the light.
Oh, okay.
You was right.
This was serious.
This is serious.
This is extremely serious.
I've never seen so much light on these boards lighting up.
God, these amiable sims.
Don't act.
It's not the right kind of light.
We want that green light.
We want that light from that money coming in.
That's what we want.
Uh, yes, we want to, we want to friends.
You don't know the purity of the, of a 10,000 pound stack of dollar bills or the
right savage horror of not having this station on the air.
So let's try again.
The numbers are 8, 2, 3, 7, 4, 9 0 8 2 3 8 8 0 1 and 8 2 3 8 8 8 3.
And folks.
You get the newsletter, the KNON newsletter, the bumper stickers, the free subgenius pamphlet
number two.
That's right.
Now you subgenius members out there that are wondering where's my pamphlet number two.
You'll get yours in the mail anyway, but Oh, ye unsaved out there.
Ye unsaved folks that could be, if you could, but if you could, but pay for this radio station
that you're listening to and enjoying right now.
That's right.
You pay for all the rest of them.
By putting up with the commercials.
That's right.
You put up, you pay for all the rest of them by hearing the same thing over and over and
over again.
Things much worse than pledge drives.
Yes.
Yes.
There are worse things than pledge drives.
Friends.

A little weight on one end of the slack plane, friends.

Bob does love you, he'll love you more
if you'll join that pledge drive right now.
Dr. Stank, would you please give out the numbers?
Yes friends, that's
823-7490.
And get your pencil, because there's another one.
8-2-3-8-8-0-1.
That's right.
If you want to hear any more bizarre, demonic-sounding music from the airwaves
or the inspirational, beautiful, classical songs of Bob White,
you have to call 8-2-3-8-8-0-1.
8-2-3-8-8-8-3, doctor.
Or doctor.
Doctor.
8-2-1-8-5-7-9.
But especially 8-2-3-7-4-9-0.
Call in and deposit that earthly check.
That offering.
That pledge.
All you have to do is promise it right now.
It's a non-pledge.
You can't lose.
You're pledging it to K-N-O-N.
It's a non-pledge.
Ah, yes, friends.
And it's so sad, because our time is already running out.
When we hear that music at the end of these shows.
Doctor, we've got a $40 pledge we have to give credit for.
Oh, yes.
Ah, yes.
As Wendell Scott of Dallas, thank you so much.
And may slack flow through your body.
May slack drip down your spine and out every side of your pants.
Oh, friends.
Oh, friends.
We have to leave you for the next religion, and so.
And so, as we sign off, once again, friends, send that money to K-N-O-N
and to the Church of the Subgenius for the Home for Slackless Children,
because that money keeps those we hate starving to death.
And get your pencils.
Get your pencils ready, because we'll be reading our address for information here
coming up at the end of the broadcast.
Oh, yes, this has been Reverend Ivan Stang with G. Gordon Gordon,
Pastor Buck Naked, Buddy West, and the folks who will be taking over the show next week,
Batman himself.
Ah, yes.
To play the amazing tapes.
Oh, friends.
And that's the Church of the Subgenius P.O. Box 1403.
Oh, yes.
Dallas, Texas 75214.
Yeah, or call 823-7490.
823-8801.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
It's so beautiful to see that phone line light up.
Ah, there it is.
Yes, more $40 pledges.
More paper slack.
Ah, yes.
Paper slack.
Paper slack.



We all need some paper slack.
Paper slack, friends.
Slack in the face of the hideous conspiracy that tries to shut down anything that tries
to talk about the things that they don't want anyone to talk about.
Oh, stop them.
That's what they try to do.
Ah, thank you, dear friends.
Thank you, dear friends.
