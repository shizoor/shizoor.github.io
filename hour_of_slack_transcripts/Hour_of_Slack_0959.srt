00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,460

This episode of this here hour of slack number 959

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,440
Is about magic, enlightenment, spirituality, and spiritual teachers

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,100
And yet, it's still

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,440
The Hour of Slack

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,500
A subgenius show

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,000
A post-spiritualist show, you might say

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,700
But bear with us, as you might learn a bit of useful comparative religion

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,400
Comparative religion bashing, mayhaps

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,420
Everything in this whole show

17
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,640
This particular show was recorded

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,280
Professionally, you'll be glad and able to hear

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,380
By Regis Sedlock at Starwood 24

20
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,440
Last night

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:25,900
Last August

22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,380
Starwood, which is sponsored by

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,640
The greatest brain cult organization

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,760
In all of Yankee land

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,020
The Association for Consciousness Exploration

26
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,600
ACE

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,720
And about 1,200 people

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,980
Come to Brushwood in New York

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,880
The campground where we hold X Days

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,620
Because you can doff your duds

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,800
If desired

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,860
There

33
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,440
And have crazy music and light shows all night long

34
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,580
So, besides all the hipsters and trippies, witchies, and posers

35
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,720
There are wonderful bands of all kinds

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,620
Such as heard in the background here

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
Boiled in lead

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,100
And guest speaker wise guys

39
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,720
And Tude gals of every stripe

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,520
Such as Are You Serious?

41
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,540
And Steven Gaskin last year

42
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,520
And Paul Krasner before that

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,660
All of which is recorded

44
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,740
And some of which is on CDs from ACE

45
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,960
But the best part?

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,820
For you

47
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,020
Will be on this show tonight

48
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,060
Of course

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,760
I really wish that I could play the movies at Starwood

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm working on one in fact

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,120
Because on Saturday night

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,980
The event climaxes with this huge high tech bonfire

53
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,400
Which the crazed and naked pagans and sybarites

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,920
Whoop and dance around throughout the whole night

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,620
Giant puppets stride around

56
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,980
And walk through the crowd

57
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,080
Outlined with neon and e-wire

58
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,860
And there's also like five streets of merchants

59
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,060
Selling new age crap of every description

60
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,240
From tents and trucks in a makeshift market

61
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,620
And theme camps

62
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,220
A la Burning Man

63
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,940
Where you can wander around and get drunk with strangers

64
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,060
Or hear strange sounds

65
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,460
Alive for a long time

66
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,640
In a flash awhile

67
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,960
Or something new

68
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,860
With جج �.'s

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,740
But you know but to we who

70
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,900
Year after year sit and believe in this clip art figure head

71
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,300
Waitin', flyin' saucers every year

72
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,220
Which never come

73
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,680
To us

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:03,700
some of you pagans seem a little kooky. You know, I mean, it's not your beliefs that we find kooky.

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:15,420
It's you. But belief is the issue. And I guess I told Jeff that the subject matter of this rant

76
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:26,340
would be a kook autopsy. So I need a volunteer. Who wants to die? No, it has to be a subgenius

77
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,940
because a subgenius. Oh, it's it. Oh, God, not. Oh, I see you've got a new haircut.

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,320
Well, now you're not a dues paid subgenius, so I can't kill you and cut you open because.

79
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,700
Oh, now he's El Gordo. Well.

80
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,680
Okay, you would do. But actually, I was just kidding. We're not going to kill the kook yet.

81
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,660
We'll do that. We'll do that later. Okay. Right on. Just.

82
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,900
Kook autopsy. Well, the thing is, I'd have to have a subgenius to do it because a subgenius is

83
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,840
it doesn't matter if they die. You get when you join our church, you get eternal salvation,

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,180
or triple your money back so that after you kill a subgenius, you don't have to really where

85
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,340
they're going to be fine. They'll get their 90 bucks back when they go to hell. Of course,

86
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,560
I've heard that there may be some delay in processing that refund because the complaints

87
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:42,620
office in hell is notoriously slow. So actually, to do a kook autopsy, friends, all we need is the

88
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,760
Starwood 24 tour guide.

89
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:55,240
This works every year. But Bob may not have brought most of you here, but Bob brought me here. So praise damn Bob. That's what I say.

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,620
One thing I learned from perusing the schedule and also looking at this crowd was.

91
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:10,340
I made a note note to self don't ever be cross scheduled with nude body painting massage workshop.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,820
I just ran into my friend.

93
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:34,240
Gail who said, oh, it's a scheduling conflict. I can't watch your rank because I'm going to go watch Harvey Wasserman talk about how to, you know, do something practical about this world and all. And I really can't offer we we we promise we are going to save the universe this time.

94
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,400
Look what happened last time.

95
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,420
Now, I'm not putting anybody down when I mock your.

96
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,200
Your your workshop title.

97
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,280
Okay.

98
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,820
As I said, we're not making fun of your beliefs.

99
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,980
We're just making fun of you.

100
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,040
It's purely personal.

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,900
I don't even know.

102
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,360
I don't know anybody's real names, so I don't know who to if these are friends of mine who did that.

103
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,640
But the one I liked here was one of blessed bees and mad mad houses.

104
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,600
So I like that one a blessed bee routine.

105
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,660
It's like got Bob's name is spelled with that in it.

106
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,920
Blessed be blessed.

107
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,620
Oh, blessed.

108
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:14,980
Blessed be.

109
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,520
Isn't that sweet?

110
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,720
Who wrote the Bible was one.

111
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,060
Now, I always thought that was an autobiography.

112
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,400
Now, don't tell me they got the name of the author wrong on that book.

113
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,880
Oh, dear.

114
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,460
Wouldn't that be now?

115
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,480
Here's a as a as a skeptic.

116
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,280
I liked the nuts and bolts of oracular practice, which I guess is about the hardware aspect of it.

117
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,180
And this was a new.

118
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,840
This is a word that I should have made up myself.

119
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,180
Introduction to eco psychology.

120
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,700
My dad would have a lot of fun with eco psychology.

121
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,700
Rush Limbaugh would to with that cure.

122
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,720
Guy Rhea.

123
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,300
No offense, but we could really use a cure for guy Rhea around here.

124
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,780
Spells for democracy.

125
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,960
No, I bet that was George Bush's favorite.

126
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,760
Yeah, Isaac Bonowitz did that one.

127
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,400
I'm sure Bush would love to have more people spend their time doing spells for democracy,

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,060
assuming he doesn't believe in spells.

129
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,980
According to the.

130
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,280
Hey, Nancy Reagan sure did.

131
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,980
Now, she they were running the White House, according to astrological advice.

132
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,440
The incontinence of Ron Reagan expelled.

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,540
At least I wasn't scheduled.

134
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:43,960
Across.

135
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,500
From expanding arousal and orgasm skills.

136
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
Or oh, there's a related one.

137
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,820
How to handle yourself.

138
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,520
Steve Gaskin.

139
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,740
How to handle yourself.

140
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,880
Since when is he doing?

141
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,460
Oh, but maybe that was about raising powers or something.

142
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,420
Raising the rod.

143
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,940
Anybody got any good rod or orb photographs lately?

144
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,260
Or or.

145
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,260
Well, anyway, oh, hypnotic pranks and tricks.

146
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,880
I thought that was when Bob should be teaching friends.

147
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,400
I can save you some time on the hypnotic pranks and tricks.

148
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,840
All you really need for successful hypnotism is a pointy goatee and bushy eyebrows.

149
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,620
That's the real secret.

150
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,260
You know all those books about how to hypnotize chicks and so forth.

151
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,680
Don't believe that stuff.

152
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,940
Just the bushy.

153
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,120
You've got to have the goatee and the bushy eyebrows, though.

154
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,740
I noticed Isaac was also leading one called Sex.

155
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,140
Magic for seniors.

156
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,400
Now for seniors, that's about the only kind, isn't it?

157
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,280
And practice what you preach.

158
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,320
Well, see, subgeniuses can't do that because we're not the kind of people we're preaching

159
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,640
to.

160
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,000
That's a good excuse.

161
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,900
And my friend and know me had a class earlier or yesterday called Stretch Yourself Out of

162
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,180
Pain.

163
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,780
Which I would have attended.

164
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,720
If it had only been for the.

165
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,900
If it had only been Stretch Yourself Out of Debt.

166
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,100
But I think I stretched myself into debt.

167
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,060
Then there was the Puffer Trance in the Space Dome.

168
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,680
I know what that's all about.

169
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,920
And the Ignivomus Pyrography.

170
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,380
That's my favorite title.

171
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:36,460
Ron Slabe's fireworks and music show last night was Ignivomus Pyrography.

172
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,000
You got me, but it sounds great.

173
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,620
Great job.

174
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,800
And right now, as I'm speaking, I'm up against body painting art ritual and play.

175
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,540
So that's where everybody else is.

176
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,680
See?

177
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
No, I'm not going to tell you.

178
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,880
You have to stay here.

179
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:02,540
By hanging around the main stage sound area at Starwood, I was able to procure excellent

180
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,400
recordings from sound man Regis Sedlock.

181
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,600
Any time that a band knocked me off the stage.

182
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:10,600


183
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:10,600


184
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,480
I was completely on my ears, as the saying goes.

185
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,120
And this happened when a band called Thelonious Bosch played.

186
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,680
And nobody at Ace really knew much about this band, except that their CD sounded really

187
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,660
good and weird and Celtic.

188
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,500
And that they were from Minneapolis.

189
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:32,200
But it turned out it wasn't just Celtic, friends, as heard on Speaker 7.

190
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:38,240
It was Bulgarian and Aswinian and every kind of obscure ethnic tune.

191
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,300
And stuff from 600 years ago.

192
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,140
Done up in all manner of instrumentation.

193
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,540
Modern instruments and stuff.

194
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,080
Including two high speed violins and a smoky voiced singer babe.

195
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,140
Adding totally modern lyrics to these ancient tunes.

196
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,860
As you will hear in this show.

197
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,160
And well, they did a killer version of Give Me That Old Time Religion.

198
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,440
Let us worship like the Druids.

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,280
Running naked through the night.

200
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,040
In theärke puis en underneath un maeble flûte.

201
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,140


202
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,260
Drinking strange fermented fluids which taste good enough for me.

203
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,500
Give me that old-time religion, give me that old-time religion

204
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,460
Give me that old-time religion It's good enough for me.

205
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,320
Oh, the Christians are a humming cuz they say their God is coming

206
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,960
Well our God came three times last night and our God is 33

207
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,480
Give me that old-time religion, it's good enough for me.

208
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:35,540


209
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,140
Give me that old-time religion.

210
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,960
It's good enough for me.

211
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,260
It's good enough for me.

212
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,060
Cause she doeth what she willeth,

213
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,460
Good she willeth, lillith killeth,

214
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,760
But she's good enough for me.

215
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,760
Gimme that old time religion,

216
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,540
give me that old time religion.

217
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,620
It's good enough for me.

218
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,800
We will gather in our saunas,

219
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,680
Till the Spirit comes upon us,

220
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,640
To perform the rites upon us,

221
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,380
And that's good enough for me.

222
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,700
Gimme that old time religion,

223
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,160
give me that old time religion.

224
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,560
Take it Rick Lee!

225
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,960
There are some who say it's folly

226
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,860
When we worship a mother collie

227
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,800
She may not be very jolly

228
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,700
And she's good enough for me

229
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,720
Gimme that old town religion

230
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Gimme that old town religion

231
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,760
Gimme that old town religion

232
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,640
It's good enough for me

233
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,460
Well it made me a believer

234
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,560
When I met that old man Shiva

235
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,580
And his cannabis sativa

236
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,320
It's quite good enough for me

237
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,480
Gimme that old town religion

238
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Gimme that old town religion

239
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,520
Gimme that old town religion

240
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,320
It's good enough for me

241
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,300
Let us sing to Mother Isis

242
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,160
She'll stand by us in a crisis

243
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,120
And she hasn't raised her prices

244
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,040
It's good enough for me

245
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,040
Gimme that old town religion

246
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Gimme that old town religion

247
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,860
Gimme that old town religion

248
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,700
It's good enough for me

249
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,300
Break down!

250
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,260
Ha!

251
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,340
With your trusty old othami

252
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,360
You can cast a triple whammy

253
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,280
Or slice and dice salami

254
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,700
Which is good enough for me

255
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
Gimme that old town religion

256
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,720
Gimme that old town religion

257
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,160
Gimme that old town religion

258
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,000
It's good enough for me

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,060
Says my mom this witchcraft's loony

260
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,880
And this pagan stuff is goony

261
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,800
But at least he's not a moony

262
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,760
That's good enough for me!

263
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,780
Gimme that old town religion

264
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,640
Gimme that old town religion

265
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,120
Gimme that old town religion

266
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,580
It's good enough for me

267
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,720
There are people into voodoo

268
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,660
With their mojo and their hoodoo

269
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,460
I know I do, I hope you do

270
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,360
That's good enough for me

271
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,320
Gimme that old town religion

272
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,500
Gimme that old town religion

273
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,240
Gimme that old town religion

274
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,220
It's good enough for me

275
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,060
We will worship Maphrodite

276
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,280
Though she's kinda wild and flighty

277
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,620
We get to see her in her nighty tonighty

278
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,020
That's good enough for me

279
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,080
Gimme that old town religion

280
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
Gimme that old town religion

281
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,740
releases me through the show

282
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,020
It's good enough for haned riff

283
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,180
Hanna theme!

284
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,480
This verse means a lot to us because we're from Minnesota, and we're very glad that we

285
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,540
didn't bring our state bird here to you.

286
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,340
Outdoor skyclad is for weirdos who forget about mosquitoes and they zap you like torpedoes.

287
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,840
That's not good enough for me.

288
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,080
Give me that old time religion.

289
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,200
Give me that old time religion.

290
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,140
Give me that old time religion.

291
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,920
It's good enough for me.

292
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,120
It was good enough for Buda.

293
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,680
As a god he's kinda cuta and he comes in brass or puta so he's good enough for me.

294
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,780
Give me that old time religion.

295
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,700
Give me that old time religion.

296
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,760
Give me that old time religion.

297
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,580
It's good enough for me.

298
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,720
Let us sing to Lord Cthulhu.

299
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,640
Don't let Lovecraft try to fool ya.

300
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,640
For the elder gods will rule you.

301
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,200
They're quite good enough for me.

302
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,400
Give me that old time religion.

303
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,260
Give me that old time religion.

304
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,280
Give me that old time religion.

305
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,340
It's good enough for Nemo.

306
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,880
In the halls of Frey and Freya.

307
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,880
All the priestesses will lay ya.

308
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,780
If you're good enough they'll pay ya.

309
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,500
That's good enough for me.

310
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,540
Give me that old time religion.

311
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,480
Give me that old time religion.

312
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
Give me that old time religion.

313
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,300
It's good enough for me.

314
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,420
John and Paul and George and Ringo.

315
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,360
We will worship playing bingo.

316
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,220
We will listen to them sing-o.

317
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,020
That's good enough for me.

318
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,100
That old time religion.

319
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,980
Give me that old time religion.

320
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,960
Give me that old time religion.

321
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,820
It's good enough for me.

322
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,700
Medieval troll jams for the new dark ages.

323
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,220
And now to those live recordings at Starwood.

324
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,760
So as Jeff Rosenbaum said,

325
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,780
God works in mysterious ways

326
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,340
but Bob plays in mysterious ways.

327
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,020
And, friends, maybe if we're lucky

328
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,100
we can hope for not only survival

329
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,760
with or without the aliens

330
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,900
but REVENGE AS WELL!!

331
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,060
Oh, wouldn't that be great?

332
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,440
I'm so tired of nothing being fair.

333
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,160
My wife comes home.

334
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,580
She has to work a real job.

335
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,680
And she comes home and it's really not fair.

336
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,460
And nothing to get hung about.

337
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:48,520
But no, but the new age, I'm afraid, in general kind of insists on fairness.

338
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,020
And friends, that's not fair to the unfair.

339
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,040
You know.

340
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:02,540
And so we hear all this gyria running out of all these gurus, therapists, and numb nuts.

341
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,280
And our job in the Church of the Subgenius is simply, well, among many other things,

342
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,540
it's really one of our jobs is to unmask the false prophets.

343
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,760
That's great.

344
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,060
That means anybody you don't like.

345
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,460
That's the pink boys, the humans, the mediocritans, the Barbies and Kens, the cage dwellers,

346
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,800
and all that, which can all be read about in our booklets and pamphlets.

347
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,420
And DVDs over there.

348
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,140
But really, it's a tricky question.

349
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,340
Who is the biggest false prophet in your life?

350
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,660
You know, is it George Bush?

351
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,840
Is it the boss?

352
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,040
Is it Bob?

353
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,140
No, it's you.

354
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,880
Yeah, it's you.

355
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,240
The biggest liar you know is you.

356
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,540
And the reason I know that is because I'm the biggest liar I know.

357
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,120
But I'm trying to catch myself in the lies.

358
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,400
Oh.

359
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,580
I just did it again.

360
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,140
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,060
See, it's so difficult.

362
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,680
It is really, it is very, very difficult.

363
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,600
And a slack of that kind does not come that easy.

364
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,540
And so there's all this new age guru claptrap that sometimes I'm wondering,

365
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,240
does it really teach you to be more aware?

366
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:21,080
Or is it teaching you to pretend better to be more aware and more awake?

367
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,060
Is it just giving you a more?

368
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,520
Is it giving you a more?

369
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,520


370
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,520


371
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,520


372
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,520


373
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,520


374
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,520


375
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,480
It's a lofty vocabulary of higher consciousness,

376
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,980
which mimics the real thing.

377
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,700
You can find lots of people right here who will teach you

378
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,840
how to categorize every part of your personality

379
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,440
just as if you understood all those parts.

380
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,000
But really, aren't they just possibly more imaginary boxes

381
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,180
that keep you automatically sure that you're not on automatic?

382
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,100
That's the whole idea, right?

383
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,380
That's the whole idea.

384
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,460
Not to let yourself fall into that sleepwalk,

385
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,620
to try to keep yourself from mental habits and being alert and awake and so forth.

386
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,880
I know all this because I'm one of the automatic robots

387
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,220
that goes around telling all the other robots

388
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,800
that they're robots and they must wake up.

389
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,640
I do that automatically.

390
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,960
That was the way I was programmed.

391
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,540
You know, I read a bunch of fucking Robert Anton Wilson books or something.

392
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,180
Next thing you know,

393
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,920
I had to have Pope Bob himself.

394
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,860
He himself had to de-zombify me.

395
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
Actually, I wrote to...

396
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,860
I was a big fan of Robert Anton Wilson when I was in my 20s.

397
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,420
I wrote him...

398
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,100
I just had to get in touch with him, you know?

399
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,200
I had to make that communication somehow.

400
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,820
And so I wrote him a letter with the...

401
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,160
just made up a question that I thought he might be interested in answering.

402
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,220
Something about some weird UFO cult.

403
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,840
And he said,

404
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,640
if you get any deeper into UFOs,

405
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,980
try to keep your sense of humor.

406
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,920
I probably shouldn't say any more about what Pope Bob told me about...

407
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,980
But anyway, that's how I know about enlightenment.

408
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,160
It's because I was automatically programmed to tell everybody to wake up.

409
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,700
It's fun to put yourself into the happy mental state

410
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,820
of believing yourself to be fully awake and preternaturally aware.

411
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,400
To skip straight to announcing your enlightenment,

412
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,560
without actually ever having turned the lights on.

413
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
So to speak.

414
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,440
And you know and I know a lot of...

415
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,260
very well-spoken new age people

416
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,220
who are so busy thinking about how in the now they are

417
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,900
that they can't pay any attention to what's really happening

418
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,460
right in front of their damn face.

419
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,940
You know, they talk the trademark talk of the aware person,

420
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,040
but it just stays hot air.

421
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,620
And I'm sick of this hot air.

422
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,180
Man, they don't live forever.

423
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,040
They don't speak from the grave.

424
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,760
They don't really read minds.

425
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,700
Their followers might say they do,

426
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,560
but it's only because they heard somebody say that they heard somebody say that they do.

427
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,440
It's just words, words, words, and a bunch of hot air.

428
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,800
And I should probably shut the fuck up.

429
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,500
See, that gets applause.

430
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,840
See, they get that over...

431
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,240
They like that.

432
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
But seriously, you know, the followers type.

433
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,540
Now, the super

434
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:28,640
The super duper types are those with the most vested interest in not being proved to have been dupes of a conman.

435
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:36,480
Or worse, a conman who is himself a sincere dupe of a long line of conmen.

436
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,140
Because we all want answers, we all want meaning, we all want to know what...

437
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,580
what it's all about.

438
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:49,160
out, but do we really have to? Is there anything in the rule book that says we have to know or that

439
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:57,020
we deserve to know? Isn't it okay if they never catch the Loch Ness Monster? They did catch Bigfoot.

440
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:08,000
He turned out to be just some guy like me and my crop circle friends. So the conspiracy is

441
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:16,040
one version of the conspiracy existing inside you and me is thinking that mental freedom

442
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:24,280
is going to come by magic from reading books or believing some lofty, copying the vocabulary of

443
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,780
somebody who knows how to talk the talk. And I may not be enlightened, but I can spot a liar

444
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:37,840
sometimes. It takes one to know one. And friends, when you see a guru bragging about his enlightenment,

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,720
I'll say that again, bragging about his enlightenment, and sometimes it's very

446
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,420
indirect, you know, those who know don't say and those who say don't know, so I should shut up.

447
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,040
One of the greatest tricks of the false prophet is so simple. Well, it's the power stare,

448
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:07,720
you know, just a certain look that impresses, well, it impresses intellectuals is what it

449
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:07,980
does.

450
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,560
It's a simple trick that creates a powerful presence, you know. Suddenly you're the, and it's

451
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:25,080
the simple power stare. Chimpanzees and Texas rednecks practice the power stare, but it only

452
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:33,500
works on other chimpanzees or on people who read too much, Star Trek fans, geeks, gimps, nerds,

453
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,760
dips, friends, you know, I mean, it's not that hard.

454
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,100
I mean, it's not that hard to start your own cult and rope in believers saying the most outrageous,

455
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:55,420
patently loony bullshit, I promise you. I've had to deprogram subgeniuses. And also, when people are

456
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:00,580
giving lessons in enlightenment, that certainly implies that they're qualified to teach it, so

457
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:07,580
that, you know, have you ever had somebody, like people who tell you you're smart, only it's like,

458
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:07,980
you know, you're not smart. You're not smart. You're not smart. You're not smart. You're not smart.

459
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:16,500
They're complete drunken tarts. And they're going, I've been listening to what you're saying,

460
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:27,340
and I must say, I want you to know that you're very intelligent. Oh, well, thanks so much

461
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:33,520
for the compliment there. I never would have, you know, telling people who's smart and who's dumb

462
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,900
is not necessarily smart. And even if a statement is true, it's not necessarily

463
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:46,120
a good idea to say it. So, but there's one thing far more powerful than even belief or the power of

464
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:55,540
the human mind, and that is the human ego. That damn ego thing is so much better at tricking the

465
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:01,080
mind than the mind can even guess. In fact, your ego makes your mind think that it's winning

466
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,140
all the time just by sweet talking it. Boy, you are so, hey, you've got your act together, man.

467
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,820
You're not in your own little world.

468
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,980
You've really got your act together. So you just keep doing what I told you to, bragging.

469
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,100
So next thing you know, there's guys that are nothing but ego telling everybody else how to

470
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:26,680
run their own minds and lose their egos. As the new rapper Poop Bobby Bob said,

471
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,160
the pink boy's got a Bob complex.

472
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,680
Oh, yes. When you're at Starwood, it's a good idea to,

473
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:44,580
occasionally get away from all the new agers and play some punk or otherwise sarcastic or

474
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:50,680
disrespectful secular music for yourself to offset the nice sweetness and light crap

475
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:59,000
that impinges from all directions there. Now, luckily for me, my friend, sister Melodious

476
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:07,180
Chops, also known in the human world as Victoria Ganger, writes sarcastic sweetness and light music.

477
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,740
She,

478
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,140
she has sweet songs and sad songs and happy songs, but she's best known for her sarcastic songs.

479
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,700
I've played Pagan Fest Barbie on Hour of Slack many times, but she's got a new one,

480
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:30,400
which you're about to hear called Magical Tool. The backup babes in this band, Victoria Ganger and

481
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,740
Revelry, by the way, include Princess We Are Doe, to whom I am consort.

482
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,100
And they sound like sarcastic angels, friends.

483
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,220
This is the song that we've been talking up the whole time. If you like Pagan Fest Barbie,

484
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,840
we think you'll like this one.

485
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,560
Too bad Oberon left.

486
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,020
Bagpipes play

487
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:04,140
One dark and stormy night, I thought I'd do me some magic and work me a spell that was cool,

488
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,880
not to summon up a pixie or find me a new friend, or find me a new conference room, or find me a new place to stay.

489
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,500
Fix something tragic, just get me a magical tool.

490
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,160
I had cups and wands and cauldrons, even an altar with davies carved out of stone.

491
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:26,980
But I was feeling all frustrated, cause I was lacking a magical tool of my own.

492
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:34,380
One with the heart of a god and the mind of a druid, and built like the bull of Queen Maeve too.

493
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:41,960
But I spent too much time in the arms of Bacchus, so I'll probably settle for you.

494
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,220
Now that's a lesson that I've tried a long time to learn.

495
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:03,600
So I knew that it was risky, but I was frisky and I had some power to burn.

496
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,360
Burn.

497
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:11,100
So I did some meditating, gazed at some candles and splashed in my visionary pool.

498
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:18,500
I threw caution to the wind and then I started to spin and called for a magical tool.

499
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:26,080
One with the heart of a god, oh please don't make him dizzy, and built like the bull of Queen Maeve too.

500
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:33,660
But Osiris is unwilling and Odin's busy, so I'll probably settle for you.

501
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
Oh I was something like that.

502
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,360


503
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,360


504
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,800
Oh my higher power, can you hear me?

505
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,360
I'm praying with all of my might.

506
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,700
For the you'll bring my tool here tonight.

507
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,260
Now I know you don't like whining.

508
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,320
So here is some candid.

509
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,160
Maybe Ill pour you a beer.

510
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,360
And it would be awesome, but I can not keep the good will than this love.

511
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,620
It's not too much trouble.

512
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,240
It would be handy if you'd manifest him right here.

513
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,800
And with the heart of a god and the mind of a druid,

514
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,640
I'm built like the bull of Queen Maeve too.

515
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,120
But Cthulhu is outrageous.

516
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,000
Krishna's contagious.

517
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,160
So I'll probably settle for you.

518
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,920
And up and down and in and out,

519
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,440
cause that's what magic's all about.

520
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,200
I want to get me a magical tool.

521
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,920
Round and round and round we go with me above and you below.

522
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,660
I really need me a magical tool

523
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,360
that has the heart of a god and the mind of a druid

524
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,180
built like the bull of Queen Maeve too.

525
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,560
But Poseidon is suspicious.

526
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,780
Thor can be vicious.

527
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,560
So I'll probably settle for you.

528
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,340
Dearest higher power,

529
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,480
now don't you tease me.

530
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,820
I'm not asking much of you here.

531
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,780
Just a single magic tool that would try to please me

532
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,340
and help me to be of good cheer.

533
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,020
I have practiced long and hard,

534
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,460
so you will reward me the way that you know that I should.

535
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,600
And I swear I won't abuse him.

536
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,520
I'll never lose him.

537
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,420
And I'll own him.

538
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,980
I'll only use him for good.

539
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,600
And you have the heart of a god.

540
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,480
Oh, please don't make him lazy.

541
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,280
Built like the bull of Queen Maeve too.

542
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,880
But Apollo's such a player.

543
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,700
And Loki's crazy.

544
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,680
So I'll probably settle for you.

545
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,020
I don't want to be depressed.

546
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,180
I demand the best.

547
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:59,420
So I'll probably settle for you.

548
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,520
Ooh!

549
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,260
Woo-hoo!

550
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,520
Thank you.

551
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,200
We are Revelry.

552
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,720
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

553
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,500
That's Victoria Ganger and Revelry.

554
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,360
And you can find out more about them

555
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,000
at www.revelrychix.com.

556
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,860
And now this.

557
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,740
Now.

558
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,260
How much time do I have?

559
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,560
A little bit more.

560
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:40,800
I want to read something that another subgenius said on our news group,

561
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,660
the subgenius news group, alt.slack.

562
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,080
Just before I left for Starwood, I printed this out.

563
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,740
They were bitching.

564
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,960
It was the title of the thread was Zen Sucks.

565
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,600
And they were basically talking about American Buddhists who are full of crap.

566
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,300
This one guy said,

567
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,900
Well, it's not about overcoming the ego.

568
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,200
It's about realizing your ego doesn't exist.

569
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,280
I know that because I lost my ego a long time ago.

570
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,220
It's great not having an ego.

571
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,280
All the chicks think I'm so hot,

572
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,700
and I'm smarter and better looking than I ever was

573
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,280
when I was just a bag of skin with a little controlling voice inside.

574
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,240
I make more money than ever.

575
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,100
I just bought my fourth vacation home in Italy.

576
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,800
I have a bitchin' set of wheels.

577
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,300
I have three ways and four ways every night,

578
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,920
and I never feel bad about anything.

579
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,280
In fact, I screwed the waitress at the local French restaurant in the pantry,

580
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,920
then had a big dinner and skipped out on the bill

581
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,220
and didn't feel guilty at all

582
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,320
because being an enlightened master, I deserve it.

583
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,140
You can take it from me.

584
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,760
Being ego-free is terrific.

585
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,820
That was by Bolden Pramer.

586
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,140
Sure.

587
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,080
And then our friend, Reverend Joe,

588
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,660
Joe Cosby said,

589
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,600
and bear with me, this is great,

590
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,000
I've always found American Buddhists intensely irritating.

591
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,020
Like Puritans, but worse.

592
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,880
Always running around preaching about the evils of your ego,

593
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,980
usually when you say something that would irritate them

594
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,380
if they weren't so lofty and enlightened.

595
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,360
And you know they're lofty and enlightened because they tell you so.

596
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,940
But no, you have an ego problem.

597
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,340
Your ego's getting in the way of seeing that they, the Buddhists,

598
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,240
are right in all ways at all times.

599
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,800
A bunch of passive-aggressive serial killers.

600
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,480
Anybody who tells you they're enlightened is looking for a donation.

601
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,780
Anybody who tells you what you, quote, need to do, unquote,

602
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,960
is trying to tell you that they're enlightened

603
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,160
without being so obvious about it.

604
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,860
They want you to say it.

605
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,620
Of course, J.R. Bob Dobbs is an exception to this rule.

606
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,740
Bob does want a donation,

607
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,760
but only so that he can continue the good work

608
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,220
of getting even more donations.

609
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,600
And Bob is enlightened.

610
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,560
Bob is more enlightened than Mother Teresa,

611
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,620
the Dalai Lama, and Martha Stewart put together.

612
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,400
Bob spent many years in the misty Himalayas

613
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,160
studying, meditating, and chanting

614
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,340
under the great ascended masters in their mountain monasteries,

615
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,320
and he had a realization that none of them before had had,

616
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,520
and that was that studying, meditating, and chanting

617
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
is really fucking boring.

618
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,500
It was from this epiphany that Bob developed

619
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,200
a new system of enlightenment.

620
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,780
Instead of studying and meditating to get enlightenment,

621
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,060
the Bob Dharma was to buy it,

622
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,860
which is much more time-efficient.

623
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,580
Bringing his salesman superpowers to bear,

624
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,280
Bob quickly realized that all these masters he'd studied with,

625
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,280
while they were pretty sure that they were actually pretty enlightened,

626
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,780
couldn't help but wonder secretly

627
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,220
if the other masters might not be as enlightened.

628
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,520
If they might not be more enlightened,

629
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,860
or have some type of enlightenment

630
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,440
which had never occurred to them.

631
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,980
So Bob quickly brokered a black market network

632
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,080
through which one enlightened master

633
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,140
could buy another enlightened master's enlightenment

634
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,320
using subgenius technology to isolate the area of the brain

635
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,340
where the enlightenment pheromones go,

636
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,940
and transferring them via toothpaste tubes

637
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,380
obtained at a bargain from army surplus.

638
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,140
Yes.

639
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,200
Since he realized,

640
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,700
he ran the whole network of course,

641
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,060
Bob got the best prices

642
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,560
and got to sample everybody's enlightenment,

643
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,260
and he passes the savings on to you!

644
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,220
So friends,

645
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,140
and those savings are represented by our new set of DVDs there.

646
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
For those who can't read,

647
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,920
there are the DVDs,

648
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,440
and for those who can only read a little,

649
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,220
there are the $1 pamphlets.

650
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,560
But really friends,

651
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,060
is it all bluff,

652
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,360
you know,

653
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,100
guru bluff,

654
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,460
and self-bluff,

655
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,400
fire sign theater kind of indicated that it might be.

656
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,760
Are we really that cynical?

657
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,180
Is the guru bluffing himself so well that he inspires others?

658
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,940
And if so,

659
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,160
is there anything wrong with that?

660
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,300
Gurdjieff,

661
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,280
actually this whole rant was inspired by a book about Gurdjieff

662
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,700
by a friend of mine,

663
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,960
John Shirley,

664
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,140
who is a science fiction writer,

665
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,360
and he wrote his first non-fiction book was a,

666
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,700
a life of Gurdjieff.

667
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,580
He was originally kind of skeptical,

668
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,360
but when he got into it,

669
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,840
he talked to some of the Gurdjieff teachers,

670
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,600
the ones that are in the more legitimate,

671
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,100
you know,

672
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,620
schools,

673
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,160
according to him anyway.

674
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,280
And,

675
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,000
and,

676
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,080
and he ended up getting to be a little bit of a kind of a believer in it.

677
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,060
And I read his book and it was very respectful,

678
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,340
but I couldn't help,

679
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,340
but focus on this paragraph at the end where he kind of skimmed over the fact that,

680
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:58,340


681
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,100
bottom line,

682
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:10,960
Gurdjieff was a guy who wrote some books and did these classes and had babies by the wives of many of his followers and was,

683
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,720
died of smoking too much and being an old drunk who had a car wreck.

684
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,640
You know,

685
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:17,840
so,

686
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,420
and this is the best we have,

687
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,000
you know,

688
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,600
this was the most legitimate of the mystic school teachers for me.

689
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,020
And I still ended up going,

690
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,180
well,

691
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,880
was he all just,

692
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,580
was he just saying all this shit because it sounded wise?

693
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,200
You know,

694
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,380
it's so easy to learn the semblance and the trappings of awareness and knowledge.

695
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,840
All you need is the impenetrably flighty jargon punctuated by

696
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,220
pregnant pauses and flattery.

697
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,240
There's a key moment when the real good teacher will say,

698
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,460
Oh,

699
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,100
obviously there are many things I don't need to tell you.

700
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,340
And they use the big eyebrows at that moment.

701
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,920
And that's the cue that they could tell you even more with more donations.

702
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,900
Friends,

703
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,360
some,

704
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,340
it's not necessarily lying,

705
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:23,780
but lying by omission and by suggestion and providing rule books for fairness for lazy thinkers who want to believe that there's such a thing as fairness.

706
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,900
People who like to think that they're thinkers.

707
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,180
And that brings us to the subgenius kooks.

708
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,620
Friends,

709
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,160
J.R.

710
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:45,040
Bob Dobbs said a bunch of shit that was so obviously exactly telling kooks what they would most want to believe that only a kook could possibly believe it.

711
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,940
And so plenty did.

712
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,140
And that is why I know how easy it is to fool somebody.

713
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,840
We weren't even trying.

714
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,180
In fact,

715
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
it says,

716
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,960
humor on the back of the damn book.

717
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,540
And I've had people tell me,

718
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:02,660
no,

719
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:02,980
staying.

720
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,520
It's all channeled material.

721
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,460
It's like,

722
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:05,600
well,

723
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:05,820
no,

724
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,980
it's me and my friends got high and wrote that shit.

725
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,460
Well,

726
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,300
but you were being the invisible college was channeling this material through you.

727
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,960
You just had to get drunk in order to,

728
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,460
you know,

729
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,680
be a proper channel.

730
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,760
It's like,

731
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,040
well,

732
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,620
whatever,

733
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,940
I guess friends.

734
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,520
Sometimes I suspect that in some cases,

735
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,720
certainly not all,

736
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,000
but sometimes gurus and therapists.

737
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,700
Especially can kind of impede your slack because there's some things you just have to figure out for yourself.

738
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,480
Unless you're a dumbass,

739
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,620
then you should pay me.

740
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,500
And that's why that table is over there,

741
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,620
but you really have to want to stop kidding yourselves.

742
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,680
You can't just want to reap the bragging rights about it.

743
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,800
One sign of getting old like me is when you're not sure you're right anymore.

744
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,680
Being more sure that you're right.

745
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:56,980
Right?

746
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,240
Is a sign of being stupid,

747
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,840
not necessarily old.

748
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,900
So when you're young,

749
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,740
you're more,

750
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,200
you're a lot more sure of what little you do know.

751
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,560
And when you get older,

752
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,400
you know a lot more,

753
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,800
but you're very doubtful of any of it.

754
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,600
At least that's the way it struck me.

755
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,820
But nonetheless,

756
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,460
even though this,

757
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,900
all this is so vague and maybe an if fish,

758
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,140
God damn it.

759
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,400
The subgenius,

760
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:19,820
this,

761
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,660
even though it may be drunk,

762
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,320
broke,

763
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,200
neurotic,

764
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,920
stupid,

765
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,900
yet it is still better.

766
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,760
And still,

767
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,280
still luckier because it has Bob and the others don't.

768
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,580
And that is all any religion really does for you.

769
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,500
Yes,

770
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,480
you're smarter than the next guy because you believe the right thing.

771
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,240
Friends,

772
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,980
Bob Dobbs healed me.

773
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,540
He healed me.

774
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:52,080
He took his living fist and he rammed it all the way up my butt and it Bob healed my ass.

775
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,080
Now,

776
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,640
you may not want to be.

777
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,960
He healed quite the same way.

778
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,940
You know,

779
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,780
when you take the path less traveled,

780
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,140
you often find out that it was less traveled for a pretty good reason.

781
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,400
But and sadly,

782
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,080
everybody,

783
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,400
everybody is pretending to be something.

784
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,240
They're not because you can't know what you really are.

785
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:26,100
That's one case where the act of observing really does affect the outcome and where the ego is a lot smarter than the mind because you can form a labyrinth of beautiful.

786
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:40,840
Words just the most wonderful sounding stuff and get lost in that maze of words and or rituals or habits or whatever to the point where you're analyzing the forest while the trees are burning down all around you.

787
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,300
So damn it friends.

788
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,680
All I can say is there is such a thing as slack,

789
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,860
but I sure can't tell you what it is.

790
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,580
And,

791
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:54,860
uh,

792
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,740
Bob is not the answer,

793
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,640
but neither is anything else.

794
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,980
Praise Bob and friends.

795
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,620
That is why we say repent,

796
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,200
quit your job and slack off while you still know how question Authority.

797
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,640
Cuz I said so.

798
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,080
Yeah.

799
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,560
And friends really just the only thing you really have to do.

800
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,780
They have to remember about the church of the subgenius.

801
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,700
We only have one rule.

802
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,460
We don't have a charter.

803
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,080
It's company.

804
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,040
It's actually a novelty company incorporated in Texas.

805
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,560
So hopefully what happened to Oberon won't happen to us,

806
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,600
but the one rule and really,

807
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,240
you know,

808
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,300
we can Bob said a lot of funny shit.

809
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,080
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

810
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,280
Well, that's great.

811
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,940
I'm blind still,

812
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,360
but at least it's my own blindness.

813
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,540
Too much is always better than not enough.

814
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,880
Yeah, go ahead kid.

815
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,780
But it's almost as bad.

816
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,500
That was the part Bob left out.

817
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,280
He had a lot of wise stuff and most of it really doesn't hold up under close examination,

818
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,980
but one does and that's the one rule.

819
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,620
The one solid foundation bedrock of the church of the subgenius.

820
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,540
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

821
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,200
That is that is it.

822
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:24,280
That is it.

823
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,120
Give me that old time religion, it's good enough for me.

824
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,140
We will go and worship Maui with that Polynesian Sa'ui,

825
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,680
and he'll give us Maui-Waui, that's stoned enough for me.

826
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,860
Give me that old time religion, give me that old time religion,

827
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,640
give me that old time religion, it's good enough for me.

828
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,620
We will all worship Elvis, although he was kinda selfish,

829
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,240
he could rock and roll his pelvis, he's good enough for me.

830
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,380
Give me that old time religion, give me that old time religion,

831
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,120
give me that old time religion, it's good enough for me.

832
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,040
Let us dance with Dionysus and get drunk on wine and spices,

833
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,560
the Christians call them physes but they're good enough for me.

834
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,720
Give me that old time religion, give me that old time religion,

835
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,660
give me that old time religion, it's good enough for me.

836
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,580
Give me that old time religion, give me that old time religion,

837
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,220
give me that old time religion, it's good enough for me.

838
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,520
It's good enough for me.

839
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,240
We will sing a verse for Eris, golden apples for the fairest.

840
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,880
Though she sometimes tries to scare us, she's good enough for me.

841
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,820
Grab your sacrifice and wicker, it will make the flames burn quicker.

842
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,520
Though the cell makes some foes sicker, it's still good enough for me.

843
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,400
We will jump the old bonfire, though the flames are roaring higher.

844
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,200
If you miss, you join the pyre, and that's good enough for me.

845
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,420
Gimme that old time religion, Ricci, Miller, I don't even know how to

846
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,060
Decide it's good enough for me.

847
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:34,340
Gimme that old time religion, Ricci, Miller, I don't even know how to

848
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,820
We will all practice tantra, groans and grunts will be our mantra.

849
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,640
When there's nothing that you can't-a, it's good enough for me.

850
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,580
Gimme that old time religion,

851
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:52,520
Give me that old time religion, give me that old time religion, it's good enough for me.

852
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,600
Oh, this lusty old priapus, he's just itching to unwrap us.

853
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,160
He'll do lots more than just tap us, he's good enough for me.

854
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:08,020
Give me that old time religion, give me that old time religion, give me that old time religion, it's good enough for me.

855
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,020
Oh, we'll all worship Venus, oh the gods, you should have seen us.

856
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,720
Now the clinic has to screen us, but she's good enough for me.

857
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:23,540
Give me that old time religion, give me that whole time religion, give me that whole time religion, it's good enough for me.

858
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:39,240
Oh, we'll all worship Bacchus, and we'll raise a royal raucous, and he'll lay us down and fuck us, he's good enough for me.

859
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:45,160
Give me that old time religion, give me that whole time religion, give me that whole time religion,

860
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:45,700
at least He'll bring us back and we'll say He's good enough for me.

861
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:45,700


862
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,940
It's good enough for me.

863
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,140
If you think these verses for us,

864
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,760
then go write another chorus.

865
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,780
Just make sure that you don't bore us.

866
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,420
You're all good enough for me.

867
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,700
An old time religion.

868
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,620
Give me that old time religion.

869
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,540
That old time religion.

870
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,840
One more time.

871
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,300
Last time.

872
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,480
Give me that old time religion.

873
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,340
Give me that old time religion.

874
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,280
Give me that old time religion.

875
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,520
It's good enough for me.

876
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,420
Yeah.

877
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,060
Thank you for indulging us.

878
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:28,880
You guys too.

879
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,860
We understand there's going to be some things blowing up next door.

880
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,220
So we'll play this one

881
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,260
and send you off to the next one.

882
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,020
We'll all off into the night.

883
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,560
We are Philonious Bosch from Minneapolis.

884
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,000
Thank you again for having us here.

885
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,600
We like your city very much.

886
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,840
We're going to finish off with a piece of medieval English music.

887
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,960
Sir Ian Gillan.

888
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,640
From somewhere in the 1370s?

889
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,300
14, 15?

890
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,360
Maybe the 1770s.

891
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,680
1870s?

892
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,680
No.

893
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,860
1870s?

894
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


895
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


896
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


897
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


898
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


899
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


900
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


901
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


902
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


903
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


904
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


905
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:00,860


906
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,020
He doesn't honestly say that.

907
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,600
The window is broken.

908
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,560
¶¶

909
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,460
¶¶

910
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,420
¶¶

911
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,880
We're kind of sorry this is the last song.

912
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,060
It's been a great time playing for you guys.

913
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,060
¶¶

914
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:03,540
¶¶

915
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,560
Sing along in the chorus if it might mood strikes you.

916
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,160
¶¶

917
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:19,480
¶ Well we all came into Montreux ¶¶

918
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,660
¶ On the Lake Geneva shoreline ¶¶

919
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,920
¶ To make music with the mobile ¶¶

920
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,580
¶ We didn't have much time ¶¶

921
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,780
¶ Frank Zappa and the mother ¶¶

922
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,540
¶ Had the best time ¶¶

923
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,900
¶ We had the best place around ¶¶

924
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,740
¶ But some stupid with a flare gun ¶¶

925
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,780
¶ Burned the place to the ground ¶¶

926
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:51,020
¶ Smoke on the water ¶¶

927
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,940
¶ And fire in the sky ¶¶

928
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,960
¶ Smoke on the water ¶¶

929
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,940
¶¶

930
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,320
¶¶

931
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,100
¶¶

932
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:21,600
¶ They burned down the gambling house ¶¶

933
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,560
¶ It died with an awful sound ¶¶

934
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:29,240
¶ Funky club was running in and out ¶¶

935
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,300
¶ Burning kids out of the ground ¶¶

936
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:36,780
¶ When it all was over ¶¶

937
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,980
¶ Had to find another place ¶¶

938
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,560
¶ The Swiss time was running out ¶¶

939
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,300
¶ It seemed that we would lose the race ¶¶

940
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,380
¶ Smoke on the water ¶¶

941
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,320
¶ And fire in the sky ¶¶

942
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,280
¶ Smoke on the water ¶¶

943
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,220
¶¶

944
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,280
¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶

945
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,620
¶¶

946
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,200
¶¶

947
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,100
¶¶

948
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,140
¶¶

949
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,200
¶¶

950
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,720
¶¶

951
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:32,800
¶¶

952
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,020
¶¶

953
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,400
¶ We ended up at the Grand Hotel ¶¶

954
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:38,500
¶¶

955
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,020
¶ It was lonely, cold, and bare ¶¶

956
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,720
¶¶

957
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,540
¶ With a rolling truck stowa¶¶ ¶¶

958
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:44,540


959
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:48,600
¶ Just outside making our music la¶¶

960
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,840
¶¶

961
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,700
¶ With a few empty beds ¶¶

962
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:51,800
¶¶

963
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:51,820
¶¶

964
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,700
¶ And a few red lights ¶¶

965
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,920
¶ It built a place to sweat ¶¶

966
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:04,740
No matter what we get out of this I know that we will never forget

967
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:11,180
Smoke on the water, the fire in the sky

968
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:18,860
Smoke on the water, the fire in the sky

969
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:56,060
Smoke on the water, the fire in the sky

970
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:05,160
You can learn more about Starwood by looking at www.rosencomet.com

971
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,920
That's R-O-S-E-N comet dot com

972
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,940
And hello friends, I have so...

973
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:20,220
You know, I'm a geek and I just as soon sit and animate and edit and fiddle with my computer

974
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,840
And that's really what I've mostly been doing

975
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,900
And if left to my own devices, I'd probably just hide

976
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,740
In my little studio here making things in a gilded cage with Princess Wee and a G5 Mac

977
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:38,020
But whenever she orders me to go out with her to be sociable like at Starwood

978
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,940
It's not nearly as bad as I expect

979
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,140
And, you know, it's gotten to where I wouldn't want to miss a Starwood if I could help it

980
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,360
Even if they weren't paying me to rant there

981
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:53,760
Because you never know where else a trip to Brushwood might lead you

982
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,080
And I'd probably, if I could

983
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,900
I'd probably go to Brushwood

984
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:02,640
Also attend Burning Man and Pamplona, Mardi Gras, Carnival, Glastonbury

985
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,380
And every year, if I were a wealthy man

986
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,340
Because you see such strange, strange things

987
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,160
I'd even attend Burning Star

988
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,780
Or, I don't know about Manwood though

989
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:18,480
But you meet the most interesting people despite yourself

990
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,620
That's what usually happens to me anyway

991
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,280
And a special thanks to our friend Pater Nostril

992
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:26,900
For everything he does for us

993
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,400
And for everything at Starwood

994
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,820
And the Barneys

995
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,740
And Jeff and Joe at Ace

996
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:36,660
For more on Starwood again, check out roseandcomet.com

997
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:43,060
It is by far the coolest big pagan festival anywhere

998
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,660
I can tell you that with absolute surety

999
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:50,460
And the greatest cult in the world is the Church of the Subgenius

1000
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,900
At www.subgenius.com

1001
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,900
Friends, you can even write to me at subgenius.com

1002
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,580
And write me, Reverend Ivan Stang

1003
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:02,820
At post office box 181417

1004
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,340
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1005
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,800
Stang at subgenius.com and praise

1006
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,160
Remember, people watch the line of drinking

1007
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,580
To make sure you have alcohol and fire

1008
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,280
On every level of your home

1009
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,560
Remember, if someone in your household

1010
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,480
Chokes under the influence of fire

1011
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,420
You must be aware of Ontario

1012
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,900
Remember, if someone in your household

1013
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,080
Chokes under the influence of fire

1014
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:27,080


1015
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,660
I'm a dangerous drinker

1016
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,340
You must remember

1017
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,780
There's more to responsible drinking

1018
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,300
Than alcohol and fire

1019
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,820
On every level of your home

1020
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,320
There's more to responsible drinking

1021
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,460
Than alcohol and fire

1022
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:49,840
On every level of your home

1023
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:56,540
There's more to responsible drinking

1024
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,580
I want to tell you about Paris

1025
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,520
My heart has never finished

1026
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,320
There's an advantage of the Eiffel Tower

1027
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,260
Or the Saint-Michel neighborhood

1028
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:13,920
Ha ha!
