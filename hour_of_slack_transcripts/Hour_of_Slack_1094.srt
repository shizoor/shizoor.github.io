00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,320
Hi, I'm a trained professional just waiting for you.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,220
If you're ready to take your life, it's time to put yourself first.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,740
You can call the number on your screen.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,180
We're waiting to hear from you.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,800
The Muppet in your head is like a gorilla who crapped a watermelon in my brain.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,560
They were so insistent.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,860
One, two, three!

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,040
The subgenius power of squirt.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,600
Thank you.

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,040
As we entered the courtroom, we heard the clerk of the court saying,

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,100
Silence in the court.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,980
You have been found guilty of the subgenius power of squirt.

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,680
The sentence of this court is that you be,

14
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,760
hanged by the neck until you are dead.

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,780
Ha! If you ask me, hanging's too good for him.

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,700
Oh, boy. Wait a week, Admiral. Here's a buff person.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,380
That's good, yeah?

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,200
Yeah, it's good.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,080
Oh, chief is?

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,920
Oh, chief is fine.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,060
Yeah, yeah, chief is.

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,700
Let me go, yeah?

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,620
Yeah, yeah, let me go.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,320
Let me go.

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,260
Rancher Joe Martinez and his grandson tried to help Debbie Hunt,

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,760
who went into premature labor,

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,940
but it was in a breached position,

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,380
and Mr. Martinez had to use chains

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,620
to pull the large fetus out.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,660
They really had to work to pull it out because it had a big, big head.

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,800
It was just a big, round head, round and something.

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,060
And when they opened the mouth,

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,900
they found TV reporter Marisa Mays under the cheeks.

34
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,420
As he moved the head from one side to the other,

35
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,600
you could literally see the fluid sploshing back and forth.

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
It was grossly mutilated.

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,700
Ring next, go, stay parked.

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,940
I will have photographs of this abnormal fetus posted within about 30 minutes.

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,240
And make them happy.

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,060
Participating subjects adversely affected by accessory organs.

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,480
Now, accessory organs that give you scientific throat and not nose.

42
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,440
The medical specialist stated,

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,600
It is my opinion that accessory organs were throat and not nose.

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,680
And pre, what are your names, my friend?

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:26,680


46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,560
Poor children.

47
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,680
My name is Greco.

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,060
And my name is Hansel.

49
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,560
Hansel?

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,320
Hansel?

51
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,260
Hansel?

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,560
The End

53
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,960
The End

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,780
The End

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,580
Every day in London,

56
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,800
people wait quietly in line.

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,860
In an orderly manner,

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,620
no crowding or pushing out of turn,

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
in a cheerful way.

60
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,260
London is getting quick and comfortable.

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,320
Busier.

62
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,380
Neater.

63
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,420
Easier.

64
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,700
Thoughtless.

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,760
In a friendly manner.

66
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,360
Always punctual.

67
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,600
Friendly cooperation.

68
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,840
Time goes presently.

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,120
Right on time.

70
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,460
No rushing nor crowding.

71
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,880
Much kindness.

72
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,140
Friendly hands give help at once.

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,940
Excellent service.

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,320
Healthy and pleasant.

75
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,440
Very important.

76
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,280
Pleasant special safety.

77
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,520
Right on time.

78
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,480
Efficiency and comfort.

79
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,760
Good service.

80
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,660
Civilization.

81
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


82
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


83
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


84
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


85
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


86
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


87
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


88
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


89
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


90
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:26,660


91
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:26,820
Quality.

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,160
Willing, orderly and friendly cooperation.

93
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,440
Far away from London, people are kindlier.

94
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,080
No one is hindered at all.

95
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,080
Africans in particular have a quick instinct

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,460
and seem to know when they are with friends.

97
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,460
The End

98
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,640
That's the thanks you get.

99
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,820
He's the same as all the rest.

100
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,960
What he doesn't want to be so, just isn't so.

101
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,560
No skin off my nose.

102
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,220
My 30,000 safe.

103
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,200
And I deserve every last penny of it.

104
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,120
And more and more and more.

105
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,760
What's keeping you then, Dan?

106
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,120
Be honest now, Daniel.

107
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,020
Fear.

108
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Fear and habit.

109
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,940
You get into the habit of serving.

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
Born a servant, see.

111
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Son of a servant.

112
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,480
Family of servants.

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,580
From a nation of servants.

114
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,660
Very first thing an Englishman does, straight from his mother's womb,

115
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,960
is touch his forelock.

116
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,880
That's how they can tell the wrinkled little bastards English.

117
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,880
They don't know about me.

118
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,180
Not they.

119
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,520
They don't know about Daniel Tucker.

120
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,700
Just old faithful Tucker.

121
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,020
Give doggy boney.

122
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,200
You know who I really am.

123
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,060
Alexei Kronstadt.

124
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,700
Anarchist, Trotskyist, communist, revolutionary.

125
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,140
I'm a sell.

126
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,060
For years I've been working for the revolution.

127
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,160
Spitting in the hot soup.

128
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,400
Peas on the wedges were placed.

129
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,120
So raise the scarlet to banner high

130
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,700
Brene's in jail.

131
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,660
We will live and die.

132
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,120
Deleting your life.

133
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,820
Now remember, feel unhappy.

134
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,340
Focus on the things that would make you unhappy.

135
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,240
And delete your life.

136
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,760
Get depressed.

137
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,320
Get depressed.

138
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,020
Piece of cake.

139
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,460
Focus on all the tragedy that's happening in the world right now.

140
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:09,920
Right now.

141
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,780
Children that are dying right now of starvation.

142
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,580
We can make pictures in our head of those bloated stomachs.

143
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,000
Hearing the cries of babies just as they pass off into death.

144
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,440
Seeing flies eating their flesh.

145
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,720
Absolute total pleasure.

146
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,820
Create total pleasure.

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,480
Delete a relationship you have.

148
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
You could, you could, you could, you could freak out.

149
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,400
This moment, there's so much we could focus on and feel good about.

150
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,140
Does that make sense?

151
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm a big doubt.

152
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,280
Gosh, can I really do this?

153
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,800
My brain will get,

154
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,860
I don't know what I asked.

155
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,420
Does that make sense?

156
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,260
Think about it.

157
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
Hey, hey, an expand.

158
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,220
Bitch, bitch.

159
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,040
I want you to know that I believe state management.

160
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,640
That moves me, pull me down.

161
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,480
Pull me to areas of frustration and anger and giving up.

162
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:43,960
Giving up.

163
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,460
A lot of people do things without being aware of how they do it.

164
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,980
Every single day.

165
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,860
Can't be done.

166
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,200
You are absolutely right.

167
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,900
Couldn't be done.

168
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,340
Couldn't be done.

169
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,460
I want you to feel lousy.

170
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,180
Feel bad.

171
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,000
Feel sorry.

172
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,680
Feel hurt.

173
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,100
How can I expand from this.

174
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,900
Experience it again.

175
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,520
Do you have a family?

176
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,940
Do you have a nuclear family?

177
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,960
If not, start one now.

178
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,780
Right now.

179
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,840
Now, ask for your freak.

180
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,440
Now get your freak.

181
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,460
Now, get your free copy of South Korean school nation.

182
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,460


183
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,460


184
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,460


185
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,460


186
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,680
Self-help courses. You can improvise your life.

187
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,320
Do you have a nuclear family? Radiation. People. Right now. Keep calm.

188
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,120
Fertilizer will give you some protection. Fertilizer now.

189
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,740
In case of nuclear attack. Fertilizer protection. Panic burst.

190
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,940
American history. American history. Nuclear attack. Shelter type.

191
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,680
What to do. What to do. What can you do. What to do. The building.

192
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,440
That's why it's important. Take shelter yourself.

193
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,020
Do you have a nuclear family? Danger. Ask for your freak disaster.

194
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,840
Sinks and bathtubs will hold large amounts of water.

195
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,120
Sinks and bathtubs. Sinks and bathtubs. Sinks and bath. Sinks and bath. Sinks and bath.

196
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:18,780
Do you have a family? Do you have a nuclear family? If not, start one now. Right now.

197
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,120
Living easy. Living free.

198
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,260
Season ticket on a one-way ride.

199
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,360
Asking nothing.

200
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,400
Leave me be.

201
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,780
Taking everything in my stride.

202
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,800
Don't need reason.

203
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,900
Don't need rhyme.

204
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,740
Ain't nothing that I'd rather do.

205
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,900
Going down.

206
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,960
Party time.

207
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,080
My friends are gonna be there too.

208
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,400
I'm on a high way to hell.

209
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,840
High.

210
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,420
Way.

211
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,380
To hell.

212
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,880
High.

213
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,580
Way.

214
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,420
To hell.

215
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,600
What would you say if I had found a Martian down there?

216
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,760
That was Phineas Narco from NationalCynical.com.

217
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,720
And more from him later.

218
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,140
Friends, this is hour of slack number 1094.

219
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:59,360
And it's a mishmash this time of sex, giant gorillas, puzzling evidence, collages, and bath.

220
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:06,200
The collages are by Norel Preff and the great Fernandin and Elie Mer.

221
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,280
Separately.

222
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,860
They don't actually work together.

223
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,400
And in this particular show, they're also by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stank.

224
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,160
And there are so many of them, you just have to look at the logs of the show.

225
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,000
Which are on subgenius.com.

226
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:31,960
I also chopped up and blended some clips from an old movie called The Ruling Class.

227
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,760
Which is where the rebellious butler and the British Jesus come from.

228
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,800
And this episode owes a lot to Saint Mel Blanc and Saint Karl Stalling.

229
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,340
As will become obvious.

230
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,420
But first, let us exploit KPFA and Berkeley for this episode.

231
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,420


232
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,420


233
00:09:49,420 --> 00:10:00,140
A glimpse into the mysterious world of Dr. Hal Robbins, Dr. Philo Drummond, and Autentotter D. Woodman Atwell on The Puzzling Evidence Show.

234
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,000
In the world of snails and hermaphroditic worms.

235
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,160
Good now.

236
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,420
And don't forget there's the 420.

237
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,860
Worms that splash acid sperm on each other's integument.

238
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,400
Sperm that etches its way into the body.

239
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,980
And then works its way painfully through the tissues of these hermaphrodites.

240
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,780
To find and fertilize the eggs.

241
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,460
There is no passage to bring the sperm to the eggs.

242
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,920
The sperm is acid.

243
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,000
Bubbling and searing through the rubbery hides of these unfortunate annelids.

244
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,340
Then, after the requisite interval.

245
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:46,960
There you go.

246
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,800
The female leaves a clutch of glistening eggs and glides away.

247
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,500
For so it is in nature's wonderland.

248
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,820
Well, we got no closer to the address.

249
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,400
And we have no closer to the caller.

250
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,100
I can't give you the address.

251
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,100
But I can tell you that everything's coming through at typhoon volume.

252
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,960
And my earphones.

253
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,880
I can hear the earphones with an incredible blast.

254
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,760
Like heaven's cherubim horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air.

255
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:35,440
And so, also, we've recently received the award-winning CD of music composed on Xerox machines.

256
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,600
We're looking forward to playing that later.

257
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,380
And we're comfortable here with our feet put up on the end iron.

258
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,220
Ready to spend another evening.

259
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,400
In air-conditioned comfort.

260
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,660
In the city of the future.

261
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,280
Long may it rain.

262
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,200
Actually, it's not raining now.

263
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,040
An event on Adolf Hitler's birthday.

264
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,440
Yeah, that's April 20th.

265
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,240
Why would anybody assume that one date was connected to only one event?

266
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,960
Well, that's also the date of the Columbine attack.

267
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,520
Of course it is.

268
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,220
And also the date of Waco.

269
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,040
Yeah.

270
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,460
It's many days, actually.

271
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,020
It's many days.

272
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,100
It's just the day that I get my check.

273
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,560
That's all I care about, sitting here in the bunker.

274
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,460
I should get my check ten days before that.

275
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,340
Assuming that they hold it out to the 45th day.

276
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,620
I've got to hold on somehow.

277
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,620
It's also a subgenius' birthday, Reverend Joy DeVees.

278
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,420
Well, you see, it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good.

279
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,260
At least one more subgenius squeaked into the world, mewling and bawling.

280
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,720
Suicide Man, did you see the eclipse?

281
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,720
No, none of us did.

282
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,800
None of us?

283
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:06,460
I saw the toenail-y clippings in the sky, like tiny moons, each with its delicate mark.

284
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
Oh, grace, it's hard.

285
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,120
Love is my theme and it frightens them.

286
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,360
Happiness my gift and they run.

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,500
I try to tie the air in knots and make mountains out of water.

288
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,240
It's hopeless, darling.

289
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,400
That's not a word in love's lexicon.

290
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,840
We'll hear the voice of the turtle throughout the land.

291
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,140
Yes.

292
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,700
Clop, clop, clop.

293
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,680
Well, Goo Goo, that's the first time.

294
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,380
We've had crooks walk right into a paddy wagon.

295
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,440
Si, senor Gracie.

296
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,600
Service right through your door.

297
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,960
Well, genius, how you gonna talk us out of this mess?

298
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,840
Oh, I was here with my distributed gadget, what did you say?

299
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,780
Ooh, well, it tells death to the judge.

300
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,400
And X Day.

301
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,820
X Day, 10 X Day.

302
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,500
Oh, that's scary.

303
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,360
X for 10.

304
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,060
Probably not.

305
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,500
Probably what?

306
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,940
He says X Day's not going to happen.

307
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,280
Oh, it's going to happen, but it's going to happen with a slight calendric adjustment.

308
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,860
It will start later.

309
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,140
Well, yeah, we're gonna get there days early.

310
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,160
By these giant frogs here.

311
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,640
And we're gonna have our own X Day before July 5th.

312
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,440
You see the giant frogs?

313
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,500
And then we're gonna have X Day on the 5th.

314
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,100
With the frogs.

315
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,660
And then we'll have a special X Day after the 5th.

316
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,800
With these frogs from the frog pond.

317
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,280
Oh, yeah.

318
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:35,920
Oh, yeah.

319
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,060
And they make their melody all night long.

320
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,760
Sweet melody.

321
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,040
I generally like to celebrate the 4th on the 3rd with the 5th.

322
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,300
Well, I don't know whether...

323
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,780
Did you check out Findlay Lake, which is about a mile away from Sherman?

324
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,460
That I did not.

325
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,640
After all my base of operations...

326
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:53,780
Oh, it's a beautiful little lakefront town.

327
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,640
It's a beautiful little...

328
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,320
That's where these mighty ducks...

329
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
Yeah, it's a beautiful little lakefront town.

330
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,060
One must put those mighty ducks in a row.

331
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,420
Ow.

332
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,400
Oh, the mosquitoes are giant here.

333
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,660
Just gotta slap them.

334
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,180
What could that have been?

335
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,920
You know, one of the drawbacks about staying out there is it just gets so cold.

336
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,900
About staying out there?

337
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,260
Drawbacks about staying out there?

338
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,160
No, it's just gets so cold that night.

339
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,880
A drawback about staying.

340
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,920
Here it is.

341
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,320
Oh, yeah.

342
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay, what is it?

343
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,620
First for you tonight here on the show, Rocknar Spills about staying out there.

344
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,700
And what did he say?

345
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:32,200
He said that the Union chief, staying out there, got together with the bugs and left

346
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,160
their own residue on the...

347
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,160


348
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,500
On the vegetative matter as it was arranged for the...

349
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,980
They call it chyme.

350
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,220
Maximum effect.

351
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,440
Yes, an organic agglutinate.

352
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,580
Part of nature's marvelous pharmacopoeia.

353
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,120
Chyme.

354
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,360
This bug juice has been used by sages and scientists since the...

355
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,780
What the...

356
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,140
I faded out there.

357
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,000
The floor.

358
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,020
It's about time.

359
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,140
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


361
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


362
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


363
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


364
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


365
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


366
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


367
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


368
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


369
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


370
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


371
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


372
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


373
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,140


374
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,300
I'm sorry.

375
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,300


376
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,300


377
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,300


378
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,380
Yeah, it's about space.

379
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
About two guys in the strangest place.

380
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,580
Wait till they see what is inside.

381
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,520
Is it good luck?

382
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:12,780
It's about time.

383
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:12,780


384
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,980
It's about two guys in the strangest place.

385
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:22,900
As through the barrier of time they flew, past the fighting Minuteman.

386
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:32,520
Past the armored knight, past the Roman warrior to this prehistoric site.

387
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,140
Hey, you'll appreciate this.

388
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,120
I appreciate this, Dr. Howell. I found the complete collection of Captain Nice.

389
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,580
You did?

390
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:49,880
At the same time as Captain Nice was on one network, they had a similar show on the other network, just like the Munsters and the Addams Family.

391
00:16:50,160 --> 00:17:02,000
So while Captain Nice you could see on whatever it was, CBS, I think on NBC or ABC they had Mr. Terrific, which was their version of Captain Nice.

392
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,480
Nice. Don't tell those guys they left all their equipment under there.

393
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,120
Unappealing superheroes, I guess that was the idea.

394
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,580
Yeah, Captain Nice. It was like Underdog.

395
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,980
They were just nice.

396
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,220
Was it animated?

397
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,800
No, they were live action.

398
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:31,600
No, it was live action. In fact, the guy who played the voice of Kit on Knight Rider, Kit was the special robotic car.

399
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,780
Oh, I like that. David Hasselhoff.

400
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,160
This is the animated or live action?

401
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,020
This is the live action.

402
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,320
He played the voice. The guy that played Captain Nice was the voice of Kit.

403
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,800
Yes, exactly. Well, you've got to put three squares on the table, even in Hollywood.

404
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,800
It is written...

405
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,880
Relax. You never get hard like this. The sad eyes of the girl who serves me.

406
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,060
Yes, the loveliness. Young, nice looking, bright and shining. Each of us, we score and grow.

407
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,700
Yes, it was only natural. Her face had that glad look I'll always remember. Watching her feeling good.

408
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,780
She went through the motions. Joy. Many, many kisses.

409
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,100
Yes, cuddle close. Dreamy young girl. Wonderful girl who wanted nothing in the world more than a big one.

410
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,320
Nine, ten. Though she was quick, yet still they come.

411
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,160
Eating on the run. Happy pain.

412
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,960
You can forgive Charlie for being excited.

413
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,800
Yes, he didn't quite believe one who isn't safety conscious. Yet victims can only be tasted later.

414
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,760
We will not be hanged.

415
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,640
Hating the waste. Haters all of us.

416
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,360
This is Helen. Flavorless. Mrs. Jo. Helen is nevertheless 42 years of good strength and stamina.

417
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,540
Yes, this is the boy across the street.

418
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,380
Crack crack. One, two. 25,567. Hundred or a thousand. Let's get out of here.

419
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,180
Stir stir stir stir ah ah ah ah. Women want the ultimate sex and the man you love.

420
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,800
I'd like to start with a mess. Listen to this. Listen to this story. Yes, yes.

421
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,960
You know just how I'm feeling. We'd be perfect for each other. I have a reputation.

422
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,980
Just give up. Be mysterious or confusing. Problem. Why? Why?

423
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,060
Wanna have more sex? Wanna have more sex with me? What? What? What? What frequent sex? Sex?

424
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:20,020
No no no no. How? If only you would do X. You know where I'm going with all this, right?

425
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,000
No no no no. Input. Severe emotional problems. We feel what we feel and do what we do.

426
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,640
Psychological problems. Become problems. Nothing's wrong. Whatever. Everything's okay.

427
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,880
Big part of their love pie. Exacerbating. Do it. Do it. Superficial. Superficial.

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,280
He's made a spectacular breakthrough. We're in the process of making a new man.

429
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,660
I'm always on the lookout for new men.

430
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,140
Hello. Hello.

431
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,920
Going my way?

432
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,280
Uh huh.

433
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,080
Ah sure, I know. But aren't they all witches inside?

434
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,820
I'm fed up. I'm true with women.

435
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,040
Why I'll kill myself before I'll even know.

436
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,060
You look at another babe.

437
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,480
Britain?

438
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,080
Uh huh.

439
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,800
A fly blown speck in the North Sea.

440
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,040
You can't kick the natives in the back streets of France.

441
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,900
I'm not from Calcutta anymore.

442
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,560
Oh he's joking again. Aren't you my lord?

443
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm not laughing Pamela. And we can't stay here any longer.

444
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,460
Then for Christ's sake go.

445
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,640
Oh don't go for my sake.

446
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,540
Delicious. Homegrown.

447
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,460
No I bought them. I mean they go with the...

448
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,320
Ladies! I've decided to begin my second ministry at your gathering.

449
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,860
Last time I preached the word in Holy Galilee I spoke in parables.

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,480
Mistake!

451
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,040
Now I must speak plainly.

452
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,200
God is love.

453
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,640
Love?

454
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,460
Love. As water is wet, as jade is hard, as bread is life, so God is love.

455
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,000
Mrs. Pamela Treadwell, can you love?

456
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,360
Can your blood bubble, flesh melt, thighs twitch, heart burst for love?

457
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,980
Your Lordship, I'm a married woman.

458
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,040
Remember the commandment I gave you. Love one another as I love you.

459
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,640
Stay back. My husband is a master of hounds.

460
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,340
Fill your hearts that your souls dance, your eyes sparkle, be bird-happy.

461
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,260
Ow!

462
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,300
Ow!

463
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,440
Ow!

464
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,080
What is it?

465
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,740
A Watusi walking stick. Big people the Watusi.

466
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,200
Ow!

467
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,040
Ladies come back! I'll fill your bodies!

468
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,040
Ow!

469
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,200
Oh I'm awfully sorry. Have you seen my father?

470
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,660
I am the resurrection and the light!

471
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,900
We'll never make it.

472
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,460
Oh you speak English.

473
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,320
Righto. Oxford. 34.

474
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,420
Well gee Mr. Headhunter, thanks for saving us.

475
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,740
Very decent thing to do under the circumstances.

476
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,760
You can help us. We're looking for...

477
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,120
A blonde young lady perhaps. She's with us.

478
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,020
Gee, you don't seem like headhunters to me.

479
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,220
Yes. We're hunting heads right now. Cabbage heads.

480
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,200
And say that young lady showed us how to make a new dish. Guamki.

481
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,480
Guamki?

482
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,240
Yes. Stopped cabbage. Delicious, don't you know?

483
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,100
Yes.

484
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,680
Mmm. Yum. Yum. Guamki.

485
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,300
Clutch Cargo!

486
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,620
Yes Mary. We found your dad. He's okay.

487
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
Oh thank goodness. Mr. Cargo, these people have been so helpful.

488
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,080
And Miss Mary taught us how to make Guamki.

489
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,420
Oh yum yum Guamki.

490
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:08,760
Gosh Clutch, look. They're all smiling. They are friendly headhunters, aren't they?

491
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,600
Oh they are.

492
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,200
C'mon boys, we're all

493
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,780
You know Mr. Headhunter's muito

494
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,260
Nosotros somos aqui

495
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,260


496
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,060
You're gay, don't you get it?

497
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:39,220
Mr. Headhunter, I'm tired to go to the gym..

498
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,900

499
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,840

501
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,060
Bless the mealy red

505
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,860
Bless the snotty-nosed

506
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,920
giraffe. Bless

507
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,980
the buffalo. Bless

509
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,020
Bless

510
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,180

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,500
Bless the mighty cockroach.

512
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,580
Bless

513
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,380
me. Today

514
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,460
is my wedding day.

515
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,060
Obviously,

516
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,280
they did not reckon on me great

517
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,260
dinner strength.

518
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,540
Number four.

519
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,460
If

520
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,420
all else fails,

521
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,780
and it has, you must

522
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,920
utilize the gopher's love of music.

523
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,940
Music. EGAD.

524
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,020
What a boat.

525
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,920
Deformed.

526
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:33,880
What a boot.

527
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,760
Deformed.

528
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,400
Deformed.

529
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,440
Deformed.

530
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:45,160
unfinished, sent before my time into this breathing world.

531
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,740
I'm cured of fantasy obsessions, paranoid delusions, I master words.

532
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,820
I, straighten up there.

533
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,280
Am, close up with I, you horrible little word.

534
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,920
God, I am God.

535
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,160
Not the God of love, but God Almighty.

536
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,320
I massacred the Malachites and the seven nations of Canaan.

537
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:24,040
I hacked Agog to pieces and blasted the barren fig tree, for the day of vengeance is in my heart.

538
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,260
You lunar jackass. She betrayed you. Guilty, guilty, guilty.

539
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,160
The punishment is death. I've finally been processed.

540
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,200
They made me adjust to modern times.

541
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,500
This is 1888, isn't it?

542
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
Punishing the innocent?

543
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,720
Nothing. For three days there's been nothing.

544
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Because the world is evil. Wicked.

545
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:01,960
Sinful.

546
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,680
Let us pray, brethren.

547
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,700
This is the end. The end of the world.

548
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,640
I would let it. I would let it.

549
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,160
Riot and panic. Riot and panic.

550
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,720
Wait a minute.

551
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,160
Panic and terror. Terror and panic. Terror and death is man-made.

552
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,540
We've got to have martial law.

553
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,400
That's my fog.

554
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,140
Sorry, gentlemen. You'll have to excuse me.

555
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,880
I don't know.

556
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,240
What?

557
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,940
I don't know. My fog. My fog device is so constructed and so equipped, there'll be a panic.

558
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,520
A panic?

559
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,780
Deadly new gas.

560
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,300
Gas. Gas. Gas.

561
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,720
A deadly gas?

562
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,560
Yes, a deadly gas. My fog, fog machine, fog machine that will not spare a living soul.

563
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,400
Soul. Soul.

564
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,800
Panic.

565
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,500
I believe your story. I'm forced to believe it.

566
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,920
Start releasing the deadly gas.

567
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,220
Unknown. Unseen.

568
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,260
Poison gas.

569
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,000
Poison gas.

570
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,860
Yes. Panic.

571
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,780
Yes, Doctor.

572
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,760
What are you going to do?

573
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,420
You... you're going to release the gas? Insane.

574
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,880
No. But...

575
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,540
I believe the

576
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:06,760
The gas was killed.

577
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,580
Wait.

578
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,120
Panic terror and death.

579
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,060
I'm so sorry.

580
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,940
I'm sorry.

581
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:16,940
I'm so sorry.

582
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,040
I'm so sorry.

583
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,760
I'm so sorry.

584
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,400
I'm so sorry.

585
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,700
Later, Pierce makes another appeal.

586
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,580
Yeah, that's why I need some slack.

587
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,960
Yeah, I need some slack.

588
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,580
As it turns out, Pierce has not needed any slack.

589
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,840
Oh, I thought I heard something drop around here.

590
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,400
No.

591
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,740
Maybe somebody fell down and broke that wood.

592
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:18,800
I don't know.

593
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,360
Pierce's dad.

594
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,320
Pierce's dad.

595
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,040
Pierce's dad.

596
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,900
On Wall Street, 312-512-465-8645-338-442.

597
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,540
This is PR News.

598
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,160
Israeli media report that Bob's expecting pig pictures from Mexico City.

599
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,380
Bob could come the same day.

600
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,540
The first blast occurred when Bob spent in a bag placed among the stalls at Camp David, Maryland, with caution.

601
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,980
According to drug gangs,

602
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,480
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins debate

603
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,940
on PR reports, but only 6% expect PR news in Washington.

604
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,640
PR comes from oatmeal.

605
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,960
You gurneys don't draw the line at murder.

606
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,300
Upper class extramant!

607
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,260
You want to do me dirt?

608
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,720
That's because I know too much.

609
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,600
I know that 1% of the population owns half the property in this country.

610
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,740
And that vomity 1% wants kosher killing.

611
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,420
And up so the blue blood drains out slow and easy.

612
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,020
So comrades, come ready.

613
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,000
And the last fight, let us face.

614
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:19,460
And the last fight, let us face.

615
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,860
The international army unites the human race.

616
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,880
I'm only a strolling vagabond.

617
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,160
So goodnight pretty maiden.

618
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,980
That's what I've always said.

619
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,420
You can't give the working class money.

620
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,340
And now the battle continues, the civil war between the big Indians and the little Indians.

621
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,160
I'm on the wrong side of what's going on.

622
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:49,380
It all started when the emperor of Lilliput,

623
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:49,460
I'm on the wrong side of what's going on.

624
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,160
cut his finger on an egg shell.

625
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,800
When opening the egg,

626
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,420
from the large end.

627
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,040
He made a decree that from henceforth all eggs should be opened at the small end.

628
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,440
But the big Indians of Lefkoskiu rebelled.

629
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,960
Jerry Anderson Studios junk.

630
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,900
Planet Patrol, I think, was something else.

631
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,920
And no, it's said that perhaps no copies of that one exist anywhere.

632
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,800
Travels all land around the sea.

633
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,940
And it can journey anywhere.

634
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,540
It was my favorite.

635
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,220
Supercar.

636
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,260
It had Captain Larry Dart in charge of the spaceship.

637
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,120
And the Venusian who was like Spock.

638
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,620
Yeah.

639
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,160
And a big Martian who loved to eat and was very funny.

640
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,760
Yeah.

641
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,140
Like the thing, you know.

642
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,440
Yeah.

643
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,300
And they would run around and help the universe.

644
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:46,860
Face sign name.

645
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,840
Yeah.

646
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,300
Just little string people.

647
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,640
Don't forget.

648
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,340
Oh, here we have fresh from Robert Dobbs.

649
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,880
Seven foolproof alibis to calm the wife.

650
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,420
Have the courage to look the little woman straight in the eye with the...

651
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,960
And utter the boldest of floppers.

652
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,560
There are only so many lines you can feed the little woman.

653
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,740
The trick is to make them convincing.

654
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,700
Here's a happy expert who tells you how.

655
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,780
Can you go out with the boys any night you please?

656
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,800
Does your wife understandably allow you to beg out of boring social events in favor of

657
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,540
the poker table?

658
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,160
Or any other evening entertainment you may really have in mind?

659
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,640
Do you have a wealth of excuses with getting out of your home sweet home?

660
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:46,480
Well, here's seven foolproof alibis composed by your favorite guru, Robert J.R.

661
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:46,740
Bob.

662
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:46,840


663
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:46,840


664
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:46,840


665
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:46,960
Hiya Bob.

666
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,080
See what else I found.

667
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,000
And here they are.

668
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,340
Number one, honey, I am working late at the office.

669
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Number two, honey I've got to get the wife the car repaired.

670
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,260
Not the wife the little Freudist.

671
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:03,420
Yeah.

672
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,200
The wife repaired.

673
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:04,560
Yeah.

674
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:04,740
Yeah.

675
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,180
Honey, I'll be working out at the Y tonight.

676
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,900
Honey.

677
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,920
I'll be out with the boys.

678
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,600
We're starting a camera club.

679
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,300
Honey.

680
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,820
I have a sick friend.

681
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:16,820


682
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:16,820


683
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:16,820


684
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:16,820


685
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,320
and I have a duty to nurse them back to health.

686
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,520
I'll be working late tonight to make some extra dough.

687
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,560
And don't forget, I'll be spending the afternoon at the races.

688
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,020
Well, that would convince anyone, I would think.

689
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,960
A special significance for me. I like that last one.

690
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,680
Yeah, you work at the racetrack, don't you, Governor?

691
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,000
You know, what would help is the seven-bladed windbreaker,

692
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,600
and you put each of these excuses on each blade of the windbreaker.

693
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,220
So as the wind catches them, they spin like hypnotic little discs.

694
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,100
And the wind breaks?

695
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,440
Yeah, as the wind breaks, and they spin their magic on any woman of your choice.

696
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,860
And you don't even have to worry about which blade comes up.

697
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,280
Right.

698
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,700
They're all equally valuable.

699
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,460
That's right.

700
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,660
I hope that someone didn't imply, that I didn't imply,

701
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:23,280
that there was an order of importance or a priority in those seven famous excuses of Dobbs.

702
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,720
Now you see the importance of the seven-bladed windbreaker.

703
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,160
It has a way of dispelling any concept of priority

704
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,060
and puts it back in the world or realm of randomness, where it belongs.

705
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,860
Where it was said, behold, the river of pee.

706
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
It is dirty because it accepts everything.

707
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,860
Look closely and you will see.

708
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,460
An old broken wheel floating by.

709
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,140
The wheel of karma.

710
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,180
That thing almost hit me.

711
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,500
Damn it.

712
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,640
Damn it.

713
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,380
I'm not gonna lie to you.

714
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,240
Hansel?

715
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,220
Hansel?

716
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,620
Hansel?

717
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,420
Hansel?

718
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,620
Hansel.

719
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,660
Mr. Sarge, Super Sarge, whoopity-doo.

720
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,040
Your boss in the wakes.

721
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,280
Now take over, snafu.

722
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,160
Important announcement.

723
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,480
Attention, each tent.

724
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,860
This camp is now run under new management.

725
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,540
Relaxation.

726
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,960
More money.

727
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,760
These are my aims.

728
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,660
The new management.

729
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,780
No GI issue.

730
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,740
Each guy gets two things.

731
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,320
Yay!

732
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,940
Parade for snafu gives us all limousines.

733
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,480
No more drill, no salutes.

734
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,420
No more cleaning latrines.

735
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,740
Look me over, Jackson.

736
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,040
This is really all root.

737
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,380
Snafu lets you dress up in a suit that is zoot.

738
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,720
And you can't even get a good look.

739
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,280
Ain't this swell?

740
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,440
I fixed things.

741
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,700
I told you I could.

742
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,800
What a camp.

743
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,780
No more discipline.

744
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
Boy, am I good.

745
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,380
I beg pardon, sir, but you hear all that humming?

746
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,480
I got a suspicion.

747
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,940
The joymans are coming!

748
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,360
The joymans?

749
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,160
The joymans?

750
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,400
All right, them poops.

751
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,940
Let me at them joymans.

752
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,960
Say, where are my troops?

753
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,760
Troops!

754
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,660
Troops!

755
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:45,660

00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:45,660

768
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,880
No use, they ain't trained and they got no morale.

779
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,020
Time to take a look at what's happening across the country.

780
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:04,460
We want you to be aware of northeastern Texas moving along Interstate 40 until 10 p.m. tonight.

781
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:14,300
We also want to mention that we've got Wisconsin stretching from northern Louisiana through Missouri just to the west of Milwaukee.

782
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:19,440
Also through tonight, southeastern Texas staying above Louisiana.

783
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:28,240
And as we head further into the northwest, we've got Idaho just off the coast of the Carolinas coming up on Washington.

784
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,640
We'll explain.

785
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:40,680
My lords, I had doubts about speaking here, but after what I've heard, I realize this is where I belong.

786
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:55,620
My lords, these are grave times, killing times, stars collapse, universes shrink daily, but the natural order is still crime, guilt, punishment.

787
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,060
There's no love without fear.

788
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:14,180
By his hand, sword, pike, and grappling hook, God, the crowbar of the world, flays, stabs, bludgeons, mutilates.

789
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,280
Just as I was.

790
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:28,220
You have forgotten how to punish my noble lords.

791
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,160
The strong must manipulate the weak.

792
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,700
That's the first law of the universe.

793
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,940
The hard survive.

794
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,800
The soft quickly turn to corruption.

795
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,020


796
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,900
This.

797
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,880
Is a call to greatness.

798
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,280
Approach this day unto battle against your enemies.

799
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,280
Let not your hearts faint.

800
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,040
Fear not and do not tremble.

801
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,440
Neither be ye terrified because of them.

802
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,520
For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you.

803
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,040
And mine eyes shall not spare, neither will I have pity.

804
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,020
I will recompense them according to their ways.

805
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,700
And their abominations that are in the midst of them.

806
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,160
And they shall know that I am the Lord that smite them.

807
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,960
You're one of us at last.

808
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,100
Well done, Jack.

809
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,860
Come, all you Christian soldiers, marching as to war.

810
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,860
With the cross of Jesus.

811
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,740
Glory for before.

812
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,560
Ah, your mother rides a vacuum cleaner.

813
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,580
Truth is fiction.

814
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,860
And this is the Orbit Genoc.

815
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,560
An empty gallon can will hold one gallon of water.

816
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:13,800
Yet when the same can is converted to a side view likeness of a human face, it will increase its capacity to six gallons of ammonia gas.

817
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,280
And that's the truth.

818
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,700
The natives declared that the miraculous profile was that of King Alfonso the 11th.

819
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,300
The Orbit Linnat.

820
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,120
In a moment I'll tell you how a stroke of lightning struck Salamanca, Spain.

821
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,880
It was designed to conform to the exact size and shape of the base of the great lightning.

822
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,580
The Orbit Linnat.

823
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:39,280
The Hill of the Bells in Hermosillo, Mexico produces Warren Hastings, the great empire builder and first governor general of British India.

824
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,000
During 41 years of married life, he never wavered in his love of gold.

825
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,940
It's caused by gas escaping from the most seductive murderers in the annals of justice.

826
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,680
The Orbit Linnat.

827
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:58,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm strewn along a southbound stretch of Interstate 85 this morning.

828
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,080
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it might take hours before the road was to be reopened to traffic.

829
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,720
He faces up to 40 years in prison.

830
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:12,100
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected to take part in a joint

831
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,000
on Wall Street 12-2-3-2-4-4.

832
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,180
Authorities said this is PR News in Washington.

833
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,480
Okay, what other questions? There's got to be something serious.

834
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,240
Oh yes, the little girl in the back.

835
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,700
You know the dinosaurs that you were showing me a picture of that your friend grew,

836
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,680
is that one of the ones that ate the 40 foot peyote plant?

837
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,460
No, that was a seismosaurus. The one that ate the peyote plant was called Vomit Ultrasaurus.

838
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,980
You really don't want a vomit Ultrasaurus at your party.

839
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,640
That's all they do is vomit.

840
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,180
And just the shinbone of an Ultrasaurus is higher than this room.

841
00:42:53,300 --> 00:43:00,460
They were really big. The dinosaurs that I was taught about as a kid were midgets compared to what they've found since then.

842
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,720
Tyrannosaurus is no longer the biggest meat eater.

843
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,100
There were much bigger, there was a type of Allosaur that was actually called Gigantosaurus.

844
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,180
I learned that from Hal's book.

845
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,620
It was bigger than a Tyrannosaurus. Probably more foul tempered.

846
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:23,980
Although some people say that the Tyrannosaurus wasn't all that fierce, but was more like a buzzard and a scavenger that ate dead things.

847
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,600
And in dinosaur land, there's lots of dead things.

848
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,000
God, I love dinosaurs.

849
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,100
Now see, if I was going to go back to nature, I'd seriously think about the late Cretaceous.

850
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,300
Any other dinosaur related questions?

851
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,040
Spell effects?

852
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,180
I'm an amateur special effects expert.

853
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,940
How does King Kong come into the picture of these dinosaurs?

854
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:56,360
Oh, well now in the movie King Kong, that island was so remote that it had not been affected by the cataclysm that wiped out the dinosaurs.

855
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,040
So they had continued to evolve.

856
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,400
And also apes had evolved.

857
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:06,040
There was a giant ape called Gigantopithecus.

858
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,840
We know perfectly well that's what a Sasquatch is or a Yeti.

859
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,480
But there really was.

860
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:19,900
I mean, you can go to the Cleveland Natural History Museum and there's a jawbone of a Gigantopithecus that's like this long.

861
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,080
And there's a gorilla skeleton next to it to give you an idea how big this thing was.

862
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,780
It must have been at least 12 feet tall.

863
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,180
But it was a gentle giant.

864
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,720
You can tell by its teeth that it sat on its butt eating bamboo all day long.

865
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,720
It was probably really, really fat.

866
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,420
They lived in Java.

867
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:52,140
And King Kong, Skull Island as we know from history, before it sank, was just southwest of Subantra.

868
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,980
Any other questions?

869
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,900
What's the significance of the Dunkleosteus from the Hegonian era?

870
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,160
Oh, he heard the Hour of Slack show about the Dunkleosteus?

871
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,460
Yeah.

872
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,600
Well, the significance is...

873
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,980
It has a funny name.

874
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,160
I've seen the skull.

875
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,060
Oh, you have seen the skull.

876
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,420
Nasty looking thing, isn't it?

877
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,080
Yeah, it's that big across.

878
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,660
It was an armored fish.

879
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,440
Shortly after fish came up with the idea of backbones, they became armored.

880
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:36,520
And the Dunkleosteus has that funny name because he was discovered by Professor Dunkle of the Cleveland Natural History Museum.

881
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,580
Dunkle means dark and shiny.

882
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,260
Really?

883
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,380
Well...

884
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:48,560
And it was from the Devonian period, which is, as you thought, named after the band D.Va.

885
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:56,800
I do not have a giant gorilla fetish, my friends.

886
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,500
I do have a lost prehistoric monster fetish.

887
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:07,020
And also, I've lately been studying some science books about the flora and fauna of Skull Island.

888
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,580
Now, I'm not sure if I'm right or wrong.

889
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:14,540
It's kind of a depressing hobby because Skull Island vanished beneath the waves in 1948.

890
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,800
And the only remains besides photographs are kept locked up in the Smithsonian.

891
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:28,240
Those being the bones of the unfortunate Megaprimatus cong, the very last of that species, it turned out,

892
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,460
that was foolishly exhibited and then killed in New York in 1933.

893
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:38,560
Now, I will admit to being sexually attracted to the face of the planet.

894
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,340
I'm not a big fan of the fake movie character King Kong in the 2005 film of that title,

895
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,780
but I know perfectly well that it's just an uncannily real-looking CGI replica.

896
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:54,500
I'll never get to see a live Megaprimatus cong.

897
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,060
I had to face that fact about dinosaurs and congs when I was little.

898
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,760
I'll probably never live to see a live Martian either.

899
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:08,040
At least I got to see a few stuffed ones in the museums before the cover-up.

900
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:14,300
No, I'll never get to see any of the evolved dinosaurs or insects of Skull Island,

901
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,440
except in jerky old movies and grainy black and white photos.

902
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,280
I wish I could blame it on man's greed or global warming or something,

903
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:31,320
but I know perfectly well that the very thing that allowed the creatures there to survive the nuclear winter that killed the dinosaurs,

904
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,940
that is, the volcanic vents that kept the island shrouded in fog,

905
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:43,040
were the selfsame geological features that inevitably led to its collapse back into the sea.

906
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,680
It's a shame that more samples weren't gathered during the expedition,

907
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,600
but those few explorers who escaped with their lives were very lucky to get away with that much.

908
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:59,840
Of particular interest to me would be the plant or fish glandulars or whatever it was

909
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,860
that gave the human Skull Island natives the will to survive

910
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,920
on their lifeless corner of the ocean.

911
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,380
The Skull Island is a very mysterious place.

912
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:14,400
Some evidence indicates that they were dependent on this powerful but mysterious drug.

913
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,760
Now, even if I'm not a true Kong sexual, I'll admit I like gorillas and other great apes.

914
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,900
It runs in the family.

915
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:30,080
My maternal grandfather decorated his house in the West Indies with sculptures and paintings of apes

916
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,040
to the extent that it was called Apes Place all over St. Martin.

917
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,920
The Apes Place is a place where you can find the most mysterious creatures in the world.

918
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:42,460
It's the island in the Netherland Antilles where we visited Mamu and Papu a few times in my youth

919
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:49,760
and I have fond memories of caressing the three-foot-tall marble gorilla statue he kept on his front porch.

920
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,620
I wonder if it's still there.

921
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:59,860
Unfortunately, after Papu died, Mamu sold the house to the famous crappy artist Jasper Johns.

922
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,720
And I...I've been back to the house since Johns bought it,

923
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,860
but he's erected a fence,

924
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:09,600
and I couldn't see much over the top of it before the native guards chased me away.

925
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,260
Anyway, friends.

926
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:18,920
Anyway, you can quit it with the Stan Gorilla fetish gags, okay?

927
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,380
You are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

928
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:31,700
And this music in the background was, uh, it's by Estrada Sphere.

929
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,680
Yes, that's the name of the band, Estrada Sphere.

930
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,140
And the album is called Palace of Something.

931
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,800
I'll have to take it out of the CD player to tell you the title,

932
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:52,580
because it's a homemade CD sent to me by Popes Pantiera Ivakovich,

933
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:58,440
who will certainly be at X Day, uh, X Day, X Day, 10X Day coming up.

934
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,580
Okay, well, the music ended. Now we can look.

935
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,340
Palace of Mirrors, Estrada Sphere.

936
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,280
How about that?

937
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,920
Wonderful, interesting, instrumental music.

938
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,640
Don't know what else to tell you about it.

939
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,800
Estrada Sphere, with an E.

940
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,280
Estrada Sphere.

941
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:24,820
Ew.

942
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:25,680
Ew.

943
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,240
Yes, it's an acquired taste.

944
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,500
Yeah, I mean, but once you're into it, it's like, you know, rubber.

945
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:31,620
Rubber.

946
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,860
Yeah, I can't wait to get home to my little wife.

947
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,140
In your little rubber suit.

948
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,980
Get her in that Brontosaurus suit.

949
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,840
I'll be the Tyrannosaurus.

950
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,660
We'll deck it out.

951
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,160
Blair.

952
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,760
And I finally got the boredom detector working again.

953
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,080
Yeah, oh, okay, there we go.

954
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,780
Let's move up on that.

955
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,240
My God, it's in the red.

956
00:50:59,500 --> 00:50:59,940
It's in the red.

957
00:50:59,940 --> 00:50:59,940


958
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,660
Oh, it's gone off.

959
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,340
It's gone off.

960
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,340
It's turned on for ya.

961
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,860
It's gone off.

962
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,900
Yeah, we switched right over into the flat zone.

963
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,060
That's pretty close to the mediocre range.

964
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,840
Oh, there we go.

965
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,980
It's building back up towards punk.

966
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,680
There it goes, right past anti-music.

967
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:29,920
Oh, there we go.

968
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,760
Oh, there we go.

969
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,100
It's really getting to me.

970
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:35,520
I'm not even gonna lie.

971
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,120
I'm not even gonna lie.

972
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,560
It's doing it on the right side.

973
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,740
Did you get that?

974
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,740


975
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,740


976
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,740


977
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,740


978
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,740


979
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,740


980
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,740


981
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,740


982
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,980
I think we've got it.

983
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:39,980


984
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,100
I think he's broken.

985
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,260
Well, there it went.

986
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,280
He blew out the boredom detector.

987
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,040
Crack the whip, man.

988
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,080
Crack the whip.

989
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,900
Have you ever thought of this?

990
00:51:59,900 --> 00:51:59,900


991
00:51:59,900 --> 00:51:59,900


992
00:51:59,900 --> 00:51:59,900


993
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:09,120
Have you ever thought about what it would have been like to have been a person somewhere in the past, but not here?

994
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:14,660
But you might have been like a person somewhere in the past.

995
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,120
Sure, you could be in Rome.

996
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,760
Could be in Rome.

997
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,880
Could be in Troy.

998
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,960
Could be in Terra del Fuego.

999
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,920
You could have been just a, you know, like a tail sniffing.

1000
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,120
But so what?

1001
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,400
What? Have you ever thought of, did you ever think about that?

1002
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,700
Well, I was just wondering, I just want to know.

1003
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,300
I thought about it.

1004
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,240
Yeah, I have too.

1005
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:42,840
You know, I thought about, you know, maybe being reincarnated from somebody who lived in Rome.

1006
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,580
This guy from Kentucky can talk on our show and say he thought about it too.

1007
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,240
But I was going to say Tredny Chisholm.

1008
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,160
Tredny Chisholm.

1009
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,840
Okay, there, I said it.

1010
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,520
Well, now you have, and what are you going to make of it anyway, Tredny Chisholm?

1011
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,820
Nothing, I'm just going to throw it out there and let the historians of the show figure out what I just said.

1012
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,940
Well, they'll have to go.

1013
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:58,100
I don't know.

1014
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,720
I don't know what you said.

1015
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,780
Of course you do.

1016
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,380
To get to the bottom of the Tredny Chisholm.

1017
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,920
You really said that God's testicles were his eyes.

1018
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,080
Ah, man.

1019
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,360
That's a complete misreading of the seventh sacred scroll.

1020
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,940
Well, so what's your point?

1021
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,960
So what's your point?

1022
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,480
Aren't we supposed to misread them?

1023
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:25,000
How many miles of blood vessels are there in an average testicle?

1024
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,460
Here we go again.

1025
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,940
You've got to walk.

1026
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,100
Walk that lonesome valley.

1027
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,220
You've got to blow those brainwaves right out the sky.

1028
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,260
No one can do it for you.

1029
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,260
Loud, Philo.

1030
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,200
But it's a metaphor, right?

1031
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,940
It's a metaphor for a thing that sounds like something else.

1032
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,300
But it's not what I metaphor.

1033
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:46,420
If God's eyes are his testicles, then how many miles of blood vessels are there in it?

1034
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,660
No, those are eyes.

1035
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:53,340
Somewhere between the amount of smoke in his pipe.

1036
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,040
I mean, you would say, how many puffs are in Bob's pipe?

1037
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,540
You might say that same thing.

1038
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:58,940
Let's look.

1039
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,980
Bum-diddly, bum-diddly, bim-diddly, bum-diddly, bum-diddly.

1040
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,720
Same as before.

1041
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,200
See, it's exactly what I thought.

1042
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,000
It's the same exact same amount as before.

1043
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,140
And just here we are.

1044
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:17,920
We're arriving in front of Jayner's Pro Shop where we'll select our new golf clubs.

1045
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,600
Yes, but I just want to say...

1046
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,460
No.

1047
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,400
Did you bring the, did you bring your allowance this time?

1048
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,940
I'm not sure we should interfere with the ceremony.

1049
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,460
There's no ceremony going on.

1050
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,420
It's just the Pro Shop.

1051
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,920
Well, let's not stand on ceremony.

1052
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,700
Select some new spikes.

1053
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,940
I'd like you to meet a very good friend of mine.

1054
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,320
Look.

1055
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,740
This here is, well, this is Governor Rocknard.

1056
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,360
It is.

1057
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,040
This is Dr. Philo Drummond.

1058
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,520
The guy I was telling you about.

1059
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,120
Did you drive?

1060
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,340
Yeah, I'm driving today.

1061
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,600
Driving at the Pro Shop.

1062
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,500
What are you using?

1063
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,140
Are you using your driver?

1064
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,500
Are you using like maybe a three wood or a five wood?

1065
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,780
You're using a wood, right?

1066
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,240
You can play through, gentlemen.

1067
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,480
The masher.

1068
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:56,920
The masher.

1069
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,340
You're using your masher to drive with?

1070
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,600
Masher.

1071
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,940
Call the police, someone.

1072
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:01,980
That's excellent.

1073
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:02,180
Why not?

1074
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,020
It's high up, you know.

1075
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,680
I think you should grill the Connor.

1076
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,400
Oh, he's high up now.

1077
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,600
And before you do that, wander off down the hill with your masher.

1078
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,980
Use a niblet on the green.

1079
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:19,220
Same as before, but I know that within the regular loft, as it were...

1080
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:19,740
A birdie.

1081
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:24,360
There's a continuous love picnic on the ninth hole.

1082
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,360
On the love picnic.

1083
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,700
What is it about par four?

1084
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,280
Below par, I would say.

1085
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,000
Below par.

1086
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,360
Okay, well, I'm taking my stand.

1087
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,980
That's right, take a stand.

1088
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,660
Can you say, meh-meh?

1089
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,900
It's been a while since I've driven.

1090
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,400
You know, I've got to get out and play golf more often.

1091
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,860
In San Antonio, he took a stand.

1092
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,460
It was a taco stand.

1093
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,300
He left a trail of taco chips all the way to the Rio Grande.

1094
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,620
And four.

1095
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,480
Wow.

1096
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:56,920
That's a good one.

1097
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1098
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1099
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1100
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1101
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1102
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1103
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1104
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1105
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1106
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,920


1107
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,960
No stop signs.

1108
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,820
Speed limit.

1109
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,700
Nobody's gonna slow me down.

1110
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,820
Like a wheel.

1111
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,060
Gonna spin it.

1112
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,980
Nobody's gonna mess me round.

1113
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,140
Hey Satan.

1114
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,300
Paying my dues.

1115
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,200
Playing in a rocking band.

1116
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,280
Hey Mama.

1117
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,320
Look at me.

1118
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,480
I'm on my way to the promised land.

1119
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,760
I'm on the high way to hell.

1120
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,780
High way to hell.

1121
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,940
High way to hell.

1122
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,940
High way to hell.

1123
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:48,900
And it's swell.

1124
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,040
I'm going down.

1125
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,260
All the way.

1126
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:54,780
All the way down.

1127
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,080
Yeah.

1128
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,920
I'm on the high way to hell.

1129
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,820
High way to hell.

1130
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,960
High way to hell.

1131
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,300
And it's swell.

1132
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:24,300


1133
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,580
Yeah.

1134
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:25,720
Yeah.

1135
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:25,840
Yeah.

1136
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,040
I'm on the high way to hell.

1137
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:31,160
High way to hell.

1138
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,300
High way to hell.

1139
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,480
High way to hell.

1140
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,180
Don't stop me

1141
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,380
I'm going down

1142
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,140
All the way down

1143
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,500
Yeah

1144
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,700
Yeah

1145
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,020
I'm on the highway to hell

1146
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,360
And back

1147
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:33,620
Yeah

1148
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,060
Yeah

1149
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,860
Yeah

1150
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah

1151
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,180
Yeah

1152
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah

1153
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,000


1154
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,000


1155
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,000


1156
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,000


1157
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,000


1158
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,000


1159
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,760
The Zoological Society

1160
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,440
One minute's silence, please.

1161
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,420
What for?

1162
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,200
For all the dead books of World War I.

1163
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,420
for Mr. Moto, the Cisco kid, and me.

1164
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,200
Muffle the drums.

1165
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,640
Silence.

1166
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:39,460
Shh!
