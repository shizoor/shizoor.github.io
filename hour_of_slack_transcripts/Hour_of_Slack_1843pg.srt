00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,660
communication section Washington low alert on Sierra case standby low alert

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,580
vital information coming through standby

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,820
actually Steve Rogers got kicked off the air for saying

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:35,900
but I think it was listeners that are not letting him say on the air

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,160
that's gonna be a whole bunch of

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,500
meep meep meep meep meep

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,860
that'll be the good part when you hear the meep meeps

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,580
oh

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,620
oh

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,780
beat me to a pulp and I'm

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,860
praying for some

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,700
pain

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,760
I ain't got religion

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,960
I got a damaged brain

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,320
and if I had a dollar

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,400
for every looking that I took

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,000
I'd

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,280
buy the pulpit back again

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
and write a dirty book

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,440
oh

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,620
beat me to a pulp

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,460
and I'm praying for some pain

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,220
beat me to a pulp

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,060
and I'm praying for some pain

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,700
oh

26
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,720
I ain't got religion

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,700
I got a damaged brain

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,340
I ain't got religion

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,440
I got a damaged brain

30
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,280
that was lonesome cowboy Dave some years ago friends

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,900
he hasn't been on the show for a while except in reruns

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,740
because he's old been sick

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,300
and his lifestyle changed drastically

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,680
but he's still David and he's going to be on the show for a while next week

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,680


36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,820
and we did a show by phone just like in the good old days of 2020

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,100
also all of the songs in this show are by Dave performed with Einstein's secret orchestra

38
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,660
with Dave singing and playing guitar in all cases

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,380
this show is recorded August 9th

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
is lonesome cowboy Dave still alive?

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,000
I wonder

42
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,340
let's call him and find out

43
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,520
I hope

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,280
Dave

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,280


46
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,480
well I called

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,120
so you beat me to it

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,440
that's right I beat you to the pulpit

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,480
beat you to the pulpit

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,540
you're praying for some pain

51
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,300
after you went insane

52
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,740
well should

53
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,220
start drilling in the microphone right now

54
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,480
yeah that's part of your

55
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,700
messed up brain

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,840
I'll beat you to a pulpit

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,320
after you go insane

58
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,400
it's not your dirty

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,500
morals it's just your messed up brain

60
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,320
see that's it I made up a Dave type song

61
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,120
well that's that's that's delicious

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,240
it's like the little slices that

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
they have at the Hungarian store

64
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,060
of sliced up cow brains

65
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,880
or lamb brains I guess

66
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,660
it's like real thin

67
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,200
looks almost like sushi and you can wear it as a hat

68
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,960
well Dave Dave brains

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,260
is what I was going for

70
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,200
Dave brains

71
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,880
that's that's different you can't wear a hat to that

72
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,180
the hat is already provided but

73
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
in a different color and fashion

74
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,500
some some people say it's too ludicrous to be to be held

75
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,500
well how's your hat Dave

76
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,340
well I got some rain in the soup

77
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,460
I had to take the potatoes out

78
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,060
it was mashed up pretty good in there

79
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,580
I froze up some cinnamon stick

80
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,740
and gave it to my grandmother

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,260
she showed me how to do the rest of it

82
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,320
so I guess I could say it's all right

83
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,880
cool man cool

84
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,880
I mean it's cool sometimes

85
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,460
it's hot here it's so hot

86
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,900
I don't want to go anywhere near the doorway or the airlock

87
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,800
yeah it's it's 90 something here

88
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,560
but it's 90 something humidity too

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,860
it's just making people just pass out like birds on a telephone wire

90
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,660
yep yep that's why I'm in here

91
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,500
calling lonesome cowboy Dave on the phone

92
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,100
well you have you have actual

93
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,960
uh sedentary breakfast don't you

94
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,160
right now

95
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,060
I mean uh air conditioning

96
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,160
yeah yeah we yeah yeah our airlock is still functional

97
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,840
that's good

98
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,100
yeah I had to repair it a lot

99
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,840
with snot and scotch tape and stuff you know

100
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,500
they normally work pretty good

101
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,680
scott scott and snot tapes

102
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,180
but yeah

103
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,020
I'm sorry I was just gonna say I was wondering

104
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,000
for instance

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,940
sissue our doe had her gums removed or something

106
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,700
she said she's had a hard time finding things

107
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,880
because they put some articles in there that something I don't know

108
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,400
yeah she did she had her gums removed today

109
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,540
in fact she's still not home yet from the uh dental mental hospital

110
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,800
ah

111
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,700
yeah she had she had gum all over her hair

112
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,120
and you know just stuck in every little crevice

113
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:25,980
oh yeah yeah she had she had gum all over her hair and you know just stuck in every little crevice

114
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,480
And so she had to go get her gums removed.

115
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,640
But they did it with lasers.

116
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,920
They do it with lasers now.

117
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,700
They don't have to surgically peel it all, scrape it off with scalpels and peel your skin off and everything.

118
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,080
They just shoot a laser at you.

119
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,740
It still peels your skin off, but they don't have to use a knife.

120
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,720
It's easier for them.

121
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,940
It doesn't make it easier for the patient.

122
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,120
Oh, no, of course not.

123
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,780
But it's easier for the insurance company and the nurses and stuff.

124
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:09,860
I noticed when you go in the dentist's office, everybody has to wear a face mask except you, the patient, or me, the patient.

125
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:22,600
And it's not fair because there's all these pretty dental assistant ladies that you want to be able to recognize them in the supermarket later.

126
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,960
But you won't because they're...

127
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,700
They have masks on, but they can recognize me.

128
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,060
Except that when I go to the supermarket, I still wear a mask.

129
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,480
Even now.

130
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:42,400
Even today with the Lambda Delta Beta virus going around, I still wear the mask.

131
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,080
Yeah, I thought that was a fraternity when I first heard about it.

132
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,560
I mainly do it just to tick off the others.

133
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,600
I'll refrain from using the term ignorant.

134
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm not going to use the term ignorant.

135
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:57,720


136
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:57,720


137
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,880
Don't do that because...

138
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:10,560
Well, do do that because it'll make it much easier later to recognize the bodies when they're trying to, you know, get the motorcycles going again.

139
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,580
Yeah, I know.

140
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:25,960
I don't think many of these women who have to wear a mask wouldn't want you to see them drooling in their pants or their heart pickle or their, you know, suitable escapes of whatever kind they have.

141
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:25,960


142
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,100
I...

143
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,260
You know, I hadn't really thought about that.

144
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:37,580
I guess that just like those pretty ladies, I could drool all I wanted behind my mask and nobody would be the wiser or the wetter.

145
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,780
Yeah.

146
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,960
I retroverted mine.

147
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,880
I put like a bunch of fur on it.

148
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,780
Pasted some fur on there.

149
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,080
It's like a portable beard and mask.

150
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,900
It works both ways.

151
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,900
That's what I...

152
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,500
Because I've been feeling kind of funny.

153
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,320
You know, I have this goatee.

154
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,760
And the mask doesn't quite cover it.

155
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,940
And I figured, well, the germs are crawling in through the hairs underneath the mask.

156
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:09,780
And if I glued more hair onto the inside of the mask, that would form a sort of a baleen type of barrier.

157
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,960
Yeah, and then you would know...

158
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,280
To keep the bad germs out, but I could still eat the good germs.

159
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,120
Yeah.

160
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,320
That I live on, the phytoplankton, if there's any left after this heat wave in the ocean.

161
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,400
So you think it's going to kill the phytoplankton in the oceans?

162
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:25,960
It's going to kill...

163
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,640
They've announced that they've already done the funerals.

164
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:39,060
Billions and billions of tiny funerals have already been enacted because all the microbes in the ocean are...

165
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:45,300
They died yesterday, and now the slightly larger krill are hungry.

166
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,060
And then the fish and whales are going to get hungry.

167
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,780
And then pretty soon the fishermen are going to get hungry.

168
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,940
And then the land...

169
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,120
Lubbers will have to spend a lot more for a can of tuna fish with dolphin in it.

170
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,880
Yeah.

171
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,740
And, you know, I'm glad that we're both so old that...

172
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,540
Well, actually, you know, the funny thing is I thought that I was going to die before the planet did, but now I'm not so sure.

173
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,740
It's...

174
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,040
Yep.

175
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,100
It's the snowballs kind of rolling through hell all over again.

176
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,900
Melting fast.

177
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,260
Yeah.

178
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,560
I was wondering when the calling hours are going to be.

179
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,240
All right.

180
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,880
Or if anybody's going to call.

181
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,220
I'm going to call them anyway.

182
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,580
Well, the Lord's going to call us all home.

183
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,460
To call them be.

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,560
I just want to...

185
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,860
I was hoping to avoid seeing the whole rest of the ecosystem get called home at the same time.

186
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,140
Yeah, that's going to be another very pretty sight, I'm afraid.

187
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,200
Right.

188
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,940
I was thinking, well, too bad about my grandsons and possibly my children.

189
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,700
But now I'm starting to go, damn.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,520
I'm...

191
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:55,940
I'm...

192
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,380
I'm probably going to live to see that stuff.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,620
Darn it.

194
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,200
What they're probably going to do is a retrofusion on the last 500 years.

195
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,840
And you know they're going to charge...

196
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,500
They're going to charge double for tickets.

197
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,740
Oh, amazing.

198
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah, to watch yourself die.

199
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,280
Because that's the way them are.

200
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,420
That's they for you.

201
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,680
Thame.

202
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,340
Yeah, that's...

203
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,600
Thame.

204
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:16,940
Thame.

205
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,660
Ain't Thame.

206
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,020
Yeah.

207
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,080
But it doesn't do you any good to hate.

208
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,920
Doesn't do you any good at all.

209
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
But it's a tasty word still.

210
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,700
You can use in many elaborate situations.

211
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,180
Like if you want to impress the congressman and get some money to clean up the phytoplankton.

212
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,720
You can't just...

213
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
You can't just...

214
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,740
Whatever I just said.

215
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,680
Right.

216
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,700
Whatever you said.

217
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,900
You can't do that anymore.

218
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,620
No.

219
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,360
It's verboten.

220
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,540
Yep.

221
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,840
Oh, boy.

222
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,380
We actually...

223
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,540
The funny thing is, where I am in North Texas...

224
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,340
Well, we're under a heat advisory.

225
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,440
But that's normal here for this time of year.

226
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:08,060
It's everybody else in the country that's getting the really, really strange, bizarre Texas weather.

227
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:19,880
Well, they were saying you can see the stuff in the sky from the wildfires and stuff as far east as New Jersey.

228
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,560
And I thought that was silly until I looked down and asked.

229
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,340
The skies looked all hazy.

230
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,040
Oh, yeah.

231
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,420
I asked somebody if that's it.

232
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,760
And they said, that's it.

233
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,040
Yeah.

234
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,080
Yeah.

235
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,040
We...

236
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,100
When I look at the hills, they're very, very hazy now.

237
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,200
Kind of orangey.

238
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,060
The sunsets are pretty.

239
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:49,260
And my lungs are infected with the toxins from the burning appliances and homes of the Californians.

240
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,220
Yeah.

241
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,580
I mean, I've really noticed my...

242
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,320
I get bad enough allergies living in this city.

243
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:55,860
I was like, I'm going to go to the Cedar Forest.

244
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,180
But now it's pollen plus burning plastic.

245
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,760
In minute quantities, but it doesn't take much.

246
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,600
Hell no.

247
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,060
You know, to make you snot and sneeze and hock up loogies, lungers, and bungers.

248
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,280
Yeah.

249
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,380
Or not be able to and fiercely want to.

250
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,180
Right.

251
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,040
Yeah.

252
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,920
Yeah.

253
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,040
It's a sad thing.

254
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,320
But I suppose there's sadder things happening all at once.

255
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,140
So we shouldn't have to worry about it too much.

256
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:36,000
Just get under the old pillow and pull down the bed and just repartee like there was nothing going on.

257
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,620
You know?

258
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,920
That's actually a good idea.

259
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,580
As soon as we hang up, I'm going to go do that.

260
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:50,220
I'm going to go to bed, pull the covers up over my head, shrivel up, and cower and tremble.

261
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,640
Yeah.

262
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,920
Until I go into the big sleep.

263
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
I like the trembling part, you know?

264
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,300
Well, it's as close to sex as I ever get anymore at my age, I'll tell you.

265
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,020
Well, you know, I mean, it's good.

266
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,800
But hey, hey, trembling beats nothing.

267
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,560
It's good for making milkshakes.

268
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,180
You just put the milk and the chocolate and the ice cream in there and just shake away.

269
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,960
Yep.

270
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,640
And within a few hundred hours or more, you've got a beautiful, delightful milkshake.

271
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,140
Right.

272
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,280
You can use your fear to save on the...

273
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,940
Electric bills.

274
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,720
Yeah.

275
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,820
That's what I was thinking.

276
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,660
I was hoping...

277
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,740
Or your palsy, you know, fear, palsy, whatever.

278
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,120
All those things that make old people quiver uncontrollably and spew.

279
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,360
I think it's because their underpants are too tight.

280
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,720
You know, the people in these lounges, what do you call them, lounges?

281
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,320
Lounges, you know, where people are kept in solitude.

282
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,780
In solitude until they get older and die.

283
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, those nurses that come around and so dutifully pull down the underpants and replace them,

284
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,080
they don't do such a good job all the time, especially when they're paid off.

285
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,740
You know what I mean?

286
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,140
Well, yes.

287
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,400
Of the man.

288
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:09,880
Yes.

289
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,440
Sometimes the man pays them off to humiliate the old elders and old people.

290
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,060
Helpless.

291
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,980
At least the old woman just...

292
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,380
Yeah.

293
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,840
At least the old woman just...

294
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,080
The old woman just came.

295
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,140
Speaking of old women, the old woman just came.

296
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,500
Oh.

297
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,520
Are you making a show of these?

298
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,960
Yeah, I'm making a show.

299
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,940
Now, see your gum sound.

301
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,200
Those, that box of...

302
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,960
Oh, and I have to make a pit stop before I can.

303
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,020
Remember, I've just been on the road for a while.

304
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,440
I'll be back.

305
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,080
She has to make a pit stop because of her pits.

306
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,340
Well, you know, you live close enough to California, you're bound to get some pits once in a while.

307
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:48,860
Yeah.

308
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,260
Fort, do you remember Fort Pitt?

309
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
They named Pittsburgh after that.

310
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,220
Oh, I didn't know that.

311
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,320
I didn't know that.

312
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,800
Yeah.

313
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,920
Pittsburgh is short.

314
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,520
It's kind of like American for Pittsburgh, isn't it?

315
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,100
I don't know.

316
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,580
I didn't see an H on the end of it.

317
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,680
I saw a couple of X's.

318
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,120
So I got confused, and I asked the witch doctor.

319
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,020
Don't ask which one.

320
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,000
I asked the witch doctor.

321
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,000
At the police station, he told me everything was off until next year.

322
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,340
I said, man, I'm just trying to find an etymology of some snakes, some animals,

323
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,600
and, you know, where does the word Pittsburgh come from?

324
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,440
Because Detroit, we know, was formerly under French rule until the American Indian,

325
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,440
what's it called, wars, French and Indian wars.

326
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,160
The French Indians probably pronounced it Detroit.

327
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,140
Yeah, Detroit.

328
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,500
Because they don't use the T. They just waste it.

329
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,940
Yeah, it's just wasted.

330
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,460
And Fort Pitt.

331
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:52,600
Fort Pitt.

332
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,060
That used to be, what was the name of that place?

333
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,440
Oh, Duquesne, which was also a bottled beer in the 1940s.

334
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,180
Hey, speaking of French Indians, I heard that in Cleveland,

335
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,820
they changed the name of the baseball team to Guardians of the Galaxy or something like that.

336
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,800
They're not called the Redskins or whatever they were, the Braves, the Powwows.

337
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,160
Yeah.

338
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,960
And the local Native American organization said, you know, we've been doing this for a year,

339
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,660
but there's no negative onus with it.

340
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,280
Why don't you just call yourself the tribe?

341
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,820
Because we go along with that, too, and we even play drums at halftime.

342
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,840
Instead, you come up with some ridiculous, you know, game-sounding name,

343
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,100
or maybe it sounds like a European soccer team, you know,

344
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,280
Britchester United, you know what I'm saying.

345
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,060
Yeah, but if you call yourself the tribe, then the other tribe's going to go,

346
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,140
no, no, we're the tribe, so we're going to have to kill you.

347
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,200
Because everything's tribalism now, you know.

348
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,620
Yeah.

349
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,100
If you don't have the right totem pole in front of your house,

350
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,960
the other tribe will probably want to set your house on fire.

351
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,440
Except they won't need to, because it'll already be on fire from the climate change.

352
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,280
And the spare change, and small change.

353
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,280
I heard that it actually got into the triple digits,

354
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,880
1-0-something.

355
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,400
It was even higher than 1-0-something.

356
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,720
It might have been like 1-10 or something.

357
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,180
In British Columbia.

358
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Actually, Dave, the oceans just off the coast of western Canada are dead zones now.

359
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,920
Yeah, it got real hot.

360
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,760
They're not used to seeing asphalt melt.

361
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,440
And they don't even know what air conditioners are up there.

362
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,340
So basically, everybody's already dead.

363
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,640
You might as well just, anybody you knew up there in the northwest, US or Canada,

364
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,600
they're probably burned up by now.

365
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,400
Have you spoken to anyone before they died?

366
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,740
Did they what?

367
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,900
Have you spoken to any of the western Canadians and Oregonians and Washingtonians before they died?

368
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,160
Well, I'm not sure.

369
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:33,120
But at least they'll die clean, because the water from the glaciers will be washing over them pretty soon.

370
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,200
There won't be any glaciers left, but there'll be plenty of water for a little while,

371
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,700
flooding down from where the glaciers were about 10 seconds ago.

372
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,240
Yeah, I was wondering if that became a gigantic tuna casserole, you know?

373
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,100
Yeah.

374
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,620
Of all those.

375
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,000
Well, it's...

376
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:52,860
It's funny.

377
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,020
It's happening even faster than doomsayers like me thought it would.

378
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:07,380
And I remember when this movie came out about 20 years ago called The Day After Tomorrow, I think that was it.

379
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,800
Yeah, something like that.

380
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,180
Climate Change Horror Movie.

381
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,160
And at the time, I thought, oh, this is ridiculous.

382
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,800
Look at this.

383
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,180
Suddenly, there's glaciers in New York, and it only took five minutes.

384
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,760
But then it turns out that's exactly what...

385
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,980
I think I just...

386
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,340
Just before I came downstairs here, I was glancing at the news, and I think that that was what was going on.

387
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:36,120
The air froze in Manhattan and was creeping down, you know, freezing up in New Jersey.

388
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:48,300
And meanwhile, the water was evaporating in the West so fast that people were just shriveled up desiccated potato chips.

389
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,500
One minute, they're fat.

390
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,860
Happy eating at McDonald's.

391
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,280
The next minute, the heat wave hits, and they're just...

392
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,760
Crisp.

393
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,460
Crisp.

394
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,780
Crisp skills.

395
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,280
Yeah, like the...

396
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,460
Yeah.

397
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:07,880
And see, we're kind of in the middle, in between the coasts, so it hadn't hit us yet, or whatever's going to hit us hadn't hit.

398
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,200
Well, that will be the dynamic thrash point between you and the other sides of the continent.

399
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,920
That will be what causes the explosion, and eventually, your suborganic demise.

400
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,360
Not yours.

401
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,080
Not yours personally, but, you know, millions of people in that area.

402
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,680
Oh, well, I'd probably be in that number, too.

403
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,160
I mean, I'm a person.

404
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:40,900
I do have an airlock, but, you know, they're only good up to a temperature of about 180 degrees Fahrenheit.

405
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,600
That should be a lot of fun.

406
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,440
Yeah.

407
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,000
180 plus.

408
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,820
I think it's about 150 out there today.

409
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,600
Yeah.

410
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,560
The last time I looked.

411
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:03,680
But we were going to have a cool spell next week where it would get down to the 130s.

412
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,460
Yeah, real funny, huh?

413
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,120
Real funny.

414
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,940
Yeah, so funny I forgot to laugh.

415
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,520
I remembered, too.

416
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,040
I remembered to laugh.

417
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,980
Good job, just after the idol two- Kopal leanings show.

418
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:24,980


419
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,300
I want to thank you Seton Эжик test for the whole ciw.

420
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,800
Yeah.

421
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,080
You know, I had this bad.

422
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,880
nos left-i'll change that in tonight.

423
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,400
I didn't think we'd say it.

424
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,660
It became alles u rappi OUN he has.

425
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:46,660


426
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,080
I always fight to see if the work.

427
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,080


428
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,240
The ad 무서 ба.

429
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,060
You want me to fight.

430
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:51,880
What?

431
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,520
It's making it hard just to stay alive

432
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,720
But the iodine, a one to one

433
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,020
The iodine, a one to one

434
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,500
No more running through the metal plans

435
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,280
No more boyhood in the mud

436
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,040
Power, power's in the power's hands

437
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,680
Shake the bony head and shake it good

438
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,140
The barium, a two four eight

439
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,380
This baby's sterile, I can't procreate

440
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,660
And plutonium, a two oh seven

441
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,960
So long folks, I'll see you in heaven

442
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,200
But the iodine, a one three one

443
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,240
The iodine, a one to one

444
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,540
No more running through the metal plans

445
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,500
No more boyhood in the mud

446
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,240
Shake the bony head of the poison rain

447
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,200
Shake the bony head and shake it good

448
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,440
So there's over two million known pollutants

449
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,940
That can cause cancer, pancreatitis

450
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,780
Bad juice, bad breathing, gingivitis

451
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,220
Bad breath, acne

452
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,660
No more

453
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,380
What's the use?

454
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,720
The iodine, a one three one

455
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,100
Has got my thyroid on the run

456
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,200
And the krypton, a eighty five

457
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,340
It's making it hard just to stay alive

458
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,940
But the iodine, a one three one

459
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,180
The iodine, a one three one

460
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,240
No more running through the metal plans

461
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,100
No more barefoot in the mud

462
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,800
Shake the bony head of the poison rain

463
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,700
Shake the bony head and shake it good

464
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,500
So there's over two million known pollutants

465
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,600
That already tonight

466
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:22,760
So there's over 20 million known pollutants

467
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:22,760


468
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,660
No more bad way out, it's boring

469
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,520
The iodine, a one three one

470
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:25,520


471
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,940
Shake the bony head of the poison rain

472
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,240
Shake the bony head and shake it good

473
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,520
Shake it

474
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,820
Shake it

475
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,120
Shake it

476
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,520
Shake it

477
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,540
Shake the bony head of the poison rain

478
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,680
Shake the bony head

479
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,000
A heartache now you know

480
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,700
We just went to the bathroom

481
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,180
What's the matter with your teeth and your gums

482
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,300
Stuff like that

483
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,420
Then we don't have any problems

484
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,260
Except for when we see the guy

485
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,200
Who committed the crime in person

486
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,540
Well I'll be able to hear

487
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,780
This on the recording

488
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,580
Later

489
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,040
I'll be able to hear everything everyone says

490
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,180
Later when there's just me

491
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,220
In the headphones

492
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,420
So your deafness

493
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,780
Has a time shift on it

494
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,560
No it has

495
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,580
It has

496
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,420
Sort of a space shift

497
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,900
If there's another headphone

498
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,760
In the room

499
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,380
My headphone loses

500
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,500
Half of it's hearing

501
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,240
It's cheap equipment

502
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,360
Is what it is Dave

503
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,220
It's cheap equipment

504
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,640
I've had people

505
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,600
I've had erstwhile

506
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,040
Beginner podcast people

507
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,320
Go Stang

508
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,000
Tell me what kind of equipment

509
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,160
You're using for your wonderful sound

510
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,020
On your show

511
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,340
And

512
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,020
And it's like

513
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,060
Well this is a 30 year old

514
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,460
$20 Radio Shack mixer

515
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,520
Three old microphones

516
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,400
With rotten foam

517
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,600
Windscreens on them

518
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,000
Chewed up by wind and cats

519
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,320
And

520
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,760
A cassette deck

521
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,760
An iPhone 6

522
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,900
That has to be kept

523
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,740
Charging all the time

524
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,520
And a

525
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,700
Yeah

526
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,320
And a

527
00:26:39,340 --> 00:27:09,340


528
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,860
Spider farm inside of it

529
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,360
Yeah it's got cobwebs everywhere

530
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,440
It just makes it look like

531
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,680
This is a real sound studio

532
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,720
And not just a table

533
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,680
With a bunch of junk on it

534
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,740
Like I said it's for a fact

535
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,720
What it really is

536
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,880
Is a table with a bunch of

537
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Really dusty old junk on it

538
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,620
I mean really really dusty

539
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,020
So dusty that there are also

540
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,160
Dinosaur footprints

541
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,240
Within my eyesight view here

542
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,460
Seriously

543
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,720
There are

544
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,580
That's true

545
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:38,780
Yeah

546
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,840
So

547
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,360
That's a

548
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,880
Can be considered

549
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,900
Kind of a good thing

550
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,460
Especially when you get

551
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,480
You know some kind of

552
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,900
Protectionist racket

553
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,960
You have to hide out there

554
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,160
You pretend like it's 1987

555
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,520
What

556
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,480
Wait a minute

557
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,420
Wait a minute

558
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,940
What year is this?

559
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,360
1987

560
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,000
That I'm talking about

561
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,720
Oh what a relief

562
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,000
God I thought for a minute there

563
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,320
I just

564
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,140
You know

565
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,820
Had a stroke or something

566
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,900
And kind of forgot

567
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,760
The last thing I had to do

568
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,220
For 50 and a half years

569
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,600
Right

570
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,220
You had a stroke of bad luck

571
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,920
That's for sure

572
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,300
Well

573
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,860
Especially when you were young

574
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,840
Oh no no

575
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,640
Everything was easy

576
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,460
When I was young

577
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Somebody else wiped my butt

578
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,360
For me and everything

579
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,620
Pretty soon

580
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,100
That'll probably happen again

581
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,320
Not less

582
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,340
Yeah that's what I miss about

583
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,780
You know being young

584
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,460
Is not having somebody

585
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,240
Wipe my butt

586
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,360
And you're saying

587
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,200
Well don't worry

588
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,940
You're going to be having

589
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,380
Your butt wiped pretty soon

590
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,620
Yeah it won't be that long

591
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,060
Much longer

592
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,020
Before somebody's

593
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,880
Wiping your butt again

594
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,800
If you're lucky

595
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:43,900
Yeah

596
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,500
At least they won't be

597
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,480
Using spoons now

598
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,600
You know plastic spoons

599
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,440
Anymore like they

600
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,240
Were doing there for a while

601
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,060
In the late 1980s

602
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,800
Oh I hate those

603
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,900
Wiping your butt

604
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,820
With a plastic spoon

605
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,660
I hate that

606
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:55,960
Ew

607
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,640
Yeah can you

608
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,440
Just see like

609
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,380
Ronald Reagan

610
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,040
Walking around

611
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,760
With a bunch of

612
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,920
Plastic spoons

613
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,640
Hanging out

614
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,080
Of his

615
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,040
Unfortunately

616
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,600
I have actually

617
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,340
Seen that

618
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,600
I went to a

619
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,320
Party once

620
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,060
In Hollywood

621
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,780
Just before he was

622
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,280
Elected governor

623
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,160
And I saw him

624
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,980
In that condition

625
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,920
At the party

626
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,740
But I was

627
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,300
I was just a little kid

628
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,960
I was only about

629
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
18 or so

630
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,260
When Ronald Reagan

631
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,340
Was 25

632
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,620
Did you get his

633
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,060
Screen legend

634
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,480
His

635
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,760
I got his autograph

636
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,840
Yeah

637
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,820
But unfortunately

638
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,620
It was written

639
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,040
With one of those spoons

640
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,200
So

641
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,020
Yeah

642
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,600
Yeah

643
00:29:38,620 --> 00:30:08,620


644
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:38,620


645
00:30:38,620 --> 00:31:08,620


646
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:38,620


647
00:31:38,620 --> 00:32:08,620


648
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,600
He's saying, should I turn on the evidence or be a good old stumble?

649
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,960
The president's on a bump, having a chat with God.

650
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,560
He says he's going to save our world, or maybe just buy half of us.

651
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,000
It's a democratic country where they don't have funds.

652
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,480
And business is not an offshore fund.

653
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,680
And business is growing and there's no surprise.

654
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:58,060
The president's in your head.

655
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,380
The president's in your head.

656
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,780
The president's in your head.

657
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,300
The president's in your mind.

658
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,760
The president's in your mind.

659
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,320
The president's in your mind.

660
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,620
The president's in your mind.

661
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,120
The president's in your head.

662
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,080
Well, Dave, I'm sure the listeners,

663
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,140
the listeners will be amazed and surprised to hear that you're still alive.

664
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,820
I know that they're kind of amazed every week that I remain alive.

665
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:51,480
But nobody's heard you on the show except in hail and hearty reruns.

666
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,800
For quite some time.

667
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,240
Our blessing in a damned confusion is described.

668
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,460
For a great long time.

669
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,980
So welcome back, Dave.

670
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,780
Yes, welcome back, Dave.

671
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,960
I'm feeling welcome and useless, actually.

672
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,580
I have a fictitious idea of what's going on in the world right now.

673
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,140
But you count your blessings, dude.

674
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,020
You don't want to know what's really going on.

675
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:26,860
Reverend Stang tells me pretty much every day that he's really glad that I don't read the news because it's just so bad.

676
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:28,940
Yeah.

677
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,300
Especially environmental news.

678
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,580
Good old Washington Post last week.

679
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,960
Most people don't read any of that anyway.

680
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:43,000
I looked at, today I thought, I was looking at the regular, you know, the fake news headlines.

681
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,320
CNN, you know, BBC, that kind of thing.

682
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:53,640
And the main headline was, world is ending.

683
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:05,060
I mean, that was the first thing up because there was a big conference that they released this compiled data that was worse news than even the egg.

684
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,920
And I thought, I wonder what Breitbart.com is saying about this.

685
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,920
Nothing, nothing at all wasn't even mentioned.

686
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,820
It was all about movie stars that refuse to wipe their own butts because they're Hollywood elites.

687
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,980
And what was it?

688
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,020
The sex rapist and the whisperer.

689
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,720
That's Cuomo and Biden.

690
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,340
Ah.

691
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,660
The sniffer.

692
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,580
No, the sniffer.

693
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:32,840
Yeah.

694
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,780
The whisperer.

695
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,700
And he sniffs.

696
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,960
And that was why the world is ending because of Biden's sniffing and whiffing and whispering.

697
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,560
Ah.

698
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,720
And Cuomo's attempted gropes.

699
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,600
Apparently, he never really got anywhere.

700
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:57,580
All he did was grope and harass, but nobody has actually said that he did anything but put his hand on their butt.

701
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,980
Which, that used to be standard operating procedure for every 1950s male boss.

702
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,640
Absolutely.

703
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,200
Yeah.

704
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,380
Yeah.

705
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:12,400
I mean, if your boss didn't chase you around the desk like in a sitcom, you felt like you

706
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,420
weren't doing your job.

707
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,340
Those were the days.

708
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,280
You were missing something.

709
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,600
Yeah.

710
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,320
Nowadays, all you have to do is whisper or sniff and the right-wingers will come after

711
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,560
you.

712
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:32,180
Now, you can grab them by the country, and that's okay because it's one of them doing

713
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,500
it.

714
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:32,940
See?

715
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,300
Yeah.

716
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:41,100
But if a sniffer or a whiffer even sniffs or whiffs, much less grabs them by the country,

717
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:51,560
like the Russians and the North Koreans did to our country, they grabbed it by the country.

718
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,160
I'm sorry.

719
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,440
Do you think I speak of country matters?

720
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,720
Yes.

721
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,520
That's Shakespeare.

722
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:00,960
Yes.

723
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,020
That's from him.

724
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,360
He's a good one.

725
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,240
You think I speak of country matters?

726
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,840
Country matters.

727
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,480
It's a rude, crude joke.

728
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,300
Country.

729
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,300
Country, yeah.

730
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,480
And you even hear them making these sexist remarks like, she was a good sexratary, and

731
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,800
then they go, and look at each other in a knowing way, and then they go, and look at

732
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,360
each other in an unknowing way, and they go, and make it look like they're not quite

733
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,140
sure, and then they say it again.

734
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,940
They say sexratary, and then they all laugh uproariously.

735
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:32,920
Sexatary?

736
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,900
Yeah.

737
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,680
Well, see, there's one I can't use.

738
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,120
You did not just say that.

739
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,700
Yes, I did.

740
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:51,340
I imitated, I quoted Dolomite in a Rudy Ray Moore imitation voice, and I have to cut that

741
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:57,680
out of the show, because if you're not woke, you're asleep, but if you're woker than thou,

742
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,100
that's even worse.

743
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,480
So, they got you coming and going.

744
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,700
Oops, I said coming.

745
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,180
And you know what going means.

746
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,520
That's like number two.

747
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,460
Yeah, that's bad.

748
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,480
Knock, knock, knock on your back door.

749
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:10,880
Stinky.

750
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,120
Yeah, bad.

751
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,800
It's a bummer.

752
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,020
Well, that's, we have to, that's probably wrong.

753
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,080
Murr.

754
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,740
I missed that.

755
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,160
It's a bummer?

756
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,360
It's a bummer.

757
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:22,960
Yeah.

758
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,460
It's a what now?

759
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,220
A bummer.

760
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,080
Yeah, Monty Hall, let's find out what's behind door number two.

761
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,380
I'm sorry.

762
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:32,900
I'm sorry.

763
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,900


764
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,900


765
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,900


766
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,900


767
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,900


768
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,900


769
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,900


770
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,900


771
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,900


772
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,020
There's another door there.

773
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:44,420
I'm actually, I'm quoting the Trailer Park Boys Greasy Money phone app game, which I'm

774
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,060
addicted to.

775
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,040
Deeply addicted to.

776
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,980
Oops, I said addicted.

777
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,720
That's got an unwoke word in it.

778
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,080
I'm Richarded to this game.

779
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,780
The Trailer Park Boys, how do they get away with anything?

780
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:00,980
Poison.

781
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,720
They're, oh, that's right.

782
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,080
It's Canada.

783
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,200
They're from Canada.

784
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,380
They're from Canada.

785
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,440
They can do anything they want.

786
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,740
The FCC is.

787
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,860
Those poor creatures, they have no freedoms like we in America.

788
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,380
Right.

789
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,920
So they can say anything they want on TV or radio.

790
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,520
They do.

791
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,520
Actually, Steve Rogers got kicked off the air for saying .

792
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,680
But I think it was the listeners that are the .

793
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,300
Not letting him say on the air.

794
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,700
That's true.

795
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,000
That's going to be fun.

796
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,800
That's going to be a whole bunch of .

797
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,140
Yeah.

798
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,820
That'll be the good part when you hear the .

799
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:37,860
Yeah.

800
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,840
Well, that's what the Cleveland and radio broadcast audiences hear.

801
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,800
The internet audiences only hear that if it's funnier to put the in than the curse words.

802
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,120
At least the curse words are in cursive now.

803
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,060
They're encouraging the children to learn backwards.

804
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,760
No, but see, that's okay.

805
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,700
If you say them in cursive, people understand.

806
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,220
They're under 30 or so can't hear it.

807
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,560
They never learned cursive.

808
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,840
They can't.

809
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:16,020
To them, like the former president, the Declaration of Independence appears to be in a foreign language.

810
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,260
What language is this?

811
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,180
They actually ask that question.

812
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,220
Because he can't read English cursive.

813
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,600
We can't read big words.

814
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,680
They typed it out for him and hand him the handwritten calligraphy of the Declaration of Independence.

815
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,160
But, you know, they sell at gun shows and stuff.

816
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,840
They sell copies of it, right?

817
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:38,980
Yes.

818
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,720
Replicas of the Declaration of Independence.

819
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,360
Yes.

820
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,900
And kids have to ask what it is.

821
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,840
They can't even read the title of it.

822
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,220
They can't read a clock either, a regular clock.

823
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,240
They can only read digital readout numbers.

824
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,700
A circular clock with, you know, the number.

825
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,160
With hands?

826
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,920
Yeah, with hands.

827
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,140
Yeah, that means nothing to them.

828
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:14,920
They don't, they didn't sit at five minutes till three every weekday staring at that round thing waiting for that hand to hit the top.

829
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,780
You know, when you could leave school.

830
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,660
To get out of school.

831
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,180
Right.

832
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,720
That means nothing to them.

833
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,940
They look at their phone, which has a countdown, and tells them when they can leave.

834
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,720
And also sex pictures of the kids all sitting around them.

835
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:39,300
Because that's all they do in school now is unzip their pants, take sexties or whatever of their privates and then text them to each other.

836
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,220
No, seriously, I heard that on Fox News.

837
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,040
That's all they teach in school.

838
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,900
We left, but it's true.

839
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,620
And Marxism.

840
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,000
That and Marxism.

841
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,740
And that's all there is in schools now.

842
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,420
Oh, I see.

843
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,140
You need to, there's a microphone.

844
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,280
That's all there is in school now is just.

845
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:53,540
Yeah.

846
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,540
You know, you, Philo, and Susie have a lot in common, Princess Wee.

847
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,660
No memory whatsoever.

848
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,380
None.

849
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,760
Complete blank.

850
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,400
You can remember there's a microphone there for, what, about 10 seconds?

851
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,820
But then your back gets tired of leaning.

852
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,840
Actually, Hal does that, too, to some extent.

853
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:22,380
Although usually he leans forward until his lips and nose touch the windscreen on the mic and then he falls asleep.

854
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,380
I thought it was turned blue.

855
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,420
That's it.

856
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,300
It actually has happened.

857
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,640
But that's because Hal doesn't have a microphone.

858
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,540
Hal's shows are usually on at four in the morning.

859
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,380
I've seen Hal fall asleep on the mic.

860
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:33,720
Yeah.

861
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,760
I've seen him fall asleep while he was awake.

862
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,460
Or awoken.

863
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,400
Awoken.

864
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,960
Or awoken berries.

865
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,500
Yeah.

866
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,080
Yeah, there's a lot.

867
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,740
What's up with all the new vocabulary, you know?

868
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,720
I remember when I first started doing some stuff, they'd say contact or whatever, and

869
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,960
now they say everybody has to reach out to somebody.

870
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,140
And then if you're aware of something, you woke.

871
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,260
And then otherwise you're gaslighting.

872
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,200
What does gaslighting really mean?

873
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,600
I'm wondering.

874
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,700
Is that fibbing?

875
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,240
It basically means lying, more or less.

876
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,100
It's based on a movie called Gaslight.

877
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:15,580
Yes.

878
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:22,820
Where this woman thinks she's losing her mind because she keeps thinking she turned off that gaslight.

879
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,280
But then it's on again.

880
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,280
And her husband berates her and tells her she's losing her mind.

881
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,420
But he's the one secretly turning the light on and off to make her believe she's crazy,

882
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,240
so she'll go crazy so he can get all the money.

883
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,140
That's gaslighting.

884
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:45,160
Yeah, I don't think most people who use that term have any idea whatsoever where it came from.

885
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,440
Because it's a movie from the 30s.

886
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:47,840
Yeah.

887
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:48,520
Yeah.

888
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,260
And I have not ever seen it.

889
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,260
I really want to see it someday.

890
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:52,600
Really?

891
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:52,740
Yeah.

892
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,340
Goodness.

893
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,740
That's what I was just going to ask you.

894
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,340
It was from the 1930s.

895
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:56,760
Yes.

896
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,560
I think it was.

897
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,980
It was the predictive decade before DeFiro walked the earth.

898
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:06,120
It was a famous movie, but that was over 150,000 years ago.

899
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:13,220
These creatures were thought to be extinct, and yet here they are, gaslighting.

900
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,920
Yeah, stinking the place out.

901
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,620
And leeching and everything else that we thought had gone out of fashion.

902
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,240
But it's all back in fashion again.

903
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,760
Well, they're going faster than a speedboat.

904
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,180
They're on their way to hell, if you ask me, but nobody did.

905
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,180
No, they just motorboated me.

906
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,420
Did you ever try and haul some bowling balls?

907
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

908
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,840
What was that, Dave?

909
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,480
I am too.

910
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,380
Say it again, Dave.

911
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,780
You said, oh, I was just wondering if they were taking canoes and putting bowling balls

912
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,620
in them to make sure everybody got to the right shores of the river.

913
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:55,740
Yeah.

914
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:55,740


915
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,560
You know, because if you didn't, then...

916
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,800
Dave, they quit doing that back in 2030.

917
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,160
Which was 35 years ago.

918
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,640
Yeah, yeah.

919
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,560
Yeah, they quit making bowling balls around 2035 entirely.

920
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,140
Because bowling was outlawed.

921
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,020
You know, it wasn't...

922
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,300
I don't know.

923
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,240
There was something...

924
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,600
The right-wingers hated it because of the...

925
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,040
The racks.

926
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,460
And the left-wingers hated it because of the balls.

927
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,440
Yeah, but at least the left-wingers had enough little marks on their bodies so that it wouldn't

928
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,320
pinch you there on the chest.

929
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,500
Nobody cared about the pins.

930
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,200
The pins were fine.

931
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,940
You can still get bowling pins, but you can't have balls.

932
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,640
Not anymore.

933
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,380
Yeah.

934
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,260
It's balls pretty much kind of been outlawed on all fronts.

935
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,720
Both sides have outlawed balls.

936
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,120
Wow.

937
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:54,920
They don't like balls.

938
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,200
Yeah.

939
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,720
They don't like balls.

940
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


941
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


942
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


943
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


944
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


945
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


946
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


947
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


948
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


949
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


950
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,720


951
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,200
I see.

952
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,980
No, they're just taboo.

953
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,300
They're becoming more and more taboo each day.

954
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,840
I have balls, but don't tell the cops because they don't like...

955
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:10,360
Well, I've been sitting on mine lately as I've become older, like close to 105 years

956
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:10,660
old.

957
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,300
I've noticed now that it's very easy to sit on that, on your scroll area.

958
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,500
Yeah.

959
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,020
When I say balls, that's kind of a figure of speech in my personal case.

960
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,680
Well, why wouldn't you call it balls?

961
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,860
Balls, it's a singular is the way it works.

962
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,860
But let's not go into that.

963
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,980
Let's talk about something that blesses my heart.

964
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,360
UFOs.

965
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,620
They finally told the truth about UFOs.

966
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,300
Which is what?

967
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,160
They don't know anything about it.

968
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,980
No Jack Who-ey.

969
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,320
They finally admitted it.

970
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:44,700
Yeah.

971
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,080
They finally admitted, yep, yep, UFOs, we have no idea.

972
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,660
Not a clue.

973
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,680
If you know, tell us.

974
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,040
All that Roswell stuff, that was all big story.

975
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,680
Well, no, we don't know.

976
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,740
They don't know.

977
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,780
They just don't know.

978
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,420
They just don't know.

979
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,440
Roswell, heck, who cares about that?

980
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,580
That's, that's...

981
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,540
So, haven't they been collecting information for the last 50 years?

982
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,000
Well, they released the information, it's just that it doesn't say anything.

983
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,900
Nobody knows.

984
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:12,260
Yeah.

985
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,880
It's like, well, yeah, this thing buzzed all these planes, all these things buzzed all

986
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,920
these planes and did all these crazy things, but we don't know.

987
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,380
Might be Nazis from the hollow earth.

988
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,820
Might be aliens from out of space.

989
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,980
There could be Nazis from the moon.

990
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:34,140
Might be creatures of light that fly around and dart around in the sky and they're just

991
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:39,020
some species we never heard of before that's been here this whole time and they just like

992
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,920
to tease us.

993
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:46,640
Or it might be John Galt and his rich people that withdrew from the world 500 years ago

994
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,920
to dedicate themselves to peace and science and slack and now they're teasing all the

995
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,960
rest of the suckers.

996
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,740
Better hands.

997
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,160
Yes.

998
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:01,400
That's, honestly, that's, to me, that's the most likely scenario for UFOs is secret

999
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,360
geniuses that a long time ago went, this whole thing is screwy.

1000
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,640
Let's go find ourselves a nice hiding place in the hollow earth or somewhere that only

1001
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:19,820
brilliant geniuses like us can learn how to live in and we'll just become advanced.

1002
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,900
Like Wakanda in Africa.

1003
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,060
That's a case of, you know, a secret civilization that's way more advanced than everybody else.

1004
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:33,160
And you don't expect it because they're protected by holograms and it just looks like remote

1005
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,680
jungle.

1006
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,680
Dave wouldn't know what I'm talking about because he hasn't seen a movie in 45 years.

1007
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,440
Wakanda.

1008
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,240
Yes.

1009
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,260
That's where Black Panther comes from.

1010
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,500
Okay.

1011
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,320
You know, long live Wakanda.

1012
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,700
No, I never saw Black Panther.

1013
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,160
What?

1014
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:49,960
I heard it.

1015
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,580
You've got to be kidding.

1016
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,800
You know, I've told you a hundred times I never saw it.

1017
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,780
And you always think you have that same reaction.

1018
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,440
What?

1019
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,300
You didn't see Black Panther?

1020
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,240
That's great.

1021
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,400
No, I didn't see it.

1022
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,300
You ranted to me about it and I really wanted to see it, but I never saw it.

1023
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,260
Maybe I should go rent it from the Red Box right away.

1024
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,240
Oh, by now it's probably free on one of those pay-per-view channels.

1025
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,680
I've tried.

1026
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,000
For free.

1027
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,580
I've looked.

1028
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,340
If you pay.

1029
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:17,840
Oh, well.

1030
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,220
Free.

1031
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,280
Only $5.00.

1032
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,740
The Subgenius movie isn't on Amazon anymore unless you bought it.

1033
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,640
You can watch it on Amazon if you bought it.

1034
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:34,600
But it's still on Fandango, I think, and Hulu and Apple TV and all the other ones that we

1035
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,040
don't have.

1036
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,960
It's a moot point because I have my own bootleg copies that I can reproduce anytime.

1037
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,520
And I have the official DVD.

1038
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,400
Well, I'm glad you can reproduce anytime you want.

1039
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,480
But it makes it less.

1040
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,040
I don't want to.

1041
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,260
I bet you can.

1042
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,400
I bet you can.

1043
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,320
But Dave's never seen the Subgenius movie, J.R. Bob Dobson and the Church of the Subgenius.

1044
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,360
I bet he hasn't.

1045
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,860
Well, he's not in it, so he wouldn't care.

1046
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,160
I tried, Dave.

1047
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,640
I tried.

1048
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,880
Remember I filmed you?

1049
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,580
She didn't use anything I filmed.

1050
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:07,800
I filmed G. Gordon Gordon, you, Gary Gbrogfren, and Anna Moll.

1051
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,420
And she didn't use any of that footage.

1052
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,820
I even went to Portugal to film G. Gordon Gordon.

1053
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,340
It was a horrible trip, too.

1054
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,720
She still didn't use the footage.

1055
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:16,980
No.

1056
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,100
No.

1057
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:22,700
She drank a lot of blush wine and smoked a lot of Tunisian arceece.

1058
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,000
No.

1059
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,280
No.

1060
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,740
I didn't even get to do that when I was in Portugal.

1061
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:34,920
Only fun thing I got to do was try goat in a fancy restaurant, and I didn't even like

1062
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,100
it.

1063
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,660
He didn't like it.

1064
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:35,880
No.

1065
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,840
Well, anyway, the Subgenius movie came out pretty good, even though you're not in it.

1066
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,340
It did.

1067
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,140
It's really good.

1068
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,620
It has me in it a lot, so it's really good.

1069
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,300
Princess.

1070
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,460
They interviewed Princess Wee, and they didn't use her.

1071
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:47,820
No.

1072
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,340
Not a second of it.

1073
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,900
You can see her smiling at 7 a.m., the fake 7 a.m.

1074
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:01,920
It was actually 7 p.m., but the sun was in the same position, so I said, let's just do

1075
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,320
a fake 7 a.m. ceremony.

1076
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,420
We'll have more people that way.

1077
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,340
So we had almost like a dozen.

1078
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,360
Yeah, but you didn't want to have people all the time.

1079
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,220
People, yeah.

1080
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:12,840
People, sure.

1081
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,400
You want stranger elements than people.

1082
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,280
Yeah.

1083
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:15,280


1084
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,220
You want some, you know, nice fried figs, some people from outer space.

1085
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:20,900
That's right.

1086
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,240
Not people.

1087
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:27,800
We wanted people from outer space, but all we got was a small film crew.

1088
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,980
They did use some of the footage, but I bet they felt like, man, why did we all come out

1089
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,580
here for this?

1090
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,820
Yeah, you get paid in bars.

1091
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,620
They didn't use much from that.

1092
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,660
Anyway, Dave, we have to go because it's almost an hour.

1093
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,260
Okay, well, it's been a very pleasant hour.

1094
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:45,260


1095
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,700
And I'm glad the world's not going to completely—

1096
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,740
Oh, it is.

1097
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,220
It is.

1098
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,000
It is.

1099
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,440
It is.

1100
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,560
We've got about—yeah, by the time I get this recording upstairs to my computer, I

1101
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,300
probably won't even get a chance to copy it over.

1102
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,880
Right, the sky will have fallen.

1103
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,140
Yeah, the sky will have fallen.

1104
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,420
30 seconds left to go.

1105
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,380
That's so sad to think of.

1106
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:10,780
But—

1107
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,700
Seven, six, five, four—

1108
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:14,780
Five, four.

1109
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,020
Three, two, one.

1110
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,000
And then—

1111
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,700
And it's the day called X.

1112
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,400
Not really.

1113
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,140
Not really.

1114
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:24,560
Not really.

1115
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:33,840
Okay, well, I'm going to go back to my—well, I don't want to say what I was

1116
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,060
doing.

1117
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,400
Well, I don't see why you wouldn't want to let everybody at least know that.

1118
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,900
No, I don't know what the kids call it nowadays.

1119
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,660
I don't know the vocabulary.

1120
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,760
As you were saying—

1121
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,200
Hog fishing.

1122
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,060
—you know, they change the words for everything.

1123
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,040
It's hog fishing now.

1124
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,300
At least that's the rural term.

1125
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,280
Haven't you ever gone hog fishing?

1126
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,620
Hog fishing?

1127
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,060
Yeah.

1128
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,060
I never have been hog fishing.

1129
00:52:59,040 --> 00:52:59,960
Well, you don't want to stick a stick—

1130
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,260
Is that the thing that girls do?

1131
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,500
Well, they're allowed.

1132
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,180
Yeah, they do it better than guys.

1133
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,340
They don't like that idea.

1134
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:06,660


1135
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,860
It goes against their sexist dichotomy.

1136
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,160
Hmm.

1137
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,160
That's the way it is.

1138
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,740
Yeah.

1139
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:14,740


1140
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:14,740


1141
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,380
Well, I guess I'll sign off now.

1142
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,240
The sky is turning purple again.

1143
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,880
I can see the little children outside my window all praying.

1144
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:30,120
Yeah, the pages of my script are curling up and catching on fire.

1145
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,180
I guess we better call it quits.

1146
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:40,120
The last hour of slack, number 1,843?

1147
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,600
Forty-three?

1148
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,240
Forty-three?

1149
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:44,240


1150
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,540
Wow, 1843.

1151
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,260
Wow.

1152
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,580
Holy mackerel.

1153
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,120
That's a lot.

1154
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,540
That's a lot of radio shows.

1155
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,740
That's the envisionment of a super animal.

1156
00:53:53,740 --> 00:54:00,080
I've actually been doing this show longer than Johnny Carson did his show or David Letterman

1157
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,100
did his show, but they did them every night, five days a week.

1158
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,260
We only did it once a week, but I'm just as tired as those guys.

1159
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,180
In fact, I'm about as tired as Johnny Carson.

1160
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:14,220
Yeah.

1161
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:14,540
Johnny Carson now.

1162
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,600
Okay, man.

1163
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,940
Okay, man.

1164
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,800
Okay, man.

1165
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,600
You want words?

1166
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,700
It's fun to make a radio show with you, Dave.

1167
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,440
Yeah, it's good.

1168
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,140
I just noticed the battery went down, too.

1169
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,320
It's still working, but it wouldn't work for much longer.

1170
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,980
Boy, they go fast now.

1171
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:34,980
I know how it feels.

1172
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,320
I know exactly how that battery feels.

1173
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:37,780
Mm-hmm.

1174
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,140
Totally full one minute.

1175
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:39,360
Me, too.

1176
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,400
Suddenly, it seems like no time at all goes by.

1177
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:42,700
Yep.

1178
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,040
There you go.

1179
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,140
Just like my old life.

1180
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:44,220
No.

1181
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:44,220


1182
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:44,220


1183
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:44,220


1184
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:44,480
I'm out of energy.

1185
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:45,580
Yep.

1186
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,780
That's where I'm going right now.

1187
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:47,940
Okay.

1188
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,700
Swap batteries, Dave.

1189
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,820
See you on the flip-flop.

1190
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,060
Set the end.

1191
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:56,580
Dave?

1192
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,640
He actually hangs up, even though he could fake it.

1193
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,600
He actually hangs up.

1194
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:07,840
Ah, well.

1195
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,840
So, let it be.

1196
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,820
Well, I guess I'll push the stop button.

1197
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,060
Stop.

1198
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:22,020
And finally, let's go to hear live versions of two of the songs we played earlier recorded

1199
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,820
at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland as part of Subgenius Debacles.

1200
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:33,340
There may be time coming soon when you will not need that dangly dingly or that thing.

1201
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,500
No!

1202
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,720
That pristine juicer you can hang from yourself.

1203
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,540
That slimy eye.

1204
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,700
It's not good for pioneers.

1205
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:43,800
It's not good for pioneers.

1206
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:43,800


1207
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:43,800


1208
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:43,800


1209
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:43,800


1210
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:43,800


1211
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,260
You've gone far from the sky.

1212
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,020
Oh, I don't know.

1213
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,360
It was so long ago.

1214
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:09,980
Well, they said Chernobyl was so long

1215
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:10,280
ago.

1216
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,720
There's nothing to worry about.

1217
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,800
It's luck you didn't sink.

1218
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:13,800


1219
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,160
Then I hear on the news a bunch of dumb guys in the Department of Energy and Defense Department

1220
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,420
are going to start building a bunch of Chernobyls across the United States.

1221
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:28,160
Then I hear Chernobyl's not really over. All these people are all dying within a 250 mile radius

1222
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,760
because all the underground aquifers are all polluted.

1223
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,720
So now we're getting it too.

1224
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:39,980
And then I wonder as I stare into the mirror how, why my movements are getting so jerky and...

1225
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,960
Jerky and...

1226
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,880
One, two, three, four!

1227
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:54,800
The iodine, the 131, has got my thyroid on the run

1228
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:00,780
And the krypton-85 is making it hard just to stay alive

1229
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:07,220
But the iodine, the 131, the iodine, the 131

1230
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,100
There's no more running through the metal lanes

1231
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,800
No more barefoot in the mud

1232
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,260
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

1233
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,900
Shake the bony hand and shake it through

1234
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:31,820
The barium, a 248, has made me sterile I can't procreate

1235
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:37,940
And the plutonium, a 247, so long folks, I see you in heaven

1236
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:43,780
But the iodine, a 131, the iodine, a 131...

1237
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,000
There's no more running through the metal lanes

1238
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,640
No more barefoot in the mud

1239
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,080
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

1240
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,620
Shake the bony hand and shake it through

1241
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,240
And the krypton-85 has got my thyroid on the run

1242
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:11,600
And the krypton-85 has got my thyroid on the run

1243
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:17,180
And the plutonium, a 131, the 131...

1244
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,200
Jerky and...

1245
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,920
Jerky and...

1246
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,600
The iodine, the 131, the 131...

1247
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:40,020
So, if you're over 2 million known, can eating chicken cause cancer, skin lesions, brain

1248
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:50,320
tumors, conjunctive lymphoma, Passer's disease, Hodgkin's lymphoma, chicken neck, acne, gingivitis,

1249
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,740
bad breath, then what's the use?

1250
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:07,840
The iodine, 1, 3, 1, has got my thyroid on the run, and the krypton, 85, is making it

1251
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,300
hard just to stay alive.

1252
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:18,380
But the iodine, 1, 3, 1, the iodine, 1, 3, 1, there's no more running to the metal line,

1253
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,200
no more pain.

1254
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,160
Well put in the bag.

1255
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,740
Power, power's in the power's hand.

1256
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,060
Shake a pointy hand and shake it.

1257
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,540
No more running to the metal line.

1258
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,340
No more pain.

1259
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,300
Well put in the bag.

1260
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,720
Shake a pointy hand of the poison man.

1261
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,040
Shake a pointy hand and shake it.

1262
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,020
Shake it.

1263
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:41,780
Shake it.

1264
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,320
Shake it.

1265
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,480
Oh, beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

1266
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,300
I ain't got religion, I got a damaged brain.

1267
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,020
If I had a dollar for every Lincoln that I took,

1268
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,840
I'd buy the Pope and Vatican and buy the dirty phone.

1269
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,860
Beat me to the pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

1270
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:08,740
Beat me to the pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

1271
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,620
Beat me to the pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

1272
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,460
Beat me to the pulpit.
