1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,080
Unless they have control of your radio tubes!

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,480
Uh, and I do too.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,820
Good. This is Ren Hoag.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,720
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,100
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,960
On, uh, local station.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,840
Keep listening, you idiot!

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,020
Else I shall kill you!

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,360
Okay, all you little squirty honeys out there in radio land.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,980
This is Joe Offrecht of the Order of Dionysus Abasios.

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,500
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack with Reverend Ivan Stang.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,860
I'm gonna force you into bed with me!

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,360
Ha ha ha ha ha!

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,320
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,060
which reaches from the inner mind to...

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,780
The subgenius Hour of Slack!

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,800
I believe in just letting the holy benediction of Bob

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,340
float.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,460
Flow out like pus from a pustule.

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,160
You just don't understand the true power of the show.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,040
Oh, it's very fashionable to say Bob is a good man.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,440
Oh, he was a prophet.

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,580
But, uh, the son of Jehovah One.

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,600
No, well, ha ha ha.

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,700
I don't go for these old superstitions, you say.

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,140
Certainly not.

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,860
Very fashionable.

29
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,080
It hath not been my use to pray

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,980
with moving lips and bended knees,

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,440
but silently, by slow degrees,

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,260
my spirit's eye to Bob composed.

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,820
In humble trust my eyelids close,

34
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,980
in reverential resignation.

35
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,800
No wish described, no thought expressed,

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,140
only a sense of suffocation.

37
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,140
A sense, for all my soul impressed,

38
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,440
that I'm out in the street undressed.

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,120
Church air, one soul per breath.

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,480


41
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,880
Glad to hear from you, and turn the radio on.

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,980
Well, I think you'll get the show,

43
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,100
no matter how you're listening.

44
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,340
I'm not sure if you'll get the show,

45
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,340


46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,340


47
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,340


48
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,060
but I'm sure you'll get the show.

49
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,360
It's being beamed through the heads

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,300
of all the Central and Northern California,

51
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,400
no matter what they do.

52
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,480
Yes, this is the show that never stops,

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,560
and we whistle our way.

54
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,580
Oh, no, the church air, please.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,880
Where's Whistler?

56
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,120
Oh, yeah, see, as long as the Whistler's on,

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,720
we seem to be at peace with our universe.

58
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,380
We don't like to be too confused.

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,900
We are able to do more than things.

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,320
We are able to do more than things.

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,720
We are able to do more than things.

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,460
It's happy little blooper

63
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,320
sliding on the rainbow.

64
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,280
Why, oh, why can't I?

65
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,160
Waiting the pathway.

66
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,440
Waiting for the rain to stop.

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,400
Eh, the soot on my тому.

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,540
Ah, yes, I varieties.

69
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:18,840
Eh, the soot on my treating.

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:18,840


71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,740
Ah, unanimous call the

72
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:19,880
Ah, unanimous call the

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:26,260
Ah, come along.

74
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,640
Follow me, Jack.

75
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,320
The gladiators.

111
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,820
please

guitar solo

115
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,520
See, Dobbs, he sold the planet to the Exists.

116
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,220
Because, you see, he's the world's greatest salesman.

117
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,440
He sold the planet to the Exists, but the Exists made a deal with Bob.

118
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,960
They said, okay, we'll buy this planet, and we'll, you know, we'll do what we want with it.

119
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
And, yeah, okay, we'll take care of your people.

120
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,020
We won't kill your people.

121
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,280
His people being the subgenius.

122
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,240
Yeah, I think we each have to realize that we have a responsibility there

123
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,140
and maybe be more bold than we've been,

124
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,000
because our voices are heard if there are enough of us talking.

125
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,840
And we just have to get together as a group of people who are against it,

126
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,140
because the ones that are for it sure do have a voice and are heard.

127
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,860
The world wears a mask to hide its startling differences.

128
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Some natives in Africa enjoy life without clothes.

129
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,260
Only nudists in our part of the world enjoy life without clothes.

130
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:21,680
Once again, the only visitors WCSB can have loudly resent brain rot, radio fear, and all its nakedness.

131
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,440
Hallelujah!

132
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,260
The strange, the hideous, the amusing, the shocking.

133
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,060
This tribe's ceremony of circumcision is barbarically painful,

134
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,500
but terminates in the boy being cared for by a woman.

135
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,800
Who teaches him the techniques of love.

136
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,720
So that's us.

137
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,820
The subgenius.

138
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,660
We're not gonna die.

139
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,400
We're immortal.

140
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,600
Just like these guys here.

141
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,320
This is crash worship.

142
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,680
This song, if you want to call it that, was recorded live.

143
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,760
Obviously.

144
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,820
At a Samhain ceremony.

145
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,680
Samhain being the holiday that we just had.

146
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,840
Halloween.

147
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,040
Samhain being the holiday that Bleepo and I experienced a week late.

148
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,520
Yes.

149
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,080
Yes.

150
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,340
Samhain is when the veil between the living and the dead is the thinnest.

151
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,400
Normally it's supposed to happen on October 31st.

152
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,540
However, it happened on November 7th and 8th.

153
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,440
Yes.

154
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,020
Yes.

155
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,120
The dead were raised and they came into our house and they, they touched us.

156
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,820
Yep.

157
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,920
We were dead.

158
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,500
We truly were dead.

159
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,080
The devil dog was dead.

160
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,420
We lost reality.

161
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,560
That's what happens on Samhain.

162
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,940
That's what happens.

163
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,660
Stuff like that.

164
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,740
You know, living, walking dead.

165
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,380
Goblins and monsters and evil powers and stuff like that.

166
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,740
What was Bob doing on Samhain?

167
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,880
Bob was probably watching TV or something on Samhain.

168
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,420
Bob does stuff like that.

169
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,380
He doesn't believe.

170
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
The living.

171
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,260
The dead.

172
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:04,800
Ha ha.

173
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,900
No, cause see, mom wasn't there when we destroyed the universe.

174
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,340
Ivan Stang wasn't there when we destroyed the universe.

175
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,120
Not there physically, but he was there in our hearts.

176
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,640
We love him and we missed him so.

177
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,600
We wish that he could have been there to share in this experience with us.

178
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:33,040
And I just, I would, I would just like to conclude this little story with, with, with,

179
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,000
with a thank you.

180
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,360
Thank you.

181
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,780
Thank you not only to JR Bob Dobbs, our savior, our high E-popped of our church.

182
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,860
We'd also like to thank.

183
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,500
I'm sorry, commander.

184
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,780
No member of my crew wants to be a hero.

185
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,320
And the normal leave is going to be fine without a promotion.

186
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,040
And tell that hunk of metal that MK 31 is returning home.

187
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,140
Captain Ham-

188
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,520
But most of all.

189
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,460
Most of all.

190
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,420
Leepo and I thank.

191
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,460
Thank you.

192
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,360
For bringing us to the edge of the world.

193
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,380
Bringing us careening over the edge.

194
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,360
Down the cliff.

195
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,300
On the rocks.

196
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,540
Split.

197
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:31,760
Torn.

198
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,480
Bloodied.

199
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,680
Bruised.

200
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,540
Broken.

201
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,700
Atomized.

202
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,780
Thank you.

203
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,240
Wherever you are.

204
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,980
Thank you.

205
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,500
For without you, we would not have raised the dead.

206
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,420
We would not have destroyed the universe and recreated it.

207
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,420
And it's so much better now, isn't it?

208
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,420
You must admit the world is a better place now than it was on Friday.

209
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,040
You have to admit that, don't you?

210
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,420
You're right.

211
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,940
I'll say this right.

212
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,560
You're right.

213
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,300
Of course you have to admit it.

214
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,860
Okay.

215
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:03,980
Okay.

216
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,660
You know it's true.

217
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,360
Yes.

218
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,160
You're listening to this, aren't you?

219
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,660
Well.

220
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,080
The world definitely is a blessed place.

221
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,880
And this is a blessed radio show.

222
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,920
This is the Church of the Subgenius.

223
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,140
That's it, baby.

224
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,540
There'll be a lot of husband and wife swapping.

225
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,500
There are a lot of great numbers of young people that are going to be living together without getting married.

226
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,180
And I think we see that already.

227
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,940
Even in an area where we live, we're kind of a minority being a married couple.

228
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,980
But again, the thing he's talking about here.

229
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,280
There's not just society at large, but within the church.

230
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,560
Right.

231
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000
These are sins within the church.

232
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,960
Here in this seaport dive, women can be bought for what you pay for a highball.

233
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,880
We cannot run this ministry on love alone, children.

234
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,580
We wish we could, but I'm afraid you're going to have to reach down in your pocketbooks.

235
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,320
Maybe if we just sold everything we own, we could stay on the air another day.

236
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,120
Those naked girls are doing their wicky-wacky-wacky dance.

237
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,540
Wow.

238
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,480
Take a look at them.

239
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:03,960
You don't have to.

240
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,220
You don't have to tell me that three times.

241
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,220
Look at them.

242
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,440
You know, those are...

243
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,700
Look at them.

244
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,300
Look at them.

245
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,500
They say every gesture and every movement has a meaning of its own.

246
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,560
And you can believe that.

247
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,520
Watch these wacky knees.

248
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,220
My God, now they're...

249
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,320
My eyes have been glued to that one in the middle.

250
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,220
If I could only pull them off.

251
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
Super glue or something.

252
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,080
Ah!

253
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,540
Ah!

254
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,480
Know the thrill of racing bulls.

255
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,000
Or the super thrill of the ultra-dangerous sidecar racing.

256
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,960
Perhaps the most macabre of all.

257
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,000
Are these young lovers.

258
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,520
They find crowds and danger enhances their love making.

259
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,380
Ha!

260
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:39,800
Ha!

261
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,220
Ha!

262
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,280
Ha!

263
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,960
Ha!

264
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,920
Ha!

265
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,800
Ha!

266
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,180
Ha!

267
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,880
Ha!

268
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,240
Ha!

269
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,780
Ha!

270
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,780
Ha!

271
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,940
Ha!

272
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,540
Ha!

273
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,060
Ha!

274
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,360


275
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:51,700
Ha!

276
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,400
Ha!

277
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,420
Ha!

278
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,720
Ha!

279
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:52,720


280
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:52,720


281
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,460
Ha!

282
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,060
Ha!

283
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,980
Ha!

284
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
Ha!

285
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,440
Ha!

286
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,840
Ha!

287
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:07,720
Ha!

288
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:07,980
Ha!

289
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,020
Ha!

290
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,400
Dad Pig vs. Chair Man vs. Horse

291
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,920
How To Play

292
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,080
Casso

293
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,840
Th懵

294
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,180
Son

295
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,180


296
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,080
Man

297
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,120
Land

298
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,560
Whif

299
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:33,660
L

300
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:33,840
Just

301
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,320
A case of slaves and slack robbers out to chop your slobber

302
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,720
Pigs and geeks licking the cheese off your tongue

303
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,220
Just when you're ripe and you throw them the load

304
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,260
Slap back them and bomb at them

305
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,300
They don't want your bones and feet

306
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,120
And if you got the cleft in step, mommy-o

307
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,240
It'll hate your worth, hate's way worse

308
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,360
So why can't you please your papa squeeze him

309
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,360
When the gush isn't going all normal and anti-right-line?

310
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,740
Crushing a gaseous sex in your sneezing chamber?

311
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,500
Tossing an empty platter in your beanbag, boy?

312
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,620
Where's your rollerballs at?

313
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,100
I can't drop me no glove throw on these luchu-luchu logo bands

314
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,240
They cut your check purse and water your creamery coming and going

315
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,080
And the slobber to love it won't be your oven

316
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,700
Cause the slacky taps of the Greenwich Center be there claw to bleed

317
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,340
And the slacky taps of the Greenwich Center be there claw to bleed

318
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,120
And the slacky taps of the Greenwich Center be there claw to bleed

319
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,340
They are dogs who do ya

320
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,520
But you are letting them bang down the barn doors

321
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,260
And your cows are getting nicked and out

322
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,280
You be your moon the man

323
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,060
Or a volley of moon to the slasher house

324
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,880
Like good baby butterbutt

325
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,640
Or not

326
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,980
You're gonna have to spreech angry, Jake

327
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,240
Get right with your muscle snake, snow monkey

328
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,340
Quick spreech in your blizzera

329
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,680
Lessen it snow and light lute juice

330
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,000
Elsewise, you're clean bleeders boiling hot water

331
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,300
You'll go blind or please your neater trying not to

332
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,220
Either way, you're getting up on the wrong side

333
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,860
Or get to this kind of free peed-neutering side trade

334
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,200
Well, I want you to just stand there like a Danny Nichols slug

335
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,560
Or you're gonna bust your blimperer in a righteous bargaining

336
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,060
Hey, hey, hey, hey, boy

337
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,160
You got weenie rivers in your fluter tube

338
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,280
And a joint gumption with the true and the seed brave

339
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,080
And paperball, man, it's senior jeans

340
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,920
Buy out the gland owners with what you earn

341
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,720
With your skinny, peely face of pain

342
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,540
Bleach a piece of the fine ass

343
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,080
Have a fuzzy bean bock

344
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,320
And strike your heart-best soft blow

345
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,360
For the rat coin was the rocket rat

346
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,280
This face-out belongs to your worship

347
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,420
And the crack of your choice toys

348
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,660
Then Ivan bought him a flush lugger of tears

349
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,600
To let him stay

350
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,640
You know who's the cop?

351
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,380
Well, that's the gans ain't keen to hob on nobody

352
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,360
No, sir, ma'am

353
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,040
You just work in the buggin' good

354
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,600
And they'll be strong like your man

355
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,480
This has been your re-enunciator

356
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,440
Thank me

357
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,800
Thank you.

358
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,600
Uh, me. Something like that.

359
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,340
Uh, yes, dear friends, that was, uh, that just there, right, Dan,

360
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,660
was indeed huge voodoo with yours truly, Reverend Ive.

361
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,320
I've been staying off, uh, 10 Inches of Slack, the album.

362
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,980
And you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

363
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,680
In this case, tonight, a show thrown together at the last minute.

364
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,080
But that's good. That's good.

365
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,120
That forces us to scavenge and parasitize the other shows.

366
00:31:52,580 --> 00:32:00,660
So what you've been hearing, such as KPFA, uh, the Subgenius show there with, uh, Dr. Hal Puzzling Evans,

367
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:00,660


368
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,600
and Jane or Hypercleets in this particular case.

369
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:10,760
We also get lots and lots of clips from Brain Rot Radio Theater, WCSB in Cleveland.

370
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,860
Praise WCSB.

371
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:23,220
Uh, that amazing, senseless waste of airtime that I love so much, uh, starring Scabby, Lonesome, and Psycho,

372
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,460
Toast, Wacky, Sal Wayne, Sam Haines, Lame Brains.

373
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,280
They get you talking all wink-lack and spinny.

374
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,140
Tours.

375
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:41,600
Uh, also, a young sister, Gobi, on her Subgenius show from far, far up in Rochester, New York.

376
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:49,400
And all of that intercut in tonight's case with bits and pieces of media barrage, so-called tapes,

377
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,140
put together by our friend, Nancy Regalia.

378
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,660
And, uh...

379
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,440
Zoo Castle Films presents our Insect World Series 9.

380
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,560
Volume 27.

381
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,900
The Fly.

382
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:11,640
Welcome, boys, girls, men, women, and teachers, to the world of one of nature's most underrated wonders, the common fly.

383
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,300
Yes, the fly.

384
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,400
Both a bold and a shy creature.

385
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,680
He enjoys frolicking on the family's picnic in the park on Sundays.

386
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:24,420
Yet, he prefers to spend his frappy week alone under a large leaf in his own pipe-like entrenching tool, the proboscis.

387
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:30,420
The many-faceted eyesight of the fly is so keen, he can detect movements before they even happen.

388
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,320
Making him a hit at parties and a big winner at the races.

389
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,360
But what about nectar?

390
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,040
Well, when the fly finds its time to mate, or rut, he puts out his feelers, turns up his olfactory and other sensory nerve inputs,

391
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,380
and scans the horizon for the picante, marshmallow smell of a female fly in heat.

392
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,980
Ah, lucky fellow, he's found one.

393
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,000
Yes, her mysterious dance seems to lift up his day and light up his night.

394
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,160
But it's all right.

395
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,400
As she comes to accept him, it's no secret that the fly's orgasmic pleasure is matched only by his built-in proportionate appetite.

396
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,000
And it's his infinite inability to remain in a fixed location for any length of time.

397
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,900
For no sooner has the mating couple filled each other's goby nodules with albumin and spoo,

398
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,900
than the fly, ever-touring, ever-seeking nectar, flies off to another destination,

399
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,320
smiling all the while as the facets in his mirror-like covering reflect grace, land, and mansions of endless stars,

400
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,740
thus filling in the blank spaces of nature's lost address book.

401
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,080
Is it all in the name of love? Or is this conscious pest but a note in the marvelous symphony of nature's universe?

402
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,380
Perhaps we'll never know. But the next time you see a common fly, remember, there's more to this pest's quest.

403
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,700
If you're looking for a lucky fellow's life, then Rancid Oatmeal and his attraction to that light bulb over your bed.

404
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:40,420
Yes, one of nature's most misunderstood anomalies, Mr. Fly will always be a part of Our Insect World.

405
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,900
Two-headed Elvis baby found in Martian spaceship!

406
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,980
Creature from future lands in Times Square with answer to world pollution!

407
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,180
Family dog performs emergency surgery on injured boy.

408
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
Looking for hidden messages?

409
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

410
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,580
You want the truth?

411
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,120
You don't know what you...

412
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,700
Well, if you do...

413
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,120
Just keep listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

414
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,300
And you could also, you could, yes, write for free information if you're one of those who hasn't actually done that yet.

415
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:29,500
Just drop that self-addressed stamped envelope in the mail to Bob at, yes, post office box 140306, Dallas.

416
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,220
Texas.

417
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,640
75214.

418
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,980
And we'll be giving that number again and again and again.

419
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,720
In fact, I'll give it now.

420
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,840
It's post office box 140306.

421
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,040
Dallas, Texas.

422
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,180
75214.

423
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,740
We pause now to flip.

424
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,860
I see him.

425
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,220
I, I, I worked for the conspiracy.

426
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,340
Don't be working for that conspiracy, man!

427
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,960
I worked for the conspiracy.

428
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,640
Don't be working.

429
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,020
Yes, I have to pay for it.

430
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,800
Work for Bob.

431
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,020
Work for Bob.

432
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,340
Work at the rent.

433
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,380
Live on the street.

434
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,440
Work for Bob.

435
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,940
I worked for Bob and I live on the street.

436
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,640
And these Christians, they took me in, they gave me a home and they fed me.

437
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,440
And then they, they said all the things I did that make me feel good, this I shouldn't be doing.

438
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,720
And I feel guilty and I feel guilty for every...

439
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,240
Stop.

440
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,800
You know, you know, you know what you need to do.

441
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,380
You need to get down.

442
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,220
Put those drawers against your knees.

443
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,000
And stick yourself right up against the wall.

444
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,620
Get the radio and get ready.

445
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,980
You know, you need to have those guilty hands leave your body.

446
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,360
Get ready, my friends.

447
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,260
Give it to me, River.

448
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,240
Give it to me, River.

449
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,420
Give it to me, River.

450
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,380
Oh, yeah.

451
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,520
Oh, I feel it.

452
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,420
Oh, I feel it.

453
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,580
Do you feel it, you feel it's leaving?

454
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,420
Oh, I feel it.

455
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,920
Can you get it?

456
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,500
Get it.

457
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:44,980
Get it out.

458
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,940
I feel something arising in me.

459
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,240
Get it out.

460
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:47,240


461
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,580
I feel something arising in me.

462
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,100
Feel the rising.

463
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,520
Feel the rising.

464
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,240
You know.

465
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,800
I feel it arising.

466
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,940
Well, that's how you know that it's working.

467
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,640
So, everybody just relax.

468
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:58,980
I'm going to get you out of here.

469
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:58,980


470
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,060
And enjoy the warm glow, the warm sting of the glow.

471
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:11,400
And don't forget, now that you have received this great gift straight from Bob himself,

472
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,660
you need to pay and to tithe unto Bob.

473
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,640
Nothing's free.

474
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,320
Oh, my buttocks are so red and swollen.

475
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,980
I feel like a new man.

476
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,900
I feel safe.

477
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,120
It's a good feeling on this cold night, that warm glow in the buttocks.

478
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:28,980
I feel like a new man.

479
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,380
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like quitting my job.

480
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,140
That's right.

481
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,560
Quitting your job.

482
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,500
I feel like quitting my job.

483
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,420
Quit that job.

484
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,440
I feel like sending all my money to Texas.

485
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:36,960
That's right.

486
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,160
Sending it in.

487
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,560
All my money.

488
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,640
My rent money and the money I've been saving up to get my mom that operation so she can

489
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,300
get a new heart.

490
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,520
Ah, she doesn't need a new heart.

491
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,920
Because she eats bacon and she feels guilty about it and her heart's going to stop.

492
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,180
Well, it's best for your mother's heart to stop rather than one of the poor slackless

493
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,980
children in the home for slackless children.

494
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,320
To go without their, you know, their facials and their plastic surgery this month.

495
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,760
So send that money in.

496
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,860
Now, we're up to our long distance dedication.

497
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,780
And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand.

498
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,820
Whether we have kids or pets or neither.

499
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,880
It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio.

500
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,260
And here's what he writes.

501
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,480
Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere

502
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,960
and it'll mean a lot if you're willing to help.

503
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:28,960


504
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:28,960


505
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:28,960


506
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:28,960


507
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:28,960


508
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:28,960


509
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:28,960


510
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,320
I want you to play it.

511
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,600
Recently, there was a death in our family.

512
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,080
He was a little dog named Snuggles.

513
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,580
But he was most certainly a part of, let's start again.

514
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,740
From coming out of the record.

515
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,620
Play the record.

516
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:39,860
OK?

517
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,600
Please?

518
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,560
That's the letter U and the numeral two.

519
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,640
Nobody cares.

520
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,220
Snuggles.

521
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,540
Snuggles.

522
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,820
Snuggles.

523
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,940
The number that's missing is three-fifths of a second.

524
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


525
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


526
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


527
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


528
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


529
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


530
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


531
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


532
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


533
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


534
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


535
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:58,940


536
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,420
There's a little dog named Snuggle.

537
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,100
This is American Top 40.

538
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,600
This is American Top 40.

539
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,060
This is Boat Head.

540
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,460
Yep, with you.

541
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,880
No one else, just you.

542
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,680
Here's the first Top 40 hidden.

543
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,220
Guess what?

544
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,180
For the Irish band from Dublin who call themselves U2.

545
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,420
I have run.

546
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,000
I have crawled.

547
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,880
I have scaled these city walls.

548
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,300
Crawled.

549
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,360
Yeah, that's a great idea, but nevertheless, I have done that for you.

550
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,680
Oh, yeah.

551
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,160
You can feel the love coming from Reverend Nikki.

552
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,560
You can feel the love as it pulsates from her very breast.

553
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,740
Oh, yeah.

554
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,200
I can feel it.

555
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,520
I can feel the pulsation.

556
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,560
As long as you can't smell it.

557
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,580
I am French, you know.

558
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:56,960
Yeah.

559
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,960
Oh, you're Americanized French, aren't you, Nikki?

560
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,540
That's right.

561
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,700
I took a bath this morning.

562
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,300
Yeah.

563
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:03,860
Yeah.

564
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:03,980
Yeah.

565
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,140
Yeah.

566
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,660
Hose down and de-louse.

567
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,880
Welcome to America.

568
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,720
Uh, and speaking of the French, if you know anyone out there who's French, kill them.

569
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,440
Oh, now, now.

570
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,240
We're just kidding.

571
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,380
We wouldn't want to tell you to kill the French.

572
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,580
No, no.

573
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,360
We don't want to tell you to kill the French.

574
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,860
That's what got Manson in.

575
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:32,100
Well, not the French, actually, but just for telling people to kill other folks.

576
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,120
We don't want to tell you to kill the French, but we're forced to.

577
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,060
Yeah.

578
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,160
Well, you know, it would be bad if somebody out there were listening to us and got the

579
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,620
idea in their head to go out and kill someone just because they're French.

580
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,060
That would be a bad thing.

581
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,340
We think that if someone out there really wants to go out and kill someone who's French,

582
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,560
they should get the idea on their own.

583
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,840
And just because we keep using the French word, we don't know what's going to happen.

584
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,440
We're using the words kill and French in the same sentence.

585
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,580
Don't try to take that as any kind of a subliminal order.

586
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,660
Don't kill the French.

587
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,200
Don't kill the French.

588
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,140
Don't kill the French.

589
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,160
Oh, but look at all the great things the French people have given us.

590
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,380
Oh, yes.

591
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,920
Leprosy.

592
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,660
Venereal diseases.

593
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,000
Crack whores on every street corner.

594
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,220
Oh, yes.

595
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,900
Artists who paint with brushes stuck in their butts.

596
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,880
Oh, yes.

597
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,240
Look at all the great things the French have given us.

598
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,620
Perfume.

599
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,720
Perfume.

600
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,180
The French gave us perfume.

601
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,800
You know, in France, they use perfume in the subways to mask the stench of urine.

602
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,640
But here in the United States, we use urine to mask the stench of the French.

603
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,520
That's right.

604
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:51,820
And, dear friends, at that point, I'm afraid that I must censor this show.

605
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:56,580
I had left a statement or two by Dr. Lagume.

606
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,100
I left a statement or two by Dr. Lagume in there, in the previous version of this show,

607
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,580
because it was so funny.

608
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,020
It made my eyes water.

609
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,600
But it was the kind of statement that could be taken just...

610
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:13,560
Well, it was the kind of statement that you can lose a show over if somebody gets the wrong idea.

611
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:20,480
So instead, you're just going to have to listen to me apologize for having to censor things because...

612
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,220
Well...

613
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,300
Well, it's probably for the best.

614
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,680
It was pretty brutal, friends.

615
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,100
He polluted rivers.

616
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,800
And they've got their artsy-fartsy museums.

617
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,160
Oh, and their classic French literature.

618
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,800
Come now.

619
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,880
You ever met a Frenchman who can read?

620
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,520
They import that stuff.

621
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,520
They have ghost writers.

622
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,860
They have the English write all of their stuff for them and send it over to them.

623
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,360
And in return...

624
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,480
Well, I guess the French give nothing in return.

625
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,860
And it's true, they should give something in return.

626
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,360
I mean, there are many things that the English really could use.

627
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:02,900
Oh...

628
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,680
Instructions on oral hygiene, for instance.

629
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:07,860
Oh...

630
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:14,100
And you know, it is an historical fact that all French literature was really written by German ghost writers who were actually born in Austria.

631
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,300
That's right.

632
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,040
Where they are...

633
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,100
Where the paper hangs on the walls.

634
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,220
Hung by the crazed Austrian paperhands.

635
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,580
And look but...

636
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,880
Doesn't this look girly, mister.

637
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,480
Well, I don't...

638
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,620
This looks like a goodical example of how much talk culture holds.

639
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,000
Oh...

640
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,000


641
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,000


642
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I don't know what you allRL did, but we found these New YorkuyorsunДа impresses.

643
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,160
.

644
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,200
Aren't these little dirty things made in Germany?

645
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,800
Must be purple- counseling

646
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,920
You know...

647
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,700
It's touchy...

648
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:59,400
It wasn't really a wet dream, but just a drawing on the back of a napkin in a diner somewhere

649
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,580
of a wet dream.

650
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,980
And it wasn't even a real diner.

651
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,940
It was actually a bowling alley that had a lunch counter, but they didn't bowl there

652
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,560
anymore because the neighbors complained about all the noise.

653
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:16,920
And there weren't even really any neighbors there to complain because the French ate them,

654
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,520
those cannibalistic French bastards.

655
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,600
Of course, it's not really cannibalism when a Frenchman eats a human.

656
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,820
Only when a Frenchman eats a Frenchman.

657
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,540
And we all know that it'll be hundreds of years before the French are allowed to mate

658
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,900
with anything even remotely resembling humans.

659
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,280
Maybe 200 years.

660
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,160
Why, they have...

661
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,980
Look at the history of France.

662
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:46,900
They had king and queen.

663
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:46,900


664
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,100
They had kings like Louis XIV.

665
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,700
They don't even have last names, just numbers.

666
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,520
How can you trust a country where the people have numbers for last names?

667
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,300
How can you trust people who think that Jerry Lewis is a genius?

668
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,460
I know you all hate Jerry as much as I do.

669
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,780
I hope someone makes soap out of him.

670
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,080
Jerry Lewis, sir.

671
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,280
That would be funny.

672
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,260
Let us test us.

673
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,460
Let us test us.

674
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,600
Motivated fucking school.

675
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,560
We live on the west side.

676
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,880
Let us test us.

677
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,560
We call opportunity, except if I pay every dollar.

678
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Well, I don't get paid to bring you the word of Bob and the friends, and I'm telling you

679
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,000
that sex is all right.

680
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,100
Yee-haw.

681
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:45,760
Bob wants you to enter a subgenius short duration marriage with a prairie squid and get, I said,

682
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,640
get down.

683
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,500
Yee-haw.

684
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,220
The normals.

685
00:45:53,700 --> 00:46:01,480
The normals are taught in what they are pleased to call their holy scripture that the lust

686
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,040
for money is the root of all evil.

687
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,960
The lust for money is the root of all evil.

688
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,740
And yet you walk into one of their churches and you see that they are not the same.

689
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:15,740


690
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,180
And what's sure to happen.

691
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,740
That's right, brethren.

692
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,860
They're going to ask you for money.

693
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,920
Pink churches are the greatest property owners in the world.

694
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:33,960
They're tax-exempt and make billions upon billions of dollars a year, yet they preach

695
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,000
that lust for money is the root of all evil.

696
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,740
The conspiracy's strategy of keeping the dull notes.

697
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:45,740


698
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:45,740


699
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:56,840
Normals trapped in a double paradox of sin and hypocrisy over sex and money makes them easy to control through guilt.

700
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,220
Hell, they'll even try to make you feel guilty about being smart enough to see through their game.

701
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:12,980
They're forever adding two and two and getting five, but they think that's the right answer, even though all of their works ultimately come to naught.

702
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:19,580
Even though the real answer is literally blowing pipe smoke in their very nostrils.

703
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,760
Verily, they have noses, yet refuse to smell.

704
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,800
And that's the real sin of the pinks, my brethren in Bob.

705
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,280
Willful, willing, ignorance, and stupidity.

706
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,380
And that, brethren, is a sin in the eyes of Bob.

707
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:41,980
Oh, Bob.

708
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,960
And as far as...

709
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:48,140
As far as I'm concerned, that makes it the only sin worth listing as a sin.

710
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:58,260
Willful ignorance is the sin that evil normal humans wallow in as if it were something to be proud of.

711
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:07,560
They flaunt their sin of Jehovah One-inspired, indescribable, self-inflicted stupidity,

712
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,400
while they cheerfully destroy the only planet known.

713
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:12,960
That they...

714
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,820
That they can live on.

715
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:22,400
These normal religious nuts are so steeped in hypocrisy that they can say,

716
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:30,980
Thou shalt not kill with a straight face, and yet be ready to jump up any time some two-bit fascist scumbag declares a war.

717
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,820
And they cheerfully obey and slay each other in droves.

718
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,940
And all with the blessings of their priests, who travel with their armies,

719
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:49,200
to reassure the soldiers that their evil imaginary gods are with them,

720
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,900
and will even aid them in the slaughter of their enemies.

721
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:03,560
Yes, my brethren, the normals are conditioned to live in the sins of ignorance and hypocrisy

722
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:12,920
from such an early age that it has been easy to convince many of them that they were actually born in sin.

723
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:21,380
Being born a sinner as the result of a sinful act committed at their conception.

724
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,040
But no one is born a sinner, my friends.

725
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,820
No one is born a sinner to Bob.

726
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:40,020
Everyone is born with the opportunity to see the truth, pull the wool over their own eyes,

727
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,320
warp their own DNA.

728
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:47,520
Wallow in the gutter with the prairie squid of their choice.

729
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:54,260
And most importantly, get saved aboard the excessed pleasure ships.

730
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:03,940
Everyone is born with that chance to escape the conspiracy trap of constant sin and guilt manipulation.

731
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,080
But few take that opportunity.

732
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,400
The lies of the conspiracy,

733
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:11,500


734
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,800
are plain to all who care to see them.

735
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,440
Lust for money is the root of all evil.

736
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,500
Give us your money, thou shalt not kill,

737
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,580
except when we order you to for God and country.

738
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:32,540
Now, the word and will of Bob

739
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,800
is manifest all around you at all times,

740
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,340
just as the desire for slack

741
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,960
is always within you.

742
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:50,140
Bob's saving excuse from sin is not only easy to find,

743
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,100
it's punching you right in the freakin' face all the damn time.

744
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,880
Bob is in your face now,

745
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,080
and Connie sits on it now.

746
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:07,560
The odor of Bob's pipe and the odor of Connie's, uh, uh, uh,

747
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,320
are blasting into your third nostril.

748
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:15,340
Can you continue to deny their overpowering psychic stench?

749
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,720
Can you continue to live,

750
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:22,620
knowing you are a living sin against Bob,

751
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,440
and a stink unto his very nose?

752
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,720
Oh, you'd better think it over, friends,

753
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:38,480
because X-Day is coming right down on you like a rabid face-raping bat in estrus.

754
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,360
And if you're still trapped in that pink sin and guilt trip,

755
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:51,120
then on that day, Bob and the X-ists will stamp the final seal on your state of sin,

756
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:58,140
and you will be forever doomed to endless cycles of despair in eternity,

757
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:05,140
condemned to a self-generated nightmare of sin and guilt and penance,

758
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,620
forever and ever.

759
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,240
Forever?

760
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,480
I strongly...

761
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,720
And ever.

762
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,900
Isn't it amazing, dear friends, how a subgenius preacher

763
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,360
can make you feel so guilty about feeling guilty?

764
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:25,760
It's beautiful the way we, uh, uh, do that.

765
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,060
You know, well, you have to fight fire with water,

766
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,460
is the way we look at it in this religion, friends.

767
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,200
Let me give you some credits here.

768
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,520
That's a rather long...

769
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,840
And that was chopped down some.

770
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,480
I just skipped the whole first half.

771
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,480
That was, uh, Reverend Nolan Void on WREK in Atlanta.

772
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,440
And, uh, it's a shame, apparently, just last week,

773
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,100
Dr. Nolan Void swore off Bob and the church,

774
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,940
or at least swore off doing the radio show anymore

775
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,460
and got mad at Sister Susie the floozy,

776
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,660
and I don't know.

777
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,080
These...

778
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,420
You know, they don't call them high,

779
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,960
they call them high-unpredictables for nothing.

780
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,900
But luckily, we have lots of tape of the, uh, performer,

781
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,880
I guess he would say, uh, Nolan Void.

782
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,800
And, uh, unless he tells us not to play him.

783
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:23,740
Yes.

784
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,920
And, oh, and before that,

785
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:30,100
an incredibly tasteless stretch of, uh,

786
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,860
Doctor Like You with, uh, Reverend Nikki Death Chick

787
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,740
and, uh, Dr. Edward Strange,

788
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,220
from, uh, that station in Philly.

789
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,760
What is this station?

790
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,900
In, in, uh, it's right outside of Philly.

791
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,340
There, anyway, well, we love you, uh, dear friends,

792
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,060
and Dr. Strange, and...

793
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,240
Or, I guess he's not Dr. Str...

794
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,200
I don't know what's going on, man.

795
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,940
Let's just listen to Hendrix for a minute.

796
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,180

797
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,060

808

¶¶

809
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,760
started in all this fog.

810
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,360
Gary, turn on the radar.

811
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,000
Hey, this is a Whiskey Yankee Kilo 8231.

812
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,340
Set it for New York.

813
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,620
Range mark.

814
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,760
Oh, here we are.

815
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,140
Back again, live on the air.

816
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,620
Oh, the fair is so much fun down here.

817
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,040
This is the real radio show here.

818
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,340
Parades going by, and the fireworks are going off.

819
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,300
Just amazing.

820
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,420
Just amazing.

821
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,860
The cameras, you can see your monitors from where you are,

822
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,140
wherever you are in the fairgrounds.

823
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,240
You can see the presidential motorcade has started here

824
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,540
and there.

825
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,280
Once again, throwing the groceries out of the way.

826
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,300
Bernice, I'm only on one side.

827
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,180
Could I be on both sides?

828
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,960
Hype-shaped fireworks.

829
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,460
They're fading off into the back.

830
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,380
Are we both there?

831
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,120
Wait a minute.

832
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,180
Giant subgenius toilet flushes the dregs of subgenius life

833
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,320
into subgenius hell.

834
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,580
We wake up Saturday morning.

835
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:35,640
Yes.

836
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,220
And we're back again.

837
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,240
How amazing.

838
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,000
How amazing.

839
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,220
You act like you're a bunch of babies or something.

840
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,580
Yes, we're the big, big, stinking babies.

841
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,300
That's just the way it is at this hour

842
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,580
in the morning for most normals.

843
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,260
Well, back to the parade now.

844
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,860
As you can see, the marching infants band

845
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,060
has been passing by now with all those little instruments

846
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,220
are welded to their little faces.

847
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,140
And they're about, well, from four months to eight months old.

848
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,300
It's just breathtaking here, the huge flowered floats

849
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,380
of the Dobbs head being pushed.

850
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:08,620
Bobbin.

851
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:09,380
Bobbin.

852
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,020
Yes.

853
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,180
And then the gigantic pipe float that you were just mentioning.

854
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,520
There's the inflator in the parade.

855
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,900
And now here's the inflatable pipe now.

856
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,720
And then there's the ocotisma head right behind it.

857
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:19,420
And the giant.

858
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,760
This must be one of the doctor bands that are coming up here.

859
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,200
About a mile down the avenue there,

860
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,480
I can see the giant bloody head of Arnold Palmer,

861
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,300
which is an exciting moment for the children here.

862
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,180
Because that drips real blood.

863
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,800
And they like to run out and get the blood.

864
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,920
And it helps well.

865
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,280
Yes.

866
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,760
Although completely severed, the head will bleed forever.

867
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,080
OK.

868
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,840
And World Cup golfers are great.

869
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:35,840


870
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,180
Very important in this part of the world.

871
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,360
More important than many of the sports figures except for,

872
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,200
and now we have the wonderful treat that all of the children

873
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,540
have been waiting for, Vic Morrow.

874
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,720
That's a repulsive cycle.

875
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,520
Now don't do that.

876
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,460
You're making me nervous.

877
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,120
And above all, don't place a limitation on your own future.

878
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,140
You know, my real estate course is merely

879
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,840
a course to some people, an article.

880
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,940
It's just another item of information to be tossed away.

881
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,960
These short-sighted bobbies simply cannot see the great opportunity

882
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,500
that lies before them in such a unique program as our show.

883
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,480
Exactly.

884
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,960
You see, it's always bend over and with a cheerful grunt

885
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,900
to pick up any dime that you find before you.

886
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,920
And with a pocket full of these, you'll soon have a dollar.

887
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,120
And well, this dollar can be the first step in a series of steps,

888
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,740
from stepping stones to high-stepping success.

889
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,720
Soon you'll be goose-stepping over the bodies of the poor and decrepit

890
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,040
as you march your way...

891
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

892
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,700
I was a little bit too exuberant there.

893
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,620
These folks are going to have to go to the wall,

894
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,820
but then that is necessary for you to achieve...

895
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,180
...true wealth and power, such as I, Dr. Howell Weald,

896
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,580
in my giant mansion with my fleet of expensive automobiles

897
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,100
and terrified children.

898
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:05,940
And I'm a very tired, cowering servant.

899
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,220
And you can be like me and splash in my giant warm water pool

900
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,000
with a bevy of idiots.

901
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,920
It's all possible.

902
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,280
Just grasp the brass ring...

903
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,380
...and with my robotized investment counselors,

904
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:29,940
I need not lift a pencil to scratch my John Hancock on a single document

905
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:34,400
to get Rich's creases by 12 p.m. daily.

906
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,400
Sensational is just no good.

907
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,980
The most sophisticated robot on the planet could...

908
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,900
Yes, this giant robot will answer all your questions.

909
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:45,580
And once you become a member of my real estate seminar,

910
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:51,180
this robot will teach you how even a non-human can achieve financial parity

911
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,580
in today's collapsing money market.
