You feel lucky tonight, Bob, you feel lucky tonight, Bob, you feel lucky, Bob, you feel lucky.
Lucky.
Gosh.
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Black, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
I'm coming around, I see your children, I see them, I see you're going down for the
ground.
Hey!
Hey!
Bob is our forecast now, Bob is our forecast, Bob is our forecast now, Bob is our forecast,
Bob is our forecast.
Bob is our forecast now, Bob, the only thing I'm not really crazy about, Bob is our forecast.
All right, thanks, Bob.
Rub it up real good.
I got you.
I like the rub.
Rub it up real good.
Let me rub this one.
Let me rub that one.
Oh, I lost it now.
I was going to get naked, rub it all over my body and carry a can of Alpo and rub it
on my genitalia and go like maybe wear a pit bull in the heat and start making fun of it
and make noises and stuff.
I mean it all look like I'm naked.
I'm mad at myself and I have no exercise and I'm starting to have all these tears in my

I try a couple of times and then I Shinier's Nations crush me and then my 뛰 bigger
than I come around and I sit down.
I only even some real you know.
I can't drag my pants out.
I can't drag my pants out.

Yeah.
All right, so I disgusting bitch, I'm dying.
Just have that in my stinks so I can have enough compaction andласens on my shit.
Yeah, have some energy boost riding to some more happiness and I'm gonna still be alive
and healthy at this point.
And I think that's going to be great.

Yeah, that's exactly what he's trying to get through.

baby. You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, well, like that pit bull
in that Alpo, you know. That could be
kind of disastrous there, Dave.
Well, that's the disaster I'm looking for.
It's disaster,
man. Not lonesome cowboy
Dave. Wearing his
pants made of Alpo into a
pit full of pit bulls.
That's it, man. He's a love god.
He's a groin trepanation
freak.
Hooky, hooky, hooky, come on, baby.
You thought Don Knotts was a love
god. Wait until you see
love god lonesome
with his Alpo
britches.
Baby, oh, baby. Oh, that's all right, Mama.
Just get your hand away from there.
I'm waiting for Husky.
I passed out.
How did you get in here?
You're not supposed to be in here.
I am supposed to be in here.
It's my show.
That's right. Mine. All mine.
And
a little
snippet there from the
last show in Cleveland,
friends, and we've got
oh so ever much coming up.
What have I got for this show
here tonight, friends? We've got
a bit more.
The last of the recordings from
Cleveland, the
and the Austin
prank call
extravaganza
starring the Crystal Methodist.
We're going to do a lot
of music this time. We've got some
X-Day songs that people
may have forgotten and
Indian Rope Burn. We'll do a little
tribute to that fine
band and
we've got some KPFA
and some Janer Wellman
and a little bit of
everything. But you know, girls,
X-Day is only eight months off.
This gives us eight cycles
for us to sync up and bleed
in one great Technicolor
unison.
Even if we all have to move
into a one-bedroom walk-up
on the east side, the lower east
side together, we must all be
in heat come X-Day.
All men,
the hairy barbarian scum,
must be driven into a breeding
frenzy by the scent of
our albunimal
spooge. We must
mate with those who don't kill each other
in their stupid sexual posturing
rituals. We will take them to our
lairs. We will let them kiss
and suckle our
ovipositors. And at the moment
of climax, we will
eat their heads
and use their bleeding neck
stumps as quivering
dildos.
Only Stang
shall be allowed to pleasure
us all, and on X-Day
he will choose the queen of the new
Xist brood. If it is
not me, I will submit
to the will of Stang and his queen
and ovipositor
shall caress ovipositor
and we will bear a million
Stangian eggs.
Join me, sisters. It is time for us
to unite in our discharge.
Signed,
Sister Arachnid,

Well, by the time you hear this show,
BugSexGirl will probably have died
because they only live about three weeks.
But, friends,
the subgeniuses
are getting excited about X-Day.
As of this
recording, it's 223
days away,
seven months approximately,
and you
ought to see the arguments
and vindictive
hatefulness that's starting to...
to happen. It's practically civil wars
in subgenius land. If you look at the
news group
alt.slack
on the internet, that's just been a
shameful
display of
faithlessness. In many cases,
people are, like, going, well, what are
they going to do if the saucers
don't get here?
And other silly questions like
that. And, friends, for those of you
who are not familiar with the
main basic doctrine,
of the Church of the Subgenius,
Bob Dobbs, the world overlord
in secret,
living avatar of
slack, discovered that there was
a conspiracy of normal people
stealing away the slack of all the weirdos.
However,
come July 5th,
1998, at 7 o'clock
in the morning,
starting at the
Pacific dateline,
or the international
dateline,
so-called men from Planet X,
the exists, godlike
beings from other
dimensions, will
come to this planet to destroy
all the unbelievers and
to reward those who
became $30 subgenius
ministers with
two, count them, two
utopias
and eternal paradises
in heaven, or hell, or whatever.
That's what this is all about,
dear friends, and
now that you know that, I guess I can just
probably, I could probably
just shut up.
What else? Oh, I should mention this
in the news here.
We love to do the news every week
now. The news from The Onion,
the
newspaper of Madison,
Wisconsin.
Report,
drug use down among
uncool kids.
According to a study released
Monday by the Department of Health and Human
Services, drug use is on
the decline among
uncool kids in the United
States. While nearly 80%
of cool kids, whose levels
of substance abuse have risen steadily
throughout the 90s, use drugs,
the study found that just .007%
of uncool
kids between the ages of 12 and 19
use drugs, down from
.012% in
1990.
Really, this should surprise
no one, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala said.
If you ever met any of these kids, you'd be
amazed they ever left their
own bedroom, let alone
smoked
a joint.
DEA guidelines established in
1989 define
quote, uncool kids,
unquote, as those who are
introverted and passive,
possess academic aptitude
and physical ungainliness,
and live in constant fear of
things that really aren't that big a deal.
Now, this description, friends,
obviously includes a lot of subgeniuses.
Speaking for myself,
I'm no longer one of those
uncool kids, but there was a time
when I definitely was.
Among the uncool kids polled for the
federal study were high school yearbook
editors, people unable to
do chin-ups for the President's Council
on Physical Fitness test,
forensics club secretary treasurers,
and newspaper
carriers.
Saving their money to buy a
capsella set. I don't understand
that. Well, anyway, friends,
that's a shame about the
uncool kids.
You know, but somebody's got to do it,
I guess.
I'm so glad I became cool.
You know, did all
the things that were expected of a
young fellow back in the
70s. Unfortunately, I'm
still doing the same things that I
did to be cool back in the 70s, so I guess
I'm not really very cool.
anymore.
Friends, let's
proceed.

So, I haven't seen you in six years
Video and radio
And instead of having a conversation
We're just going to get on the radio and rant
Yes, I think that's the general idea
We'll just get on and deliver a load of blather
This actually makes more sense than the real world
Some supposed quote real unquote conversation we might have
Yes, because...
Then we just live in the dark
They are forced to listen to you
Duh
And now we may speak without contradiction or interruption
Duh
Yes
So now that we got rid of all the contradictions, obstacles and interruptions
And now we can't think of anything to say
Well, we could tell them about our plan for future domination of the world
Yeah, well, just tell them about commotion instead
Excess
Talking about future
Commotion, yeah, that's where it starts or where one of them starts
We're going to make the world eat out of a dog bowl, man
You'll see that
But first you buy the world a coke
And keep it company
And pull its pants down to its shoes
And...
And Jaina Hyperclete at the club commotion at the horror church
That's right, that's quite true
I, Dr. Howell, will be present in a spiritual fashion
To shepherd the proceedings through thick and thin
All the naked women and whores will have to...
Obey the common rules of civility and parliamentary procedure
Are you going to have a...

So if you don't remember to send money
To bring money
To also to send money
You should bring money because there is a cover charge of three bucks
Or if you take off all your clothes, they'll put them in a plastic bag
And naked as you were born, you may enter the presence of Saint Jaina the Hyperclete
You're not kidding, neither
This is really real
I told you this is real
This is not some satire that we're making up
No, no, this time we're serious
We're like...
No, this isn't part of a rant
It's really...
It's really...
It's not a joke
Okay, well it is sort of a joke
But it means a real joke
It's not a fake joke
Don't...
Don't lie in that way
I...
Just tell them it's real, brother
What about that part?
Is that real?
And it really, really works
Ronco presents the Cap Snapper
And you also get Jaina Hyperclete appearing at Club Commotion
Ow!
As part of the horror show







And you use the project to fire starters
And there's more
You use fire starters to fire starters
And it really, really works
And remember, every donate, every penny you donate to the My Wallet Foundation, nothing
is taken out for advertising costs, nothing is taken out for administration costs, there's
no fancy limos
Every cent you donate goes directly into My Wallet
No other charity can make that claim
Well, you see, this is part of a program which has been attracting lots of attention
in the greater Bay Area
I'll send you my porn
You're not gonna get it




And in all of Northern and Central California, the rush, the headline rush to give all you
have to Jaina Hyperclete
Whistled right into the ground, buddy
Is one of the most astonishing phenomena of modern times
Yes, we're down here on Channel X, you can see the Jaina device and Dr. Howell, there
they go, they're engaging now in the liquid slack bank
Wow, I'm really getting a lot of attention, that's why I went into show business the first

Now the nurses have washed the Jaina off
I have to go to the bathroom for some reason
They're beginning to clean the fins
Hello

Yes, we've got a little bit of a show here
Please join us
We'll allow you to go to the bathroom

Oh
Bob's is Bob's.
Great Bob.
How you doing, son?
I'm, I'm, I'm...
Poor Bob.
Thanks, Bob.
I almost felt sorry for you.
All right, thanks, Bob.
Thanks for coming to the show.
But, you know, the, um...
What really disgusted me more about that
than the fact that they couldn't spell Bob's name right
and they had the dates wrong and all that shit
was the way the normals,
the normals took it upon themselves to go,
oh, all these pundits on television and the radio
had to take it upon themselves to go,
gosh, isn't it a shame about those silly, superstitious weirdos
who believe that some invisible space gods
would save them if they kissed its ass enough?
Gee, isn't that terrible?
And what it boiled down to was it was a society of Americans
and everybody all over the world
basically saying to the Heaven's Gators
and any other kind of dead weirdos,
ha, ha, ha, my invisible monster
is bigger than your invisible monster.
Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.
Mine let me live and yours killed you.
Now, friends, you might laugh at how, you know,
these are the same people that believe Noah built a boat
that took two of every animal on it.
And you can laugh, but the fact is
87% of Americans believe
really believe in that invisible monster.
And because of them,
there is a fucking invisible monster up there.
But, friends, you can fight back.
We will fight back.
As a matter of fact, we will turn the tables.
And as of this moment,
we now declare war on God.
Now, I'd say that takes a little bit of balls,
don't you think, in ovaries?
It's not everything.
It's not the church that declares war on God.
But just between you and me,
I find it rather offensive when
little old ladies and conservative pinch-faced yo-yos
feel like God is not big and strong enough
to protect himself from the offensive statements
of people like me.
You know, really, I mean, think about it.
There's, um, didn't, didn't,
wasn't there something in the Bible about
vengeance is mine, saith the Lord?
You know, don't these dumbasses give God
enough credit to be able to kick my ass?
Do they have to, you know, hold protests and have genius?
I wish they would, actually, God.
It makes me sick that they let us get away with this.
This country's going to the dog.
Thank God, thank, praise Bob,
there's only 245 days left.
Ah!
Ah!
War on God
War on God
War on God
War on God
War on God
War on God
War on God
War on God
War on God
War on God
War on God
Well, let me put it this way, okay,
a lot of people, if you just pick up
oh, um, some
magazine,
article about Church of the subgenius they always get wrong and they'll start going well it's for
the slackers yeah that's it you know like Generation X it's a religion for slackers
but still Bob's idea of slack is the diametric opposite of what the conspiracy wants you to
think Bob's idea of slack is the conspiracy wants to speak for Bob Dobbs himself and say
oh slack you know man slack that's like when life becomes a big Miller beer commercial
you drink a 12-pack your team wins sorry
you
you're watching your very favorite show and you're doing a nice job that doesn't really
challenge anybody and and by the way stay away from that creepy internet and don't turn
that dial whatever you do don't turn off that television because then your slack will end
oh yeah friends I'll tell you something it doesn't matter you know we used to worry oh
this Sunday the televisions will watch us back hey as long as you're watching that tube
it doesn't have to watch it
it just
you can watch some crap on that tube
they're got you right where they want you slack is not the same thing as laziness either difference
friends it can be it certainly can be it can slack can be sitting there in front of the tv watching
you know drinking beer all day and watching your favorite cartoons praise bob but it can also be a
frenzied insane level of uber work in the service of bob dobbs or even in the service of yourself
it can be such a high level of activity and so little sleep that your third eye snaps open
and for once for once in your life you're smart enough just for an instant to realize that you
are god life is worth living and the world is still just as cool and psychedelic and beautiful
as that old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore now hold that thought hold that thought
just hang on to it get a grip on that slippery thing and and pay
it back
friends because i know how easy it is to let the conspiracy or the day job you know the
the depression the pittness all around you to drag you down i know how that works
but you can break the cycle you can break that evil cycle and we're here to prove it
we're here to prove that by example that you can indeed get rich but without working price bomb
but there's only one there's only one way to do that friends you've got to just you've got to just say no
to jobs just say no to jobs you've got to get off your butt and do it yourself don't expect
the aliens or the or magic to save you i know there's probably some people here that really
you know they go well i know that praying won't help but if i do magic and obey you know and do
like that alistair crowley and all that cool stuff then i'll have my own guardian demons and stuff
friends magic may be real but uh judging by its practitioners belief in it i'm afraid does
defeat the purpose and as for the aliens oh well you know you can wait for the aliens which ones
you're gonna wait for little pipsqueak greys the ones with the flying saucers that crash
you're gonna have to do it yourself friends
you can learn to think for yourself but only bob can show you how and that's this this religion in
fact any religion all religions that's all it is it's just a big pep talk it's kind of like a booster
shot yeah magic hey anybody here practicing magicians as they call it oh man well i'd like to
i'd like to um talk to you
about magic and religion and dumb superstitions
i was somebody sent me a copy of the the special magazine that you get if you are a fifteen
thousand dollar a year scientologist and sure enough for the people who are brilliant enough
to send fifteen thousand bucks a year to the church's scientology get the dumber magazine
than the free one
it had testimonials in it like this one a picture of a nice grinning pink boy saying
one day someone stole my bike out of my garage well thanks to scientology i went outdoors
and rode all around my neighborhood and i found my bike
well friends what that man learned for fifteen thousand dollars from the church of scientology
i'm about to tell you for free what that man learned was the first time he had been to the


church of science and he was like oh my god i'm going to go to the church of science

well he said well it's called the first key of magic which we say and here's the key get off your ass
no seriously you know that is the first key to magic get off your ass if you want a girlfriend
if if you really really need a girlfriend talk to a girl if you want to change you hate your job
you really really hate that job
talk to another company friends get off your ass is king solomon's first key to magic here is key number two the second key
bust your ass you will get even more magic done by busting your ass key number three even better get others to bust their asses for you
if you can do that then you have achieved i guess we could say you have achieved true ass holiness
now key number four
watch your ass
watch your ass and friends if you can remember all four of those keys and do those things then you won't have to worry about anyone trying to kick your ass
for lessons on ass kicking see dr legume after the show
now um
now needless to say friends all of these rules all kinds of rules like they teach in most religions should be plain common sense
i mean really you know what they should go without saying
our
plus
ap
wash your ass
water as we really got a hot pair of tights that's good and do you have a couple dollars we have but let's just just see for one second honey not like anybody else it's just love in a bad mood so much was hurry up and have as many mus уб Walt benf heroes like to donate money or anything at wosh us you never have cash eat me in albany we you don't want to do the tumors any time so you had no money on account so you need your own clients on behalf of the bruce ehout donner that's warning anyway that we maybe kinda break theious cock there in theまあ there goes if they're gonna take it up here we're getting mentioned that he brought to the mixin but all supports return this midday become emotional like me yeah
should have said that one number one some of you boys and girls may feel like
you're gonna meet up you're gonna need matching to get laid well friends a
personal hygiene could go a long way in that direction it really could I want
you to stop and think about that that inner subgenius short duration personal
marriage available right here about two hours from now
no but seriously friends whatever happened in common sense you know you
would think that you would that people would wouldn't have to be told over and
over again be nice to other people and other people will be nice to you
actually that doesn't always work out that way and you know some people are
just plain assholes and you should avoid them or kill them repent quit your job
slack off salvation begins at home stay home from your job

You're waiting up your neck in a sea of Bob's pills.
You're just too deaf, dumb, and blind and toneless to taste them, friends.
So don't let the conspiracy turn it into slackers versus slack

You know, we're now, we've been around 15 years,

Ah, yes dear friends, and uh,
I've been wanting to do a, um, a little, a little tribute
subgenius band called Indian Rope Burn for a while here. These guys have played at almost
every show we've done up in the Cleveland area over the years, and that's a lot of shows.
We're not able to play at the last one, and so I'm going to make up for that.
As of right this minute, Indian Rope Burn, friends. Thank you.

This is the song I did the video garage for.
I wish that someday y'all could see it.
It was full of the most delicious Hong Kong evil.
The thoughts remain, arms and legs feel the same.
Swing the whip, caress the feet.
Your pleasure is my pain.
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red light.
The red light, the red light, the red light still burns in your eyes.
The red light, the red light, the red light still burns in your eyes.
The faces change, the thoughts remain.
Arms and legs feel the same.
Still the same.

Illuminate the darkness.
Skip your love for me.
Cut down your soul, build it up again.
The red light, the red light, the red light still burns in your eyes.
The red light, the red light, the red light still burns in your eyes.
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red light.
You now know why I'm alive.
Cold and cold.
And I don't let the boring past痛.

For a sad, wanting husband.
Straight to a very cold love that I don't care how I maybe have felt.
So sweet, happy, wonderful and degrading…

The такое, the terror, you and your gang are the ultimate superhero.



But now come back how I once became yours.
I'm the second baby, the Quarren leader's physician from a faừ.




So, let's face this.
Cut it.
Through the city, underground
The sirens scream tonight
Meet me there, the sacred hall
Turn on your red light
The faces change, the thoughts remain
Arms and legs feel the same
Swing the whip, caress the feet
Your pleasure is my pain

Okay, friends.
I'm gonna try something here.
I'm gonna try to play back the recordings of the prank calls made to a Christian radio
station in another state from the subgenius devival in Austin, Texas by the
group of prank or telephone sociological experimenters called the Crystal
Methodists. Okay friends, this is the Crystal Methodists trying to ply their
trade live over loudspeakers being overheard by an entire paying audience at
a subgenius show, but at the same time trying to prank a talk show host or a
series of talk show hosts actually at a Christian talk radio station a thousand
miles away. This was at the Austin Devival a couple of months ago thanks to
Fringeware.
Fascism for the individual! It's what we call
patriopsychotic and narco materialism. The political party of the Church of the Subgenius.
How you doing Josh?
Yeah, pretty good. Is this the Leaf here?
It is Leaf.
Yeah, how you doing?
I'm fine, what's on your mind?
Well, I'm calling up because, well, I have two concerns here. One of them is, well, I really like what you're saying about the
humanism in the church today in America.
I've had two concerns.
I've had some first-hand experience.
You're probably one of them, right?
Hedonism in the church? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'll get to me later.
But first, a town of mine, well, he and I have been messing around with different forms of religion and in particular a cult called the Church of the Subgenius.
Now, this cult of the subgenius is dangerous.
I'm sure it is, Josh, but we're talking about hedonism tonight. I don't know what you're talking about.


I want to talk about the Church of the Subgenius.
I'm getting to that. I'm getting to that.
Well, you better get there quickly, my friend, or otherwise I'm going to dump you.
Oh, okay. All right. He was a good Christian. I turned him over to Bob in the worship of Splash.
What?
And he took it to such an extreme that he gave up all worldly possessions to live in a cave in Arizona, relying on nothing but the Lord to keep him alive.
Now, if that isn't crazy.
I don't know what is. And it's all thanks to this Bob.
Well, Bob's on the other line, so let's go to Bob and see what Bob has to say. Bob, are you there?
Yes, sir.
Is this the Bob that took everybody out in the desert and lived in caves?
No, I'm just Bob, just regular Bob.
Oh, okay. Well, you heard the other guy talking about Bob, and I saw your name, Bob, and you're calling from the same city, and I just figured you're maybe the cave dweller guy or something.
That's crazy.
What's up, Bob?
No, I've been accused of being a cave dweller. I'm always on my computer.
But other than that, I get out every now and then.
Well, friends, I changed my mind. I decided that the sound quality on that recording is so bad that that requires us to go back to the Cleveland show, which was recorded quite a bit better, where there was a song, in fact, about weirdos in Arizona.
This is Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing the song.
Now, we will come back to the crystal Methodist amazing pranking of that Christian radio station probably next week, because it really deserves an entire show devoted to it.
They not only had Brother Russell, or Melba, as the case may be, calling from our devival, but they also had subgeniuses connected through the radio station.


They were all over the country calling that same station that same night, and repeatedly bringing up the subject of Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius, and so forth, and basically driving the poor bastard crazy to the great astonished amusement of the live audience at the Austin concert.
But we'll do that next week.
In the meantime, the truth about the state of Arizona.


It's not a place you want to go alone.
It's not a place you want to go if you have too many clothes.
It's not the place you want to go.
Toe or allergic to red clay and red sand.
It's not a place at all.
This is a true story.
It's a part of your brain.
Another true story.
It's another true testimonial tonight.
I want to tell to you all tonight this true story.
It happened in Arizona.
And we were camping out.
Actually, Michelle and I, the violinist Michelle and I were camping out.
I thought you were with Louie that night.
Guitarist Lonesome Cowboy Dave was not there.
Other guitarist Lou Kolai was also not there.
And our drummer Bob Mosick was not there either.
It was just Michelle and I.
And we were there camping out about a mile from the Grand Canyon.
At about 3 in the morning.
Sparks started to fly in the sky.
I came down there.
And we noticed that there were black ravens flying in the sky at night.
And there was this guy out there in the middle of the wilderness, the middle of the desert.
At 3 in the morning.
Just chanting.

espanyol Cantiles fumaria arrugado,
I'm riding alone out on my own in a land of sand and stone.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I work with my hands in a land born free.
Live in a white house in Canyon DeShay.
What I take I give to living in peace.
Awareness is a universe through your eyes and sees and knows.
Sweet.
Deep in duties are a state of mind.
You're so at sea.
They just walk, walk, walk into the light.
And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I work with my hands.
I work with my hands.
Building castles made of sand.
I'm riding alone out on my own in a land of sand and stone.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
It's beautiful now.
But what kind of living in Arizona do you want to have to survive on this planet?
Is it better because an operator will take care of you first?

No, I've lived very few settled in the US.




Me.

Yes, dear friends, you're listening to
Einstein's Secret Orchestra
live at
Goodbye, Mom.
Goodbye, Dad.
Goodbye, Chaz.
Goodbye, Dave.
I gotta go in the tuna can now, Ma.
I gotta get on the pleasure ship.
Time for the launch.
I gotta go on the pleasure ship now, Ma.
It's X-Day.
I gotta go into space, Ma.
Goodbye, son.
You know how them Smith boys
are.
And I'm never coming home.
Einstein's Secret Orchestra,
dear friends, at the
subgenius revival at
Euclid Tavern in Cleveland
a couple of months ago.
Yes, and
before we continue,
I should mention that you can
learn all you need to know
about Einstein's Secret
Orchestra, and here's a
little bit of a sneak peek.
Here's their Thursday night
radio show over the internet
at www.wcsb.org.
You can
obtain CDs
of Ego Plum,
who we have not played at all tonight,
but for the last
four shows we did,
from www.

ebolamusic.com.
And of course,
subgenius.com.
That's Bob at
post office box 140306
Dallas, Texas 75214.
Once again, that's Bob
at box 140306
Dallas, Texas 75214.
It's coming back up.
Yeah.
Whoa!
It's intense, man.
Do some really sick twisted things
so you don't want to miss what's happening.
Is that my penis buzzing?
No, it's the back of my neck.
I hear the voices again.
This is a...
This is a part that's just like a rock concert.
So if you all want,
you can take out your lighters
and sway back and forth
to the beat.
There.
Just like a real rock show.
The day unfolds
from lamplight streams
The asphalt shimmers
from blackened streams
And all about my feel and smell
and sense your presence, Neil
The lines are drawn
the wrong direction
Then I am the one
I'm aware
No words in books
here have a look
There's something in the air
And measurements of time
are crumble and climb
For Jaguar
Knight
and White Deer
So I'm drooling
And stopping late
I don't know, I really, I'm dazzled
I don't know what I know
Oh, look at all that
Just let me at least
do something
For all theseachusetts
On every conventional

drop-in
I ain't home that night
I won't be in doom
I'll arrive home
Measurements of time, a couple of times, for day or night, that's why it's me.
Living in jungles of radio waves, never now or ever or yesterday,
and just now in the air, we're black.
Well, just now in the air, we ran out of the tape.
And so we go from Einstein's Secret Orchestra to back to the 70s.
Actually, this is from the 90s.
Guitar god Frank Marino. Thank you.
guitar solo
Well, I see your power, baby, now.
And I see your power coming around.
I see your children lashing out
I see you're going down for the count
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
I've never loved you
But what you're gonna be
You've never gone too sweet
Hey!

Hey!
Hey!
I see you riding on the road
I see you headed for a fall
I see you ballooning on your best
I see that you're going down with a last
Thank you.
