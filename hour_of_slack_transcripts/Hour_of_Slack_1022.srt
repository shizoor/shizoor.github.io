1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm allowed to remain in contact with children, despite PR News.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,740
On Wall Street 3 1⁄2, President Bush says,

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,540
PR's bad.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,680
The Energy Department is warning that suicide bombers will be up to 50% higher.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,440
Some Republicans had argued that they could not support PR News in Washington.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,980
Get your things out of this house right now before I throw them into the street and you wet them.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:27,400
Bye, June.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,480
Get out before I...

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,720
Yeah!

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,620
Close the door, Cratchit! Shut out that infernal noise!

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,660
So I'm down in the basement

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,840
Racking up all the points

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,940
Killing binary soldiers

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,160
And trashing all the joints

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,360
I'm the dungeon master

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,380
Master of all I see

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,720
Scoffing up for pizza

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,720
Playing a little D&D

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,860
Mom peeps into Crash the Show

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,140
She scowls and frowns and says,

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,060
What do you know?

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,460
She says, you gotta do something someday

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,940
What you gonna do?

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,160
What you gonna do?

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,320
What you gonna do?

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,460
What you gonna do, Junior?

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,540
Good day, Bob.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,140
I say you think you know me

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
And what I do?

30
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm gonna do what I can do

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,820
I live in such a world of fools

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,600
I'm a musician

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,060
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,260
I'm gonna picket my guitar

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,560
I'm gonna strum me some chords

36
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm gonna picket my guitar

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,040
I'm gonna get with my fellas

38
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,980
I'm gonna put it all together

39
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,260
I'm gonna make a smash hit!

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,480
Just like Molly Hadgett

41
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,580
Just like Dashiell Hammett

42
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,880
Ain't no one gonna match it

43
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,160
Ma says that nothing in life is free

44
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,880
You ain't going nowhere

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,040
Playing D&D

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,340
You ain't going nowhere

47
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,340


48
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,940
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,040
Here's what I'm gonna do

50
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,940
I'm gonna put it all together

51
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,060
I'm gonna make her smash it

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Just like Molly Hatchet

53
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,380
Just like Dashiell Hammett

54
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,680
Ain't no one gonna match it

55
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,060
I'm gonna make her smash it

56
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,760
Not convenient and it's not fair

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Hey boy, hey boy

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,260
I got a message for you

59
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,960
About a thing called love and the stars above

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,340
And a little white dove since pushed her to shove

61
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,020
To fists and cuffs

62
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,100
Things really got rough but it does enough

63
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,600
Hey boy, hey boy

64
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,960
I heard it from a friend about you

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,860
About your hatred

66
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,760
When you're lying in your bed

67
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
And your face turns red

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,020
With your hatred fed

69
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,700
From the things you said

70
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,320
And you wish you were dead

71
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,480
Because you're separated

72
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,160
From a thing called love and the stars above

73
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,560
And a little white dove since pushed her to shove

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,220
To fists and cuffs

75
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,340
Things really got rough but it does enough

76
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,660
To smash it

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,800
Hey boy, hey boy

78
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,260
I heard it from a friend about you

79
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,480
That your heart is broken

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,000
And your anger's smoking

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,700
And you're lying there poking at a lid

82
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,120
Talking of days gone by

83
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,500
You laid outside

84
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,260
To fill your eyes

85
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,860
And you just started to cry

86
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,460
And say oh God why

87
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,200
And you wish you could die

88
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,740
And your eyes are dry

89
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,400
And time don't fly

90
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,080
On you's a hellish night

91
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,660
I'm gonna make her smash it

92
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:21,900
I'm gonna make her cry

93
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,720
And your eyes open wide

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,460
Oh that's a hellish right

95
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,660
As you go swishing from side to side

96
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,980
Because you feel hatred

97
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,000
When you're lying in your bed

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,660
And your face turns red

99
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,200
With your hatred fed

100
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,920
From the things you said

101
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,540
And you wish you were dead

102
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,740
Because you're separated

103
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,340
From a thing called love and the stars above

104
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,860
And a little white dove since pushed her to shove

105
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,480
To fists and cuffs

106
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,200
Things really got rough

107
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,520
But it does enough

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,100
Hey boy, hey boy

109
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,160
Hey!

110
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,240
I heard it from a friend about you

111
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,780
From the American Astronaut, dear friends

112
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,560
The great film, The American Astronaut

113
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,060
The music, I think, is performed by

114
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,560
The Billy Nayer Show

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,080
And you should learn more about that

116
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,880
From theamericanastronaut.com

117
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,660
Or the Billy Nayer Show

118
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,340
Or thebillynayershow.com

119
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,580
And before that smash hit

120
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,540
Is by our own

121
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,000
Reverend Norrell Preff

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
And you can get a lot more

123
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,820
Of his at

Dot com

127
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,900
And Lee Murr opened for us

128
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,800
And this is Hour of Slack number

129
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,160
1022

130
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,260
The Billy Nayer Show, by the way

131
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,060
Will be at 9X Day

132
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,540
Yes, the subgenius

133
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,020
Fantabulous

134
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,520
Love Fest

135
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,860
Called X Day

136
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,000
This will be our ninth one, yeah?

137
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,700
Yeah, we say

138
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,700
We say yeah to X Day 9

139
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,340
Now we're gonna have some fun

140
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,480
They kill for one reason

141
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,880
They kill for food

142
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
They eat their victims

143
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,260
You understand that, Mr. Berman?

144
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,460
That's what keeps them going

145
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,360
The more you run over a dead cat

146
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,960
The flatter it gets

147
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,200
Give me the girl or die

148
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,000
Well

149
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,440
If I have a choice

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,840
I'll take death

151
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
So be it

152
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,400
Or pursue your present course

153
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,920
And face obliteration

154
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,180
You can just go to hell

155
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,400
You go to hell and you die

156
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,440
I'd like to repeat that

157
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,240
Because it sounds vaguely important

158
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,920
You are fined one credit

159
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
For a violation of the verbal morality

160
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,180
Maniac is imminent

161
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,280
Request advice

162
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,340
Hey, I'm tired of talking

163
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,460
When you gonna do me, huh?

164
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,980
It's a very difficult job

165
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,420
And the only way to get through it

166
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,740
Is we all work together

167
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,140
As a team

168
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,160
Jeff, don't do that

169
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,500
We haven't

170
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,400
I've got business baking

171
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,980
And don't tell

172
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,180
Lambre Systems did that

173
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,880
And you can get free videos

174
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,060
From Lambre Systems

175
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,500
At lambre-systems.com

176
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,540
And now from the album

177
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,600
Pairs in Bob's Ears

178
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,420
The great Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger

179
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,480
Jehovah

180
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,520
One is sent a new Messiah

181
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
He's the one who grins

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,880
And smokes the pipe

183
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,740
For in a world of darkness

184
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,440
Danger and despair

185
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
We can go on smiling

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,240
Cause we know that Bob Dobbs

187
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,200
Is always there

188
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,700
And I know that Bob's on my side

189
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,740
I know it as sure as I'm born

190
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,200
He will make the proper deal

191
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,480
With the exes

192
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,040
And the most racist whore

193
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,500
Then we'll come to meet him

194
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,560
Then we'll greet him

195
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,540
And rule forevermore

196
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,840
Bob is my one true savior

197
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,080
You can't keep all of the rest

198
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,540
Looking at his smiling face

199
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,240
Helps me when I'm depressed

200
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,760
For the pinks I sure feel sorry

201
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,700
For tomorrow they'll fry

202
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,080
With all the rest

203
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,620
Bob has got no real brain

204
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,760
To speak of

205
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Though his luck has seen him

206
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,480
Through the last year

207
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,000
And the last year

208
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000


209
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000


210
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000


211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,120
For all the geniuses

212
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,100
Led us on the wrong track

213
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,460
At least we know a subgenius

214
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,500
Won't turn around

215
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,600
And stab us in the back

216
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,900
The con thinks they have us suckered

217
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,940
But I know that that is a lie

218
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,460
They're due for a big surprise

219
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,440
From demons from the sky

220
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,900
Makes me so glad I'm wised up

221
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,980
Got it sized up

222
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,940
Hell I'm a lucky guy

223
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,620
Bob brought me slack

224
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,420
And that's lots more

225
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:51,480
To do

226
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


227
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


228
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


229
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


230
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


231
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


232
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


233
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


234
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


235
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,480


236
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,380
More than I ever got from the con

237
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,460
Though I know it's only

238
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,860
Cause of all those pills he's on

239
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,100
Heck I know he ain't too clever

240
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,540
But whatever he says I'll do or die

241
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,180
A new breed of rasta youth is currently dominating the reggae scene in Jamaica and around the world

242
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,480
Dressed in turbans and robes and preaching militant lyrics

243
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,700
With religious and social messages

244
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,680
The Bobber Dreads or Bobber Ashanti

245
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,020
Are some of the most imposing figures on the island

246
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,140
Now I've been playing tunes from Bobber artists for years

247
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,200
And there's all kind of rumours about members of the Bobber order

248
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,320
That they believe in racial segregation

249
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,820
Repress their women

250
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,480
And basically known as Jamaica's homegrown fundamentalists

251
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,580
Dancehall star Capleton

252
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,460
Whose lyrics include slackness

253
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,680
Reference to guns, sex and violence

254
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,460
Quote him

255
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,420
Calling himself the prophet

256
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,480
His lyrics became conscious and increasingly militant

257
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,380
Preaching reparturation of black people to Africa

258
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,440
Human rights, religious purity and the burning of the wicked

259
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,580
More and more artists started to throw their weight behind the Bobber movement

260
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,220
This new wave reggae had very strong lyrics

261
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,340
With reference to burning the government

262
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,060
And other parts of what the Bobbers called Babylon

263
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,740
The spiritual home of the Bobber Ashanti is in Bull Bay, Jamaica

264
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,160
Bobo Hill

265
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,780
Which was founded by leader Priest Emmanuel

266
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,360
Holy Manuela is last year I Jah Rastafari

267
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
What is very clear

268
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,460
I mean everybody here is dressed very traditionally

269
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,300
In turbans and robin

270
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,420
You get this feeling that you're a hundred years back

271
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,280
But when we do actually get inside

272
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,760
In their rooms, their computers, mobile phones

273
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,740
They're in 2004 definitely

274
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,720
Holy Manuela is last year I Jah Rastafari

275
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,300
Rastafari

276
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,420
The priest dressed in turban and long African robes

277
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,360
Invited me to join in prayers

278
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,540
Anytime you hear we talk about God

279
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,300
Christ, Father, Moses

280
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,740
This man we are talk upon

281
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,940
When we pray

282
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,700
When you see we come in and pray

283
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,400
This man we are pray to

284
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,520
Prophet, priest and king you see

285
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,480
Mostai

286
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,000
Slasya I Jah Rastafari

287
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,680
Priest Bob

288
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,380
Man, you should have seen the Bobo Dread last in the room

289
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,440
Man you should have seen the Bobo Dread last in the room

290
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,880
You see the Bobo Dread is a man we're well humble

291
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,860
Walk from dream and go straight to jungle

292
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,780
Hop on them shoulders is a big bundle

293
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,540
Priest Bob

294
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,880
Man they say we bring forward a purification

295
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,900
And a world peace

296
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,480
You know we wish everyone to them own vine and fig tree

297
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,180
This music, as I say, is a heart ball music. It walks under the earth like a living man.

298
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:00,220
It can make the hills and the mountains dance. The trees dance, the animals dance too.

299
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,000
It rises up earth, creates lightning and thunder in diverse places.

300
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,360
It's a comfort to the heart of the righteous and discomfort to the heart of the wicked.

301
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,300
It's cutting and clearing, renting and tearing, bringing down the pillars of Rome.

302
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:24,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, so long, so long, so long, so long, so long, so long, so long, so long, so long.

303
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,360
I'm coming from the land of the devil, the land of the dead.

304
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,480
They say that I'm the one who's dead. I'm a prince of peace.

305
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,640
I'm a prince of peace.

306
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,580
Bobo artists have to come to terms with spreading the good word through an unholy music.

307
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,080
We don't learn much at school, but we learn from the music.

308
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,280
So they see Bobo more and more, and they see them on stage.

309
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,160
Now they see them on the TV, music videos.

310
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,540
They start DJing and they say, yo, go buy Bobo and learn what's what.

311
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,400
Some Bobos become very rich and famous and change their lifestyles.

312
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,000
Whatever the case, artists calling themselves Bobo have been consistently topping the reggae charts worldwide.

313
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,140
Whatever gets you rich and famous, you're going to do a lot more of it to get more rich and more famous.

314
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,580
You better believe it's commerce.

315
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,840
Or is the Bobo artist popularity part of a global backlash against the dominant forces in the world?

316
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,380
For now, though, the Bobo movement is one of many faiths in a very religious country.

317
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,060
Although appearing extreme in some of their beliefs, Bobo is currently inspiring more lyrics than revolution.

318
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,100
He is known for singing some of the shyn breeze in thesey music.

319
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,100


320
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,100


321
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,100


322
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,440
There you go.

323
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,300
I won an English contest.

324
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:08,560
You watch the dance with the man I choose as gameplay.

325
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,740
Thank you.

326
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,520
Bye-bye.

327
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,800
Set tape recording made at a C in 1973.

328
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,460
I picked the gall darned terror of the frigging gods out of my nose.

329
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,960
Pardon my language.

330
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,660
But yee-haw, let the sons of God and man bear witness.

331
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,080
Even in the belly of the thunderbird I've been casting out the false prophets,

332
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,180
I'm busting a dud and blowing my o-ring, and right to throw a lobe.

333
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,220
For I speak only the frigging truth, and never in my days have I spoken other than.

334
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,280
For my every utterance is a lie, including this very one you hear.

335
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,000
I say, have sex with, em, if they can't take a joke.

336
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,880
My God, anything for a laugh, I say.

337
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,820
I am the last remaining homo correctus, I am the gall darned man of the future.

338
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,100
I'll drive a mile so, as not to walk a foot.

339
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,060
I drank the devil under seven tables, I am too intense to bite.

340
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,140
I cannot be tracked on radar.

341
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,800
I wear nothing uniform, I wear no gall darned uniform.

342
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,600
Yes baby, I'm twenty-three feet tall and have thirteen roseau breasts.

343
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,360
I was.

344
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,080
Suckled by a triceratops, I gave the ante's verge in a high protein tonsil wash.

345
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,480
I'm a bacteriological weapon, I'm armed and loaded.

346
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,700
I'm a fission reactor, I fork plutonium.

347
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,500
Power plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow.

348
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,560
You make me happy when I am blue.

349
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,540
Too low.

350
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,340
1-800-1961.

351
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,880
I'm acting just like an animal.

352
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,320
Is all the time I need and all the time I want.

353
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:36,980
Ample.

354
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,940
Antithesis.

355
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,160
Are you hungry?

356
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,700
Are you in good hands?

357
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,460
Ashes of a dead world.

358
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,140
And he moved an entire community back into the dark ages.

359
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,060
Uh-huh.

360
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,800
Better blood?

361
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,020
Bob called me.

362
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,720
I sing the body electric.

363
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,420
I sing the body electric.

364
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,660
I sing the body electric.

365
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,880
I sing the body electric.

366
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,100
I burn up.

367
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,200
But I made love.

368
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,900
I can't even play Perry Como.

369
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,960
Chip off the old block.

370
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,000
Chip off the old block.

371
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,780
Come on Alice

372
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,940
A dimension of wind.

373
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,920
Don't make any noise when the music's playin.

374
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,120
Don't paint the sun anymore.

375
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,400
Don't paint the sun anymore.

376
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,660
Don't touch, don't touch my tool.

377
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,080
T-Zone, cut up by Reverend Norrell Preff, and more of that to come later.

378
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,320
And for this next cover tune, I'm not sure who performed it.

379
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,160
Possibly Prozac for lovers.

380
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,880
Sitting on a park bench

381
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,800
Eyeing little girls with bad intent

382
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,980
Snot running down his nose

383
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,500
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes

384
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,720
Hey, Aqualung

385
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,800
Drying in the cold sun

386
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,800
Watching as the frilly panties run

387
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,880
Feeding like a dead duck

388
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,440
Spitting out pieces of his broken lung

389
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,680
Hey, Aqualung

390
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,140
Sun streaking cold

391
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,760
An old man wandering lonely

392
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,680
Taking time the only way he knows

393
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,360
Leg hurting bad

394
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,000
As he bends to pick a dog

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,520
And he goes down to the bar

396
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,620
And warms his feet

397
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,540
Feeling alone

398
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,280
The arm is up the road

399
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,920
Salvation, all the motive

400
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,880
And a cup of tea

401
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,020
Aqualung, my friend

402
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,780
Don't stop, don't stop me now

403
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:00,780


404
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:00,780


405
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,260
I'm not afraid of the way I need to see

406
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,260
Your poor old soul, you see

407
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,900
It's only me

408
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,800
From PR News in Washington, I'm hampered by a lack of city officials.

409
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,780
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has declared a state of PR news.

410
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,260
This is me.

411
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,040
And I don't get it.

412
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,340
You know this.

413
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,820
PR is a violation of obligations, nations.

414
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,380
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice exploded today in Texarkana, Arkansas,

415
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,760
aggravating several people by exposure to PR News in Washington.

416
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,060
Could you tell me a story before I go to bed?

417
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,600
Yes, I can, dear.

418
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,020
I'll tell you a story about the shrinking intellect.

419
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,100
It's about a whole town full of people whose brains got smaller at one time.

420
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,420
Well, it actually took about five years.

421
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,980
I don't know what started this.

422
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,600
I don't know.

423
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,080
Where it began.

424
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,460
But it reached such a sorry state that people would walk up and down

425
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,140
from one edge of the town to the other,

426
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,700
burbling inanities to each other

427
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,960
and sniveling off people they didn't quite dig.

428
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,200
And then, pretty soon, big hunks of their teeth fell out

429
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,500
because the decay had seeped down from their brain area all the way into their mouths.

430
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,940
And next thing you know, the tongues was a-wiggling,

431
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,380
and they were in pain.

432
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,160
That's right.

433
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,060
They were in some heavy, dark pain.

434
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,620
But the tongues kept a-wagging.

435
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,660
The brain was dead.

436
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,520
The brain had actually atrophied into a piece of lump.

437
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:30,800
A lumpage.

438
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,160
Say what?

439
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,260
Another prophetic vision.

440
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,440
You'll thank us for it later.

441
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,120
And he said, well, that may be, but I doubt it.

442
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,460
A lonesome cowboy Dave did that.

443
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:50,760
And now for some live clips from Radio Synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland

444
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,740
with host Dr. Sinister and callers,

445
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,080
Governor Rocknar, Big Johnson, and yours truly.

446
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,000
Yep.

447
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,900
There you go.

448
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,620
Yeah.

449
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,300
There you go.

450
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,980
Hey, I was going to say something, Rocknar.

451
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,900
How's your LCD projection TV doing?

452
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,240
Oh, it's doing great.

453
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,640
Hey, I was talking to a technician.

454
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,920
He says that in a couple of years from now,

455
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,580
you'll be putting a new bulb in that LCD projection TV.

456
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,980
Yeah, that's what they said.

457
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,720
Yeah.

458
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,040
Huh?

459
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,740
That's what they said at the store.

460
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
They said they'd help.

461
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,580
But the bulbs are actually cheaper.

462
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,400
Yeah, it's cheaper to get a bulb fixed.

463
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, a couple of years from now, after the X's come,

464
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,100
if you don't have that subgenius minister's card in your pocket,

465
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,080
you're going to be running that.

466
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,540
That projector with candlelight.

467
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,920
You're going to have a candle inside that video projector.

468
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:41,540
The X-Day prophecies are as relevant today as they ever have been.

469
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,080
You'll be reduced to 16 millimeter projectors after X-Day.

470
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,120
Yeah, I'll tell you one thing.

471
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,460
You're so lucky.

472
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
I'll tell you one thing, Stang.

473
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,820
You know, I mean, I understand that prophecy is prophecy,

474
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,580
but PR is PR.

475
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,060
And when you set a date like that,

476
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,160
I think a lot of people lost interest after the conspiracy in 1998.

477
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,680
That's what you think.

478
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,100
Well, we thought, yes, our business fell by half.

479
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,140
That's really...

480
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,000
We lost our mansions.

481
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,920
We lost several of our limousines.

482
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,240
Not to mention that, God almighty,

483
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,280
I can't even count how many employees and...

484
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,100
Quit?

485
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,440
Interns, as we call them.

486
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:27,780
Yeah.

487
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,560
That's...

488
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:29,840
So, yeah.

489
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:37,720
You know, obviously, a lot more people had faith in precisely that date

490
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,960
than I would have thought.

491
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,440
You know, it really boggles the mind,

492
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,100
because when you think of the subgenius type,

493
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,080
you don't think of them as being terribly punctual.

494
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,940
You don't think of them as being...

495
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,180
You think of them as the kind of people who have to constantly

496
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,720
check the calendar to see what month it is.

497
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,040
They probably didn't pay their taxes on time, either.

498
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,720
I didn't.

499
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,640
You know, I mean...

500
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,880
And that's not even the real...

501
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
calendar, anyway.

502
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,940
You know, we all know that that's the bogus conspiracy calendar.

503
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,680
We don't really know what date it is.

504
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,000
Well, the lesson of it all is that we don't know nothing.

505
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,480
Exactly.

506
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,600
And Bob Dobbs could come any second.

507
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,340
He could be knocking at your door

508
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,500
with a giant spaceship hovering outside,

509
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,300
and you're either going to have that ticket to ride,

510
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,680
or else you're going to be target practice.

511
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,420
Yep, yep.

512
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,140
We were sitting in the park.

513
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,900
It was a bright...

514
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,840
some shiny day.

515
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,840
We went on all the rides.

516
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,380
And then we died.

517
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,060
We went in the funhouse.

518
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,440
Charles Manson was there.

519
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,440
He was our guide.

520
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,180
And then we died.

521
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,860
It was a beautiful day

522
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,100
in the amusement park.

523
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,020
Not a cloud in the sky.

524
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,260
And then we died.

525
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,000
We went on the dive of cars.

526
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,820
They were going 87.

527
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,680
And the eights they declined.

528
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,160
And then we died.

529
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,800
We went on the sky ride.

530
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,600
We thought we could fly.

531
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,720
Gave it a try.

532
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,020
And then we died.

533
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,740
It was a beautiful day

534
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,020
in the amusement park.

535
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,860
Not a cloud in the sky.

536
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,100
And then we died.

537
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,340
We went to the Jeffrey Dahmer Lake in Intakistan.

538
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,080
Asked them what you got for dinner.

539
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,880
He said he just arrived.

540
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,280
And then we died.

541
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,040
We went on the rollercoaster.

542
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,860
It got off track.

543
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,820
We flew through the sky.

544
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,800
And then we died.

545
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,540
And then we died.

546
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,820
And then we died.

547
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,220
And then we died.

548
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,760
Duh, duh, duh, duh.

549
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,140
Duh, duh, duh, duh.

550
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,100
Duh, duh, duh, duh.

551
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,100


552
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,460
Duh, duh, duh, duh.

553
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,240
If I can't hop it, I'll go down.

554
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,560
Everybody's dead except me.

555
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,220
I do it every day.

556
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,320

00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,720
we have a constitutional guarantee of crime and violence

580
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,360
no matter who buys this material 75 to 90 percent of it ends up in jail

581
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,360


582
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,360


583
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,840
In one where they're getting lives Waar song

that only forked cookingAP香港才、 débθε公席 published here to look at these new things morning empty if you want

586
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,080
The teachers of unnatural sex acts

587
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,160
Their trust is gone

588
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,360
Military Kaplan's Association of the United States

589
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,580
That's living big

590
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,060
I spend a lot of time thinking

591
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,600
That's living big

592
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,700
Form a citizen

593
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,840
Or pervert

594
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,840
That's living big

595
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,800
My brain here is a lot of games, guys

596
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
By Saint Foo

597
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,040
And before that, Norrell Preff's T-Zone

598
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,300
And that song, And Then We Died

599
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,680
Was by Wally Pleasant

600
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,640
Actually, you know, it's funny

601
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,580
I'm looking at this

602
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:53,820
You know, I'm looking at this

603
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:53,820


604
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,020
UAIOE CD here again

605
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,020
And the guy on the cover

606
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,600
In the artwork

607
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,960
Kind of looks like Bob's evil twin

608
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,860
That had never occurred to me

609
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,460
Until just now

610
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,620
Well, this guy

611
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,340
This guy really does

612
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:03,840
He's got

613
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,540
He's got

614
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,460
Well, this is

615
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,260
This is from 1989

616
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,740
The artwork of Brute

617
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,420
No, this guy's got the hair

618
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,800
He's got the grin

619
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,340
He's got the

620
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,800
Like a lot of the so-called Bob clones

621
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,500
I've seen people just say

622
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,900
Oh, his smile kind of looks like Bob

623
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,460
Or oh, his pipe kind of looks like Bob's pipe

624
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,180
Or his hair kind of looks like Bob's hair

625
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,080
But like you never see

626
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,820
Like every Bob's pipe is like Bob's pipe

627
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,040
Or any Bob clone picture I've ever seen

628
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,400
You don't have all those qualities going together

629
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,640
Every now and then we find one

630
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,900
That is obviously really him

631
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,500
But they're quite rare, really

632
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,460
Actually, one I saw was

633
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,360
A Mr. Pipe character from Ren and Stimpy

634
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,420
I saw one

635
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,760
Now, that was Bob

636
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,440
That guy, you never saw his face, though

637
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,980
Right

638
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,660
That's how you know it was Bob

639
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,540
Yep, yep

640
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,080
Hey, I was gonna say something

641
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,780
You know, there's an easy way

642
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,340
Of getting around the whole UFO thing

643
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,440
Floating near your house

644
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,320
And you're gonna get attacked

645
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,100
When Bob comes to your door

646
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,080
Kill him

647
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,280
Exactly

648
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,220
Kill him

649
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,340
He'll be back in two minutes

650
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,140
Kill him

651
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,960
He'll be back

652
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,940
Keep killing him

653
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,560
He'll run out of ammo

654
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,960
The factories cannot pump out ammunition fast enough

655
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,920
Think how many times Elmer Fudd said that about Bugs Bunny

656
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,660
See what happened to Bugs Bunny

657
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,960
He just keeps coming back and back

658
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,420
Wile E. Coyote keeps coming back over and over again

659
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,420
I think Bob's like a vampire

660
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,040
He just put a stake through his heart

661
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,440
Nope

662
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,640
I mean Bob's like a exhausted burned animal

663
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:41,640


664
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:41,640


665
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:41,640


666
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:41,720
Get rid of anything

667
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:41,720


668
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,060
In the looseness of the web

669
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,040
The puzzle is just a game

670
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,960
In the looseness of the web

671
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,840
I know nothing

672
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,860
what i thought

673
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,360
human was

674
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,700
human

675
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,600
human

676
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,620
Marley Needs.

677
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,220
So it's a gag.

678
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,280
It's a prank.

679
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,120
Humanity, why do you bug us?

680
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,960
Oh, massive bring down.

681
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,280
The world is a bongo drum.

682
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,280
And we are merely the ubleo de suido de suido.

683
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,740
Hello, hello.

684
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,540
How are you?

685
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,720
From Smith.

686
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,680
Hello, hello.

687
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,300
My name is Juan Juan.

688
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,800
Hello, hello.

689
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:15,960
Hello.

690
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,500
Hello.

691
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,540
Hello.

692
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:19,840
Thank you.

693
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,880
He's lost his faculties.

694
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,600
Music mix by yours truly, I, Vin Stang.

695
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,780
This music that you've been hearing in the background, by the way,

696
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:37,460
is by the Flying Ryan Brothers from their new album, Blue Marble, a CD.

697
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,380
You can learn more about this incredible instrumental album,

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,040
That's R-Y-A-N.

702

Ryanetics.com.

703
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,580
I pay no taxes.

704
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,460
The devil's hands are my ideal playground.

705
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,960
I hold the seven-bladed windbreaker.

706
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,260
The wheels that turn are behind me.

707
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,360
I think backwards.

708
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,000
I do it for fun.

709
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,440
My imagination is a frigging cancer,

710
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
and I'll pork it before it porks me.

711
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,700
The say a godzillion is the highest number there is,

712
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,840
well, my god.

713
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,020
I count to a godzillion and one.

714
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,840
Yes, I'm the purple flower of Hell County.

715
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,640
Give me wide hearth when I drop my drawers,

716
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,360
mother nature's moods.

717
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,800
I use a python for a prophylactic.

718
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,980
I'm thicker, harder, and meaner than the Alaskan pipeline,

719
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,580
and carry more spew.

720
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,920
I'll freeze your seed before it gets the bathroom tile.

721
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,820
Yee.

722
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,540
Yee.

723
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,880
From NPR News in Washington,

724
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,280
I'm severely disrupted because of the very positive day.

725
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,680
Forecasters could become Tropical Storm Wilma today,

726
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,560
with top winds of 1935 miles per hour.

727
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,320
Getting relief aid to remote areas has been severely disrupted because of PR's radio reports.

728
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,560
Investigators were killed.

729
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,760
PR's bad.

730
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,480
PR's bad.

731
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,500
Meanwhile, the US military says ministers and central bankers said in a statement

732
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,640
they were concerned that finance ministers from wealthy and developing nations say,

733
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,980
this is PR news.

734
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,620
Washington.

735
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,460

And now, Norel Press.

760
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,520
Welcome, sir. Nice to have you on the program.

761
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,140
All Russia, all juicy, juicy, all Russia, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy.

762
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,280
Let this be short.

763
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,020
You know, I'm lightning, but...

764
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:06,200
And I am deeply, deeply messed up mentally, emotionally

765
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,340
because of the propaganda.

766
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,520
Plantation.

767
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,500
Propaganda.

768
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,320
Plantation.

769
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,000
Got this mental illness.

770
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,820
Form of mental illness, Rush.

771
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,060
Mental illness, Rush.

772
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,400
Abortion, homosexuality, promiscuity, prostitution, racism.

773
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,380
I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate to stop you, but...

774
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,460
I have to. I have to.

775
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,560
So if you just hold your...

776
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,160
Propaganda.

777
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,680
Institute.

778
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,320
I'm just darker skin, Rush.

779
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,160
Amen.

780
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,820
You look evil.

781
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,380
Amen.

782
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,660
All right, all right, all right, all right.

783
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,940
Mental, mental illness.

784
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,580
Mental illness.

785
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,000
Well, Rush, that's...

786
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,940
But, but, but, but, Rush, thanks to you, I have...

787
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,940
I can smell you ten miles away.

788
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,780
Fontaneous.

789
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,100
Man came from pornography.

790
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,060
Slave.

791
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,160
Slave master.

792
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,820
Slave master.

793
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,100
Keep them on the plantation.

794
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,680
Man came from race.

795
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,280
Man came from slime.

796
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,040
That's me.

797
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:57,940
Stutter around.

798
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,720
Stutter around.

799
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,680
That's me.

800
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:05,920
This is one of the greatest oral-foral final exam at the Limbaugh Propaganda Plantation.

801
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,640
Me?

802
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:07,860
Me?

803
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,260
I'm just...

804
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,720
I'm just working on the job and lucky to be doing that, friends.

805
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:19,540
Because since they've had this crackdown on crack, they have succeeded in true conspiracy fashion

806
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,580
in making it so you can't get anything but crack.

807
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,560
I wonder why that is.

808
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,900
Actually, you can't even get crack in Dallas.

809
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,020
You can get plenty of cocaine.

810
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,000
Oh, yeah.

811
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,140
Cheaper than ever.

812
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:38,640
Because coke, like most of these other drugs, lights up that little spot in your brain.

813
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,260
That would normally be lit up by sex.

814
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:46,660
Or a real kick-ass riff off your favorite song at just the right time.

815
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:53,700
Or the right incredible climactic passage from a great book might light it up on rare occasions.

816
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,960
Or Jesus or Jim Jones or whatever.

817
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,080
Or a subgenius tape or a subgenius show like this every two minutes will light it up.

818
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,400
Or the merest glimpse of one of Bob's hundred-year-old footprints might light up that spot.

819
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:18,660
That mighty undiluted, unneagified squirt will flood that spot with just the right juices from just the right glands.

820
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,400
But since to read that good book takes days,

821
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,840
and you've got to be in the right place at the right time for that song to have the effect,

822
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,440
if you're going to get it through sex, well, that takes at least five minutes.

823
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,660
And often, you have to take them out to dinner.

824
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,660
But my God!

825
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,240
You can just go out.

826
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,480
Spend some money.

827
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,820
And in no time at all, you can light up that little spot.

828
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,580
Just as soon as you can get back in your car, baby.

829
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,300
Just as soon as you can get you a sample.

830
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,640
Fire that booger up.

831
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,940
What else do you need?

832
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,160
Why would there be any need for noble feelings for all mankind?

833
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,440
Or even any sense of human decency whatsoever?

834
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,740
Why would there be any need for anything but to light up that spot in that brain?

835
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,020
And when you get those headsets, where you just tape a little pad to either side of your temple,

836
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,300
one in the front and one in the back on a shaved place on your head,

837
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,180
and you have that little control in your pocket with a battery in it,

838
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,000
as long as you've got you a $1.98 9-volt battery in that thing,

839
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,900
you can crank it up to 5, to the 5 marker on the dial, and feel mighty damn good.

840
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,180
Or turn it up to 10, and you'll never turn it off.

841
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,620
There better be somebody standing by.

842
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:38,620


843
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:45,940
Anywhere past 6 on the infinite control with knob, and you're not going to turn it off.

844
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,360
You're not going to, friend.

845
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,680
You might turn it off for a second, but it would hurt.

846
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
Oh, it would hurt to turn it down.

847
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,560
Even to turn it down.

848
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,420
And once you've felt that 10 setting, you're not going to want to live with anything else.

849
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,780
You're going to be crying a year later for the 11 setting.

850
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,180
You're going to be begging.

851
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:08,600
Oh, you'll be reading all the catalogs, waiting for that breakthrough that'll give you an 11 on the dial.

852
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,100
And you'll be feeling that control.

853
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,480
Oh, yes siree.

854
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
You think they got a drug problem now?

855
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,640
You think there's a drug problem in the United States?

856
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,260
In the whole world now?

857
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,560
Oh, mark my words, ye sinners.

858
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,140
Wait until you get some electronics involved, baby.

859
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,360
You think those computer whizzes got rich quick?

860
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,680
Well, wait until they invent the head zapper.

861
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,720
Oh, it's my head, you'll say.

862
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,800
It's my head.

863
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,180
That's all you'll be able to say.

864
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,160
Every song will be the song.

865
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,640
It's my head.

866
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,040
That'll be the only awareness you need.

867
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,140
It's just between you, your head, and your control.

868
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,960
Your pleasure center stimulator control.

869
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,580
Oh, yeah.

870
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,260
Oh, yeah.

871
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,240
You'll be like a monkey in a cage sitting in a pool of his own saliva.

872
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,980
That's right.

873
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:01,320
Because once you feel number 10, you ain't going to...

874
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,760
You can kiss what you now know as reality.

875
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,080
Goodbye, baby.

876
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,120
Yes.

877
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,100
And after a while, even the 10 starts to feel like pain.

878
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,700
But you can't go looking for the 11 button because you can't get up.

879
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,500
You've been there too long because you're dead.

880
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,280
You're a ghost that died while it was high.

881
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:19,940
Yep.

882
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,640
Yep.

883
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,880
If you die when you're high, my friend, your spirit becomes a wandering shade.

884
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,900
Wandering, trying to score for eternity.

885
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,500
Or at least until a subgenius priest comes along and sends it spanking back to where it originally came from.

886
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,000
My God, and here I am running out of gas.

887
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,500
You're always going to run out sooner or later.

888
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,480
That's what you got to remember.

889
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,960
Too much.

890
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,600
Oh, yeah.

891
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,800
Too much is always better than not enough.

892
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,000
Till you run out.

893
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,560
And you will, friend.

894
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,200
You'll run out of that church air right when you least expect it.

895
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,160
Right when you thought you had all the church air in the world.

896
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,640
Oh, yeah.

897
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,040
Oh, yeah.

898
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,640
Oh, I had all the church air in the world.

899
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,580
But, but, but, Negi has it now.

900
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,360
Oh, you'll scream.

901
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,220
You'll cry.

902
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,400
You'll wail and gnash your teeth.

903
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,920
And you'll wish you could die.

904
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,180
You'll wish you could die.

905
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,940
But you can't.

906
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,940
You can't die.

907
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:32,220
Because your terror keeps you alive and manufactures just enough church air for you not to die but just to keep needing more.

908
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:38,340
You're going to be ready for the finals in 1998, my friend.

909
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,300
It's a beautiful world we live in.

910
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,200
A sweet romantic place.

911
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,080
Beautiful people everywhere.

912
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,880
The way they call their hair.

913
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:27,100
Makes me want to say it's a beautiful world.

914
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,680
It's a beautiful world.

915
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,200
It's a beautiful world.

916
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,480
It's a beautiful world.

917
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,860
Now believe me.

918
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,260
Now believe me.

919
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,720
Now believe me.

920
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:00,640
It's a wonderful time to be here.

921
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,180
Beautiful times.

922
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,760
It's nice to be alive

923
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,960
Wonderful people everywhere

924
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,780
The way they show they care

925
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,360
Makes me wanna say

926
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,860
It's a wonderful place

927
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,800
It's a wonderful place

928
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,300
It's a wonderful place

929
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,460
For me

930
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,460
For me

931
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:44,900
For me

932
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,200
For me

933
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,660
For me

934
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,940
For me

935
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,200
For me

936
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,060
My place

937
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,880
And all that blue

938
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,800
That blue

939
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,000
It's a beautiful world we live in

940
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,340
A sweet romantic place

941
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,800
Beautiful people everywhere

942
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,980
The way they comb their hair

943
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,920
All makes me wanna say

944
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,800
It's a beautiful world

945
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,700
It's a beautiful world

946
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:05,920
It's a beautiful world

947
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,120
For you

948
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,100
For you

949
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,740
For you

950
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:01,940
For you

951
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,480
How are you doing today?

952
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,140
For me, that is a really difficult question, Dr. Lawrenson,

953
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,480
because the world around me is shrinking,

954
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,640
and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are coming to see me today,

955
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,940
and they're not bringing flowers,

956
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,420
which just makes it really difficult to get organized.

957
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:24,600
I'm in here because they say I have a nervous condition.

958
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,720
Well, well, here's my question.

959
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,020
Who wouldn't be nervous if they really, really looked at their lives?

960
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,020
I mean, whose life is that good?

961
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:42,500
Um, we're talking about our ability to go forward in time, to go into the future.

962
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,280
It's a trip. You know, it's like a serious vacation.

963
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,300
It's a trip. You know, it's like a serious vacation.

964
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,080
See, stay calm. They're always ordering us.

965
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,120
Be calm, be calm, be calm, be calm.

966
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,380
Then what are you going to order me to be calm?

967
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,740
Well, I've been approached by the Federal Trade Organization.

968
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,960
And what have they approached you about, Mr. McKenzie?

969
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:22,880
About me?

970
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:34,560
And this is nuts. But they have asked me to head up the organization for the organized.

971
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,980
I don't believe in disposable language either. You know, small talk, little talk, chit chat. Useless.

972
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,120
The organization for the organized.

973
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:49,620
When I was in the Gulf, the organization was recruiting the organized.

974
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,280
I knew it. I knew it!

975
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,060
Long live the organization for the organized!

976
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,820
TV, you know, helps soothe an active mind.

977
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,760
TV, you know, helps soothe an active mind.

978
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,860
TV, you know, helps soothe an active mind.

979
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,780
TV, you know, helps soothe an active mind.

980
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,900
Sister, can I mention about the double entendre from Bugs Bunny?

981
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:16,840
The what?

982
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,040
There's a double entendre in one of Bugs Bunny's cartoons.

983
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,340
Well, why don't you try it?

984
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:22,760
Bugs Bunny and Aladdin's lamp.

985
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,620
Try it.

986
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,800
Okay, there's a big, mean-looking guy, big-looking Arab with a scimitar, right?

987
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,160
And he's got a full mustache and a beard.

988
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,040
Bugs looks at this guy square in the face and says,

989
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,760
What's shaking, beaver puss?

990
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,660
Well, interesting.

991
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:39,840
Yes.

992
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,480
Interesting.

993
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,940
I saw a Porky Pig in which someone tried to insult Porky by saying,

994
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,980
Ah, your mother smokes tennis shoes or something.

995
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,140
And Porky kind of looked at the camera and goes,

996
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,380
No, it was his sister.

997
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,640
Your sister smokes tennis shoes.

998
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,400
He goes, No, my sister doesn't smoke tennis shoes.

999
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,720
My sister works in a butcher shop and smokes ham.

1000
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,780
Cannibalism jokes abound.

1001
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:11,340
Actually, you know, when Looney Tunes originally came out, they weren't intended as kids entertainment, really.

1002
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,020
No, they weren't.

1003
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,360
They were marketing to a...

1004
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,540
I might curse like a real sailor.

1005
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:19,580
I didn't understand most of those cartoons until I saw them years later after I'd grown up.

1006
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:19,960
Yeah.

1007
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,460
Yeah.

1008
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,140
It's like I caught that beaver puss reference on Nickelodeon one day.

1009
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,900
I was just shocked that Nickelodeon let it go through.

1010
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,280
Well, you know, you see funny stuff.

1011
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,900
Yeah, they obviously thought, Well, it's Bugs Bunny.

1012
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,500
It's harmless.

1013
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,580
No, it isn't.

1014
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,720
Well, you know, little kids...

1015
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,160
That's what I've always had to say about, you know, sexual references.

1016
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:46,020
It seems that, you know, sexual references really bother Americans more, you know, and violence doesn't.

1017
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,800
And violence really bothers Europeans, but sex doesn't so much.

1018
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:56,660
You know, I just wonder what kind of culture we'd have if things were any different, you know, if we flip that around.

1019
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:03,120
You know, it's okay to show somebody's head getting blown off, but it's not okay to, you know, to show some...

1020
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,620
Well, this country was settled by religious nuts.

1021
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,260
It was.

1022
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:13,800
That were, you know, kind of been hinted at, kind of politely asked to leave from their respective...

1023
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,580
Pretty much.

1024
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:15,800
...original countries.

1025
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,680
And, you know, but here's what I've always had to say about...

1026
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,760
About sex references and sex jokes on TV.

1027
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:28,120
If a kid is young enough that they shouldn't be hearing it, then they're young enough that they're not going to understand it at all.

1028
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,980
And it will be totally lost on them, and they probably won't think anything of it.

1029
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,240
Right.

1030
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,000
It's a joke that kids aren't going to get, but all the audience in all their...

1031
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,060
Suitable for children up to age four, but...

1032
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:41,900
You know, some of them might...

1033
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1034
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,820
Some of them might...

1035
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,560
And over age 18.

1036
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,160
...might get a little confused.

1037
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,660
At which point, you know, they should ask their parents and maybe...

1038
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,760
Maybe their parents will explain it to them.

1039
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,340
And, you know, if not, there's always the internet.

1040
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,200
But, you know...

1041
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,840
That's...

1042
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,080
Likely all they're gonna find is porn.

1043
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,160
The internet's gonna be the last place you're gonna be able to go for real cartoons.

1044
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:00,820
Oh, yeah.

1045
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,340
Everything I know about sex...

1046
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:02,740
Information.

1047
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,240
...I've heard from my dad's detective paperback cover.

1048
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:05,840
There you go.

1049
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,080
Yeah.

1050
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,420
See you next time.

1051
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:06,740
Bye.

1052
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,020
Bye.

1053
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,260
Bye.

1054

Bye.

1055

Bye.

1056
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:13,680
Bye.

1057
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,320
Bye.

1058
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,360
Bye.

1059
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:15,740
Bye.

1060
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,280
Bye.

1061
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,060
Bye.

1062
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,340
Bye.

1063
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:32,340


1064
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,540
Bye.

1065
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,060
Bye-bye.

1066
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:38,480
Bye.

1067
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,760
Bye.

1068
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:40,800


1069
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,140
Bye.

1070
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:41,240
Bye.

1071
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:41,320


1072
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,020
Bye.

1073
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:42,600
Bye.

1074
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,440
Bye.

1075
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,160
Thank you.

1076
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,960

We.

1081
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,160
Life or death.

1082
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,080
Mother!

1083
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,280
Charlie!

1084
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,260
Master Blasters.

Master Blasters.

1086
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,260
Master Blasters.

1087
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,200
Maybe we're all insane.

1088
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,240
More and more people are discovering.

1089
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,560
More and more people are discovering.

1090
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,060
Blood!

1091
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:51,560
Blood!

1092
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,220
Much too hot.

1093
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:59,200
We will demonstrate to all interested parties a new and extremely interesting power source.

1094
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,480
Next time I'm going to get off.

1095
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,100
The other day at our office, a lady mentioned the nice balls that she saw.

1096
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,840
No comment here.

1097
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,000
No comment at all.

1098
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,060
No logic.

1099
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,120
No reason.

1100
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:10,580
No explanation.

1101
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,700
Just a prolonged nightmare.

1102
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,800
It means he has no mental facilities.

1103
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,420
Facilities, yes.

1104
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,640
Who said that?

1105
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,880
There are no more boundaries, governments, or noble causes.

1106
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:21,540
No?

1107
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:21,980
No?

1108
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1109
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,780
I'm not a housebreaker.

1110
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:26,680
Oh.

1111
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,020
Oh, yes, I did forget something, didn't I?

1112
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,580
Oh, yes, it's good.

1113
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,380
It's very good.

1114
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,200
I say we sit on it the rest of the day and see what some 105s can do.

1115
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,460
It's one long heart.

1116
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,400
You'll find that our balls are attached to some very nice and knowledgeable people.

1117
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,760
Out of the frying pan.

1118
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,600
Into the fire.

1119
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,400
Over.

1120
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,880
Overactive bladder.

1121
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,000
Over and over.

1122
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,200
What are we gonna do now?

1123
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:00,980
Know ye by these present that I do hereby declare peace upon the entire world!

1124
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,500
Pick up the phone and call now.

1125
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,720
.

1126
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,560
This is the first message.

1127
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,960
From the PLF.

1128
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,780
You judge of the so-called subgenius.

1129
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,340
You have disgusted a race of the pinks.

1130
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,180
You have spread lies and deceits against us.

1131
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:37,420
You shall not succeed until we are avenged.

1132
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:44,380
We demand vengeance from the lies and deceits which you spread about us.

1133
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,740
There on your hour of slack radio ministry.

1134
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,760
Your sick heart.

1135
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,280
This is disgusting.

1136
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,680
The pink race shall succeed.

1137
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,020
We will stop at nothing to destroy you.

1138
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,880
This is the first of many messages.

1139
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:06,060
This is a warning against you, the church of the subgenius.

1140
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:09,000
The church of the poo genius, more like it.

1141
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,860
Yes, poo genius.

1142
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,540
Church of the poo genius.

1143
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,920
You have nothing to do with Bob.

1144
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,220
We own Bob.

1145
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,580
You don't own Bob.

1146
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,900
We are Bob.

1147
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,240
We are Bob.

1148
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,480
We are Bob.

1149
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:26,540
Chaka-ba-ka-lay-kee, chaka-ba-sa-ka-la, ka-da-da-ba-ta, da-so-ma.

Chain smirker.

1151
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:32,800
Mm-hmm.

1152
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:40,700
Do you remember December's foggy freeze?

1153
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:49,480
When the ice that clings onto your beard was screaming agony?

1154
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:58,900
And you snatched your rattling last breath with deep sea diver sounds.

1155
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:05,780
And the flowers bloom like madness in the spring.

1156
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,180
Chaka-ba-kyo-ka-kaa, Chaka-ba-kyo-ka-koo.

1157
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:25,860
Chaka-ba-kyo-ka-ka-kaa, frustxes your mind's positions.

1158
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:32,600
When I Mama can say duskани gaya, you remain calm your definitely and have filiality.

1159
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,800
At Entonces as much as you pay the need that you return home, the next is dói- Чтобы.

1160
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:32,800


1161
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,640

00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:40,680


1165
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,380
Sha la la la la la

1166
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:49,140
Sitting on a park bench

1167
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,220
Eyeing little girls with bad intent

1168
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,120
Snot running down his nose

1169
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,720
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes

1170
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,900
Hey aqualung

1171
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,960
Drying in the cold sun

1172
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,940
Watching as a frilly panties run

1173
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:40,000
I kidnapped the future and ransomed it for the past

1174
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,880
I made time wait up for me to bleed my liver

1175
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,660
My infernal breath wilts the tree of life

1176
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,040
I left my s'more on the rock of ages

1177
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,600
Who'll tear flesh with me?

1178
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,900
Who'll spill their juice?

1179
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,440
Who'll gouge with me?

1180
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,220
Whose candle will I fart out?

1181
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:54,940
Who?

1182
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,900
I'm ready

1183
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,260
So step aside

1184
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,460
All you but loot

1185
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,180
Neurotic

1186
00:58:59,180 --> 00:58:59,960
Insecure

1187
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,700
The spectacle slaps all limp meat

1188
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,060
I'm a crime-fighting master criminal

1189
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,100
I am not a criminal

1190
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:05,340
I'm insane

1191
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,420
I'm a screamer and a laugher

1192
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,100
I make a spectacle of myself

1193
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,300
I am a sight

1194
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,860
My physical type cannot be classified by science

1195
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,960
My familiar is a pterodactyl

1196
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,580
