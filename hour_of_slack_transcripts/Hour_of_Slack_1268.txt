Let's see, which one will I have for breakfast?
Oh, it's probably the first breeze you've had all day.
Good salesman.
Yeah, thanks.
Better get ready.
It's gonna be late for the show.
Kids ready?
But I'm thirsty.
I want some water or some summer pot.
Forget it.
Oh, now, Brown.
You are gonna wow Brown Cow.
With indecision, ladies and...
And that's how I solve the problem of indecision.
That's it.
For you.
That's after only one broadcast.
Why, there's no limit to it.
That's good, because we're running out of pickles.
Okay, let's blast off.
Just a minute, ma'am.
You knew that ham was salty.
You shouldn't have let him eat five sandwiches.
Four!
The way I see it, somebody's gonna have to phone for help.
What do I do with the children?
Vultures!
Be careful what you say around here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yes!
Is that really what happened in the Bible?
It's a sick and twisted book of holiness, all right.
Then we'll write our own Bible.
With less Sodom and more good.
The Mara.
Let's do it!
The subgenius power of Slack!
Slack!
Because after all, however boring this may seem, it's for radio,
and it can be edited.

I got them all here.
Bob was one of the first to take university courses while serving time in prison.
Bob works with women at the local prison behind bars.
Bob has a lot of experience with prison.
Welcome to the show, Bob.
Thanks for joining us.
So you were one of the first people in prison to take PP.
What was it like trying to set that up as a prisoner back then?
They just had their lights blown.
So, and...
You know, there were situations where everybody's drunk,
and somebody would wake up,
and in the morning there's a body.
People don't even know who did it.
We all make mistakes.
And I know that, you know, I was seen as a member of the walking dead.
That and, you know, this lingering, this lingering...
What word do I use here?
Spasms of violence.
We have been speaking with Bob Bob's personality on prisons in Canada.
Attention, subgeniuses.
Ask Dr.
Howell.
Yes.
You can ask Dr.
Howell anything.
Do you dare ask Dr.
Howell?
Do you have enough of a ball to ask?
A big, fat, hairy ball.
Dr. Howell.
Do you have fat enough hair in a ball to ask of Dr. Howell any question you can think of?
Can you be the first person in history to stump Dr. Howell?
Listen up, y'all.
It's D-E-V-O.
Listen up, y'all.
It's D-E-V-O.

Dr. Nothing but fear.
Everyone's on a waist of fear.
People get up.

Don't気in'.
No one says anything.
Each has a family's own destiny.
You know,

Going from town to town, locale to locale, municipality to municipality, the Ask Dr.

From PR News in Washington, I'm killing at least three people.
During a ceremony at NATO headquarters in Kabul, Vice President Joe Biden said to help pay for
relocating Amila Ghanoua. Biden is reneging on his pledge to get off the island. He was known
for his strong anti-American views. Vice President Joe Biden is in straight sets at Wimbledon today
to win his second singles eighth Grand Slam championship. Vice President Biden said the
country is slowly moving toward a lasting political stalemate. Last month, Al Biden claimed
responsibility for the U.S. military's efforts to stop the U.S. military from taking over the
country. He claimed responsibility for suicide attacks on two main banks. And on Friday, a senior
cleric in Anbar. Iraqi police said PR is bad. PR is bad. Vice President Joe Biden blew herself up
after a long PR news from Washington. We were all fired up to tell Bob about our Vegas trip,
but we weren't really too sure exactly how he was going to react to the whole thing.
Hey, let's just not tell him.
What are you talking about? Tell him anything. We go back to work.
We told Bob that we're going to Vegas. I don't think he was too happy.
Once in Bob's writing, so Bob died. And so Bob's writings really speak.
And all that nonsense that they finally said, okay, to heck with that.
Like this thing with the eye, like, uh, yeah,
you have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this.
You have to have a complete, uh, well-formed eye for it to do you any good.
Oh boy. What a shame.
Bob built his own gravity engine. What was that? Like a joke?
Well, yeah, it runs on gravity. And, um,
that was the theory behind Bob's perpetual motion machine.
And Bob.
Oh boy.
Uh,
just individual articles that Bob had written.
He wrote books about physics.
He didn't think that there was gravity and he had a,
I think a religion called law sodomy.
So he had a lot of nutty ideas.
That was Bob's first article.
Bob had written some articles about pyramid power and the search for Noah's Ark,
the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot.
Um, some articles about Tesla and yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks for enlightening us.
Thank you so much.
It was really fun.
And thank you for giving me this opportunity to talk about Bob.
I really enjoyed it.
And, uh,
thanks to go Drex,
who did that amazing,
mashup there,
the long discussion about Bob.
And before that,
the large did Bob Vegas.
Uh,
lemur is PR news.
Uh,
the song step up was from Devo's new album,
heart ignition,
and lemur did the opening collages.
And this is the,
the hour of Slack number 1,268 from the church of the sub genius.
Uh,
half of it was recorded at the 13th.
Well,
actually the 15th X day drill during the ask Dr.
Howell show with Dr.
Follow Drummond as MC.
But first heart ignition will show us what it's about.
The agents who enabled that earthly,

uh,
and,
and,
uh,
and,
uh,
I think I am doors.
This lie.
I thought this is an error,
but this is a grave error.
God wandering about,
uh,
without me,
it's useless revelation.
And I'm sick of it.
Uh,
you see what I'm saying?
No,
no.
You know,
folks,
the existence of the,


of a question implies the existence of an answer,
but both are simply skeletal contrast struts,
which we,
um,
which we apply to the face of nature.
Now that we do have questions.
And so we'll want the background down.
I will do my introductory poem and then one by one,
Philo Drummond will fish the questions from the very bosom of priestess Pisces.
And what is more entertaining than that?
So,
uh,
I can't do a long poem as I w would like,
like one of Milton's allegorical poems.
Uh,
one of those takes eight minutes.
Another one takes 10 minutes entirely too long.
I,
so I'm going to go to something modern by the American poet,
uh,
XJ Kennedy.
The moment I finished saying this poem,
ask Dr.
How will be in session,
but at any time you can submit a question.
Okay,
here's the poem in a prominent bar in Seacost.


Oh,

a cheer, but the man at the bar made a phone call and up pulled a red patrol car, and she blew us a
kiss as they copped her away from that prominent bar in Secaucus, N.J.
Special scientific electronic bob installed in our vehicle. The big evil. Is this okay? No.
This is the city, Los Angeles, California. They feed on the sorrows, ignorance, and superstitions
of others. Special scientific electronic bob installed in our vehicle. The big evil. Is this
okay? No. It was warm in Los Angeles. We were working the day watch out of juvenile bunco section.
Would you go ahead, please? I'm a silly old fool. You're a chicken embryo.
Yes.
We know how you feel. It's happened to a lot of people. Oh.
Flush it down the commode. Oh, no. Do you want to tell us about the $15,000?
That $15,000? Flush it down the commode. You're right, Sergeant.
Go on, please. Yes, sir.
All right, come on out of there. I'm a police officer, ma'am. Can I help you?
Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. Right out of your money.
But first, Whippet, New York.
That's right. In style.
Perky ruthless.
I know. A finger in the pie. I think I'm ready for the Senate.
You want to be me.
Pink one.
And she's a bit oomph, too. People like it. She's a lesbian.
Who's obese.
A tasty snack. She cracks me up whenever I say her face.
It was guttural. It was primal. It felt like...
You can practically smell her.
Delicious.
Wow, that hit a note.
And horribly abused tonight.
By her father. Repeatedly.
I'll get that.
She was naked. She came to my...
And sexually.
Reality did some damage to me.
And I like donuts.
And he comes from a broken home.
You know, I'm really glad you came in with your helmet.
Might be his tomb as well.
It was just total convenience.
It was really easy.
And the conscious mind starts to... is occupied.
Starts to see things and then they start to fit together or not.
Euthanize it. It's time.
It's like slipping into your pajamas when you go to work. I love it.
Sexually frustrated.
I miss it.
Alright, Clarence.
Okay, Dr. Howell.
Lay it on me.
Dr. Howell, what is more important to Bob?
Our sex god?
Sex or his pipe?
Oh, and there's a second part here. Or does he...
Sluh...
I don't know what that word means, but it looks like...
Sluh...
No, oh wait.
It's...
Does he give the pipe?
I can't...
It's...
After sex.
After sex or during.
Does he give the pipe?
Give doesn't make sense.
Does he save the pipe?
Save the pipe for after sex or during.
Save the pipe.
It's not...
Save the pipe.
It's not...
Yeah, save the pipe. That's a very...
Does he save the pipe for after sex or during?
That implies that the pipe needs to rest when actually, of course, the pipe is asleep.



It's a source of Dobsian energy in itself.
But you know, Philo, I feel kind of bashful and shy here, like a young maiden who has
just hung her clothes on a hickory limb, because this is a question about Dobsian nature.
I'm sitting right next to you, the overman, and trying to answer it.
So if I am wrong, please don't hesitate to correct me.
I will blunder forward in my humble way, but, you know...
Take a shot.
Yeah, I'm going to have to do that.
So when you say, what is more important to Bob, our sex god, sex or his pipe, you're
asking, you know, what is more important to you, your arm or your leg?
You know, the pipe is a part of Bob, a piece of Bob.
Without the pipe, Bob is not Bob, not the Bob that we know.
Furthermore, there is that strange, persistent legend that the pipe itself has life.
And even, according to some, pilots or dictates the course of Bob.
Now, if it does that, then it leads him right into the bedroom, doesn't it?
Stands to reason.
And leads him on into the most outrageous sex fancies which legions of panting, scrofulous,
subgenius scribes have been writing down since the beginning of this whole subgenius thing
came about.
In reams of all but unreadable.
Bob pornography.
But they never leave out the pipe, nor do I think should they.
Now as for the second part of this entirely unpaid question, does he save the pipe for
after sex or during?
The only part of this worth answering is that the pipe has multiple uses, including those
which might be employed after sex.
That's a pretty good answer, Dr. Howell.
Okay, now you set me straight here.
But I would say that the pipe precedes Bob to a certain extent.
Oh, it does.
It does precede him just as the...
Why wouldn't Bob want to have the pipe with him while having sex?
Exactly.
And so I said the pipe leads Bob on.
Just as in an air crash, the pilot is always first at the scene of the accident.
You know, and Bob is ever vigilant with the pipe.
That's right.
That like, you know, a good pilot should go down first, right?
Absolument, mon general.
But Bob is ever vigilant to make sure the pipe is always still smoking, you know?
So he's got to have it close by all the time.
Or it's got to have him close by.
It's got to have him close by to materialize him.
They are so close that you can't really say which is pushing and which is pulling.
Where the universe ends and, you know, begins and is thrust through in a, like, a...
But it is right there at that point, you know, because that is the nature of the supernatural.
We can't answer too much.
This is an unpaid question, but it is true what you're pointing out.
So I guess that is the answer to this is true.
Yes.
Okay.
All right.
T, not F.
You have to go a little deeper now.
There's less questions.
You can go to the next one.


So I sit down on the couch.
It was really soft and smooth and I liked it there.
It was so nice.
I couldn't believe it.
I just laughed and stand up for like days and days and days and days and days and shit.
It must have been weeks.
Now I was doing okay sitting there.
I was like, I'm going to go to the next one.



I'm doing real good now.
Oh, it felt fucking wonderful, dude.
Oh, I'm doing real good.
First, back to the question of underwater oil plumes with which we began this hour.
On the Today Show this morning, BP COO Bob Suttles would not concede their existence
even when presented with testimony from a government scientist.
Instead, Suttles defended his position by saying, quote, it may be down to how you define
what a plume is.
It is that kind of a thing.

It's a kind of evasion in the face of hard evidence, a hallmark of so many BP executives
in these past 51 days, which reminded us of another infamous flack.
Here now is the verbal swill from BP CEO Tony Hayward and his friends juxtaposed with a
guy named Bob.
Don't worry.
You'll recognize Bob.
They say Bob's behind the times.
They say Bob can't relate to the X generation.
Well, you know what Bob says to that?
To horse hockey.
Bob's here to set the record straight.
Bob has his finger on the pulse of American youth today.
If Bob was an old fart, could he pound this much Jagermeister this fast and not drop dead?
Unos.
Dos.
Drills.
Zubottles.
Bob's hip.
Bob's with the times.
Bob lives up on Capitol Hill, but he'd rather be in the mosh pit with you.
Bob knows what it's like to be young.
To be alienated.
Disenfranchised.
And hassled by the man.
Bob knows who the man is.
And Bob's not afraid to take the man on.
Running against the Democrats is a death trap.
It's a suicide rap.
We gotta get out while we're young and baby, Bob was born to run.
Run this country.
Can pop legend Peter Townsend do this anymore?
No.
He's finished.
Bob rocks.
Bob rocks.


He's a fucking ass.
Where are you going, baby?
Bastard.
Bitch.
Pig.
Whore.
Bob's gun turret can swivel faster and longer than any Republican since Ike.
Can flaccid Pat Buchanan say that?
Can limp Lamar Alexander pass muster?
Come on, baby.
It's time for another caucus.
Not again.
How many times?
Two times is enough.
Wouldn't you like to know?
Bob doesn't endorse extramarital sex, excessive drinking, or rock and roll.
The proceeding was for promotional purposes only.
Bob 96 presidential tour.
Get fooled again.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.





97 8So what do we have now?
Okay now here's one of those questions that seems like it's a perpetual kind of a
Ask Doctor How question that comes from the base of individuals that wants to give
money that doesn't have an adequate question.
But here's an answer to that, it's so sad.
It is sad.
Because here's the question they ask Doctor How.
Let's have it.
What should I ask you?
Ah, yes.
Remember that question, Dr. Howell?
I remember it from so many seasons, so many seasons ago and so many recent seasons.
Yes, what should one ask?
When one has the opportunity to ask, and one can ask something gross, common, and ordinary,
something scatological, something humorous, something humorous, scatological, mythological, mythologico-scatological,
or one can ask of the very secrets of time and the cosmos itself.
What song the sirens sang, or the name Achilles used when he hid himself among women,
or who killed the toads in the rice that themselves ate the poppy coccolorum and the coccahupatrice.
My friend, you have missed it.
You missed this great opportunity by yourself, referential postmodern question,
but I don't think there was any money in there anyway.
Well, there might have been. I lost the...
I think there's some free-floating bills.
It might be floating around in the utterly wonderful realm of priestess Pisces.
There's some free-floating bills in here.
All right, well then I shall not assume that you attempted to short sheet Dr. Howell
without moving any other parts of my body.
Um, um, um, um, um, um...
Oh, you did?
Well, no.
Um, almost godlike orgies.
Just burger-eating wife sex.
Here's Pornos and the sex lives of the creatures on this planet.
Let me stay in the middle!
Sex!
Wasn't that fantastic?
Yeah, so what was this, in the 70s?
Um, well, uh, yeah, they, they, they, they thought it, well, I, well, uh, I, you know, I didn't know.
Um...
Thanks for being here.
Um...
Okay, Dr. Howell, this is a good question.
Very well.
How did dinosaurs make babies?
Babies?
How did they make babies, Dr. Howell?
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Okay, all right, calm down. We're gonna have the answer.
It's that bad boy on the spike again.
How did dinosaurs make babies? Is that it?
That's the question, Dr. Howell.
How did dinosaurs make babies?
Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Uh, I think we can all agree on that.
There were lizards, kind of like, did they lay eggs, or did they have...
They were ovaries.
Ovipo, vovipo, viviparous?
Ovipo, voviparous, yes.
They laid eggs, unless there were some, like the garter snake, and certain boas, most boas, bore their young alive, bored them to tears.
But then they took care of the little chappies.
However, this is all somewhat by the board, although I shall return to it in the course of time.
Uh...
The question is, how did dinosaurs make babies?
Not how did they make little dinosaur chicks, but how did they make babies?
Human babies.
And generally they did so by getting out of the way.
By turning turtle, by dying, with their feet sticking up straight, with their characteristic three toes clenched in a gesture of ultimate surrender.
Because it was only after these giant reptiles passed away that, uh,
our own antecedents and ancestors could develop enough to generate or decant the first squalling human infant.
Now, this was more direct than you might think, because the primate order was represented in the Mesozoic era.
You might think this early-er primate looked something like a little scrambling rat.
And maybe you'd be right, because there was a certain similarity.
Similarity caused by a process we know as convergent evolution.
Convergent evolution should always be factored into evolutionary theory.
Without thinking of it, one can make mistakes.
Particularly since classical paleontology is being overwhelmed by the cladistic science,
where data is fed into computers,
and a mathematical preponderance is considered to be the answer.
This has led many investigators into a sucking, boggy swamp of error.
Chasing foolish fires away into ultimate incomprehensibility,
and the degradation of what was once a noble scientific endeavor.
So, back to dinosaurs and the care of their own young.
Well, they did.
They did their best.
To bring them up right.
Do we know this because of the avian similarity of dinosaurs?
Partly.
We know birds raise the chicks in the nest and feed them.
So did the primitive ornithischians,
discovered by Dr. John Horner,
who shouldn't be entirely trusted,
but sure enough, they did.
In vast, communist-like breeding, brooding sites,
take care of hordes of,
tiny dinosaurs.
If they stepped on one every now and then,
they were very sorry.
Today, alligators and crocodiles also take good care of their young.
We'll carry them in their mouths without eating them,
unless they are exceptionally forgetful,
and in all ways behave as model parents.
Thus, the other side of the dinosaurian origin,
the one which is shredded in mystery,
but reflected in the ancient crurotarsals,
or early archosaur-like reptiles,
given that strange name because of a skeletal peculiarity
of the ankle bone which so identifies them.
Back in the days of the great red sandstone,
and even earlier in the misty jungles,
when it was never all that certain whether the amphibians
or the reptiles would prevail through the annoying,
and apparently endless age of giant insects,
which took forever to get out of the way.
When it did, our planet changed permanently,
so insects can no longer be giant.
But other things could and did,
and these were those famous reptiles.
It was only when their bloated bulks
were finally booted from the stage,
that the humus could ultimately rise to the top
of the squirming, swarming mammalian heap,
and start producing rugrats.
Incidentally, mammals existed long before dinosaurs
came on the scene, and were suppressed,
held down from radiating into all the juicy evolutionary niches
by these self-same dinosaurs,
which did it so well that there wasn't really much larger
than a poodle around for millions of years
on the mammalian side of the ledger.
Thanks for your question.
Alright, thanks Dr. Howe.
Traffic Bureau.
17th of 03 PM.
It didn't look too good.
Complaint board, please.
Right.
Right.
I've been involved in a shooting.
You okay?
I'm at a laundrette.
What's the story?
I just shot Bob.
I commend you.
Thank you.
But he got away.
I see.
Yeah, Bob.
He seemed fine.
He looked like a man who enjoys pulling the trigger.
Sometimes it's part of the job.
Oh, we understand that.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.






Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You really care a lot about that guy.


It gets really quiet here where the caller joins us.
I know what you're thinking.
Did he fire six shots or only five?
Please do tell me what I'm thinking right now.
Well, to tell you the truth and all the excitement, I kind of lost track myself.
But seeing that this is a .44 Magnum, the world's most powerful handgun, it can blow
your head clean off.
You can ask yourself a question.
question.
Do you feel
horny?
No, actually, that was not the question.
Yeah, no, it's actually, do you want to do the Pacific
elections?
Yeah, wrong question. Yeah, no,
right question, wrong universe.
It's a right question at some time, but
at this time, it's the wrong
question. How do you know?
It's all about the
timing, man. Ah.
Oh, okay, let's call him.
Damn, damn, damn.
Let's call it down.
Hello?
The thing that you have told me
that they formed, they did it, but the customer
stood tired. Well, uh,
yes, yes, uh.
You take this and give it to him.
Yes, yes, yes. Very well.
Well, I don't know if that concludes
our, uh, question. No, he seems
to... There's still plenty in there.
All right. Keep a-fishing,
Philo. Because
after all, uh, however boring
this may seem, it's for radio, and it can be
edited by Reverend Stang.
I got them all here. You got them all?
I got them all. I'm gonna stack them up here.
Okay, uh... Okay, now this is
what we'll call the, uh,
this next three questions will be
like the lightning round.
We call it the speed round. Speed round.
Generally, we play the speed round music. I don't know.
But we could do it. Yeah, yeah.
It's just fast music, and then I answer
them real fast, and that's what we do.
Okay. Since chimps
now use tools, when will
they master politics?
They already have.
They already have. All right. Okay.
What is
the square root of
the isosceles
right triangle, that
one triangle? Remember that one?
That would be one side
of the triangle. One side
of the triangle would be the square root of
the, isn't it the, uh, hypotenuse?
That is the square of the opposite
two sides. Oh, the hypotenuse.
Yeah.
That gives me the...
What sort of sickness am I
going to get from doc
frop teabagging my schwin?
Stingray.
A terrible
condition known as
Sherman's disease.
However, there is hope for
Sherman's sufferers, and
I'll accept
a consultation on that. Wait a minute.
You're sitting on that schwin, that stingray.
As schlick as a schwin.
That schwin
teabag. Did you wash it?
Okay, good.
Let us hope so.
I have to go to the bathroom. Don't make me think about it.
I don't want to think about that.
And one of the demons is,
one of the demons that will arise is
preschool, no, daycare demon.
Like, huh?
How come they
have friends? I go to the bathroom
or something like that and recover for a while.
Oh my god. And then
they're coming from you, completely stupidly.
And you just dummy up
to feeling like they screwed you.
And by the way, that bathroom thing is really important
for number one.
Karma. That's a demon, okay?
Money from a pension. Dollar. Money. Dollar.
Money. Then. The dollar. Dollar.
Money. Now.
Income.
What the hell is wrong
with them? That's the
question.
That's a good question. What the hell is wrong with them,
Dr. Howell?
They're still asleep. They're still sleeping.
Hmm.
They just need to wake up
and notice that they're
hurtling over a cliff onto a
field of upright knives.
We're down to the second to the last question.
Oh, this is appropriate for the...
We're starting to get really philosophical here.
Alright, let's... What is
it?
In quotes.
What is it?
It is the
answer.
You know. It is the
real
subject.
The subject of that sentence
is not what.
It is what.
It is what.
It is what.
It is.
And for a subgenius,
it is what lies at the end.
We speak of the end
here as though
it were boarding the escape
vessels of the space
goddesses, so-called.
I wish I had time to
explain that particular delusion.
But
this is just the beginning.
The beginning of a lengthy
journey. Assiduous readers
of Revelation X,
the Bob Apocryphon, may have noticed
the entire itinerary is planned out,
starting from the landing,
the process at the port authority building,
and so forth and so on.
Ultimately, by ascending through multiple universes,
you get to it.
You arrive at the punchline.
The punchline of the joke.
This is what we're all traveling toward.
What we all hope to receive.


And attend.
So we will not be it.
And that's
it.
All right. Thanks, Dr. Howell.
Sure thing, Father.
And now, from PR News in Washington,
I'm the 10th in 11 months, but not by much.
President Obama says
residents and workers are already
radioactive off the Atlantic coast.
He says cesium-137
is more dangerous than tritium.
He was talking to BSTV.
The National Guard troops say
this is
PR news.
PR's bad.
Forecasters say the worst is yet to come.
I didn't know.
That's good news.
Weather is keeping 46 Koreans from searching
for industrial machinery and commercial aircraft.
From Seoul, Cao Dixi, Duoltao reports
South Korea sank last week.
Seoul went down five days ago
after falling unconscious during a rescue mission.
Vermont's Health Department says tests show
presence of PR News in Washington.

Well, fish around and Pisces bought us some more.
She's already fished it all out.
Oh, well, all right then.
Well, one never knows.
That was a free answer.
Okay, here it is.
Here's the final and last question.
We saved the best for last.
All righty.
What does a booger smell like?
And the second part, how do you know?
You know, someone is attempting to trap me here
in the heresy of Janerism,
which is very difficult not to answer,
and to answer properly,
and is a heresy even to mention,
so I have to drop this.
But I just wanted to point out,
I'm not going to be entrapped in that standard way
talking about how you can't run from your own legs and all that stuff.
You can't bite your own teeth.
Yeah, right.
So you can't smell your own booger.
You can't watch your head.
How are you going to watch your head?
But that is incorrect, because you can.
So a booger can smell like anything then,
is what you're saying, right?
Well, the problem is...
And who would know?
Who would dispute it?
The discrete mass of useless tissue,
former living self,
has a life cycle, if you want to call it that,
of its own,
and will indeed, ultimately,
after the necessary separation and extraction,
reach a point where it may be sensed with anyone,
with even rudimentary olfactory equipment.
And this is when the purported booger is overripe,
has been too long since,
having been decanted.
This is when it has a smell.
But ideally, of course, it should not smell,
because ideally it should be a comfortable,
friendly, familiar thing,
so recently part of you,
so recently sundered from you,
that one cannot help but feel a little bit of solicitude,
even as one casts it off,
as part of the necessary business
of going about one's life
and separating that which is used up
from that which may,
yet, be employed for some useful,
even, in some cases,
nutritive purpose.
So, there you go.
Okay, that's the end of our question and answer period.
And you know, the Ask Dr. Howell show very often descends
to lengthy discussion of farts and boogers and things like that.
This is because of the way humans generally frame the questions.
And I should say, Stephen,
I actually hoquiera'ed that.






So, obviously!

And more fun will be projected and
broadcast from the Rushwood stage. At this time, the Ask Dr. Hal show goes off
the air. The final poem comes from Percy Shelley,
one of our favorites. Worlds on worlds
are turning over from creation to decay. Like
the bubbles on a river, sparkling, bursting,
born away. But they are still immortal
who through birth's orient portal and death's dark
chasm, hurrying to and fro, clothe their eternal flight
in the brief dust and light gathered around their chariots
as they go. New shapes they still may weave.
New laws, new gods receive.
Bright or dim are they as the robes they last
on death's bare ribs had cast.
A power from the unknown god, a Promethean
conqueror came. Like a triumphal path, he trod the thorns
of death and shame.
mortal shape to him were as the vapor dim which the orient planet animates with light hell sin
and slavery came like bloodhounds mild and tame nor prayed until their lord had taken flight
the moon of muhammad arose and it shall set as while blazoned on heaven's immortal noon
the cross leads generations on swift as the radiant shapes of sleep from one whose dreams
are paradise fly when the fond wretch wakes to weep and day peers forth with her blank eyes
so sweet so faint so fair the powers of earth and air fled from the folding star of bethlehem
