1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,280
THE SURPRISE!

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,680
trashtalk noises

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,280
pergunta

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:21,980
Have.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,660
Suppose it's true after all.

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,300
If so, all you vindictive, moralistic pseudo-Christians who make Jesus look so petty.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,020
All you right-wing ideologues who lie, cheat, and steal in the name of the Lord to grab people's hearts, minds, and money.

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,140
All you self-righteous moralists who think that you know what God Almighty wants us to see, hear, think, and do.

9
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,540
Are in big trouble.

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,800
Oh no, no, please God help me.

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,680
Don't let your mind go to hell.

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,100
Save it and listen to the Self Genius Hour of Slack.

13
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,160
I've seen the final frontier.

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,360
I've seen the final frontier.

15
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,960
The answer lies in the acid.

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,140
Another pop sham.

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,660
For that little amount that you can donate dollars.

18
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,280
Donate dollars.

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,960
Donate dollars.

20
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,060
Oh.

21
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,100
Oh.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:39,720
Oh.

23
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:39,980
Oh.

24
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,680
Five dollars.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,160
Five dollars.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,600
Ten dollars.

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,740
Five dollars.

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,720
Cool.

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,520
Did he get it?

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Did we rule the world?

31
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:45,840
Give it.

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,180
Good.

33
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,860
So, uh, please.

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,900
Bob.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,420
I'm doing it here.

36
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,960
I'm after you now.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,680
Poor Bob.

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,000
I almost felt sorry for him.

39
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,020


40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:11,840
Come together!

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,340
Right here, little cartoon girl.

42
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,340


43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,140
So, the face of sabeau.

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,400
Ok.

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,000
This is tantamount to it.

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,480
Oh, yes, dear friends.

47
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,520
Hi, and welcome back to the Hour of Slack.

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,200
This is a special, special broadcast tonight.

49
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:25,600
I have a lot of feeling in my heart because this is our five-year anniversary.

50
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,980
Five years, dear friends.

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,680
This show, Hour of Slack number 257,

52
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:42,000
marks the fifth year of the word of Bob reaching out across the airwaves,

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,320
reaching out for those subgeniuses and those slackless ones

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,840
who need the slack that Bob can give.

55
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,240
So we've tried to put together a special show,

56
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,480
one that will bless your heart.

57
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,320
And bring you closer to the dogma and the doctrine of Bob's church,

58
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,520
the church of the subgenius.

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,560
I hope it'll help you to understand Bob better,

60
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:22,040
to understand your fellow members and yourself.

61
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,540
Praise Bob.

62
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,280
Oh, wow!

63
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,780
Praise Bob.

64
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,380
Praise Bob.

65
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,540
Praise Bob.

66
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,040
She kept saying over and over and over again,

67
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,560
it's wonderful, wonderful.

68
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,140
And she said as fast as she could,

69
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,860
wonderful, this is wonderful, this is wonderful.

70
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,540
Everything that happens to you,

71
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,800
every second of every minute of every hour of every day,

72
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,480
remember silently to name it,

73
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,500
wonderful, this is wonderful.

74
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,500
And whatever you name, anything in your life,

75
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,120
you want it to come,

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,580
for you.

77
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,700
Are we ready for our time travel

78
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,400
experiment? Then

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,140
set the chronons for

80
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,080
Nexus 3.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Okay, the code is I love pretty words.

82
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,400
I love pretty

83
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,820
words. I love pretty words.

84
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,600
I love pretty words.

85
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,840
I love pretty words.

86
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,260
Now, as you can see, off in the distance,

87
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,620
leaving space for...

88
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,200
And so history

89
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,380
was made, or rather unmade,

90
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,360
as they went back in time.

91
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,020
Past the fighting

92
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,840
Minuteman, past

93
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,160
the Armored Knight,

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
past the Roman warrior

95
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,200
of its prehistoric

96
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,880
cycle.

97
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,100
But we overshot our mark

98
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,020
and we went zillions of years into the

99
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,340
past, into the area of nothingness

100
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,160
and chaos that existed

101
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,200
before the universe.

102
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,140
The primordial vacuum

103
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,720
cleaner.

104
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,920
The dust

105
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,020
balls of space.

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,300
Millions

107
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,140
of miles across.

108
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,320
Gigantic hairballs

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,280
and lint

110
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,800
fill the cosmos.

111
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,700
derp

112
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,180
Eggman

113
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,500
Alcomel

114
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:37,500


115
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:37,780
Master

116
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:37,780


117
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,700
Suburp

118
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:48,720
800

119
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,160
UFO

120
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,180
Earth

121
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,180


122
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,320
On

123
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,540
the

124
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,160
Earth

125
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,220
Omega Funkin' Out!

126
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,500
Get down the Bob!

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,360
Hiss!

128
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,240
Get down the Bob!

129
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,440
Hogley-holey!

130
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,940
Lord God of Hosts!

131
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,860
Hosanna in the heights!

132
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,820
In your super van!

133
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,420
Praise the hub!

134
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,380
Good God!

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,060
Having a nice!

136
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,800
To the popcorn!

137
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,080
Lord of Mice!

138
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
God of Mice!

139
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,640
Lord of Mice!

140
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,980
Lord of Mice!

141
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,340
God of Mice!

142
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,000
Praise the Mice!

143
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,340
God of Mice!

144
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,560
Praise the Mice!

145
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,720
Praise the Mice!

146
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,700
Praise the Dad!

147
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,260
Praise the Prisoner!

148
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,400
Praise!

149
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,140
He gone come back!

150
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,560
One more time!

151
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,840
I ain't waitin'!

152
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
To get under my roof!

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,420
So give it up!

154
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,320
I turn it loose!

155
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
Like my God!

156
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,640
Who take away the sins of the wild!

157
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,680
Have mercy!

158
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Like my God!

159
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,040
Who take away the sins of the wild!

160
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,920
He's super van!

161
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,820
Good God!

162
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:16,760


163
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,200
Uh!

164
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,760
He's super van!

165
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,140
Super! Super super van!

166
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,620
I'm a hot design!

167
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,400
So have a little faith in me!

168
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,340
And I'll protect all my sins!

169
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,900
Oh baby!

170
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,060
Me not yet!

171
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,560
Huh!

172
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,160
You too funky down there!

173
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,300
Uh!

174
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,200
Ha!

175
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,200
Love it with you!

176
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,240
With you too!

177
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,720
Love it with you!

178
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,680
With you too!

179
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,200
Make God bless you!

180
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,100
Bless you too!

181
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,560
Make God bless you!

182
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,540
Bless you too!

183
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,160
Please!

184
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,660
Get slapped!

185
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,780
Oh get slapped!

186
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,380
Please!

187
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,540
God the Holy God!

188
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,000
Praise Bob!

189
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,300
Good God!

190
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
Good God!

191
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,940
Master's ended!

192
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,100
Go in peace!

193
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,200
Bob!

194
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,720
What about Bob?

195
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,920
Shut up human!

196
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,620
He with Bob Dobbs takes my cash from me!

197
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,180
Lost my job!

198
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,140
And lost my wife!

199
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,700
Some genius church wants to take my life!

200
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,800
The catch word revision!

201
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,760
Fills my day!

202
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,020
And still Bob Dobbs demands his pay!

203
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,780
Down in my water I keep my gold!

204
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,820
The guy's being bound!

205
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,980
Bob Dobbs is after my soul!

206
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,140
A smiling creep!

207
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,120
The Dallas hack!

208
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,420
He claims to deliver me eternal slack!

209
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,820
Eternal slack!

210
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,900
Eternal slack!

211
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,140
Eternal slack!

212
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:12,580


213
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:12,620
Eternal slack!

214
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,520
He's got a little snack for the hollies in the car!

215
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,700
A big tiddle up in the downtown bar!

216
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,860
It's time for a big hit!

217
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,600
It's time for a big hit!

218
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,800
Bob Dobbs!

219
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,120
I don't even know what sakes they are!

220
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,640
And I'll sedd my money!

221
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,600
Across the sea!

222
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,020
To the yankers!

223
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,400
And they'll call the lady a drudger!

224
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,020
And I'll become who I want!

225
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,820
And all I know!

226
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,820
Is how happy they are!

227
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,180
When Bob Dobbs takes my cash from me!

228
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,180
When Bob Dobbs takes my cash from me!

229
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,100
I said!

230
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,560
Isn't it wonderful dear friends, what that man-bot can do for you?

231
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:08,080
Ah yes, this is one of those good old times subgenius gospel shows.

232
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,740
I'm sure just brimming over with the spirit.

233
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,320
I don't even care if you are, that's how in the spirit I am.

234
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,340
I don't even care.

235
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,600
But we do it because of love dear friends.

236
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,240
Oh praise Bobby.

237
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,500
Hi, thanks for calling the voice line.

238
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:14,040
You know with this country on the verge of war, it's getting pretty hard to take my line of work, doing voices for radio commercials, all that seriously.

239
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:24,400
In fact, it's getting so that more and more, every time I'm in the studio for a session, I feel just a little bit more hypocritical and guilty.

240
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,480
It's like I'm part of this massive conspiracy to lure unsuspecting people into spending their time.

241
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:31,480


242
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,600
Sending all their money on image enhancing products that in reality they little need, nor ill can afford.

243
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,340
The strange thing is, the more guilty I feel about this situation, the better my work is.

244
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,340
My delivery has improved tenfold since the Iraqi crisis.

245
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,100
I work four or five times a week.

246
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,280
I've even upped my rates.

247
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,140
Just think what would happen in the event of an all out war.

248
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,460
Thinking about it almost makes it worse.

249
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,380
It's worth thinking about.

250
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,640
But as good as I get at my work, I'll still be only a mouthpiece.

251
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,080
A conduit for someone else's concepts.

252
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:18,360
A faceless spokesman for companies who want you to believe their advertising campaigns only a little bit more than they want to believe in them themselves.

253
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,240
Now what do you think?

254
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
Am I cutting my own throat here?

255
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,080
Biting the hands that feed me by verbalizing these thoughts on a demo line?

256
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,440
An audio billboard for the company?

257
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,520
A commodity that I have become?

258
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,960
I don't know.

259
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,740
I can't answer that.

260
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,280
But I do know this.

261
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,320
This country has a long and proud tradition of lying to its own people to serve its own best interests.

262
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,080
And advertising is only one small part of that conspiracy.

263
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,800
Regardless of what I may have told you over the radio, nothing you can buy will make you a better person.

264
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,700
A happier person.

265
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,900
A more spiritually connected person.

266
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,820
Can provide you with the things in life that are truly important to the soul.

267
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,100
There are things that can never be turned into commodities and marketed.

268
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,340
And these things must be searched for within each of us individually.

269
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,320
Our future as a country is built upon lies and deception.

270
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,560
And if you don't think that you're only three paychecks away from that disgusting bum you just passed on the street,

271
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,880
then you too are part of that deception.

272
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:42,160
No matter how much money you have, the sad fact remains that regardless of what color Porsche or BMW or Lamborghini you have,

273
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,860
you will never be one of George Bush's rich friends.

274
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,540
George Bush does not want you to be his friend.

275
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,600
George Bush does not care enough about you to even dislike you.

276
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,540
You cannot afford to buy your way into his hands.

277
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,340
You cannot afford to buy your way into his country club.

278
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:09,520
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields, or a slave in the office, or a slave in the big house on the hill.

279
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:19,000
You're still a slave, and at best, a middle management slave, prodding and whipping and abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor,

280
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,760
praying that you will suddenly find yourself a part of that inner circle.

281
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,640
Believe me.

282
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,520
You will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.

283
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:39,940
And you will be replaced the very next day by yet another well-groomed, well-oiled, eager, well-meaning, brown-nosing slave.

284
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,920
This year's model.

285
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,320
Recently, we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.

286
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,660
Now what do you think brought all that about?

287
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:59,040
Was it because the communist system was flawed and doomed to collapse from its very inception?

288
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,700
No.

289
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,820
I don't think so.

290
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:13,320
I think it was because of the ineffective, greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.

291
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,940
Interesting parallel, don't you think?

292
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:26,520
They're not all that different from the ineffective, greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.

293
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,880
But rather than choose to evict them, as was the case in Russia,

294
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,120
all too often, we choose to emulate them.

295
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:42,740
To ape their postures, their uniforms, their speech patterns and phraseology.

296
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,420
But remember what I said.

297
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,920
George Bush and his rich friends do not need you in their country club.

298
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,660
Stop acting like you're next on the docket, because you aren't.

299
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,880
Stop acting like everything is alright, because it isn't.

300
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,660
Nothing is alright.

301
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:09,940
And if you can look around you at the state of this country and not secretly admit to yourself that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs,

302
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,860
and that their dominoes just happen to fall first,

303
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,480
then either you're truly one of George Bush's rich friends, or else you're truly ignorant.

304
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,920
And all I know is that George Bush's rich friends

305
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,960
probably would not be calling this number to hear my demo line.

306
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,600
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate fiefdom we lovingly sing to in all of those patriotic songs.

307
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,020
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now,

308
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:46,740
remember, you're working at least three of those days to pay off your accrued interest charges

309
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,940
and to help fund a government that can't even help you feel safe as you stand in line

310
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,880
to cash what's left of your paycheck.

311
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:02,280
That 3% at the top, the real inner circle, is bleeding you dry.

312
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,900
It's bleeding this country dry, not to mention what's left of this planet.

313
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,340
And as we trip over each other in our rush to emulate our leaders,

314
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,960
we wallow like pigs in the waste of our abundance, oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.

315
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,760
And why do we continue to do this?

316
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,740
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?

317
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,560
Why can't we learn from our collective histories?

318
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:42,380
And how can I give so freely of my talents and my art to the continued perpetration of this hoax?

319
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,660
I don't know. I can't answer that.

320
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,920
Freedom without a doubt.

321
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:52,920


322
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,700
Without structure is anarchy.

323
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,760
Structure without freedom is fascism.

324
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:06,300
What are you? An anarchist or a fascist?

325
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,640
You cannot afford the initiation fee to George Bush's country club.

326
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,800
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.

327
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,300
Convenience is not freedom.

328
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,500
And the government is not your friend.

329
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Thank you for calling The Voice Line.

330
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,820
Yeah, that was Joe Paulino, dear friends. Reverend Joe Paulino.

331
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,280
Isn't this a funny show?

332
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,980
We don't know where it came from. We can't imagine where it's going.

333
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,900
Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob.

334
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,640
Yeah, so that's why we're on the air.

335
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,360
That's right, we've got to be on the air because within about seven or eight, well I'd say maybe ten years,

336
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,980
most of the human race is going to be dead anyway of AIDS because it's geometrically increasing.

337
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,580
Look, we sincerely hope that once you see what the gods have in store for you by the way of retribution,

338
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,340
tribulation, plague, punishment, and flight, you'll realize just how badly you need powerful friends and benign protectors like us.

339
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:35,000
You may scoff and ridicule this show right now, but the day will come when the stockpiled calamities will all be unleashed on you.

340
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,780
Hey, this is prophecy. Stand by.

341
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,080
Miniature big feet that run around slashing your ankles with poison razor blades, the frozen nitric acid hail,

342
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,900
volcanoes that belch nerve gas, and hallucinogenic dust clouds.

343
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,040
No one does.

344
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,060
The world will engulf millions at a time.

345
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,820
Rogue planets will pull into new solar orbits and disrupt the rotation of the earth.

346
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,540
Some days will be a week long, others no more than a few hours.

347
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,380
Things will fall off.

348
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:12,280
Great skyscrapers filled with horrified screaming people will wrench themselves from their foundations and fly skyward past the atmosphere and out into space.

349
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,560
Shopping malls will sink into the ground and never be seen again.

350
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:25,260
Thousands of comets will burn the moon until it shatters and covers the ground with carcinogenic, dreadful-smelling grit.

351
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,280
Nothing will matter anymore.

352
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,660
It's okay now.

353
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,280
We're all suffering here.

354
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,080
I just want to make a couple of points.

355
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,760
Don't suffer for this.

356
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,060
Hey, look, we've got audio of immune deficiency syndrome here.

357
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,500
Yeah, we'll just clean off the microphone and start all over again here.

358
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,300
There's a possibility that there are numerous bacteriological and viral strains that are being tried on the human race,

359
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,840
by the Mother Earth nature complex.

360
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,960
The human race?

361
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,900
See, you're talking about things that don't really seem to matter, I think.

362
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,620
These are minor matters in the scope of things.

363
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,460
I mean, Dobbs' prophecies laid out what's going to happen in health, industrial, bad things like that.

364
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,180
See, we've got the cases here.

365
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,000
And when you talk about this many people having the disease,

366
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,460
or that many people working in the geological spectrums that are needed to push technology...

367
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,360
Actually, a critical point will be reached sometime around 1988 or so,

368
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,300
when all the available...

369
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,380
Yes, all the available soldiers will be fighting for dogs.

370
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,040
...mainstream population AIDS patients will have been exhausted if the train...

371
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,160
Yeah, but by that date, every single subgenius will have his own radio show, including you.

372
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,680
And, I mean, so we'll all be broadcasting this news at that time, and understanding it...

373
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,160
Okay, what year is the mutant revolution headed off

374
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,760
when Charles Manson discovers the secret Death Valley entrance to Hollow Earth,

375
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,760
and leads all the exiled misfit Nazi hell creatures against the mutant strongholds?

376
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,240
Here they come now.

377
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:00,280
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old, Thou shalt not kill,

378
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,740
and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.

379
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,740
But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with him,

380
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,260
his brother without cause shall be in danger of the judgment.

381
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,220
Ye have heard that it hath been said from eye for eye,

382
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,860
and to a virtue,

383
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,480
that I say unto you, that he resists not evil,

384
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,860
but whosoever shall spite thee on thy right cheek,

385
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,600
turn to him the other also.

386
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,380
Ye have heard that it hath been said,

387
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,960
thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemies.

388
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,420
But I say unto you, love your enemies less than you pursue.

389
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,340
Do good to them that hate you,

390
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,880
and pray for them which despitefully use you in pursuit.

391
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,220
Well, of course, this is absolute biology.

392
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,320
This is biologic suicide.

393
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,860
Suicide's nothing but madness.

394
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,700
No, it's just ridiculous.

395
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,260
Love your enemy.

396
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,040
It isn't easy to love an enemy.

397
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,380
As this goes against your most basic survival instinct.

398
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,580
But it can be done and turned to an advantage.

399
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,600
Let the love squirt out of you like a fire hose,

400
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,580
a molasses.

401
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,700
Give him the kiss of life.

402
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,920
Stick your tongue down his throat.

403
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,800
Taste what he's been eating and bless his digestion.

404
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,920
Booze down into his intestines and help him along with his food.

405
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,300
Life in all its rich variety.

406
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,240
Do not falter.

407
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,220
Let your love enter in unto him and penetrate him with a divine lubricant.

408
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,700
Makes KY Leland feel like sandpaper.

409
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,920
It's the most mucilaginous, the slimiest,

410
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,040
ooziest lubricant there ever was or shall be.

411
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,460
Amen.

412
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,480
Bob.

413
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,380
Bob.

414
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,680
Bob.

415
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,340
Bob.

416
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,140
Bob.

417
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,460
Bob.

418
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,860
Bob.

419
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,240
Bob.

420
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,360
Bob.

421
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,400
Bob.

422
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,480
Bob.

423
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,380
Bob.

424
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:25,560
Bob.

425
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:25,580
Bob.

426
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:25,580


427
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:25,660
Bob.

428
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,040
Bob.

429
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,100
Bob.

430
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:26,620
Bob.

431
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:26,700
Bob.

432
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,080
Bob.

433
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,380
Bob.

434
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,420
Bob.

435
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,200
Bob.

436
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,180
Bob.

437
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,180


438
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,600
Bob.

439
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


440
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


441
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


442
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


443
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


444
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


445
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


446
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


447
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


448
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


449
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


450
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


451
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


452
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


453
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


454
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


455
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


456
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


457
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


458
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,600


459
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,080
Be right enough

460
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,880
It's half as bad as sticking a needle into your vein

461
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,080
You see, you don't get a click of glasses

462
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,720
And you don't make a touch

463
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,920
All you do, you suck on a little reaper

464
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,160
You dump in a smoke

465
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,280
And pass it on to the next person

466
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,260
The buzz comes real fast

467
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,900
And there's no handle

468
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,600
You just light it up like you do a test of feel

469
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,540
You inhale a sweet smell of smoke

470
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,140
You exhale it out of your mouth

471
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,460
That's all there is to it

472
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,940
You see, like an atomic bomb

473
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,260
That's all there is to it

474
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,300
There's a warning step when you ever dreamed

475
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,400
What was up is now

476
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,840
The priority's all screwing

477
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,240
You're going to be a fool

478
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,240


479
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,960
You're running if your hair looks okay

480
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,080
While some new kind of bladder cancer

481
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,120
Is bursting out the front of your desire

482
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,420
Yes, this is bad talk

483
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,580
Nobody will listen to anything else

484
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,900
You won't look at TV unless body parts

485
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,080
Or cars or chicklings are crashing on it

486
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,620
You won't taste your food

487
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,020
Unless it has some nerve drug in it

488
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,000
You haven't used your head or sense

489
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,100
And said you were fine

490
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,060
And you sure as hell won't stop

491
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,540
Once you know it until someone

492
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,240
Much, very, much

493
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,120
Much, much

494
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,360
Much, much more selfishly

495
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,540
Makes you stop

496
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,600
And you'll thank him for it

497
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,340
And then just before you fry

498
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,820
In a flash of radioactive hindsight

499
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,200
You'll realize that he stopped you

500
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,860
From doing the wrong thing

501
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,320
Good God

502
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,140
What in the name of sweet screaming Jesus

503
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,920
Is this world coming to?

504
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,360
People bitch, people gripe

505
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,280
This is the sign of the end times

506
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,980
That's the sign of the end times

507
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,760
When you should all be hollering

508
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,100
It's all a sweet scream

509
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,560
It's all a sweet scream

510
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
When you should all be hollering

511
00:27:59,300 --> 00:27:59,300


512
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,360
Millions are going to be going

513
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,900
And they're going to leave this earth

514
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,440
And they're going to leave their own law

515
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,140
Law of the law

516
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,780
Law of the law

517
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,000
Lost loved ones behind

518
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,040
They must say

519
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,840
Law of the law

520
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,860
Did you hear what he was saying?

521
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,200
Law of the law

522
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,600
Did you hear what he was saying?

523
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,220
Is it possible

524
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,500
That the end of the world will come in July 1999?

525
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,880
Law of the law

526
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,040
Law of the law

527
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,040
In the form of an atomic holocaust

528
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,380
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom

529
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,120
Could generally be dismissed out of hand

530
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:49,740
This is Philo Jones and I'm your host, Bill Nye.

531
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,080

00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:11,900
as we take this one joke and keep blowing it up bigger and bigger and the only reason we're

551
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:18,480
we're pumping so much behind this one joke is that we want to see how big it gets before it explodes

552
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,440
bob bob bob bob

553
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,440
it was at this point that the hypnotist made the decision to take his subject over the hump

554
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,780
buses cars and trains and crafts wives and husbands and babies will disappear

555
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,920
of course your government and all governments they'll be you know trying to fish tail out of

556
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,760
it they'll give you all kinds of excuses you know they'll hide the reality and the ufos or

557
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,600
extraterrestrial invasion of astral projection or god only knows what but they will try to put it

558
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:08,420
under the rug but i'm warning you you've missed it it was bob all along dear friend

559
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,700

561
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,520

this is your prayer partner reverend ivan stang we're going to continue with uh well some of a

563
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,240
little bit of what we have been playing and a little bit of new what we have been playing

564
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:49,060
have been william burroughs and uh that's that's the old guy talking and uh the the kpfa uh subgenius

565
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,020
show but tapes

566
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,020
by puzzling

567
00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:04,280
evidence dr howell gary broke fran mr uh exotic and uh in this case lies lies

568
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:09,940
apocalypse

569
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,000
apocalypse

570
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,000


571
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:52,460
the great god pan is dead

572
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,080
the great god pan is dead

573
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:03,660
pan got a panic the sudden awareness that everything is alive and significant

574
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:17,360
the date was december 25 1 a.d but pan lives on in the realm of imagination in writing and painting

575
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,060
and music look at van gogh's sunflowers rising and falling in the sky and the sun is rising and

576
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:29,040
rising with pretentious life listen to the pipes of pan into duca

577
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:39,740
now pan is neutralized framed in museums entombed in books relegated to folklore

578
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:53,040
but art is spilling out of its frames into subway graffiti will it stop there consider the fact that the

579
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,280
they will be

580
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,600
that would be a

581
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,020
one

582
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,600
altogether

583
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,540
ooon

584
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,200
you

585
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,920
Everything is permitted because nothing is true.

586
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,360
It is all make-believe, illusion, dream, art.

587
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:36,320
When art leaves the frame and the written word leaves the page,

588
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:45,120
not merely the physical frame and page, but the frames and pages of assigned categories.

589
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,060
A basic disruption of reality itself occurs.

590
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,500
The literal realization of art.

591
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,980
Success will write apocalypse across the sky.

592
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,620
The artist aims for a miracle.

593
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:12,780
The painter wills his pictures to move off the canvas with a separate light.

594
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,100
Movement out of the canvas.

595
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,200
The outside of the picture.

596
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:24,280
And one rent in the fabric is all it takes for pandemonium to sluice through.

597
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,140
Last act.

598
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,620
The end.

599
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,060
This is where we all came in.

600
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,740
The final apocalypse is when every man sees what he sees,

601
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,460
feels what he feels, hears what he hears.

602
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:52,380
The creatures of all your dreams and nightmares are right here, right now,

603
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,200
solid as they ever were or ever will be.

604
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,840
Electric vitality of careening subways.

605
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,160
Faster, faster, faster.

606
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,080
Stations flashed by in a blur.

607
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:14,440
Pan, god of panic, whips screaming crowds as millions of faces look up at the torn sky.

608
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,320
Off the track, off the track.

609
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:26,080
The planet is pulling loose from its moorings, careening into space.

610
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,980
Spilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.

611
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:38,180
Spinning faster and faster, days and nights flash by like subway stations.

612
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,200
Tunnels crunch down teeth of concrete and steel.

613
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,900
Flattening cars like beer cans.

614
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:57,420
Graffiti through glass and steel like acid races across the sky in tornadoes of flaming colors.

615
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:05,800
Cherry pickers with satin brushes pick as a door inch through Wall Street,

616
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,940
leaving a vast souvenir postcard of the Grand Canyon.

617
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,640
Water trucks slosh out paint.

618
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:25,040
Outlaw painters armed with paint pistols paint everything and everyone in reach.

619
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:33,120
Survival artists paint cans strapped to their backs, grenades at their belts.

620
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,520
Paint anything and anybody within range.

621
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,920
Scum of the world.

622
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:40,920


623
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,620
Sky riders dogfight, collide and explode.

624
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:52,560
Telephone poles dance electric jigs in swirling crackling wires.

625
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,660
Neon explosions and tornadoes splash through ruined cities.

626
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:08,560
Volcanoes spew molten colors as the earth's crust buckles and splinters into jigsaw pieces.

627
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,000
Household appliances revolt.

628
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,120
Washing machines snatch clothes from the guests.

629
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,200
Gallowing hoovers suck off makeup and wigs and false teeth.

630
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,660
Electric toothbrushes leap into screaming mouths.

631
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,600
The clothes dryers turn gardens into dust bowls.

632
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,740
Garden tools whiz through long parties impaling the guests.

633
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,980
Who are hacked to fertilizer by industrious Japanese hatchets.

634
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,600
Loathsome, misshapen, bulbous plants spring from their bones.

635
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:01,800
Covering golf courses, swimming pools, country clubs, and tasteful dwellings.

636
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,480
At my back, faster and faster, I always hear,

637
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,660
Hurry up!

638
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,000
Energy ground down into, please it's time closing.

639
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:23,660
Sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires erupt from manholes and tunnels.

640
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,980
Break out with volcanic force.

641
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,820
Let it come down careening subways.

642
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,840
Faster and faster, station blur by.

643
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,260
Pan whip screaming.

644
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,120
Screaming crowds with flame pipes.

645
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,140
Millions of faces look up at the torn sky.

646
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,920
Off the track, off the track.

647
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:57,240
Planet is pulling loose from its moorings, careening off into space.

648
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,500
Spilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.

649
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,180
Faster and faster.

650
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,660
Skyscrapers break rents of blue and white paint from the sky.

651
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,840
The rivers swirl with color.

652
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:25,100
Nitrous ochres and red leak through the bridges falling into the rivers.

653
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:32,720
Splashing colors across warehouses and piers and roads and buildings.

654
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,120
Amok art floods in organic mold.

655
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,060
Stirring passions of metal and glass.

656
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,860
Steel girders rising in metal,

657
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,140
Aspersed from their concrete covers.

658
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:58,040
Walls of glass melt and burn with madness and opinion crazed eyes.

659
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,180
Bridges buck cars and trucks into the rivers.

660
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,680
The sidewalks run ahead.

661
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,440
Faster and faster.

662
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,600
Energy ground down into sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires.

663
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,280
Erupts from manholes and tunnels and breaks out with volcanic force.

664
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,180
Let it come down.

665
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,740
Caught in New York to meet the animals of the billion.

666
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,280
The piper pulled down at the sky.

667
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
We're escalating our programming here.

668
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,980
We are no longer going to just have the pseudo experts talking to us.

669
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,700
Three, two, one, tonight.

670
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,320
We're gonna probe around.

671
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,260
Where is it done?

672
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:04,520
Hardly a chance.

673
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,140
Two three.

674
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,000
Two three.

675
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,340
Et voila.

676
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,500
Round and round, look at us go.

677
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:12,500


678
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:12,560
Hard to reach top of it, the water cake Fairy樂

679
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,360
It's what you call crazy off wall ved momentum.

680
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,420
Let it go.

681
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,200
Befullaimed to go was such a chillRP.

682
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,080
Bothered the dust between offices telescope,

683
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,300
важно dose Job the show.

684
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:24,280
We don't know what they came for, but what they aim for is what they want.

685
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,060
Is it possible?

686
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,660
Is it possible?

687
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:51,960
Only those ideas which are accepted are those which are in the hands of the status quo,

688
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,280
which really...

689
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,200
...reaches the wider audience, which makes people brain-dead.

690
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:05,860
And you either have to submit, or you have to join the spectacle, you know, the...

691
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,380
The invasion of body snatchers, that kind of thing.

692
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Yeah, and so we can agree that under that situation, it's a planet of the dead.

693
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,660
And the alternative is not to offer other ideas,

694
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,560
because they'll be quickly consumed and recycled and played out.

695
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,100
So the real alternative...

696
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,220
...is a kind of new yoga, an environmental yoga,

697
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,040
not a private spiritual or Eastern yoga.

698
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,760
The new yoga is to deal with the environments we've created and we all share.

699
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,360
You know what I mean, Mike?

700
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,800
And so that's why we have to deal with the conspiracy,

701
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,880
goes back to that caller,

702
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,340
that if I was able to take control, and I do have control,

703
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,220
but if I was able to present it in the pink world,

704
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,120
then I could bring in this real alternative.

705
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,920
And the way to have an alternative is to change the environments.

706
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,280
One of the ways would be to turn off the electric environment,

707
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,400
can you imagine doing that?

708
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:55,660
Right.

709
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,560
That'd be one...

710
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,720
It's not an alternative idea, that's an alternative percept.

711
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,500
But the pinks are never going to let you do that.

712
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,580
So they will let you have all the celebratory retrievals and replays

713
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,280
and celebrations of ideas and cultures,

714
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,840
because they know the medium is the message, not the content.

715
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:15,500
The content has no importance.

716
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,000
The control environment is those of the emperor, this is his new clothes,

717
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,860
is that he's just going to keep it on.

718
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,420
He's not going to turn it on.

719
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,200
That's a lot of money to be made.

720
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,580
Yeah.

721
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,460
And he's not even making money, he doesn't even want that.

722
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,120
I knew the unholy phoenix was aware that I had recognized it,

723
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:37,280
and it was laughing at me from within the anti-virgins' unhallowed womb.

724
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,500
I felt rage and fear inside of me,

725
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,340
and the voices of the archangels,

726
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,800
broadcast from their secret staging base in the hallowed earth,

727
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,280
raged in my head.

728
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,340
By the time Satan's whore had finished her meal,

729
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,820
I had decided on my course of action.

730
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,100
I followed her home.

731
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,600
She lived in one of those bland, pasteurized, suburban mushroom colonies

732
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,840
that conspiracy-controlled lies of the television and radio

733
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,880
have conditioned the cows to want.

734
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,100
Let them numb the mind with useless consumer goods and luxuries.

735
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,760
Let the cows sate themselves on split-level ranches,

736
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,740
wall-to-wall shag, microwaves, jacuzzis, food processors, and remote-controlled VCRs.

737
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,540
They have pulled the wool over their own eyes,

738
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,040
blinding themselves with animal comfort,

739
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,480
ignoring the signs traced in fire, ice, and blood that

740
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,180
I have come and their time is at hand.

741
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,000
The eastern world, it is exploding.

742
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,420
Violence flaring, bullets loading.

743
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,820
You're old enough to kill, but not for voting.

744
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,000
You don't believe in war, but what's that gun you're toting?

745
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,200
And even the Jordan River has bodies floating.

746
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:09,140
But you tell me over and over and over again, my friend,

747
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,900
how you don't believe we're under evil destruction.

748
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,080
Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?

749
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,160
And can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?

750
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,220
If the button is pushed, there's no running away.

751
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,700
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave.

752
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,240
Take a look around you, boy.

753
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,300
It's bound to scare you, boy.

754
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:49,400
And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend,

755
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:56,140
how you don't believe we're under evil destruction.

756
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,600
This is Hour of Slack number 9183.

757
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,540
May 19th, 21989 AD.

758
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,320
In the news,

759
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:25,340
increased controversy over the skeleton and dwelling place or office of a midhistoric man

760
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:33,880
recently unearthed by scientists in the deserts of Texas in North Amerenid on Earth Farm 1.

761
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:40,480
Due to its special qualities, experts are engaged in heated debate over its origins.

762
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,600
Whether it is merely an advanced homo sapiens,

763
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,300
a Q-man, that is,

764
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,960
or is it one of the earliest homo correctus,

765
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,500
also known as the subgenius,

766
00:48:54,540 --> 00:49:00,440
the last evolutionary step before our own species, homo excelsior?

767
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:09,120
Does this fossil represent the missing link between the lesser gravity-bound bipedal primates

768
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,360
and the subgenius-descended brain race which now conquers the stars?

769
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,760
And what of the claims by cultists

770
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:25,160
and dissidents that it is no less than the skull of one of the early apostles of the historical Dobbs man form,

771
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,680
which brought Slack to Earth Farm 1 in the year 0 B.D.

772
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,280
Or as they measured time, the late 20th century?

773
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,200
Could this be?

774
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:41,640
Most scientists concur that the skeleton could well be that of a man

775
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,780
who walked the Earth at the same time and place as the Dobbs itself,

776
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,720
during his last physical incarnation,

777
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:55,380
an unwitting pre-overman fighter in the bitter struggle which raised homo excelsior

778
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:02,340
from his quagmire of mortality and physics-bound three-dimensional fixed-leggedness

779
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:08,480
and into the energy-based free-thought-form heights of our civilization.

780
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,560
But is it necessarily?

781
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,880
Let's examine the fossil record,

782
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,860
evidence which, while meager on the surface,

783
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:23,200
yet allows skilled experts to reconstruct and describe in extraordinary detail

784
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,740
the life of this mysterious ancient tool-using ape.

785
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,960
Of course, Earth Farm 1 in his time was a much different place than it is today.

786
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,540
Lavishly gifted with surging, plankton-filled oceans

787
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,860
and land masses abundant with plants and animals,

788
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,880
the home-seed planet then bore little resemblance

789
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,120
to the blasted, atmosphere-less testing range

790
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:57,160
all too familiar to modern elementary school environmentologists.

791
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:04,020
But what sort of creature dwelt in this crude office of 20,000 years ago?

792
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,740
Who was he?

793
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:12,200
What was his daily life like there on farm Earth just before the Great Transmigration?

794
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,880
Fossil fragments of his implements seen here,

795
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,180
supplemented by the oral records of our friends the dolphins,

796
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,340
paint a picture of his primeval office.

797
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,260
Constructed of simple wood and metal,

798
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,780
yet he possessed crude computers of a sort,

799
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,740
fashioned entirely from toxic plastics and metals,

800
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,340
powered by artificial electricity.

801
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:47,160
These early computers were sad, immobile, paralyzed boxes,

802
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,480
armless and legless, mere heads,

803
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,080
to be used as little more than flint hatchets.

804
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,640
Their users probably did not even suspect that their computers possessed souls.

805
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,400
Certainly they were never used for the sexual pastimes we enjoy today.

806
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,720
Nevertheless, their presence in this creature's hypothetical office

807
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,320
distinguish him as a uniquely human being.

808
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,260
The electronic animal, the first of his kind.

809
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:21,620
Indeed, he was far more overhuman than this apish reconstruction slide indicates,

810
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:27,960
as seen in slide one, which admittedly resembles the domesticated Eloi

811
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,020
we breed for soul energy.

812
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,460
Even more so, the primitive wild Eloi mocked by our children in zoos.

813
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,320
Homo correctus possesses the familiar unkindness,

814
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,160
and a curved spine.

815
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,760
He was robustly built, with thick, heavy bones.

816
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,100
At this stage of development, he was still better at driving

817
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,260
than at communicating or maintaining peaceful relationships with others,

818
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,440
and not even those of his own kind.

819
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:00,340
That the skeleton was found next to the corroded parts of a harvesting tool,

820
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,200
then called a lawnmower,

821
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:06,680
proves that he was still incapable of such simple telekinesis

822
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,600
as controlling the growth of plants by mental command.

823
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,160
He still had legs, of course,

824
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,340
though those hideous jointed appendages which are only vestigial in our race.

825
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,180
As seen here, the socket at which the femur connects to the pelvis was farther inward

826
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,680
than in Australopithecus, for instance.

827
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,960
So he was capable of walking fully erect if he wore shoes,

828
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:36,540
but abrasion on the coccyx shows that most of the time was actually spent sitting,

829
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,840
perhaps because, like us,

830
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:44,580
his great weight would otherwise have crushed even his massive bones.

831
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:50,640
The skeleton is, at first glance, typical of the humans of that time.

832
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,380
Note that the bones are much thicker than ours,

833
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,000
suggesting that the musculature of this creature had broad anchors.

834
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,600
Physically, these creatures were incredibly powerful.

835
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,960
One of them could easily slay twenty of us in combat.

836
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,820
But were his head shielded from telepathy,

837
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,040
or was it just a matter of time before he could be taken to the hospital?

838
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,200
The only way to know is to have a photographic control by Blightanium.

839
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,820
But, of course, to him, Blightanium was at best a dream.

840
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:23,720
You know, there hasn't been any real advances in your field.

841
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,840
See a gang's all here.

842
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,020
What the heck do we care?

843
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,900
What the heck do we care?

844
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,600
But your tape recorder.

845
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,320
Yes.

846
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,880
Hey, that machine is alive.

847
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,460
Get this thing off of me!

848
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,120
Look, it's crawling right up his leg.

849
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,260
You talking to me?

850
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,340
Yeah, we can see.

851
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,680
How do I kill that?

852
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,860
You can...

853
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,000
Here, we'll show you.

854
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,460
You can take this tape here...

855
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,420
You talking to me?

856
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,840
...and you grind up a little bit of buffalo residue.

857
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,720
Yeah, I'm talking to you, little...

858
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,500
Get in the trash can.

859
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,580
You gotta talk it down.

860
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,320
Yeah, you're in the stupid show.

861
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,860
You gotta be a man about it and talk it down.

862
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,880
You're in the show we're not gonna use, all right?

863
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,700
Get back in the trash can.

864
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,160
Get back.

865
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:06,780
You!

866
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:07,720
Get in the trash can!

867
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:07,960
Back!

868
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,040
Get that razor blade.

869
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,100
Quick, get that editing tape!

870
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:14,060
Get that editing tape so the razor blade slaps.

871
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,860
Razor blade beats tape any time.

872
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:16,540
Oh, yeah?

873
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,100
Yeah.

874
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,740
Get back in the trash can, you stupid.

875
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,180
Get in the trash can.

876
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,540
Oh, what...

877
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,940
The Crocodile.

878
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:34,860
That's one of his favorite pieces.

879
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


880
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


881
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


882
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


883
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


884
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


885
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


886
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


887
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


888
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


889
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


890
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


891
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,860


892
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,520
No animal is half so vile as Crockeywock the crocodile.

893
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,400
On Saturdays he likes to crunch six juicy children for his lunch,

894
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,840
and he especially enjoys just three of each, three girls, three boys.

895
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,620
He smears the boys to make them hot with mustard from the mustard pot,

896
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,560
but mustard doesn't go with girls.

897
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,760
It tastes all wrong with plaits and curls.

898
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,720
With them what goes extremely well is butterscotch and caramel.

899
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,980
It's such a super marvellous treat when boys are hot and girls are sweet.

900
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,140
At least that's Crockey's point of view.

901
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,120
He ought to know. He's had a few.

902
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,240
That's all for now. It's time for bed.

903
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,260
Lie down and rest your sleepy head.

904
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,760
Shh! Listen.

905
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,800
What is that I hear?

906
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,380
Galumphing softly up the stair.

907
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,800
Go lock the door and fetch my gun.

908
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,460
Go on, child, hurry, quickly run.

909
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,840
No, stop, stand back. He's coming in.

910
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,700
Oh, look, that greasy greening.

911
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:33,700


912
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,660
The skin, the shiny teeth, the greedy smile.

913
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,140
It's Crockey Wok the crocodile.

914
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:57,760
Observe here the remarkably small cranium of Homo correctus.

915
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,720
Only 2,000 cubic centimetres compared to our 50,000.

916
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,380
And the characteristic backward sloping forehead.

917
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:10,880
The brain of this animal was capable only of language, tool making and speech.

918
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,140
It had none of the 40 other characteristics of high thought which we take for granted today.

919
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,900
Altogether, his brain had less cells than do those of our contemporary gorilla servants.

920
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:28,500
As certain radical upstart free gorilla gorillas never cease to remind us.

921
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,900
As every school child knows,

922
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,700
our ancestors were able to create a world of free and free animals.

923
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,160
Our ancestors were able to genetically transfer the brain into the chest where it was better protected.

924
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,660
While moving the gonads into the cranium where they best functioned.

925
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,640
But that happened 5,000 years after the last war.

926
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,420
Compared to us then, Homo correctus was truly a monster.

927
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,760
Because of his savage, savage appearance,

928
00:57:54,040 --> 00:58:01,400
primitive peoples on the outer planet still use scary tales of these creatures to frighten their children into behaving.

929
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,680
But this is not the end.

930
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:08,280
Despite the quaint legends of monsters like Dob Squatch or Middle-sized Foot,

931
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:16,220
the idea that some pocket of these biological throwbacks might exist are, if romantic, nevertheless pure myth.

932
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:24,160
Yes, to us, he would look like a mutated, disgusting, violent zoo animal.

933
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,500
But if we could imagine his thoughts,

934
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,320
they would probably prove to be remarkably similar to, say,

935
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,660
those of our own forefathers.

936
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:38,480
Four year olds pondering the mysteries of life, slack, and squirt.

937
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,100

No, shut up, you guys.

Aren't those hate corpses terrible?

976
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:43,520
They're terrible.

977
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,700
Born so good.
