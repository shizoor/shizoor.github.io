1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,200
How?

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,500
Frank and I believe there is something about this mission that we weren't told.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,680
Something that you and the rest of the crew members were told.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,800
Is this true?

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,300
I'm sorry, Dave, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that both of you...

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,520
Sorry to interrupt Frank's party, Dave, but I think we have a problem.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,840
What is it, Hal?

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,280
Oh, my God. It's full of stars.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,700
Hello, this is Pat Robertson.

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,960
I suppose that this next 25 minutes may be the most important in your entire life.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,920
Because I'm going to tell you the greatest secret of all the universe.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,420
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,080
Do you suppose God wants to heal cancer?

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,100
And so we find a great deal of pessimism.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:13,140
And I think a part of the student rebellion, I think a part of the almost frantic quest for pleasure and having a good time is...

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,420
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,240
And so the human race stands at this moment...

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,780
You are a bold and courageous person, afraid of nothing.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,200
One dark and stormy night, you decide to investigate...

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.

21
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,800
And you never return.

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,240
Have you ever said you would sell your soul for one thing or another?

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,820
Better live...

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,980
Lower your voice.

25
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,300
Because someone may be listening.

26
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,900
And I don't mean the man upstairs either.

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,180
No, the man who makes these hot deals lives on the bottom floor.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,500
And nothing is beneath him.

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,440
Hmm?

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,080
Have you ever seen a hero's soul?

31
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,100
Cor peculiarly, maybe bothklärät regularized.

32
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,020
contents and

33
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
The price above WHO KNOWS.

34
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,380


35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,920
Ha ha ha.

36
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,440
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang,

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,620
so glad to be back in the power.

38
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,520
Yes, greater power.

39
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,480
Twenty-five thousand somethings.

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,820
They're watts, they call them.

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,100
And you and I know they're units of Bob energy

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,540
beaming into your brain and mine, too.

43
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,940
I can't escape any more than you can.

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,540
Why do you think I do this?

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,720
Well, here we are, back with the Church of the Subgenius,

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,140
trying to cast the money changers from the temple.

47
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,000
And why? Why do we do that?

48
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,300
So that we can change the money in the temple.

49
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,280
And you can help us in this fight, this battle,

50
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,080
by calling the station.

51
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,520
We've got a new...

52
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,260
Father Joe Mama sermon on tape here,

53
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,300
coming up about Christian pederasty.

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,180
We've got quite a bit of new puzzling evidence

55
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,440
and Dr. Howell show.

56
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,720
And we've got to thank you who pledged last week

57
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,540
and the week before, those who've paid up.

58
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,240
I've been trying to call the big pledgers,

59
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,860
the $60 pledgers.

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,700
And most of you aren't home, ever.

61
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,980
I mean, why don't you get answer machines or something?

62
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,160
Anyway, I have been trying to call.

63
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,120
And you can call us tonight if you want.

64
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,240
Tell Will what it is you want for your $60.

65
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,040
We're going to ride on down there, dear friends,

66
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,700
with the horror.

67
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,740
Yes, the horror.

68
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,040
And the wonderment.

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,100
And the beauty that is our lovely church,

70
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,980
the wonderment of the sub-genius praischbar.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:05:02,680
You have to play the version of где coins

72
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,100
to get into the지

73
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,520
subgenius praise bar.

74
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,520


75
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,220
table. Come on in and relax for a while. But don't go to sleep. You might get mixed up with

76
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,520
the merchandise. You know, I was taking the meat wagon for a spin the other day, and you'll never

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,340
guess who I ran into. At least I couldn't, what with a smashed windshield and all. Funny how one

78
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,360
can dig, dig, dig, dig up customers when they don't even try. Of course, in my business, you don't

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,160
normally have to speed. After all, none of my customers are in a hurry. But on the other hand,

80
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,360
it's not like you have to be a careful driver either, since none of them arrive alive anyway.

81
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,420
But on the other hand, wait a minute, we've got one hand too many. Oh, well, we can always use

82
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,240
the next hand around here. Anyway, like I was saying, that old funeral wagon is hell on wheels.

83
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,040
Just take it easy on the coroners. Which reminds me, once I went so fast, I blew a casket. Let's

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:56,380
see what's on the slab for tonight's examination. Roll out the body. He's a grisly one. Bullet wound

85
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,520
to the head or what's left of it. Oh, well, I guess it doesn't matter. Gray matter, that is.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,340
Let's do some dig, dig, digging and see if we can find out.

87
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,340
more about the poor soul. After all, it's not just a job. It's it's it's an adventure.

88
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,800
And it's Papa Joe Mama coming right up with tonight's sermon, dear friend.

89
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,080
Forgive me, Father.

90
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:48,040
For. Hello, friends and welcome. The title of tonight's sermon is Oedipus Rex Judeorum.

91
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,420
You know, many critics of the Church of the Subgenius say we are actually a perverted cult.

92
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:02,060
Hard to believe, isn't it? And that, my friends, is an outright lie. Sexually promiscuous, maybe,

93
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,120
but sexually perverted.

94
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,660
Never. Well, hardly ever. You see, the definition of perverted is a practice, usually sexual,

95
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,800
that is not proper or normal. So obviously there's a certain amount of academic leeway,

96
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,640
or as the trisexuals put it, a certain amount of fudge factor. You see, one must define the

97
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,860
definition of the definition before one can pass judgment as to whether we are or are not perverted.

98
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,120
After all, what is proper and what is normal?

99
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,340
What is proper is not necessarily perverted.

100
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,820
What is normal is not necessarily normal. And conversely, what is normal is not necessarily proper.

101
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,500
Indeed, the two terms can often be diametrically opposed to one another. Consider, if you will,

102
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:48,360
the definition of proper. The dictionary says proper is that which is right, suitable, or

103
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,260
appropriate. Now I ask you, what could be more appropriate for the use of a sexual organ

104
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,900
than that of sex? What could be more suitable and right for two human beings to do with

105
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,200
one another than to love one another?

106
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,320
We owe the very existence of the human being to the human being.

107
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,340
We owe the very existence of the human race to our forefathers' fornication through four

108
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,140
skins with four mothers and all fours. How can anyone in their right mind debate that

109
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,180
sex is not natural or appropriate?

110
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:22,520
Ah, now there's the key. Someone said right mind, which reminds us of the religious right,

111
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,980
which brings us to the definition of the other definition. What is normal? The dictionary

112
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,680
defines normal as that which conforms to a standard.

113
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,300
What is normal? The dictionary defines normal as that which conforms to a standard. What is normal? The dictionary defines normal as that which conforms to a standard.

114
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,400
What is normal? The dictionary defines normal as that which conforms to a standard. What is normal? The dictionary defines normal as that which conforms to a standard.

115
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,060
What is normal? The dictionary defines table. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary fleshes the number of besides that which is presentable, that which is regular, that which is average.

116
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,060


117
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:44,360
So if the year is 1940 and you live in Germany and you want to conform to the standard, then you break out the brown shirts and become a Jew-eating Nazi.

118
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:50,920
Why not? It's perfectly normal! All the kids are doing it, it's regular, it's average, it's mathematically the norm!

119
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,580
But is it proper? Well, it doesn't take a subgenius to figure that one out. For years,

120
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,440
we witnessed just how proper the normals can be. And for too long, we've stared in silence.

121
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,140
We kept quiet day after day, month after month, year after year, decade after decade,

122
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,260
century after century, millennium after millennium, millennium after millennium.

123
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,940
I could go on and on and on, but the point is when Boy George went platinum, we said nothing.

124
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,260
When the hula hoop was invented, we said nothing. When Senator McCarthy addressed Congress,

125
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,860
we said nothing. When prohibition became law, we said nothing. When Lincoln was elected,

126
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,800
we said nothing. When Galileo was arrested, we said nothing. When Copernicus was condemned,

127
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,220
we said nothing. When Christ was nailed to the cross, we said nothing. And by then,

128
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,420
it was too late, for we had allowed the normals to martyr the wrong Messiah,

129
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,080
and we still haven't lived it down after some 2,000 years. Who do you think calls us subgenius

130
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,760
perverts anyway?

131
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,340
Why, it's the Christians, of course. They're still mad at us. They still haven't forgiven us.

132
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,540
Oh, yes, they say Christ can forgive anyone and anything, but not when it comes to the church

133
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,300
that's subgenius. No, sirree. They gotta keep squeezing the cucumber until it bleeds. Well,

134
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,160
this time, they've gone too far. We've kept quiet too long this time. After all, Bob said himself,

135
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,180
fool us once, shame on you. Fool us 2,000 years, shame on us. We've learned our lesson,

136
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,060
and this time, we're speaking up. We're pointing out hypocrisy, even if it's the entire ugly truth.

137
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,380
We're speaking up. We're pointing out hypocrisy, even if it's the entire ugly truth. We're speaking up.

138
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:17,740
We're pointing out hypocrisy, even if it's the entire ugly truth. We're speaking up. We're speaking up. We're

139
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,320
setting the record straight for once and for all. We're tired of you calling us the perverts

140
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,700
just because we advocate pure, unadulterated, X-rated sex. It may seem like anything and

141
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,280
everything goes in the church to the subgenius, but there are certain universal taboos that

142
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,200
even we would not lower ourselves to. Yes, I'm speaking about child molestation. We abhor

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,340
the practice. We never condone it, at least not in living memory.

144
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,720
Moreover, we despise with equal disdain the opposite of sex with children, which is a

145
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:55,080
right. And this is unacceptable. I'm not kidding, kids. It's wrong. It's not proper.

146
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,900
And it's not normal, no matter how many people are doing it. Bob said it, I believe it, and

147
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:05,820
that's the end of it, friends. Now, we the subgenius don't wish to make any accusations

148
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,820
towards our Christian accusers, but we're on record as condemning sex between children

149
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,660
and their parents. There may have been a few earlier documents to the contrary, but they've

150
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,700
all been revised. I challenge you to listen to me. I'm not going to defend children or

151
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:17,700


152
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:17,700


153
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:17,700


154
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,480
any listener within the range of my voice to produce one shred of documentation that suggests otherwise.

155
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,540
Now, the Christian doctrine, on the other hand, well, to be honest, I have some problems with it.

156
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,960
There's one thing that bothers me most.

157
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,380
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me, at least the last time I checked,

158
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,780
that according to their documents, Christ is the Son of God, and Mary is the Mother of God,

159
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:49,080
and God is the Father of God, but Christ is God also, and yet there is only one true God.

160
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,600
Now, I'm not trying to be critical of the Christians,

161
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,100
but it seems to me that if my religion worshiped a God that sleeps around with his very own mother,

162
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,400
well, I don't think I'd be calling other religions perverted.

163
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,840
Enough said. Good.

164
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,340
Herein is the word of Bob. Praise Bob, all women.

165
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,980
Ah, and thank you, Papa Joe Mama.

166
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,040
Yes.

167
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,760
Yeah, no problem.

168
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:13,960
I'm kidding.

169
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,720
Praise Bob.

170
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:17,720


171
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Praise Bob.

172
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,760
Praise Bob.

173
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:38,780
Praise Bob.

174
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:38,860
Praise Bob.

175
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:38,860


176
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,620
Praise Bob.

177
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,660
Praise Bob.

178
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,760
Yeah, me too.

179
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,620
Here on the 11th moon of the planet Argonaut,

180
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,520
the night-flying mollusk,

181
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,920
builds its nest

182
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,460
in the top-slate crust

183
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,400
of the giant,

184
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,800
slow-moving,

185
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,180
micro-conducting bird.

186
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,860
Eating the triangular, microwave-cooked fish.

187
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,520
These creatures evidently use

188
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,580
some organic form of radar

189
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,140
to navigate in the perpendicular darkness

190
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,800
of its xenophallus atmosphere.

191
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,340
I don't understand what's happening here.

192
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,620
You're not supposed to.

193
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,220
Oh, no.

194
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,860
I mean, this is the show with no limits.

195
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,100
Nobody understands how it works.

196
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,080
This nine-pound spider

197
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,800
has its eye on that night-flying mollusk

198
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,180
and is ready to spin her deadly web.

199
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,860
It's too late.

200
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,040
Don't even bother writing it down.

201
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,740
It's too late to call this show.

202
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,640
I wouldn't look behind you, Collier.

203
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,100
It's a big thing back there with a web.

204
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,860
It's making a web.

205
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,400
Don't turn it off.

206
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,040
Its 12 horny legs,

207
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,140
covered with epigastric scoops,

208
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,900
are used for gathering the terral,

209
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,000
as the nerds call it,

210
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,680
the exudation,

211
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,920
from the night-flying diving mollusk.

212
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,620
Well, we don't know if you should or not.

213
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
You'll have to ask your physician.

214
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,400
How about the very breast of Aunt Bertha?

215
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,980
LBJ was a-flyin' one mornin'

216
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,960
Over South Louisiana

217
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,660
Feelin' for a lorn

218
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,920
Then he looks down below

219
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,440
And what does he see?

220
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,020
Two cages full of

221
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,180
Bob Bronski

222
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,360
So he lands and says

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,420
Thanks for helpin' you

224
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,660
Bob's mother

225
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,540
And then two

226
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,160
Two Cajuns

227
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,520
Looked at each other

228
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,880
Said he might be smart

229
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,360
But I'll tell you somethin'

230
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,480
He don't know a thing about alligator huntin'

231
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,180
Oh, bop, bop, bam, bam

232
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,220
Who likes Bob?

233
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,720
Bob

234
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,220
Go, go, go with a smile

235
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,940
But it was an example of intestine fortitude as supported by Count Veran von...

236
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,520
Bob, a light ear is why you get me ready for that haircut

237
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,420
He composed 27 arias,

238
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,160
67 motets,

239
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,440
12 operas,

240
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,240
and 14 symphonias

241
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,140
While he fired 47 children

242
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,720
and scribbled night and day to maintain himself

243
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,540
in a state of madness, syphilis, blindness, deafness, and extreme poverty

244
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,280
Here in Old Southbrook

245
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,520
Stop, stop, it's too nice

246
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,960
What a romantic story

247
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,140
He studied under Giovanni Rodrigo Dovzini

248
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,280
Who played this exciting Cucurrara cantata

249
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,740
The Mb-b-b concerto

250
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,780
I think there's a fight over the spelling

251
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,820
It might have been Dovzini

252
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,180
Roberto Dovzini

253
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,880
Who smoked a pipe and during the arias and would cause coughing fits

254
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,180
His Largo on the Pipes won the irritation of George III

255
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,380
Who called him that damned bounder who aggravates my gout

256
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,240
Oh

257
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,920
Here the flatulent horn cornet quintet

258
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,440
Performs the Cock-a-snook, Cock-of-the-Walk concerto

259
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,260
Oh, in that case, I'd like to know what the hell that was

260
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,060
I guess I'm off

261
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,020
Oh yeah, I'm done

262
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,920
Okay, alright

263
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,860
Hold on, hold on

264
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,980
I'll change the programming

265
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,000
Just a moment, just a moment

266
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,580
Yeah, try to get eminent here

267
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:48,680
Yeah

268
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,620
Keep bustin'

269
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,340
What's he making?

270
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,360
A bowl, right?

271
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,460
Hey, um, look at these

272
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:23,320
A-a-a-a-ama-ma-ma-ma-ma-may-keien-st Silently sit down on an carte

273
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,520
Our question in a acordion.

274
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,300
windows overflowed or pockets.

275
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,640
This plague is pornography.

276
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:43,160
It's not correct to think that only dirty old men would produce or be connected with this threat to your family.

277
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:51,880
Boy scout leaders, lawyers, actors, businessmen, clergymen, and even preteens.

278
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,080
Every part of you that are involved with it.

279
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,860
Those you might least suspect.

280
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,140
What you are about to hear is a sampling of pornography today.

281
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,880
Does it shock you?

282
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,100
Does it make you feel sick inside?

283
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,560
Let us begin.

284
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,280
Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop.

285
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,700
Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop.

286
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,080
When you're confronted with a serious, serious subject like the Kennedy assassination,

287
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,000
with as much information that's available on it,

288
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,580
and instead, you know, what you want to talk about is that what interests you is the Church of the Subgenius.

289
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,900
Well, you know, don't complain when you see what goes on.

290
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,360
Because, frankly, you know, the Church of the Subgenius is nonsense.

291
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,620
I mean, it's triviality.

292
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,480
It has no significance for any —

293
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,280
— anything that anybody would know.

294
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,280


295
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,780
going to care about for any length of time.

296
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,240
You know, it may be lots of fun, and I don't mean to belittle

297
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,260
it as such, but when you're

298
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,180
faced with a serious situation, you've got a world that's

299
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,140
on the verge of nuclear holocaust

300
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,400
and the all-democratic institutions

301
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,100
in this country that haven't already vanished

302
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,740
are under severe attack.

303
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,180
And when all that comes to mind is the Church of the Subgenius,

304
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,340
I've got to think that's one of the reasons we're in the trouble we're in.

305
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,900
Well, just to

306
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,100
try and put the Church of the Subgenius to rest,

307
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,440
those of you who are not familiar with it, the Church of the Subgenius

308
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,640
is essentially a group that,

309
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,880
and I'm sure that people will argue with me with this,

310
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,460
but it's essentially sort of a comedy routine.

311
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,480
I mean, they may have a philosophical point, but it's

312
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,720
based on humor. There are articles about it

313
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,900
in John Rubenstein's, John Carroll's

314
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,460
column in the Chronicle and things of that nature.

315
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,960
It's more or less a sort of a comedy affiliate.

316
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,720
It's about as politically weighty,

317
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,040
or less politically weighty than, you know,

318
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,860
Saturday Morning Kids TV, so there's nothing

319
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,280
to it.

320
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,500
Okay.

321
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,520
We may just be a joke,

322
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,560
but it's a joke

323
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,360
you can believe in!

324
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,500
A joke!

325
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:55,980
A joke!

326
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,520
A joke!

327
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,320
If a joke is a knowledge

328
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,280
that's believed in, don't blame Bob!

329
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,820
He doesn't make history!

330
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,400
He just

331
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,700
exploits it.

332
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,540
Right, Bob?

333
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,080
Bob? Bob?

334
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,840
Okay, show us your big, powerful

335
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,020
one.

336
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,620
Well, hold on while I pull down my cap.

337
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,160
Oh, no, it's that other call.

338
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,200
Look at the size of that thing!

339
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,800
It's so...

340
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,720
Repugnant.

341
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,440
Where and where is the Batman?

342
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,080
Yeah, where is the Batman when we need him?

343
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,900
When this show is getting out all over the airwaves

344
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,280
and more power than ever before

345
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,740
and the Batman ain't here to stop us, is he?

346
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,860
Eh, who cares?

347
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,980
Oh, yes.

348
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:59,280
You are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

349
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,900
Yes, the voice of the church of the subgenius, dear friends.

350
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,160
And, well, you know, this morning I was reading

351
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,460
in the Dallas Morning News

352
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:20,540
their usual weekly Sunday article on Terry Hoffman, my guru.

353
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,960
But I should...

354
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,400
I shouldn't talk about that yet.

355
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,660
It might injure the chances of her getting her just desserts

356
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,360
from my buddies, the Dark Lords.

357
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,900
But I also read in the paper this thing about...

358
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,760
that reminded me about the little controversy

359
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,580
over the Dakota brand cigarettes

360
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,920
that the R.J. Reynolds Company is trying to market.

361
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,620
You know, they started to market this brand,

362
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,440
a brand of cigarettes called Uptown menthol cigarettes,

363
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,540
which were entirely designed to appeal to their idea

364
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:08,080
of an urban black market for customers for cancer.

365
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,200
But Dakota cigarettes, well, they realized,

366
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,840
well, no, no, that's too racist.

367
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,780
They caught us at that.

368
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,460
We can't do that.

369
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,800
So let's do these Dakota cigarettes for...

370
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,160
And get this.

371
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,660
The people they wanted to...

372
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,700
aim their marketing campaign at

373
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,220
were what they called virile women.

374
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,320
Dakota cigarettes for virile women,

375
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,740
which they defined as young women

376
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,880
aged 20 to 29, something like that,

377
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,680
who were a lower socioeconomic group,

378
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,960
stringy-haired,

379
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,140
um...

380
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,180
country music fans,

381
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,080
who wanted to do only whatever their boyfriend wanted to do.

382
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,780
In other words, dear friends,

383
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,860
what they were marketing the Dakota cigarettes at

384
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,660
were Pobucker girls.

385
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,880
Now, you've heard we on the Hour of Slack here

386
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,320
use the term Pobucker.

387
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,600
I realize that I haven't really defined that

388
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,760
in several years on the air.

389
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,120
A lot of people read the way...

390
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,820
Pobucker is used in context

391
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,820
in the subgenius writings.

392
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,300
They assume that that means

393
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,140
people who are po or poor in bucks

394
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,040
because it obviously sort of meant

395
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,180
white trash.

396
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,580
Yes, Pobucker.

397
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,640
The subgenius term for white trash.

398
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,720
Actually, Pobucker can be of any race,

399
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,600
but somehow they...

400
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,820
I don't know, it seems to fit better for...

401
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,060
uh...

402
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,980
well, the...

403
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,100
the boopers.

404
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm gonna tell you where the word Pobucker came from.

405
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,000
It actually...

406
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,840
comes from South Carolina.

407
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,980
My dad has used that word.

408
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,100
He was raised there in South Carolina.

409
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,220
He's used it all his life

410
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,640
to mean people with no values,

411
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,180
uh...

412
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,480
people with no class.

413
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,320
But it originally comes from the African.

414
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,760
The slaves who were brought over, uh...

415
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,400
and were working in the fields in South, uh...

416
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,040
Carolina,

417
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,320
had a word for...

418
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,140
for demons,

419
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,900
or monsters.

420
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
That was Booker.

421
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,040
Uh...

422
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,400
They...

423
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,500
also referred to the white masters

424
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,940
as Booker.

425
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,040
Bookerman.

426
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,240
Which is in fact where our term

427
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,600
Boogeyman comes from.

428
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,800
Uh...

429
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,040
Pobuckers were poor bookers.

430
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,040
Bookers.

431
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,540
Poor bookers.

432
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,040
Uh...

433
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,020
You know, people who were as low down as the sun.

434
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,240
They were slaves,

435
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,920
but wouldn't admit it.

436
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,080
Uh...

437
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,440
So...

438
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,220
Pobucker,

439
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:53,980
Boogeyman,

440
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,400
uh...

441
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,520
also...

442
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,320
uh...

443
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,140
shows up...

444
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,380
The same sort of idea shows up in the...

445
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,980
the Sioux Indian language.

446
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,880
The, in fact,

447
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,440
Dakota language.

448
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,160
Or Lakota,

449
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,100
depending on which part of South Dakota

450
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,520
the particular, uh...

451
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,980
Lakota people are in.

452
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,440
Their word for the...

453
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,220
the demon,

454
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,600
for the Boogeyman,

455
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,980
was Washichu.

456
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,820
Which also came to mean white man.

457
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,420
And in fact to this day is still

458
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,180
the... the term for...

459
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,980
well, for that matter,

460
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,820
black people too.

461
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,360
Because as far as they're concerned,

462
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,620
you know, white people, black people,

463
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,620
they're both invaders from another world.

464
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,040
Uh... or were.

465
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,440
I mean, you know, geez.

466
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,680
At this point, it's...

467
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,700
it's all one world, man.

468
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,400
Ever since the harmonic convergence.

469
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,660
And of course in Japan,

470
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,040
the word is Gaijin.

471
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,080
Uh...

472
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,020
For Boogeyman or, uh...

473
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,940
uh...

474
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,060
foreigner.

475
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,020
But...

476
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,340
the...

477
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,820
my point actually is,

478
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,920
if I have one,

479
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,900
and I'm not really sure that I do,

480
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,120
the point is that...

481
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,480
that an accent does not a Pobucker make.

482
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,120
Um...

483
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,500
Just because somebody talks like...

484
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,420
like a hick,

485
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,760
it does not mean that they have no values.

486
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,660
There are many Pobuckers who,

487
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,600
uh...

488
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,920
may sound like, uh...

489
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,140
television announcers.

490
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,840
But...

491
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,000
you know, that car's still been up on roads.

492
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,000


493
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,260
And, uh...

494
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,260


495
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,700
I've been in the blocks in their front yard for the last five years.

496
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,220
And...

497
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,960
it's always going to be there until they finally get moved away for some...

498
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,860
Well, anyway...

499
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,040
I didn't want to get, uh...

500
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,680
totally lost in the dogma.

501
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,420
And in fact, I have a rant coming up here.

502
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,960
But before I get into that,

503
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,320
I...

504
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,380
I reckon...

505
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,780
I ought to play, uh...

506
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,580
a cart.

507
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,420
I've got this...

508
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
See, our show...

509
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,980
the...

510
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,120
the show is dependent upon when my original tape needs to be flipped over.

511
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,240
I will mention that you can call this, uh...

512
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,200
radio station and ask what we're doing.

513
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,600
What I have coming up,

514
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,960
what I'll be reading in about...

515
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,080
oh...

516
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,260
two minutes here,

517
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,420
is...

518
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,440
something that Reverend Nancy Regalia sent,

519
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,440
called,

520
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,540
The End Times,

521
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,360
The Reagan Years.

522
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,900
Um...

523
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,800
Her introduction here says,

524
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,920
For those of us lucky enough to have survived,

525
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,160
the eight years of the Reagan reign were interesting times indeed.

526
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,760
Looking back on the 80s,

527
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,640
it's both titillating and unnerving

528
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,400
to see just how closely our beloved leader,

529
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,960
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

530
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
and the so-called Great Communicator,

531
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,320
resembled one another.

532
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,680
Is it just possible that Ronnie was the feared anti-Bob?

533
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,980
The reviled Dick Dobbs?

534
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,020
And we never realized it?

535
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,160
Or could it possibly be that the so-called Android Double

536
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,820
rumored to have been sacrificed in Dobbs' place,

537
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,800
during the fateful night of Slack,

538
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,480
was actually a surgically altered Ronald Reagan?

539
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,680
And that Bob has been secretly governing the U.S.

540
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,300
and sleeping with Nancy Reagan all this time?

541
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,620
Who knows?

542
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,940
We'll find out,

543
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,980
come X-Day.

544
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,020
However, the following 100% real fact timetable,

545
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,100
which I'm about to read after the commercial,

546
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,600
was culled from the excellent subversive anarchist tract,

547
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,980
The Clothes Have No Emperor,

548
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,420
by Paul Slansky,

549
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,320
published by Simon & Schuster's Fireside Books,

550
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,600
my good friends,

551
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,940
and located in the humor section

552
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,820
of your local Books R Us store down at the Hell Plaza.

553
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,400
Slansky mentions the late St. Tim McGinnis,

554
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,440
praise his sweet name, in his afterword,

555
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,520
so you can tell this book is a must-have.

556
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,940
Tim was the fellow who edited Book of the Subgenius

557
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,700
and all of our books.

558
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,960
So Mr. Slansky did a great job

559
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,380
and please don't sue us.

560
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,200
We will read these revelations

561
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,000
after this message.

562
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,620
Has this ever happened to you?

563
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,140
Why, I should have been there, Ted.

564
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,960
It was great.

565
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,080
There was free booze, great music,

566
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,020
one of the best parties I ever went to.

567
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,520
Where were you that night?

568
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,600
I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

569
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,420
I guess I should have gone, huh?

570
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,940
Didn't you feel stupid?

571
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,920
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night,

572
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,740
that party?

573
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,740
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn

574
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,960
how to do that very thing.

575
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,080
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

576
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,960
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time,

577
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,860
slow turn,

578
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,320
and make time run backwards.

579
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,560
But most importantly,

580
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,180
you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

581
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,400
How, you may ask?

582
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,860
Well, just ask this man here,

583
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,580
an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

584
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,980
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

585
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,700
Blango.

586
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,880
My dog was dead.

587
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,700
Was I sad till I met Bob.

588
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,660
Bob showed me how I could go back,

589
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,260
get the registration number for the car,

590
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,700
do a slip job on the brakes,

591
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,680
and wouldn't you know it,

592
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,120
that truck went off into a ditch

593
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,900
and burst into flames just exactly a block

594
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,940
before he could hit old Booger.

595
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,700
Ain't that right, fella?

596
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,720
Yes, just imagine the horrible things

597
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,060
that could be undone tomorrow

598
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,900
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

599
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,920
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

600
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,120

on the boarded-up windows of abandoned tenements.

701
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,980
December 1983.

702
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,100
Quote, this is President Reagan on Armageddon.

703
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,540
Not until now has there ever been a time

704
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,900
in which so many of the prophecies are coming together.

705
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,460
There have been times in the past

706
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,960
when people thought the end of the world was coming and so forth,

707
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,460
but never anything like this.

708
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,120
At the same time, Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue stated,

709
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,120
quote, we're the American youth,

710
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,540
and youth is about sex, drugs, pizza, and more sex, unquote.

711
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,380
January 1984.

712
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,420
President Reagan at the National Prayer Breakfast said,

713
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,160
if we could add together the power of prayer

714
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,400
of the people just in the United States,

715
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:23,940
and the power of the people in this room,

716
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,140
what would be its mega-tonnage?

717
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,560
July 1984.

718
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,380
James Oliver Huberty strolls to the local McDonald's in San Diego,

719
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,000
where he kills 21 and wounds 19

720
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,560
before being taken down by the police.

721
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,560
Also that month, National Examiner reported

722
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,000
that Nixon was grooming Elvis for the presidency.

723
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,000
July 1984.

724
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,380
A spade.

725
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,980
A small polyp is found on President Reagan's large intestine.

726
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,540
August 1984.

727
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:05,060
When asked by reporters about arms control during a Santa Barbara photo op,

728
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,920
President Reagan grunts and shrugs for several seconds

729
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,020
until Nancy, lowering her head, mutters, quote,

730
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,920
doing everything we can, says the leader of the free world

731
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,280
and the most powerful man on earth, doing everything we can.

732
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,920
July 1984.

733
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,620
Steve Clark, of the chairman of the Young Republicans at that time, said,

734
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,200
quote,

735
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:35,500
President Reagan is a symbol to a generation happy with itself, unquote.

736
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:42,140
In September, Reverend W.A. Criswell of Dallas, who delivered the closing benediction at the

737
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,560
GOP convention, said,

738
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,320
this thing of separation of church and state is a figment of some infidel's imagination,

739
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,620
unquote.

740
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,880
October 1984.

741
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,540
Quote, I'm legally and every other way emotionally entitled to be what I want to be and that's

742
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,200
what I want to be and that's what I am, unquote.

743
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:10,200
That was George Bush explaining why he calls himself a Texan, although he was born in Massachusetts,

744
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,520
grew up in Connecticut, lives in Washington, and pays taxes in Maine.

745
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,340
October 1984.

746
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,420
Nancy Reagan at a Georgia press conference announcing a drug awareness program said,

747
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,180
quote,

748
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,920
I'm here for drugs, unquote.

749
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:35,380
Also October 1984, AP reports the existence of a CIA-prepared manual showing Nicaraguan

750
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,500
rebels how to blackmail unwilling citizens into supporting their cause, how to arrange

751
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:47,380
the death of fellow rebels to create martyrs, and how to kidnap and neutralize or kill government

752
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:47,940
officials.

753
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,560
February 1985.

754
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,640
Senator William Cohen and Senator William Roth reveal that the Navy has been paying

755
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,060
$640 each for toilet seats.

756
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,500
In March, a second benign polyp was found in the president's colon.

757
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,800
April 1985.

758
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,280
Federal officials reveal that the unicorns at Ringling Brothers Circus are goats whose

759
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,540
horns have been surgically altered to grow together out of a human.

760
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:20,540


761
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:20,540


762
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:20,640
The

763
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,860
lack of health is

764
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:21,860


765
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,780
July 1985.

766
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,920
Baptist Minister Dwight Weimer.

767
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,900
We all want to be Haz spouse.

768
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
He實施��력.

769
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:57,140
stool to teach Bible students to obey God. He discontinued the practice once told that he'd

770
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:06,180
be prosecuted should the 12-volt shocks cause injury. July 1985, President Reagan, while having

771
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:12,560
a benign polyp found in March removed, is discovered to have yet another polyp, this one

772
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,440
precancerous. In August, he revealed that a biopsy performed on his nose skin proved that an

773
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:28,460
irritation was skin cancer. August 1985, Attorney General Ed Meese flew to Arkansas to chop down

774
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:35,040
marijuana stocks for the cameras. A bad weather forced him to settle for posing with a pile of

775
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,200
already confiscated plants. The White House confirmed that as head of the Screen Actors

776
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,540
Guild, the president had been charged with the misdemeanor of the marijuana drug. The White House

777
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:49,320
confirmed that President Reagan had doubled as an FBI informant. In October, Rock Hudson died of

778
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:57,240
AIDS. Shirley Boone, the wife of Pat Boone, rushed to his home, grabbed Rock Hudson's legs, and spoke

779
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:06,700
in tongues for half an hour in an attempt to resurrect him. As Attorney General Ed Meese said,

780
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,500
you don't have many suspects who are innocent of a crime that's contradictory.

781
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:21,040
If a person is innocent, then he's not a suspect. The Miranda Act only helps guilty defendants. Most

782
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,580
innocent people are glad to talk to the police. They want to establish their innocence so that

783
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:33,920
they're no longer a suspect. Right after that, President Reagan admitted that he had yet another

784
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,880
skin cancer removed from his nose.

785
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,620
Friends,

786
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:51,180
it's a pretty serious little history there. And, you know, this document goes on for another five

787
00:42:51,180 --> 00:43:00,480
pages. It's written another five years of benign polyps, space shuttle explosions,

788
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:11,420
Lyndon LaRouche quotes, and child rapes, and so forth. You know, this truly is

789
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,940
the world we're stuck in. But praise Bob anyway.

790
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:25,980
All right.

791
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:27,960
Bruce Wayne.

792
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,440
I'm trying to avoid all this, but I can't.

793
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,860
Oh, are you going to blow me up now, or what?

794
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,420
Is that what you want, caller? You want to be blown up? Blow up real good, to borrow a phrase from another comedy show?

795
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,460
Yeah, we'll do that.

796
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,020
I don't want to be blown up.

797
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,960
Hello, you're on the air.

798
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:52,400
He asked for it. I believe in everything you're doing here tonight, as long as you pay me to say that.

799
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:58,040
Okay, now, on Friday, the president's face is missing. 1971 comedy is coming on.

800
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,640
This is an exceptionally good thing.

801
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,300
That was a spooky one. The alien's tentacles, the alien's testicles.

802
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
They removed Kennedy's face from his cadaver.

803
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,880
And it's followed by, they saved Hitler's mustache in 1956.

804
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,000
It's actually Hitler's mustache, isn't it? It's down at the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum on Fisherman's Wharf.

805
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,620
Haven't you seen it?

806
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,880
And they say that every St. Swithin's Day, it twitches disgustingly.

807
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,560
Yeah, we're watching it now. Look at that obscene dance that little mustache is doing.

808
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,040
Boy, if we could just harness this power, we could solve the energy crisis.

809
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,740
That's right, and we have some left over for the South African Nazis.

810
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,180
We can throw a bridge over the Rhine River and have a jog.

811
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,200
And the South African killer bees.

812
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,880
Participating with the show there. Too bad you didn't have it on the air. It was definitely history-making.

813
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,120
What? What are you talking about?

814
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:37,420
What?

815
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,580
I'm talking about the war.

816
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,260
You fade it out. You fade it out.

817
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,040
Unfortunately, we didn't have it on the air.

818
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,220
Yeah, sadly. Sadly.

819
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,680
Oh, Ed Bradley, yeah.

820
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:50,620
Yeah, Mayor Bradley. But, you know, I think the great thing about Kennedy is when he drinks, you can see the water come out of the back of his head.

821
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,920
Yeah, it is pretty neat.

822
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,880
While we're talking about that, we're going to go to our other correspondent.

823
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,240
We all know he shot himself. He blew his brains out in the car.

824
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,440
And we know Jackie was not with him. It was a suicide.

825
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,140
I'm proud of people who should have stared and picked their nose.

826
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,000
No, okay, that's not the truth, but it's partial.

827
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,380
Yeah, I know.

828
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,860
Do you know that more people believe in war?

829
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,480
World War III than believe in God now in the United States?

830
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,360
This is Ann. Collect call from Eddie and Brooklyn.

831
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,780
How can God stop World War III then?

832
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,700
Come on, Ann Berkeley.

833
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,560
Will you accept charges?

834
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,380
What? Depth charges?

835
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,080
Depth charges.

836
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,840
Clear the studio.

837
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,120
Up to you.

838
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,140
I gassed the magnetic mines.

839
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,560
That's right.

840
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,160
What's your point there?

841
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,000
I'm in lot number eight. Can y'all help me get out of lot number eight?

842
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,860
What parking spot are you in?

843
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,500
I'm not sure. I can't find lot eight.

844
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,740
Look, on top of the streetlights, it'll say D2.

845
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,500
You have your ticket. You have your ticket on your dashboard.

846
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,600
I parked right next to a big Ferris wheel.

847
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,680
Okay, call the attendant.

848
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,740
Okay, that means you're at the pike.

849
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,360
Call the attendant and see if Ferris Bueller will let you out of the parking lot.

850
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,540
Okay. This damn pay toilet won't flush.

851
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,560
That's okay. Just as long as... We'll have someone come in and flush it for you.

852
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,420
You know, you ought to be lucky that you're here in America.

853
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,300
Most people don't even have toilets in their cars in the third world.

854
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,820
You're right. And certainly not with pay phones right there next to them.

855
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,080
Well, if you get to keep the dimes, what's your beef?

856
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,000
Here's my little FCC license.

857
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,340
Here we are.

858
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:06,860
I said...

859
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,800
J. Edgar Hoover.

860
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:16,100
1987 biography based on the life of the lawyer who created the FBI and built it into the most sophisticated investigative agency in the world.

861
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,820
110 minutes at 8.05 a.m. on Wednesday.

862
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:20,840
Who's I talking about?

863
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,940
I think he's a communist spy.

864
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,560
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's right.

865
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,900
Let's watch it then.

866
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,560
Oh!

867
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,320
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

868
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,200
Can I bring out just one toy for us?

869
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,700
No, Gary. Jesus said,

870
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,320
From each according to his need,

871
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,780
To each according to his need.

872
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:47,080
That means you have to give everything you take out of the old abandoned building to me, Aunt Bertha.

873
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,900
Dial a story.

874
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,900
KPFA Radio.

875
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,420
Berkeley, California.

876
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,420
But, Edgar, I'm scared.

877
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,480
It says right in the Bible we are supposed to steal things.

878
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,880
Don't make us do this, Edward.

879
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:07,640
Now go on, or you'll be turned into a pillar of boiling fire just as Yehob was...

880
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,840
...in the book of Santa.

881
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,780
Hurry up, you little brat.

882
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,380
Climb into that second story window.

883
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:15,800


884
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,940
I'll just keep poking you with my crutch here.

885
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,700
Oh, my.

886
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,300
Oh, it's the alarm.

887
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,580
Run, children.

888
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,460
The police will be here any moment.

889
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,400
Hello, you're on the air.

890
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,880
Hey, Aunt Bertha. Hey, Aunt Bertha, turn around!

891
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,260
We'll be back to Aunt Bertha's crime squad in a moment.

892
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:37,760
But first, we need to get out of here.

893
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,820
First, this caller.

894
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,320
That caller. Oh, I'm on the air.

895
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,400
You, right over there.

896
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,100
Oh, hey, me. Hands up. Hands down.

897
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,620
Do your duty, officer.

898
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,840
I'm sorry. No, you get it.

899
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,020
Is that the police?

900
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:49,940
No, I'll get it. I'll get it.

901
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,580
Let's see if it's a real caller.

902
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,160
Hello, you're on the...

903
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,420
Oops. Well, we lost both the callers that time.

904
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,140
Well, that's fun, though, you know, because...

905
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,400
They get so close to the station, but...

906
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,660
Caller jungle rule.

907
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,640
So near and yet so far.

908
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,380
So far.

909
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,740
You know, this reminds me of a news ring anecdote.

910
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,020
Me too.

911
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,920
No, no, it was me, and I was out in the, uh, lonely railway station.

912
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,260
Well, then maybe you better go...

913
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,500
Hal, the story you're remembering about yourself was the time...

914
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,280
Which one of you sent that, uh, douche bomb to Aunt Bertha?

915
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,800
Oh, he did it.

916
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,360
Place the biting liquid on your tongue and palate.

917
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,120
Feel the acid stain as it penetrates to your nose and throat.

918
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,660
You're going to...

919
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,780
You're got your see makin' it.

920
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,020
You're going to do it, então.

921
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,560
And your淡roffen.

922
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,100
You're going to kill yourself.

923
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,100


924
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,100


925
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,100


926
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,100


927
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,100


928
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,380
You нес � Civil Department, will first womvent do innafoor котat Chicken.

Yours not onig Yearhud ith the radio station.

930
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,080
and it trades to your nose and throat.

931
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,160
Unfortunately, they have to maintain a starvation diet

932
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,020
in order to keep making money from their unrealistic looks.

933
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,380
Place the biting liquid on your tongue and palate.

934
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,120
Feel the acid stream as it penetrates to your nose and throat.

935
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,500
Do you feel pain in your throat when you'reегlected?

936
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,560
Feel and touch theges of darkness and your imagination?

937
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:24,800
What makes you feel?

938
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,620
I find it scary when I'm droit straight from court,

939
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:31,560
getting交 teb desired by the willow tree leaves.

940
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,100
Thee

941
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:45,900
Your sensory urges will ignite a fire in you that will burn throughout the long and sometimes difficult process of change.

942
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,200
Yes, friends, yes, that's exactly what we'll do to you.

943
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,060
That was and will be.

944
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:17,440
Actually, that was a song called Biting from Hernia Retraction Accordion, a band with.

945
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:26,980
Well, it's a tape of that band sent to us by one of the performers, Reverend Pete Petrisco, Jr. in Phoenix, Arizona.

946
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,180
In fact, you could probably get that record by writing for Infrared.

947
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:38,100
We'll get a confirmation from him at Box 56942, Phoenix, Arizona, 85079.

948
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,300
From their album Choking on the Fumes.

949
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,020
Pleasant, pleasant show tonight, ain't it?

950
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:54,140
If you want more pleasantries, you can write to the Church of the Subgenius,

951
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:01,440
who has produced this show in collaboration with KNON.

952
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:08,220
Write us, dear friends, at the following post office box number for free information.

953
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,460
That's, well, just write to Bob.

954
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,620
Just write Bob.

955
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:20,840
He'll get it at Post Office Box 140306.

956
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,520
Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

957
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,260
7521.

958
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,060
214.

959
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,780
Ah, yes.

960
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,920
What you've also been hearing a lot of tonight was puzzling evidence.

961
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:51,260
Dr. Howell and Gary Gebrog-Fran on the Less Than an Hour, More Than an Hour, Less Than a Show show.

962
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,480
The show.

963
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,520
I mean, that's all it is.

964
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,220
It's the show from KPFA in Berkeley.

965
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,280
Frightening sort of show.

966
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:00,720
But.

967
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,480
It's funny, though.

968
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,100
There's yet more to come.

969
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:10,440
It's funny, some of our listeners don't like the show, and yet others want to hear nothing but show.

970
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,580
Want some more show?

971
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:23,020
Stay tuned for Kathy's potluck with a great variety of music.

972
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:29,000
And gobs only knows what else besides music.

973
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,240
What else besides music?

974
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:38,120
Oh, let's see. Essays, poetry, comedy, live bodies if they want to come by.

975
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,200
Oh, you're a brave one, aren't you?

976
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,700
We would never reveal the whereabouts of the station while we're on there.

977
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,380
We're just scared of those bad, crazy people.

978
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,760
They're crazy, not like us.

979
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,940
No. Well...

980
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,500
Well, that's it.

981
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,380
We'll be right back.

982
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,100
Hello, you're on the air.

983
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:42,960
Evening, boys.

984
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,560
Where can I pick up the book?

985
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,880
The good book, the new book.

986
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,680
You mean High I-D-S-E by, no, I mean, uh...

987
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,920
Yeah, he means Three Fisted Tales of Bob.

988
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,360
Three Fisted Tales of Bob.

989
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,280
High Fisted It Is By The Bob.

990
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,880
One guy wrote, do you believe one guy wrote that whole book?

991
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,640
That's not true.

992
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:54,740
That's not true.

993
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


994
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


995
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


996
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


997
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,540
I will believe it. I'll believe anything.

998
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,780
One person wrote the whole thing, no?

999
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,060
Simon and Schuster asked for it in the...

1000
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,080
That's two guys right there.

1001
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,060
Just a bunch of jackbooted nannies,

1002
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,520
teetotaling, three breadsticks and a smirk.

1003
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,620
Hell no, it's about hard-drinking,

1004
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,820
two-fisted, loving subgeniuses

1005
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,180
brawling, fighting, womanizing,

1006
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,500
blazing a trail of destiny

1007
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,100
across this great land of ours

1008
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,540
from the seed of shining...

1009
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,220
Here is a bulletin.

1010
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,160
Oh, here is a bulletin.

1011
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:20,980
Here is a bulletin.

1012
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,580
Here is a bulletin, Al.

1013
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,420
This just came in.

1014
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,900
Stand by, please.

1015
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,360
Stand by, please.

1016
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,820
In Dallas, Texas.

1017
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,720
It appears as though something has happened

1018
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,220
in the motorcade route.

1019
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,340
Hey, wait a minute.

1020
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:32,720
What happened?

1021
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,440
The collar went away.

1022
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,240
Oh, what happened?

1023
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,020
One, two...

1024
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,720
Whee!

1025
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,820
Gosh, this is an exciting TV program.

1026
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,760
Hey, you know what we're missing out on?

1027
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,440
It's your Manchester TV's on Channel 36.

1028
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:45,640
I know, and last week,

1029
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,460
Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein was on,

1030
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,440
and we missed it to do their stupid show.

1031
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,980
Well, no, that's the state of the government in Washington,

1032
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,440
rather.

1033
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,060
Well, uh, the secret government.

1034
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,580
It's what we call the shadow team.

1035
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,520
And now, here's little Yagrunda Squimby Jr.

1036
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,380
Give me that old-time genius.

1037
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,760
Give me that old-time genius.

1038
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,480
And I'm tired of that thing all the time.

1039
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:08,960
Yeah.

1040
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,800
You know, uh, the...

1041
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,940
It's the future.

1042
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,280
And, uh, let me see on, uh, Channel 77,

1043
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,560

1044

Simon, Theodore, Alvin, and the Chipettes

1045
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,400
in the chipettes inadvertently

1046
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,140
become involved in an international

1047
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,160
heroin laundering operation.

1048
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,720
77 minutes.

1049
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,060
I don't think I get that channel, though.

1050
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,520
Yeah, you do. Look, there it is.

1051
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,280
Oh, gosh.

1052
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,300
You know, their voices have certainly mellowed

1053
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,660
since they started doing those irritating chipmunk songs

1054
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,780
so many years ago.

1055
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,480
With Dave Saville, who died,

1056
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,840
and his name was actually Ross Bagdasarian.

1057
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,800
Hey, look, a cowboy rap movie.

1058

Raps on the Range, 1956,

1059

starring Gene Autry and Ralph Fielding Snell.

1060
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,780
Charles Bomer,

1061
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,840
he has lived life to the fullest

1062
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,880
until he meets Francis the Talking Mule

1063
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,840
at a nudist camp

1064
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,340
where Jason's reign of terror continues

1065
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,160
as a new masked killer brutally slays

1066
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,200
a group of unsuspecting co-buckers.

1067
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,180
91 minutes.

1068
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,680
Stars George Taylor, Rock Hudson.

1069
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,140
Oscar-winning performance of Ralph Fielding Snell.

1070
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,760
Well, would you like to dance with us?

1071
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,660
Hi, good morning, how are you?

1072
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,440
Uh, we're not too good, really.

1073
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:22,880
How are you?

1074
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,380
Well, we're doing the best we can.

1075
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,760
Well, it is late.

1076
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,240
So let's let you be.

1077
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,100
It is late.

1078
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,700
I was wondering if you might have the program guide

1079
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,500
for this dead thing that's gonna happen.

1080
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,080
The dead thing?

1081
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:32,460
Dead thing?

1082
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,700
Grateful dead thing.

1083
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,700
Children should play the dead thing.

1084
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,680
Oh, the Grateful Dead thing.

1085
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,840
We thought you were talking about the 50s monster movie.

1086
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:38,660
Here comes a bulletin on that.

1087
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,560
More details?

1088
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,820
Oh, here's more details.

1089
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,120
More details, more bulletins.

1090
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,680
Same old President Dead, okay.

1091
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,000
You gotta make that bulletin louder, they can't hear it.

1092
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,220
Yeah, the President's Quails initiation song.

1093
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,780
Yeah, I think that was the one.

1094
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,660
It's a beautiful song.

1095
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,620
So you don't have to sit through this whole thing, do you?

1096
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,180
No, no, no.

1097
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,260
We're actually at home.

1098
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,540
We're standing up right now.

1099
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,480
We're running in place.

1100
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:56,800
Good.

1101
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,940
This is just a tape playing.

1102
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,780
There's nobody down here.

1103
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,740
The multi-indexed memory bank duplicates those.

1104
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,920
Some officials prefer to say mimic the...

1105
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,860
Would you like to dance with us?

1106
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,420
Well, is it necessary?

1107
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,000
No, you don't have to.

1108
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,920
You're leading again.

1109
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:10,660
Good, good.

1110
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,300
Oh, yeah.

1111
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,280
He's out there right now.

1112
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,020
Oh, yeah.

1113
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,620
Oh, yeah.

1114
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:15,800
Oh, yeah.

1115
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,580
Oh, yeah.

1116
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:18,420
Oh, yeah.

1117
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:18,460
Oh, yeah.

1118
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:18,460


1119
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:18,480
Oh, yeah.

1120
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:18,540


1121
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:18,540


1122
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:18,700


1123
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:18,960


1124
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:18,960


1125
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:18,980


1126
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,920
Oh, yeah.

1127
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,440
Oh, yeah.

1128
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,200
Oh, yeah.

1129
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:26,420
Oh, yeah.

1130
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:26,420


1131
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:26,420


1132
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:26,420


1133
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:26,420


1134
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,200
I always ask that of all my prey.

1135
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,880
I just like the sound of it.
