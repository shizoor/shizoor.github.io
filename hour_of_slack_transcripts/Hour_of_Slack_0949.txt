Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to
Is specially designed only to be played on radio station
And only in the city of
So I'm packing and re-running
Friends, this Hour of Slack number 949
Is really number 744 from the year 2000
Just after Triple X Day
And you know friends, it's as true now as it was then
Amen
Everybody be seated please
Thank you very much
The sermon today
Is the meek shall inherit nothing
Amen
Some take the Bible for what it's worth
When they see it
Says that the meek shall inherit the earth
Well I heard that some sheik
Has bought New Jersey last week
And you suckers ain't getting nothing
Is Harry Rama really wrong
When you wander around
With a napkin on
With a bell on a stick
And your hair is all gone
The geek shall inherit nothing
So you say your life's a bum deal
And you're up against the wall
Well you ain't really got
No deal at all
Cause what they do
In Washington
They just take care of
Number one
And number one
And you
You ain't even number two
You ain't even number two
You ain't even number two
Well those Jesus freaks
Well they friendly but
The shit they believe
Has got their minds all shut up
And they don't even care
If the church take a cut
Ain't it bleak when you got so much nothing
So what do you do
Eat that pork
Eat that ham
Laugh till you choke on Billy Graham
Moses, Aaron, and Abraham
They're all a waste of time
Let's take a look at the Bible
And it's your ass that's on the line
Do what you wanna, do what you will
Just don't mess up your neighbor's thrill
When you pay the bill, kindly leave a little tip
And help the next poor sucker on his one-way trip
Some take the Bible, some take the Bible
Some take the Bible
The Persuasion's doing Zappa, friends.
Yes, that amazing thing is The Persuasion's doing Zappa
from their album of all Zappa songs.
Friends.
Frankly, a capella.
But yes, it's true.
We survived, friends.
We survived another end of the world drill.
Triple X Day.
We didn't get off in spaceships,
but we did get screwed, friends.
And Bob, well, old Bobby, he came.
Bob and Connie showed up at the last minute
to climax our orgy.
Vintage was a glorious X Day drill, my friends.
A suitably slack-filled,
a beginning of the real countdown,
the real new millennium,
which we commemorate with this first
all-digitally mixed hour of slack.
The first hour of slack on CD.
Although some parts of the X Day celebrations
were recorded only on cheap, hissy audio tape,
there's so many great moments, friends,
like Sympathy for the Devil,
played by Bliss America
in front of a giant bob painted by Jesus.
From now on, every subgenius band
is gonna have to do Sympathy for the Devil
in front of a giant bob.
Friends, the conspiracy is still with us,
but at least we're getting rid of the hiss.
No more hissy-fisted nimbobs.
Henceforth, friends, it's a pissy-whooped Connie Law,
because it was a Connie-type X Day.
The Connieites ruled this festival,
and that's why, for once, it was more sex than violence.
But we did have violence, friends.
Don't worry.
It wasn't just sex, boys,
but mostly, mostly it was slack.
We broke the tolerance barrier, friends,
and wait till you hear the rants and banter
from the bands and ranters of the triple X Day baby.
We all know it was everybody!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!

Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!




Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Friends, are we controlled by secret forces?
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?
Do people think you're strange?
Do you?
Then you may be on the right track.
Give me slack, or give me food, or kill me!
Give me food, or kill me!
Steep right up, step right up!
Come on!
Come all!
Come on, one another!
Great big gloss!
Welcome to the subgenius festival of freaks!
The triple X Day, triple Xtravaganza that saves your soul for a mere $30 or triple your
god damned money back!
It serves up tenderloin of pink and a series of savage gestures, and a crazy show of the



















for charm's sake. It puts loud
plaid pants on the devil. It soothes your
soul, felches your holes, and takes you on a grand
tour of the grassy knoll. Step right up.
See common decency
skewered on the pitchfork of special privilege.
Hear music that'd scare the living
fuck out of the local Amish if they got close enough
to hear it.
See the asses that launched a thousand wet
dreams. Hear ye, hear ye.
Buy stank's chest
hairs for a dollar a pluck.
Sample as a result of screams. Use them as a
rhythm bed for the music
competition. We'll hold the next year's two-malt
if the saucers don't come again this year.
Step right up.
When thin 30 does it. Join the
jubilant jamboree that makes that juvenile
jackanapes Jim Jones jerkwad jackoff
look like the jar of jizz it was. Praise
Bob.
Kick it, lick it, suck it,
whack it, dress it up in cutesy little pants
and make it do the pee-pee dance. Bring on them
saucers. I'm paid up. I want to get laid up.
I stayed up all night at Subgenius Bootcamp.
Huh? Who needs sleep?
Drinking that suspicious coffee that ate through
the friggin' spoon just so I could be here
tonight to tell you that it is a sin not to dump
your soul in your wallet and hand the whole fucking mess
over to Bob.
Because it's the best deal you'll get outside
a three-day blowjob from Hypatia League
as the fun just keeps on coming and so will
you. Praise Bob.
Take a deep cleansing breath
and release.
Yeah.
See, that's it. All I had to do was speak in tongues.
Robert Tilton style. I used Robert Tilton's magic
words.
Chag Chag Mabah
Deba Soya.
And Triple X Day
ceremonies begin. Praise Bob.
Care. Praise Bob.
No, it is the biggest, the biggest crowd to show
up at the opening ceremonies.
And I'll get it over with as quick as I can.
But, praise Bob.
Y'all made it to Triple X Day.
You made it. You actually, if you're any,
most everybody I talk to, the devil was trying to stop them.
The cops were trying to stop them.
The weather was trying to stop them.
Their cars were trying to stop them.
You were telling them to stop me.
Their own intelligence, their brain, rational thoughts
said, don't do it, man.
But they did not let, you did not let your brain stop them.

They did not let your brain stop you.
And that is what slack is all about.
Don't ever let your brain stop you.
The thing I think about showing up, we just sort of appeared here,
and we sort of wanted here.
It's like migration, every kind of thing.
Yes, it's migration.
Every year, certain, a certain species migrates to its place.
It's mating grounds, friends.
There are many animals that can hardly, they don't even want to get laid unless they're at their mating grounds.





What, what, what, what?

Oh, well, you go sniffing around, you just find out.
I know what you just want to, you're, no, you're, you, you younger males will have your time at the top of the heap.
But first you must defeat the old, many silverbacks who are in line ahead of you.
Including a doctor like you.
And he's really, really good.
He's really ugly.
So, um, anyway, friends, this is truly, I mean, well, I mean, the, the,
Truly.
We will admit that there have been some disappointments here at this very place.
No.
On a yearly basis.
This would be the third year in a row if we're not lucky.
But, friends, we're going to get lucky.
We will get off, and if we won't get off, at least we'll get screwed.
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.
God has been misquoted all this time.
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet.
Jehovah is an alien.
Jehovah is an alien.
I just love you more than the terror of the dark.
To get technical, of course.
Doctrinally, it does not say in the book of the subgenius that the exodus will rupture.
The subgenius is on July 5th at 7 o'clock a.m. year 2000.
No.
It does, however, say that in the year 2000 the exodus will leave.
Which we interpret, of course, to be the rupture, the foretold rupture of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Now, uh, now, when the, and we presume that when the exodus leave, they'll have the courtesy to take us with them.
If they think we're worthy.
If they think that tape is worth flipping.
For the tape of your life, my friends, your life is like a cassette tape.
An audio, not a CD, an audio cassette tape.
It's got a couple of sides to it.
You better hope that first side's interesting enough to Bob Dobbs that he's reminded to flip it.
If he don't like what you do with that tape, he ain't going to, he might just decide to record over it with something better, friends.
Friends, this has been a wonderful show.

This has been a wonderful X Day for me because I have had slack.
We've learned a lot over the last few X Days.
We used to run around trying to make sure we put on a good show and prove to the aliens that we had slack.
Well, friends, slack ain't like that.
Slack is just, you know, why should we worry about anything?
Because we can let the aliens do it.
That's the, now, many subgeniuses sit around and think, oh, who am I, I'm making my list.
I'm making my list of all the hated pinks in my life that I'm going to kill.
Friends, you don't have to spend, that's kind of anti-slack.
All you have to do on X Day is think about who not to have killed.
That's, it's like you get to decide who gets on Noah's Ark.
So try to think about the, you know, think the nice thoughts.
Think about, you don't want to end up ruptured onto the escape vessels.
And be halfway to Planet X when suddenly you go, oh my God, I forgot my poor old sweet mother and father back there on Earth.
Oh Lord, I should have stopped the aliens from turning, from killing them.
And at least gotten them a good place in the concentration camps or something.
When was the last time you thought about your family and buying them, saving their asses whether they want to be saved or not?
Friends, we're just like the Mormons.
You can buy your ancestors their way out of hell.
Yes, friends.
All we have to do is say who not to kill.
Because as J.R. Bob Dobbs, here's a new Bob quote for you, friends.
The latest memo from J.R. Bob Dobbs was this.
Quote, about the same, quote unquote, isn't the same as, quote, the same, unquote, unquote, J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Friends!
This is the last year that there's going to be a church of the subgenius.
Because the Earth ain't going to need one after that.
We're going to be gone, baby, gone.
And this has been a great last year for this old church.
And it is the last year, but it's been a great one.
Why, we got new publishers for our out of print books.
iUniverse.com will be publishing High Weirdness by Mail and Three Fisted Tales by our friends.
We've been doing deep Bibles and saving souls all over this.
Be 90 Glow.
Dallas, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Tampa, Cleveland, Seattle, Lemuria, Columbus, Mars, friends.
And we've been building our own ships, too.
Did you know that we just opened the first subgenius office building in Dallas, Texas?
We built our own ship.
We opened a branch office in Cleveland, Ohio.
We built our own ship, friends.
We got back on live radio.
Our Slack is still on 17 College Station, friends.
And Time Magazine voted Bob Dobbs the fraud of the century.
We've done the rehearsals, friends.
We've done our homework.
We've sacrificed the virgins.
We're onboard the ships.
We've got our lighters right up against the fuse, friends.
And we are ready.
Earth first, and then we'll destroy all the other planets.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Earth.
Because I must get off.
Oh, yes.
Yes, yes.
Yes, friends.
Friends, my name is St. Byron Werner.
I've been a subgenius, a proud subgenius, for 20 years.
This is the first time I've gotten up to rant.
Probably the last time I'll rant.
I'm taking my time getting into this church.
I'm taking it nice and slow because...
I tell you, there are times...
I know it sounds crazy, but I don't really trust Bob.
And I'm here to tell you that I have severe doubts about the sacrament of slack.
Slack itself?
I'm here to talk against slack and in favor of stress.
I know.
You all work your long jobs.
You go on home.
First thing, you hit that refrigerator for that beer.
And you roll up a nice frog stick.
Helps you hold on.
Helps you feel, dare I say it, normal.
But anyway, I think this is wrong.
I think there's nothing like a good head of steam, of hate, of stress,
to sharpen your view about what the fuck is wrong and what you ought to do about it.
Now, Solver Dolly, when he would write,
he'd put on a pair of shiny little black patent leather shoes,
little fetishistic shoes for him.
But he bought them a couple sizes too small.
So they'd squeeze his feet.
So he would sharpen his brain and he could...
You know, when you're stressful, you know who your enemies are.
You know what's wrong.
And eventually, you know what you gotta do about it.
And I think coming home after that horrible, kiss-ass job
that you gotta do to be able to keep your house
or buy more frop or whatever you gotta do,
I think you're dissipating your energy.
You're dissipating your holy hate, your sacred sarcasm
that's gotta be chilled.
You gotta stop these people.
Come on!
Beer is false slack.
Beer could be false slack.
I do love beer. Look at this shade. This is beer, baby.
But I'm thinking, you know, we can't just think about it.
We can't just think about ourselves first.
We can't say, oh, I feel stressed.
I don't wanna fight the conspiracy today.
I gotta slack off.
And you've got that beer and you feel more like,
hey, live and let live, you know?
Fuck that! Live and let live!
My God!
You gotta hold on to that hate!
Stay tense! Drink too much coffee!
Stop having sex! Get married! Stop having sex!
Seems to go hand in hand, but keep yourself sharp.
Focus yourself into a time and heart lens
that you can just beat that hate out and blast them
peakies walking across the street.
It's your job.
Do it anonymously or just be out there being the weirdest fucking subgenius you can.
Get in their face.
Just give it to them.
Then after you've done something, then you get your slack.
But you're not doing nothing!
Get out there!
And the next time somebody says, oh, have a nice day, sir.
Did he help with those bags out to the car?
How you doing today?
You can look at them and say,
Bring on the conspiracy,
because I know my forehead can stop that tank!
I'm a man of honor!
I'm a man of honor!
Okay, St. Andrew, are you ready to give us your in?
You folks are so freaking kind.
I look out into this vast, enormous, we've never really played a place this big before
and never have seen so many people in one place.
And you don't know how grateful we are that some of you are still breathing
and that others of you have not started the transmorphal shift yet.
Especially Dr. Lagoum, who right around this time of night begins, you know, the,
well, we don't want to get into the,
the lower chakra begins to start.
It begins to expand and you all begin to decrease right along with it.
So don't start hoping them yet, doc.
There's lots of time, isn't there?
Time's been suspended!
I'm a man of honor!
I'm a man of honor!

Thank you.
But with just a few short, quick lines,
we have the symbol of the new Bob order.
The symbol that we will rally against
to destroy the very conspiracy.
It makes me believe that the new order is soon coming.
That the...
The black copters and the black Humvees
will roll down the streets
and then we will know when to run and hide
or when to run and shoot.
But friends,
we know something a little bit different.
The new world order has already taken place.
The conspiracy's boot is invisible,
but it is on your back,
pushing you down.
Friends, there's only one way to beat the conspiracy,
and that is not to take them over,
but to become them.
Yes, friends, we'll become the new conspiracy.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Under the symbol of Bob.
And then they will do what we say,
when we say, and how we say.
Yes, the great race of the subgenius
will take back the motherland.
Friends, America has been destroyed.
It has been destroyed by them.
It was once a proud country.
It was once a proud country
that was rallied under wonderful things like growing hemp.
Yeah!
And it's been destroyed by them.
Yes, we will see the freedom of expression.
Liberty!
Liberty!
Does anyone even know what that means anymore?
Well, friends, no.
It's been all reduced to a beer commercial
and a cigarette ad.
Well, friends, soon this will be the only ad they will see.
Praise Jesus!
Hold up! Hold up!
I've got to get a TV antenna light.
Stop it now!
Ha, ha, ha!
Friends, yes, we will unite
in order to bring down the conspiracy.
Friends, Bob is dead.
Long live Bob.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Yeah!
And now, sales pitch.
Yeah!
Yeah!

N Stadium is prime.

Thank you very much.
Alright, thanks.
Well, bosses, have a good evening.
Have a cute evening.

Get used to a good evening.

Friends, brothers and sisters, I'm here to tell you about one of the greatest...
Perhaps the greatest Frenatic of all time
His name, my friends, is Jack T. Chick
Now I know what you're thinking
You're thinking, oh well Jack T. Chick
We're not interested in him, he's some sort of Christian
We don't need some sort of fundamentalist Christian
Well friends, blasphemy!
Do we care whether or not he worships
Oh Jehovah 1, Jehovah 2, space aliens, or Jesus fucking Christ?
Hell no!
What we care about is he's a true believer!
That's right!
And that my friends is what we need in this here church
True believers! Woo!
And that my friends are willing to die for the cause!
Praise God!
Now friends, I am holding in my formerly, oh, sinful hands
A very copy of a Jack T. Chick track called Love the Jewish People
Now what is so unusual about this track
Love the Jewish People?
Is that it's in Hebrew!
Hebrew!
Now, excuse me, but if you're Jewish don't you already love the Jewish people?
I mean what kind of fanatic needs to know that?
He needs to write Love the Jewish People in Jewish that no one else can read!
This my friends is a true believer!
Someone who even wants to convert Jews to Judaism!
Jack T. Chick is a God amongst gods!
He may be misguided, but he has the fever my friends!
The fever of love of what he believes in!
And that's what we need in!
We need fanatics that are willing to die for Bob!
Fanatics that are willing to spend 40 of their years
Cranking out these pathetic,
little cartoon tracks!
You know how much they sell for?
13 cents!
He's the greatest underground artist of all time!
Is it because his art is great?
No my friends!
It's because his art is cheap!
13 cents!
450 million of these things have circled the planet!
You can just look at the back of the internet
and even has a picture of a globe being surrounded by Jack T. Chicks!
That's exactly what's happening!
Why we sit here and lollygag
and say, oh we'd like to be an artist
for something like Marvel!
Or maybe DC!
Or maybe have some great movie done about it!
He's sitting there doing little Xerox comics!
And converting the millions of people!
Over 90 languages!
Including Hebrew!
My friends! Hebrew love the Jewish people!
I mean that just says it all!
Doesn't it my friends?
Now folks, some of y'all probably think
You know, you gotta have the style!
We wanna be superstars!
A lot of you think perhaps
the greatest subgeniuses are the famous ones!
Well friends,
I think the ones that are gonna be first
on the saucers are the ones who have the greatest beliefs!
And that includes some of the greatest outcasts!
The ones you won't even recognize!
I'm talking about Shock Treatment!
Why Shock Treatment?
Is he some famous subgenius?
He just gave me cocoa!
He did one thing that no other subgenius did my friends!
He gave me cocoa!
He quit his job on X-Day!
He sold all his goods!
He re-sold all his goods!
I really didn't think there was gonna be anything after X-Day!
Now again,
some of you may think this is kinda stupid!
Hey, it's just a big joke!
Ha ha ha!
But what if you were wrong my friends?
What if you were wrong?
Then, Shock Treatment would be the only one on them saucers!
And that is the blind faith
that Jack T. Chick
presents in his tracks!
That is the blind faith
that we need for Bob!
And come on this X-Day
I'm talking about not July 6th!
On Sunday!
What kind of church in the subgenius sits here
and moves the day of rapture around
so that it's convenient
for the business community?
I'm talking about July 5th!
God damn it!
1998!
I don't want to hear any of this
well that's already come and gone.
No! If it ain't happened yet,
it means 1998 ain't happened yet!
Because Bob said it and I believe it
and that settles it Bob!
Damn it!
So I'm going to see you guys on July 5th, 1998
at 7am with your Chick tracks
Shock Treatment
and we're going to praise Bob!
Amen!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Thank you all!
The masses are thrilled!
Friends!
Because we are fanatics
and I don't mean
I mean us!
Look!
We are fanatics!
We are the only true believers!
Like you said,
preach ain't nobody there!
Well I'm going to tell you,
the only one who preaches to a crowd
are Bobbies!
The only true, strong, hardcore preachers
preach to no one!
They preach in their closets
and they preach in their rooms!
His eyes watch the man behind you!
So friends, us,
we are the proud
and the few, the ranters!
We are the proud!
The blackness
comes far
and stares
straight into my face!
straight into my face!
straight into my face!
It smothers me
It smothers me
with ugliness!
It blinds
my hope!
My hope!

And then it goes away
And then it goes away
And it's just another day
And it's just another day
And I smile at everyone
But I don't care!
But I have little to say!

The blackness
The blackness
is powerful!
It cannot
be stopped
or slowed!

As the futility
becomes more and more
evident
My will
to resist
does erode!
As the futility becomes more and more evident
My will to resist does erode!
And no one seems to know
And no one seems to know

And I want to tell them all
And I want to tell them all
But I know I mustn't dare!
But I know I mustn't dare!
The blackness
The blackness
Is patient!
Is patient!
For now
It can be
My friend!
My friend!
It takes my
It takes my
Pristine illusions
Pristine illusions
Leave them tarnished
Stale!
And dull!
And dull!
And dull!

And mid-coffee break at ten
And the broncos
Fucked up again!
Elwes Gardell the magic's no more
And it's really
all such a bore!
All such a bore!
The blackness
The blackness
Is honest!
And it sure
Is a stare!
It takes my
It takes my
It takes my
It takes my
Pristine illusions
Pristine illusions
Leave them tarnished
Stale!
And dull!
I know the arguments are good in law
Showing how all that I do is wrong
Showing how all that I do is wrong
I want to strip them out of my mind
I want to strip them out of my mind
For I know what I will find
For I know what I will find
If Ibook me
Imma find
The blackness
The blackness
takes programs
The blackness
And embeds
And embeds itself deep
in my soul
There's nothing left for me to do Except acknowledge complete control
And the hospital bed is flat And I see the world from my back
And I smile and everyone can laugh And I finally can laugh
And I smile and everyone can laugh And I finally can laugh

And so we gather here late, the late hours of the night.
A late watch.
A vigil, shall we say, to bring in the new year.
The poor pinks thought that their little Y2K bug in their year 2000 would bring some kind of great change.
Well, sure, there were a few divorces, praise Bob.
But then, on the other hand, there was the hope.
The hope of a true new beginning, friends.
Where we can throw out all the old things.
The old rules.
Yes, we can get on board them.
Hey, talk about anarchy.
Wait until they see what a dose of patriopsychotic and narco-materialism at work can do
for a person given control over the powers of the gods and their own planet.
Ah, yes.
Sure, we grew up with the rules of their government.
The rules of their church.
The rules of their...
Polite society.
And the rules of their so-called coolness.
Well, friends, we now have the opportunity to create a whole new world.
A new type of government.
The kind of government Bob would provide.
And you know, you can be alone with Bob.
He ain't gonna tell you what to do.
And we can have a new church.
The kind of church Bob would have.
Where you can sleep in on Sunday.
Praise Bob.
And we'll have a new kind of shopping malls where stealing is legal.
And we'll have a new kind of coolness where the geeks decide who's cool.
And the normals are the ones who are put out on the ice floes and sent out into the woods to fend for themselves.
Praise Bob.
Or put in the nice evangelical love camps where they can be reeducated.
Ah, yes, yes, yes.
I feel like something good's gonna happen.
Might be tomorrow morning at 7 a.m.
Might be Wednesday morning at 7 a.m.
It might be!
It might come as a thief in the night!
So you better be ready.
You better have that membership card in your pocket.
And every second, even when you take a shower, if you're the kind of subgenius who takes showers.
And friends, when we took a D-Bible tour to Amsterdam, Holland.
And we learned a lot there.
We learned about, and we were reminded about the way this country used to be before they regulated every single thing you did.
Before they gave your dog a ticket for taking a shit on the sidewalk.
But one of the great things about our trip to Amsterdam is we met a great subgenius.
A Dutch subgenius by the name of Jeroen van Bram.
Jeroen van Bram, the Dutch subgenius.
He had been in a coma for two years when he was 18 years old.
So he had seen Bob during that time.
He already knew about Bob.
We didn't have to tell him.
And he lived on the street.
And basically was a bum.
Had a fair amount of slack.
But he had a great philosophy.
And a louder voice than me.
He was the loudest son of a bitch I ever met.
And Jeroen van Bram, as he walked down the streets of Holland.
Getting money for more froth from the tourists.
He yelled at us and he said,
You know my friend, while you're alive, you gotta shout and make a lot of noise.
Cause when you die, you shut up like hell.
Cause when you die, you shut up like hell, friends.
And so friends, that's why we are...
It's the old thing.
It's like, well so, the world might not...
You know what it doesn't say in that first pamphlet?
The very first top of the page.
It doesn't say the world ends July 5th, 1998, 99 or 2000.
It says the world ends tomorrow.
Tomorrow, my friends.
And you may die.
You will in fact die.
You can believe that prediction by J.R. Bob Dogg.
You will die.
And what you don't know is when.
It's not a matter of if.
If you've got your subgenius membership card in your pocket, then why.
If, hey man, if I don't live forever, I get my money back.
But, it could come at any time.
And a lot of what this show is about, is not about money.
It's about what your church is really all about.
It's what you're doing with your precious time.
What is slack, friends?
Is slack more toys?
Well, you know it's not that.
Is slack more money?
Well, it might be.
But what slack really is, is more time.
More time to do what the fuck you want.
And not to have to be doing what they want.
That's what this is about.
And we cannot tell you how to spend your time.
We can only tell you that you have to spend it wisely.
And for a subgenius, that's kind of a trick.
Now somewhere among our crowd here, I imagine there must be the cop or the detective or the agent, federal agent of some kind, who is assigned to study us and, you know, make sure they know what's going on with the church of the subgenius.
And friends, I want to speak to that poor detective, that poor federal agent tonight.
Because by now, he's got to be drunk as hell.
And bitter.
Bitter because he's saying to himself,
They're right!
My God, they're right!
The conspiracy assigned me to cover these subgeniuses.
And here I am agreeing with them.
There is a conspiracy and I'm part of it.
But I'm not.
I'm not.
But friends,
You know, and we, the great thing is we, Bob Dobbs and the church's subgenius, ain't gonna tell you what the best way is to fight the conspiracy.
We'll only tell you that you must do it!
We don't know who you are or what you're best at.
You have to decide that for yourself.
Unlike most of those other churches, we only have one rule.
And I think you know what that rule is, friends.
It is, fuck them!
If they can't take a joke!
That is all that matters in this church, my friends.
That is truly a livable philosophy.
I am the one!
I am the one!
I am the one!
I am the one!
Come on, you may die!
Come on, you may die!
Come on, you may die!
You may die!
Praise Bob!
You may die!
Praise Bob!
You may die!
Praise Bob!
You may die!
Praise Bob!
You may die!
You have to escape the other world, don't you?
Or will you live your own lives?
Praise Bob!
Yo! Yeah!
I know what time it is!
Yes, uh...
Credit's time, dear friends.
Well, I'll tell ya, editing my first hour of slack on my computer has been...
different.
And I'm sure I'll get smoother at it.
And we've just barely scratched the surface of the wonderful recordings from the XXX Day Festival
and CDs handed to me, such as this background music by MC Kev Rock.
And anyway, the last music, the big piece of music we've heard and been hearing throughout
is called Slogans Run by Saint N and Mini True of Pittsburgh.
Near the beginning, we heard a great rant by Hell Pope Huey and my opening ceremonies rants
and also some ranted by me with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
We heard the great Saint Byron Werner ranting on stress.
And we heard ESO, Einstein's Secret Orchestra, doing Father of Night.
Jesus Christ, the devil aqua, spoke on the new Bob Order icon.
We heard another big long song with the Terminator line.
And we heard the X-Day by Saint N.
And Papa Joe Mama ranting on Jack Trick, Chick, Chick's Dig Chick tracks.
Followed by The Blackness by Little Theodore.
And some of my very last ranting at 11.30 p.m. July 4th, 2000 on Or Kill Me Radio.
Praise Bob, Or Kill Me.
And now, friends.

And praise the...
I feel like sometimes I'm sharing...
I feel like I'm sharing the studio sometimes with Barry White.
That's Chaz.
Hey, baby, I'm right on the microphone.
Check this Barry voice out.
Donovan's out there.
I know you listen to him.
I'm sorry if I happen to use the tried and true tools of the preacher in my daily walk.
It is your tried and true tool.
You must...
You have to kind of pull the whole thing together.
It's a leathery old beat-up, flapping thing.
But the tongue of the preacher is his most important tool.
Or hers.
We wouldn't want to pull the hood back to see what you're making of it right now.
We don't make a big deal about making a pope out of a woman.
We don't either.
Or a woman pope-ess out of a man.
We'll go either way.
That's been done.
Baby, we're swingers.
Well, not everybody.
I mean, I...
But, you know...
Hell, anything goes.
As long as Bob don't mind.
As long as we hear Bob complain about your behavior, you're out of the church.
He cares not for your behavior.
Bob only cares about your 30 bucks and your slackulent behaviors.
And if you're willing to perform oral sex on any one of himself,
you know, the written or unwritten denigents that emanate from his first body,
he'll just let you do anything you want to as long as there is anything you do.
I mean...
In fact, Reverend Evangela won that very contest at Triplex.
See, but I don't know why you guys always make everything contest.
You know, I mean, Christianity is...
Oh, just for fun.
Bad enough, you know.
Yeah, because it's too sloppy.
It gives it a sense of meaning where there is none.
A drama.
That's all people want out of life.
See, you can preach now.
Here comes some preacher music now.
I want you to put your hand on the radio, sister.
Okay.
Lean on in.
I want you to take the tenderest, sweetest part of your body
and put it closest to the vibrating part of the radio membrane.
And if your body's feeling bad
And it's the only one you have
You wanna take the wind away
Go on walking in the rain
Watch the flowers go to bed
Ask the man inside your mind
You'll never have to leave
All you gotta do believe
Praise Bob!
You can't, you can't find relief, my friend.
You can find real satisfaction.
And I don't mean just your money back on the day you die, friend.
You can get it all.
Everything you can have.
That cake and eat it too.
Go on.
Take it all away.
Some have alluded to some form of mana.
Some mystical pie in the sky.
I say revolution is the only way out of this mess.
God will not come to our aid.
He assists no one.
He cares not for you.
Get yourselves together.
Everlasting sweet desire.
It no matter what the doctor says.
It no matter what the doctor says.
He will not leave me still.
I'll wait.
Immortality for two.
Miracles they come for you.
God loves you but Bob wants you.
I hear the sea does.
Then the dumpster behind you.

Behind the lock there.
They must have found something they really like.
I can hear the screeching going louder.
I can hear the squawking.
What's that?
It sounds like a siren in the distance.
I hope they don't find it there.
If they find it here, they're not really going to find it.
Anyway.
Faith and hope and charity.
Simple relativity.
He can make you understand.
All you gotta do is take his hand.
Remember what someone says.
Ask him inside ahead.
Finger drifts and hold him tight.
So inviting.
Welcome inside.
We've been waiting for you.
Bye.
Oh, then Connie, welcome you into their home, dear friend.
Yes, room to play for everyone.
There's so many things to do.
There's one here, one there.
Here's this way, the new way to enjoy.
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Yeah.
Oh, I want to grab you real tight.
And pull.
Oh, you like what I do, do you?
Don't do that.
Don't tell me that.
You like what I do, do you?
I know you do.
No.
He's going to punish you.
God hates folks who are fat.
God hates folks who are small.
God hates.
God hates.
God hates.
Where's God's way?
Oh, where's God's way?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?

Hoping that some of you out there will actually reach through the membrane into this, other
things, and establish yourself with me.
First take the vinegar.
That's right.
Plain white vinegar will do.
Then take the baking soda.
The small wine.
That's right.
We'll go to the little bottle right here.
Now, take the little bottle right here.
Put a membrane, much like the membrane we discussed, between the vinegar and the baking soda.
Now take the bottle and crack firmly on the cranium three times like so.
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Well, I can't feel my legs.
Wait, my legs gone. I can't feel my legs.
Well, we gotta get out of here.
There's always tomorrow.
Somos en Chiapas por el mil y es de la mes.
Y mañana nos vamos a acompañar por las montañas.
I ain't gonna go home.
I'm gonna sit here.
I'm gonna sit in there and dub them X-Day recording sofas from the D.A. to the CD.
For hours and hours.
So I can put them hours of slack together in them CDs.
Well, I'm just gonna put those photons between me and the next erection.
I'm gonna go down to the nuclear accelerator and see if I can snort up a few atomic particles.
I think I might join ya.
I guess we ain't going to sleep.
Then.
No, no.
We're not going to be getting much sleep, are we?
Keep snorting those till next week.
Subatomic.
Stay awake.
Bring in the money.
Cast out the conspiracy.
Pretend the rainbow has an end
And you'll be there, my friend, someday
There's always tomorrow
For dreams to come true
Tomorrow is not far away
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh







Oh


Oh
