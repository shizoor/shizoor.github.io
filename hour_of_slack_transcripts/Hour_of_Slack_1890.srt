1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
It's time for Bob. Say Bob, why the big smile this afternoon? What's so special

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:16,120
about today? Well there's nothing special. The Self Genius Power of Slack. Now we're rolling Bob.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:27,260
Oh yes dear friends, this is your prayer partner Reverend Ivan Stang. Okay I'm recording this on

4
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:35,340
July 4th. Tomorrow is X-Day. If you don't hear from me after this that means I was ruptured up

5
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,680
onto the escape vessels of the sex goddesses on July 5th and I will have better things to do

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:52,920
than the hour of slack. If so, so long and thanks for all the fish. Meanwhile I have a lot to do in

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,240
preparation so here are the outtakes for today.

8
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,800
From last week's show. From PR News in Washington I'm in need of extra attention

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,020
after a brief illness and I'm so broad that I need to be braced. Joe Georgfine explains.

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,740
He says 45 babies. He says 25 babies. He says 15 of the babies came with the babies and will stay

11
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:26,980
with the babies until PR News. 19.7 percent and 49 percent or 13.7 percent or at least 100

12
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:34,340
55 percent. All right. 5.6 million point nine percent. All right but at least 21 percent. At

13
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:44,540
least 143 million point five percent. But PR News officials are watching it closely. The Dow was

14
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:51,440
1337. Credit monitoring company Equiftec jumped after disclosure of PR News Washington.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:16,660
I'm going to have to go and do my stretches now with some monster movie on the TV and I'll probably

16
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:27,160
run sort of pseudo run run in place on a wee foot board that that is very sensitive to your

17
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,780
your body movements on it through your feet. And so I may run be running all over Woohoo Island

18
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:41,180
while listening to rock music and and doing spaz dancing for my other exercise. I have to do this

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,180
every day for the rest of my life if I want to do anything for the rest of my life. Thank y'all.

20
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,300
The evil that has fallen upon us is much more ancient and pitch black.

21
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,720
It has several characteristics that are important to know. This is a cult of death. It lives and

22
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,240
feeds on the evil of the dead. It is a cult of death. It is a cult of death. It is a cult of

23
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:44,900
death. It is a cult of death. It is a cult of the most terrible death agonies. When people were

24
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:54,700
killed slowly, torturers were enjoying themselves in front of other people. That's what the priests

25
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,320
of this cult do.

26
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:11,600
This cult came out of the ancient swampy forest, which practiced the cult of severe torment of victims and cannibalism.

27
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:26,660
This cult is poisonous. It's invisible. At the level of very visible vapors, it creeps into the souls of people.

28
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,860
This cult is poisonous even people are turned into beyond sewer sayings. It kinda makes the actual

29
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,320
beings turned into mere 分 ACTUAL culminusռ provide isn't really het именно

30
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,320


31
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,920
This kind of Ram-shar like parts of the horse seem very different but still.

32
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,960
Just one 곡 shows this cruelty.

33
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:42,960


34
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,860
A characteristic feature of the cult is that it does not care whose suffering it enjoys.

35
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,100
It rejoices in its own deaths too, no less than others.

36
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,220
Hence, the absolutely cannibalistic attitude, capacity and strength of this cult is extremely

37
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,220


38
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,020
towards its own soldiers.

39
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,540
Well, that was Onan Counterbite and some Russian.

40
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:24,720
That is, Onan made that on his phone, I think.

41
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:35,780
And, well, this is the first time I've sat down at Tarzan's radio station in at least a month.

42
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,840
In fact, I had to pull the dust cover off of all this stuff.

43
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,340
It's set up in my living room on a fairly small table, actually.

44
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,860
It doesn't take up much room anymore.

45
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,100
And, but it's...

46
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
This is a dry land.

47
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,640
This is a dry, dry land.

48
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,740
The Subgenius Foundation is located in Glen Rose, Texas, in north-central Texas,

49
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,080
about an hour southwest of Fort Worth.

50
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,560
It's, it is very rural.

51
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,600
It's, the Metroplex has not enveloped it yet.

52
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,500
And it's farmland, and it hasn't rained in many,

53
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,120
many weeks.

54
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,100
And there's no promise of it.

55
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:36,040
And we're having such a dreadful heat wave that's so unusual for June that I went out

56
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,920
and bought, I did end times preparations that I probably should have done long before.

57
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,380
The list came from when we went through the freeze here.

58
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,660
And the whole Texas power grid came down.

59
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,660
And I made a list of stuff that I should have.

60
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,660
And then I didn't...

61
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,640
I didn't do anything about it.

62
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,760
And then, because I'm a subgenius, but then I did something about it because we were,

63
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,680
it looked like we were going to have another freeze.

64
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,320
I got a generator and some portable heaters.

65
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:17,700
Now I have, I've added a portable air conditioner because we have a 93-year-old in hospice in

66
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,800
the big downstairs bedroom with caregivers coming and going.

67
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,820
So...

68
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,040
This is a weird kind of cult headquarters.

69
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,360
It's part hospital, part workshop, part house, part barnyard.

70
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,140
Very much a barnyard.

71
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,820
The livestock are all domesticated pet type animals, but they're huge.

72
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,340
They always have to make an effort to stay that a living thing.

73
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,500
I use dogs and whether it's twelve and twenty하죠 they'll be described as here for that,

74
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,500


75
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,500


76
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,640
If you were to catch a dog or a wolf, it would leave that into theirечd,

77
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,600
which would be essential for the recovery of the animal.

78
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,180
One day they've caught a incorporates, and there was a bear know shirbet dog.

79
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,220
You could see that the cat near my ass.

80
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,160
One of our dogs, about nine or nine here.

81
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
I don't know how this dog is.

82
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
dreams are only in your head.

83
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,360


84
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,160
I said, hold it, Doc, a World War pie's still in my brain.

85
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,080
He said, nurse, get your pie, the boy's insane.

86
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,760
I grabbed my arm, I said ouch,

87
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,000
and landed on the psychiatric couch.

88
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,580
He said, tell me about it.

89
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,400
I said, I'll tell you about it.

90
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,080
Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast.

91
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,100
It was all over by a quarter past.

92
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,940
I was down in the sewer with some little lover

93
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,080
when I peeked out from a manhole cover

94
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,200
wondering who turned the lights on us.

95
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,020
Well, I got up and I walked around,

96
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,320
up and down the lonesome town.

97
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,740
I stood wondering which way to go,

98
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,840
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter

99
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,580
and walked on down the road.

100
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,700
It was a normal day.

101
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,960
.

102
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:36,960


103
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,160
Well, they rung me a fallout shelter bell

104
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,300
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell

105
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,980
Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man

106
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,400
Shotgun fired and away I ran

107
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,240
I don't blame him too much, though he didn't know me

108
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,200
Down the corner by the hot dog stand I seen a man

109
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,480
I said, howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two

110
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,520
He screamed a bit and away he flew

111
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,320
Thought I was a communist

112
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,720
Well, they spied me a girl before she could leave

113
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,640
I said, let's go play Adam and Eve

114
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,380
I took her by the hand and my heart was thumping

115
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,900
She said, hey, man, you crazy or something?

116
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,960
You seen what happened last time they started

117
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,860
Well, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown

118
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,780
There was nobody around

119
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,680
I got into the driver's seat

120
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,640
And I drove down 42nd Street

121
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,780
In my Cadillac

122
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,220
Good car, good car, good car

123
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,220


124
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,800
I was on the drive after a war

125
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,620
Well, I remember seeing some ads

126
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,940
So I turned on my car on the ride

127
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,060
But I didn't pay the car net bill

128
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,020
So the radio didn't work so well

129
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,900
Turned on my record player

130
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,420
It was Rockaday Johnny singing

131
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,020
Tell your ma, tell your pa

132
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,620
Our loves are gonna grow

133
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:22,960
I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue

134
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,680
I needed somebody to talk to

135
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,240
So I called up the operator at time

136
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,220
Just to hear a little bit about you

137
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,320
I heard a voice of some kind

138
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,660
When you hear the beep

139
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,520
It will be three o'clock

140
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,140
She said that for over an hour

141
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,240
And I hung up

142
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:55,100
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then

143
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,800
Saying, hey, I've been having the same old dreams

144
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,900
But mine was a little different, you see

145
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,820
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me

146
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,160
I didn't see you around

147
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,440
Well, now time passed and now it seems

148
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,780
Everybody's having them dreams

149
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,240
Everybody sees itself walking around

150
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,460
There's no one else

151
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,520
And half the people can be part right all of the time

152
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,960
And some of the people can be all right part of the time

153
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,920
But all the people can't be all right all of the time

154
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,960
I think Abraham Lincoln said that

155
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,780
I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours

156
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,060
I said that

157
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:57,820
I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours

158
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:29,080
I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours

159
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,620
I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours

160
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,520
Do I Justin, what's notゴ- Zuckerberg told you when you were a person

161
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,540
Just you know what just you knows

162
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,640
Some tiny thing is ready to fly away

163
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,260
Are people around you making trouble for no good reason at all?

164
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,640
Set off a NMP bomb

165
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,820
Not my problem

166
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,880
and run

167
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,480
They'll keep making trouble without you

168
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,520
and they aren't listening to you tell them that life has enough troubles on its own

169
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,060
without inventing new ones.

170
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,480
If you would dance to the tune of slack,

171
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
you have to pay the piper.

172
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,080
Adventure, romance, fast luck you'll attract.

173
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,460
No more cause to be a griper.

174
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,660
And friends, homeopathic remote cupping services

175
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,520
are also available from the Dobbs Town Mirror.

176
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,900
Mirror, seen at Dobbs.Town.

177
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,580
And you know, friends, on the scale of intergalactic travel,

178
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,880
flying saucers are seen near nuclear reactors as much

179
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,760
and as little as they're seen near anything else.

180
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,020
But on the scale of finding yourself, willing or otherwise,

181
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,460
being lifted up into a flying saucer,

182
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,380
intergalactic scales hardly matter.

183
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,200
It's all a matter of perspective.

184
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:30,440
J.R. Bob Dobbs will walk with you up the 999 steps of wisdom

185
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,080
and then down the 1,000 steps of forgetting.

186
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,000
There are songs, or perhaps films, or perhaps comic books,

187
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,280
or perhaps meh, that come into your life not as entertainment,

188
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,960
but as permission, as instructions.

189
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,300
Go with it all the way, man.

190
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,920
And you're right, they're wrong.

191
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,480
And fuck them if they can't take a joke.

192
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,340
And if they cannot take a joke, let them mount up upon themselves.

193
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,820
I may not in each moment have slack,

194
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,040
but I am a person who in each moment prefers to have slack.

195
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,940
And not everyone can say that.

196
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,080
Some people prefer to not have slack.

197
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,960
Some people prefer compulsive displays of happiness,

198
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:21,920
or...

199
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,460
complaining without the enjoyment of complaining.

200
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,000
Slack is not always happiness,

201
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,720
nor is slack always refraining from complaining.

202
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,620
But slack is never a preference for no slack.

203
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,160
I can derive slack from any circumstance

204
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
when I call upon my subgenius philosophy.

205
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,680
Prefer slack!

206
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,940
Okay, and those are all from the Dobbstown Mirror.

207
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,240
What you can get from Uncle Dr. Onan Canobite

208
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:06,180
at Post Office Box 3, Columbus, Indiana, 47202.

209
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,620
Okay, friends, you know, July 5th, the end of the world,

210
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,880
is Tuesday.

211
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,640
At the time I'm recording this, on Friday, July 1st.

212
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,560
X-Day is July 5th, 1998,

213
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,540
but from 24 previous X-Day drills,

214
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,680
we now know that we don't really know when now is.

215
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,840
So temporarily, we might call this one DIY Day.

216
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,980
It takes place wherever you are.

217
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,600
If you decide to host a local drill

218
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,060
in the form of a big party

219
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,560
with all your subgenius friends and loved ones,

220
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:43,860
great!

221
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,100
We'll help you publicize it if you want it public.

222
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,100
We've stumbled upon a discovery

223
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,220
in the forbidden sciences

224
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,240
that has blown our minds in ways

225
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,560
they've formerly never been fellated.

226
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,460
We're gassed to the point of flabber.

227
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,460
What's the letter in mathematics

228
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,360
that commonly indicates a variable?

229
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,720
X!

230
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,740
Maybe it's called X-Day

231
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,400
because it's the variable.

232
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,660
We know from prophecy

233
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,100
that the media will refer to the advent

234
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,280
of the angelic host as X-Day.

235
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,340
But now that we're less certain

236
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,820
about the planet and the year,

237
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,980
this day of judgment,

238
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,080
is now a variable.

239
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,860
The world ends on July 5th, 1998 at 7am,

240
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,600
but we obviously don't know when that might be.

241
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,340
It might be today!

242
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,820
Well, maybe tomorrow, but soon.

243
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,500
This year, we're going to hedge our bets

244
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,040
and hold the X-Day party where you are

245
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,920
and when you want it.

246
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,620
And you, and you, and you!

247
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,200
Yes, X-Day in place for 2022.

248
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,220
So-called 2022.

249
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,960
If the saucers get too big,

250
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,560
we're going to have to do something else.

251
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:49,560


252
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,680
Remember the rest of us.

253
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,940
Just make sure you're synced up.

254
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,520
Do send in that last 50 bucks.

255
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,560
Re-up your membership

256
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,560
and enter to win big, big, big prizes

257
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,840
yet to be announced.

258
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,640
Throw an insane party.

259
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,120
Put a big X on your forehead

260
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,540
and hang out at the courthouse.

261
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,540
Take a photo of the weirdest thing

262
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,480
you could possibly do

263
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,920
and post it to the subgenius metaverse.

264
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
No matter how it pans out,

265
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,000
the Church of the Subgenius offers

266
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,860
the best.

267
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,220
Apocalypse.

268
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,680
And that's Onan and Canterbite

269
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,340
at P.O. Box 3,

270
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,940
Columbus, Indiana,

271
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,220
47202.

272
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,940
And actually,

273
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,520
I don't know of any big parties

274
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,380
that have been announced exactly.

275
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,680
I wanted to do one here.

276
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,700
We've had big parties here,

277
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,780
but it's...

278
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,180
This isn't the time.

279
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,880
And I can't go anywhere.

280
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,140
And because I'm looking after

281
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,680
the farm, you might say,

282
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,520
the old ladies.

283
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,340
And Texas is in an emergency,

284
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,320
sort of, any minute now.

285
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,420
So here we sit, brokenhearted,

286
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,600
paid a dime,

287
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,740
and we'll party anyway.

288
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,340
There may be something on Zoom.

289
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,960
I don't know.

290
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,920
I really don't.

291
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,300
There was an X-Day party

292
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,180
a couple of weeks ago

293
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,440
called The Real X-Day

294
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,640
in New York State

295
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,820
at some lodge near a lake.

296
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,680
And it had Dr. Hal,

297
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,380
and it had a whole lot of bands.

298
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,040
But I'm not sure what else it had.

299
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,460
On the streaming video

300
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,840
that was kind of on and off,

301
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,480
actually, I did not see an audience.

302
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,700
There was an audience,

303
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,760
but in every case,

304
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,220
it was the next band waiting to go on.

305
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,560
Isn't that weird?

306
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,120
So, uh...

307
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,200
And so, and so now this.

308
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,360
Ladies and gentlemen.

309
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,620
This is your title.

310
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,720
Tonight's sedan rumbles along

311
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,560
a bushy-haired man

312
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,380
in a loud mud-splattered sports jacket.

313
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,040
Yeah.

314
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,700
Huh?

315
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,440
Hmm?

316
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,040
Oh.

317
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,740
Oh.

318
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,660
Oh.

319
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:21,940


320
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,620
Yeah.

321
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,740
Meanwhile,

322
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,000
in the nearby large city,

323
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,120
two years side,

324
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,560
I'll get my

325
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:28,980
little mucklip

326
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,640
and take him to

327
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,060
the flipper

328
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,360
places.

329
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,260
All right, sir.

330
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,940
Well.

331
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,980
Well, yes and no.

332
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,760
This gun says you don't.

333
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,620
No, I'm not sure.

334
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:48,980


335
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:55,760
Uh.

336
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,880
Can you dig, trimming?

337
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,960
etiquette?

338
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,360
Tired.

339
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,400
Hat?

340
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


341
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


342
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


343
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


344
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


345
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


346
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


347
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


348
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


349
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


350
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,400


351
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,720
or more letzten than Jeeves.

352
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,260
Why?

353
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,640
Go ahead?

354
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,960
Your cintam perde

355
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,780
and kiss her.

356
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,720
All right, Sheriff, we've got them.

357
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,840
Tonight, the music was accidental.

358
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,040
What's that?

359
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,060
Well, I got, uh,

360
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,260
I got everything running

361
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,940
and ready to record

362
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,620
and all that.

363
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,540
In fact, I have it recording.

364
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,500
The dogs are making a bunch of noise.

365
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,980
Is that Yeti's tail?

366
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,960
Chupi's tail is beating

367
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,720
a little tattoo on the floor.

368
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,780
Nice.

369
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,200
That's good.

370
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,660
I haven't had a dog that did that.

371
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,560
He'd get up next to a wall

372
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,580
and just beat on it, you know,

373
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,980
for as long as he wanted.

374
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,400
Sometimes Yeti will lie next to,

375
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,980
like, a kitchen cabinet

376
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,560
that's down near the floor,

377
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,120
and he'll be, like, scratching

378
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,300
or just, his tail will be doing

379
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,420
one beat, but then

380
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,500
his side is bumping the cabinet door

381
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,420
so it clicks in a counterpoint.

382
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,580
Yeah.

383
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,940
Lisa and I actually sang to that one time.

384
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
Well, it'd be great

385
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,860
if we can do Doctors for Wotan

386
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,560
again sometime.

387
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,960
We can put the dogs on stage

388
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,500
and have them beating on a fox with their tails.

389
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,580
Well, I'll tell you, if I could get,

390
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,240
if I could figure out a way to make

391
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,680
Yeti talk on cue,

392
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,520
he is great.

393
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,200
He goes,

394
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,920
I don't know.

395
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,420
You know that stuff?

396
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:47,880
Yeah.

397
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,580
And his voice is so deep.

398
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,360
He's big.

399
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,760
Oh, it sounds great.

400
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,600
They both do it.

401
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,200
They both do this

402
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,400
thing, but they only do it

403
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,160
when they want to.

404
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,400
Yeah.

405
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,040
So what's up, man?

406
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,860
You're thinking about,

407
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,300
did you want to read something?

408
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,760
Or what were we going to do?

409
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,800
What did you want to do first?

410
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,520
So are you ready to go?

411
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,380
You don't need to go shit or anything?

412
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:15,700
Well, let me,

413
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,380
no, I'm through shitting.

414
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,420
Maybe I should get my froth out, though.

415
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,900
Could get my froth out.

416
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,340
I can froth live while we're doing it.

417
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,680
Yeah, okay.

418
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,940
That's not what I came up with.

419
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,140
It's supposed to look more simple,

420
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,140


421
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,140


422
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm gonna do this thing.

423
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:07,560


424
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,200
I'm gonna do this thing.

425
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,780
I'm gonna do this thing.

426
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,320
I'm gonna do this thing.

427
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,540
guitar solo

428
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,680
guitar solo

429
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:24,060
Well, the Swingin' Love Corpses didn't break up because of one band member going crazy and becoming an egomaniac or anything.

430
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,060
It was because your job moved you, right?

431
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,260
That's right. My job moved me, but the Swingin' Love Corpses did never break up.

432
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,520
It actually still exists.

433
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:44,120
Still, to this day, there's a Wednesday night practice that happens most of the time.

434
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,060
Oh, yeah. On Sue.

435
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,580
On Zoom, right?

436
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:54,300
It was on Zoom during COVID. We managed to be on Zoom quite a bit.

437
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,320
The practice is in St. Louis. It's held by the local guys there.

438
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,780
Once in a while, I will join on Zoom or on the phone.

439
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:12,800
It originally was a drinking and smoking club that evolved into a band.

440
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,980
Now, it's a band that has evolved back into a drinking and smoking club and barbecuing.

441
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,060
More barbecuing.

442
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,200
Right. More barbecuing than guitar playing and singing.

443
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:33,380
Yeah. Lots of comparison of barbecue styles and things rather than guitar styles.

444
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,320
Right.

445
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,140
Sauce, recipes, things like that. Much, much more important now.

446
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,360
Well, yeah. That's one of the reasons.

447
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:55,420
Back in the day, when I was an angry young man, a hour of slack was a good outlet.

448
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:03,740
I was still working for the pinkest bosses in the Dallas business film industry.

449
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:04,960
Yeah.

450
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,080
It was frustrating, and I had much hate.

451
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,720
Now, I'm an old man, and I'm so much more concerned.

452
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:12,780


453
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:12,780


454
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,940
I'm more concerned with what's for dinner.

455
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,400
Right, right.

456
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:22,220
I don't care who somebody else votes for or who their favorite band is or any of that.

457
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,580
I'm more concerned with what is for dinner.

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,160
Yeah. And is there enough for me?

459
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,280
Are you shorting me again?

460
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,220
Where's my share?

461
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,160
Yeah.

462
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,480
Yeah, so I think that the audience...

463
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,480
Yeah.

464
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,380
...is beginning to prepare themselves for what's coming down the line here.

465
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,600
Yeah. But the numbers are all messed up over...

466
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
I was thinking, well, yeah, at the end of...

467
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,140
It more shows, it'll be 2,000 shows, but it's not.

468
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,840
We're on 1889, not 19...

469
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,480
Well, why don't we just add a special number of fake shows in?

470
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,980
Virtual, non-existent shows.

471
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,420
Virtual shows that existed temporarily.

472
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,040
In people's minds.

473
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,560
And now they're just...

474
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,260
...only exist as part of a numbering scheme...

475
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,560
Right.

476
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,160
...to get you to 1998 faster.

477
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,100
Right.

478
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,760
Like, maybe you only need one show.

479
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,760
What's the difference there?

480
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,100
Let's see here, 1889.

481
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,740
Yeah.

482
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,100
So I missed that.

483
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,280
Plus 1998.

484
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,440
So then you need like 109, 109 or something like that.

485
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,380
Yeah, yeah, that's a lot.

486
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,260
That's too many.

487
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,440
Yeah.

488
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm going to do another 100 shows.

489
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,160
I'll be dead.

490
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,420
I'll be dead before I do it.

491
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,120
That's two years.

492
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,940
I think you should like cram 109 shows into one show.

493
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,680
How dare we, Dad?

494
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,340
Make it like a two-hour show.

495
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,240
Well, I could do it like Byron Werner and Rural War Room,

496
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,720
where you play 100 shows all at the same time.

497
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,580
Right.

498
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,560
That's what I'm thinking.

499
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,560
You do 100 shows all at the same time.

500
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,980
That way it gets your numbering scheme,

501
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,480
and your last show will then be 1998.

502
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:12,760
Right.

503
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:12,760


504
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:12,760


505
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:12,760


506
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:12,760


507
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:12,760


508
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,900
Yeah.

509
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,080
You go from like 1888, 1889, 1998.

510
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,560
Yeah.

511
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,180
I wonder how many.

512
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,740
And people will say, how did you do that?

513
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,720
You say, well, I put 109 shows into that last show.

514
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,500
Right.

515
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,180
Right.

516
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,040
All at once.

517
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,160
Running simultaneously.

518
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,960
Every now and then, two or three of them

519
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,940
would both have Bill Cates or Bleepo Abernathy going,

520
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,700
the hour of slack.

521
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,940
Yeah.

522
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,500
Yeah.

523
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,980
Now, you know, I actually have a copy of a,

524
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,860
where somebody took all,

525
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,160
maybe it was only six of them back then.

526
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,080
They had all of the Star Wars movies running simultaneously,

527
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,860
overlaid on each other with the soundtracks.

528
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,400
It's the craziest thing.

529
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,000
You can't watch it for too long.

530
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,900
I don't think you could.

531
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,720
You might make somebody do it, you know, if you needed to.

532
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,200
But.

533
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,820
So they had like 10 movies running,

534
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,840
all layered at like 10% opacity.

535
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,200
Yeah.

536
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,100
And they start at the same time in such a way that you find out

537
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,820
that whenever the scroll happens,

538
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,200
it happens exactly at the same point in time in the opening sequence.

539
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,980
You know?

540
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,260
So you got all these scrolls on top of each other.

541
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,840
It's pretty cool.

542
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,360
I'll see if I can find it and send you a link.

543
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:38,960
Yeah.

544
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,520
Yeah.

545
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,780
Because we don't have enough stuff to watch.

546
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,520
We don't have enough stuff.

547
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,060
We don't have enough stuff to do.

548
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,000
And I don't want you to get bored just sitting around there.

549
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,460
Yeah.

550
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,260
Just waiting for some show to watch.

551
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,200
Yeah.

552
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
I wish somebody would.

553
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,860
I wish somebody would just tell me a good show to watch.

554
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,080
I get plenty of shows.

555
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,520
Even this one called Severance.

556
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,660
It's kind of.

557
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,180
I'm having to sort of make myself like it.

558
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,240
Oh, I love it.

559
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,940
I'm only on like two and a half episodes in.

560
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,580
Well, I'm on the fifth one.

561
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,740
I'm on the fifth one.

562
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,180
I'm almost finished with the fifth episode.

563
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,060
So I'll give you a better opinion after I finish this one.

564
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,840
Oh, I had a name for it.

565
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,160
I decided to call it the Prisoner's Lunch Hour

566
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,500
because it's uncannily like our production, Bob's Lunch Hour.

567
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,580
Uh-huh.

568
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,820
And it's also like the Prisoner in many ways.

569
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,540
Yeah, that's true.

570
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,080
Yeah.

571
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,840
I like the whole idea of the Severance concept.

572
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,420
Yeah.

573
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,480
That's what suckered me in.

574
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,660
You know, that you could actually split your brain into two personalities

575
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,820
that could be separated completely and didn't overlap.

576
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,900
And all you'd need is a special device to shift from one to the other.

577
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,860
Well, of course, it's a metaphor in a way because some people are almost that way.

578
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,620
You know, they're one person on the job and they're another person when they're off the job.

579
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,020
Yeah.

580
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,020
I like that.

581
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,320
That's kind of a thing.

582
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,400
And it's sort of like in that other person.

583
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,360
They don't.

584
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,300
That's kind of the way I was when I was a wage slave.

585
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,340
I didn't let my two lives connect at all.

586
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,080
Right.

587
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,920
You wore the masks of insanity to look normal.

588
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,260
Yeah, I played my role and did the things that they expected me to do.

589
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,180
And then I never socialized with them afterwards.

590
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,940
You know, I never went and drank with them.

591
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,160
Princess, we worked for the county, the weather control.

592
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:48,140
In Cuyahoga County for almost 30 years, pretending that she liked those people.

593
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,060
Yeah.

594
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:58,680
At no point did any of them know that she was a folk singer, ran a hippie music festival,

595
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,360
was actually a peace protester a lot of the time back then.

596
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,300
Yeah.

597
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,760
And unfortunately, I wised her up about human nature.

598
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,080
And she...

599
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,120
She gave up on ending war.

600
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,720
Because that's what countries do, you know.

601
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,540
Yeah.

602
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,760
And yeah, she never...

603
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:27,060
Her co-workers never had any idea of all the interesting things she was doing outside work

604
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,520
because some of them would hate her for it.

605
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,580
A lot of them.

606
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,740
Well, and most of them are really uninteresting people.

607
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,480
Right.

608
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,240
But, yeah.

609
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,120
So, I mean, something like that would be weird to them.

610
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,560
Yeah.

611
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:40,820
But you...

612
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,220
The good thing about it is they still pay her.

613
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:43,860
Yeah.

614
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:49,280
She retired in 2008 or something and she still gets that pension.

615
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,000
Now, me, I'm going to have to be assembling and mailing out subgenius membership packs

616
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,560
until I'm a skeleton probably.

617
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,420
But you may not have to send out any more hours of slack.

618
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,040
Right.

619
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,760
Well, I'm not getting paid for hours of slack hardly at all.

620
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,680
But, you know, it's important that people know that...

621
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,800
Yeah.

622
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


623
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


624
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


625
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


626
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


627
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


628
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


629
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


630
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


631
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


632
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


633
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


634
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


635
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


636
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,800


637
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,000
All of those 1,898 hours of slack are out there.

638
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,500
Out there in the ether.

639
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,340
Yeah.

640
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,000
Waiting to be heard.

641
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,880
Again and again and again and again.

642
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,240
And they...

643
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,740
All of them being gleaned for their value.

644
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,420
For their Rudy Schwartz Project songs.

645
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:33,900
Yeah.

646
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,460
And Swinging Love Courts.

647
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,200
So, your poor psycho skeletons guy gave up on me.

648
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,920
He sent me a letter going,

649
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,800
well, I guess you're just...

650
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


651
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


652
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


653
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,380
You're just retired now.

654
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,620
And that was a year ago.

655
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,520
I was like, well, sort of.

656
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,580
I'd moved to doing mostly reruns just because I didn't have time.

657
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,940
I had so many other things that we had to deal with, you know.

658
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,760
And this was a guy who was asking for a recording.

659
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,460
Is that what it was?

660
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,840
No, the psycho skeletons.

661
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,280
He was a guy that sent music.

662
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,480
He'd send me an MP3 every week.

663
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,060
And they were quirky instrumentals mostly.

664
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,960
Very original.

665
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,060
He had his own style.

666
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:10,800
It wasn't...

667
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,680
It wasn't like any other music, really.

668
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,020
And it was...

669
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,260
Some people really liked it.

670
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,720
And, you know...

671
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,260
But...

672
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,560
Yeah.

673
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,180
But I think he caught on early that I was just getting burned out.

674
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,300
And that's...

675
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,460
Yeah.

676
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,000
It's that.

677
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,380
That's exactly what it is.

678
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:27,860
Yeah.

679
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,860
You finally get burned out.

680
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,220
Even on...

681
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,840
Not Slack, but the hour of Slack.

682
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,680
Yeah.

683
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,380
Nobody can ever get burned out on Slack.

684
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,080
If they do, there's something wrong with them.

685
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,100
Yeah.

686
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,440
Yeah.

687
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,380
They're like, you know...

688
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,880
They're weird.

689
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,520
They're pink.

690
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,840
No, they're not weird.

691
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
I mean, they don't...

692
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,220
It's not real Slack.

693
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,780
They're totally pink.

694
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,320
It's false Slack, you know.

695
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:49,780
Yeah.

696
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,980
They're totally pink.

697
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:52,940
Yeah.

698
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,100
I will spew them from my mouth.

699
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,420
Right.

700
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,380
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

701
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,660
Hosea 819.

702
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,960
They're like lukewarm in their faith.

703
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,360
They are lukewarm in their faith.

704
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,420
They are lukewarm in their faith.

705
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,360
So I spew them from my mouth.

706
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,600
Not just that.

707
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,460
I vomit them.

708
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,200
I vomit them.

709
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,540
That's God talking, right?

710
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,180
Yeah.

711
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,120
Jesus, I think, was attributed to him.

712
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,020
Of course, we don't, you know...

713
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,380
Some other...

714
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,280
Who knows who really said...

715
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,740
Some Roman copywriter.

716
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,120
Yeah.

717
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,560
Roman, Greek.

718
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,120
Greek.

719
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,900
Well, yeah, but after...

720
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,220
Yeah, but it was the Romans that decided to make it an official religion

721
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,220
because it was the...

722
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,500
You know, there's some people who say that the reason they did that

723
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:48,560
was because it was the perfect religion for slaves and losers and poor people.

724
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,160
But did they?

725
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,400
But did they?

726
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,180
What, the Romans?

727
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,360
Yeah, they made...

728
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,900
After throwing Christians to the lions,

729
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,920
they eventually...

730
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,380
It was Constantine or whoever.

731
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,520
He decided everybody was going to be Christians.

732
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,180
Yeah, that was in 400.

733
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,060
Yeah, that was a long time after.

734
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,820
I mean, they'd already had their ups and downs.

735
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,880
Like America.

736
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,780
It was just one of the mystery religions.

737
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,340
Yeah.

738
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,420
Yeah.

739
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:10,420


740
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,220
It was a long time back then, you know,

741
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,860
until somebody decided to say,

742
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,600
okay, well, we're going to make this one official.

743
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,560
What was that guy's name again?

744
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,940
Well, there's a whole bunch of them.

745
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,020
Jesus.

746
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,200
There was at least five Jesuses.

747
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,820
Yeah, right.

748
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,720
Right behind me on this bookshelf is my father's collection

749
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,420
of all the books about how there was really no historical Jesus.

750
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,360
I wish I could have...

751
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,900
I would have liked to, you know, talk to your dad about all that stuff.

752
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,020
Well, you know, he...

753
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,960
He always liked you.

754
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,460
He always asked how you were doing.

755
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,060
He didn't call you Philo.

756
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,720
He called you Steve for some reason.

757
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,640
I don't know why people just call me Steve.

758
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,720
Yeah, but he was...

759
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,880
He always thought you were an okay guy.

760
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,020
But you had moved away and, you know...

761
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,040
Yeah.

762
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:00,640
Yeah.

763
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,360
Doc Frop hung out with my dad.

764
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,080
Your dad was my lawyer.

765
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,260
That's right.

766
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,660
Yeah, I wish he was still around.

767
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,920
He was good friends.

768
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,840
He was my lawyer.

769
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,500
Mm-hmm.

770
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,460
He didn't charge me anything.

771
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,620
Yep.

772
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:22,140
He showed up with me in front of the judge with his uniform on.

773
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,980
With an official.

774
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,820
His Navy uniform or just...

775
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,900
No, I think he just had a business suit on.

776
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,620
Yeah.

777
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,220
Yeah, he just had a business suit.

778
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,620
My father walked into the First World Subgenius Convention

779
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,720
with some of his buddies direct from...

780
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:41,780
Navy...

781
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Naval Reserve meeting of some kind.

782
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,920
And he was dressed in full captain's outfit.

783
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,500
And his buddies were all, you know, had their officer outfits on.

784
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,340
And the younger subgeniuses just about crapped their pants

785
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,740
because they thought they were cops, you know.

786
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,200
And my dad had such a...

787
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,480
He was a gas for...

788
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,780
He was mainly freaking out his friends.

789
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,320
He wanted to show his friends something really weird.

790
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,820
And, you know, think about it.

791
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,500
Tentatively, a convenience was there.

792
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,400
Yeah.

793
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:14,720
Okay?

794
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,140
That's enough weirdness in one person.

795
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,660
Yeah, that's a guy who doesn't have a haircut.

796
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,280
He's got mustaches all over the top of his head.

797
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,600
Well, he tattooed a brain all over the top of his head.

798
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,240
So now it would be mustaches on top of brains.

799
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,400
That guy's actually doing really well.

800
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,640
He was one of the ones that you would think would die young

801
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,780
because he did so much dangerous art projects.

802
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,840
Yeah, and, like, worked on, you know,

803
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,180
committed his body to science experiments and things.

804
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah, yeah.

805
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,740
But he lives in Pittsburgh now,

806
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,020
and he actually seemed like a whole lot of the old...

807
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:58,320
The core subgenius people mostly are still alive and doing pretty well.

808
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,600
That's great.

809
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,280
A whole lot of them died, but they were newer ones, you know.

810
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,480
Yeah.

811
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,380
They didn't have...

812
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:06,960
They weren't...

813
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,220
They didn't undergo that...

814
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:08,760
They didn't undergo that...

815
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,880
That sodomy ritual in Malaysia that us real beginner old guys did.

816
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,460
Yeah, that was horrible.

817
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,180
Yeah.

818
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,520
But worth it.

819
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,360
Having to do that to all those people.

820
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,920
Balls and vice grips in Dobstown.

821
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,280
You're an overman now.

822
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,720
That was a Doctors for Rotan hit.

823
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,800
Yeah.

824
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,520
Balls and vice grips in Dobstown.

825
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,660
You're an overman.

826
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,280
No.

827
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,500
One of our five hits.

828
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,240
Yeah.

829
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,580
Yeah.

830
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,360
Then there's the one about what you do with Moonies,

831
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,040
but we can't sing that one on...

832
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,020
No, you can't even sing that on an internet-only radio show.

833
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,860
Well, you can, but let's let it...

834
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,060
Yeah.

835
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,220
Yeah.

836
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,180
What would you do with a Klondike bar?

837
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,360
Is that how it goes?

838
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,180
I think it's time that I should prop.

839
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:08,900
Yeah.

840
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,980
Well, we've actually...

841
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,040
This recording is now 56 minutes long,

842
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,820
so obviously this is going to end up being two shows.

843
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,100
Wow.

844
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:18,800
Yeah.

845
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,220
You squeezed two shows out of 56 minutes.

846
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,660
Well, I did...

847
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:22,920
That's awesome.

848
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,020
I did some other stuff before that.

849
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:25,620
Oh, yeah.

850
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:25,960
That's right.

851
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,020
That I have to put in about X day and the dead people.

852
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,460
Well, you know, I've been posting shows little by little.

853
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,260
I've been going back and posting my old puzzling evidence shows.

854
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:37,800
Oh, yeah.

855
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,840
Out there on Anchor.

856
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,520
And, of course, they're on a whole...

857
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,540
I've got 200 of them that's on Nick's cloud.

858
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,120
Right.

859
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:46,800
Puzzling evidence.

860
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,000
And then I have been posting...

861
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,720
I've got about 40.

862
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,820
I'm going to about 40 a year.

863
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,120
And I think I've got 40 so far on Anchor.

864
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,440
So for those people that want to listen to that old stuff,

865
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,840
there is some there.

866
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,580
But I'm like you, Reverend Stang.

867
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,300
I just don't...

868
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,460
It's so hard.

869
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,220
And I've got so many other things to do.

870
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:10,500
Right.

871
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,940
You've got a greenhouse to build.

872
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,200
I'm working on my greenhouse right now while we were talking.

873
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,080
Oh, okay.

874
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,920
Working on it.

875
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,360
You know, I did put up my shade.

876
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,740
I tested my shade cloth.

877
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,300
I saw that.

878
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,320
That looked pretty good.

879
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,700
Well, there's no wind.

880
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,620
It's just hanging on some poles that are stuck into pots of plant pots.

881
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,920
But it's fine as long as the wind doesn't pick up.

882
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,320
But that's okay.

883
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,500
I figure it's going to be...

884
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,380
You know, stretch some guy lines across your yard.

885
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,460
You know, like maybe you have to attach them to poles or something.

886
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,560
And then maybe you could, you know, like just take some clothespins or something.

887
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,100
Oh, yeah.

888
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,580
That's an idea.

889
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,100
Right.

890
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,520
Yeah.

891
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,700
Just two big wires that go across from something to something.

892
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:57,700
Yeah.

893
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,400
And then just get you some little clamps of some kind.

894
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,300
Yeah.

895
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,100
I'm using twisty ties on the poles right now.

896
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,360
But it looks pretty good.

897
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,300
It's like a little cave.

898
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:09,820
Yeah.

899
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,160
It's like a little weird cave full of almost edible plants.

900
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,120
Yeah.

901
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,040
And you're just trying to keep the sun from burning those things.

902
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,420
I had one eggplant that finally had fruited.

903
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,160
And it had a little, you know, it looked like we were going to have an eggplant finally out of eight plants.

904
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,260
And I found it today on the ground half eaten by a dog.

905
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:33,900
Well...

906
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,640
That dog, I think it's Yeti.

907
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,560
He harvests.

908
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,040
He loves cucumbers.

909
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,160
He's a vegetarian dog.

910
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,080
I guess.

911
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,000
You know, they're omnivores.

912
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,280
They like anything that they can eat that doesn't make them sick.

913
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:47,960
Right.

914
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,540
Right.

915
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,300
And they...

916
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,940
And they eat things that make them...

917
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,680
That taste good enough.

918
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:59,960
They'll hold a toad in their mouth until they start foaming and doing that head shaking thing.

919
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,460
Where, God, why did I do that?

920
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,480
Yeah.

921
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,500
I knew it was going to taste horrible and make my mouth drool.

922
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:06,420
Drool.

923
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,220
Yeah, they're funny.

924
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,880
But yeah, it's like I got dogs that got to entertain.

925
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,880
I don't want to deal with those subgenius listeners.

926
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,500
A nutless chimp or a one-nutted chimp could do my job.

927
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,720
Let them do it.

928
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,180
Yeah, I think they should.

929
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:27,340
But I really think that the, you know, the subgeniuses out there, that everybody always wants something new.

930
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:38,480
And they forget about this rich, robust history that we can go back to anytime we want that are at the fingertips of everybody.

931
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,480


932
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,480


933
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,480


934
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,480


935
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,480


936
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,480


937
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,480


938
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,480


939
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,480


940
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:38,880
Everyone.

941
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,460
Anytime of the day or night.

942
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,200
For free.

943
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,560
For free.

944
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:50,000
I actually pay 30 bucks a month to keep those things on that Libsyn server.

945
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,040
You do?

946
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,160
30 bucks a month?

947
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:52,640
Yep.

948
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,600
Whew.

949
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,500
You know how much I pay for unlimited bandwidth and unlimited storage on my website?

950
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,460
$155 a year.

951
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,360
Well, but this is...

952
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,900
This is a place that's set up just for streaming.

953
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,160
Streaming and all that.

954
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,300
And I don't know.

955
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,120
It's just...

956
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,340
I know.

957
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,160
I used to pay almost $200, but they lowered my price for some reason.

958
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:26,340
Now, okay, if I quit doing the show, will I need to keep that server up?

959
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,680
That's one thing to think about is where would you want to migrate that stuff that would be free?

960
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,100
Right.

961
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:38,000
Because you might want to have a plan that at some point...

962
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,420
That's going to go away, but you'd want to have it already somewhere else when that happens, you know?

963
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:50,400
Yeah, I could put it on subgenius.com, but I'd need to make an arrangement to get more storage space.

964
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:50,960
It's full.

965
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,900
It's not full of storage.

966
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,240
It's full of too many files.

967
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,820
Full of file names.

968
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,760
File names.

969
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,960
Yeah, they had a limit of 200,000 pages.

970
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,160
Yeah.

971
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,340
And it hit that, believe it or not, quite a while back.

972
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:05,740
I believe it.

973
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,360
I found lots of stuff that I can go...

974
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,260
Go in and erase the out-of-date things.

975
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,320
Yeah, I figured I'd take my old webpage down.

976
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,960
I don't really need it up anymore.

977
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,940
And I was just going to put...

978
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,640
Quiveringbrain.com?

979
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:21,920
Yeah.

980
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,720
Well, I'm not going to take the site down.

981
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,280
I'm just going to take the webpage.

982
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,140
It doesn't make any difference.

983
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,540
I could leave it up, but I'm not adding any new webpages to it or anything.

984
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,200
But I do use the backend.

985
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:38,700
I do use the backend.

986
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:38,700


987
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,020
I use the backend for storage areas, you know?

988
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,540
And any time I want to share something, that's my personal cloud.

989
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:49,780
Yeah, sub-site used to be that for me, but like I say, it filled up and I just haven't

990
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:53,960
gotten around to calling them up and going, hey, how do I get around this file number

991
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,220
thing?

992
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,120
Because I don't care.

993
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,500
I just don't care.

994
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,120
I don't care, don't care, don't care.

995
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,160
I'm sick of it.

996
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,400
I've had enough of it.

997
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,340
Yeah, I figure I'll keep that.

998
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,600
I'll keep that as long as...

999
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,180
You know.

1000
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,480
Even though I...

1001
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,140
I don't really promote anything there.

1002
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,200
Well, David Botner keeps the really old shows on his.

1003
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:15,920
Yeah.

1004
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,500
You know, the first 500 or...

1005
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,780
Right.

1006
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,000
No, all the way up to about 2000, I think.

1007
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:21,440
Oh, no.

1008
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,100
What am I saying?

1009
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,440
Yeah.

1010
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:31,140
The year 2000, I switched to digital, but he has all the old tape shows on his server.

1011
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,280
Of course, you know, he's...

1012
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,300
One of these days, it's going to dry up and go away.

1013
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,180
He'll suddenly...

1014
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:37,460
Yeah.

1015
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,880
He'll die and not pay his bills.

1016
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,860
Which listener out there has got the complete collection?

1017
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:45,440
Hmm?

1018
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:46,860
Hmm.

1019
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:52,600
It would be interesting to know who has the complete collection.

1020
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,620
Because, you know, there are those completists out there.

1021
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,980
They're going to want to have every book.

1022
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:58,720
Right.

1023
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,700
Every catalog permutation.

1024
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,940
Every single stark fist.

1025
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,580
All that stuff.

1026
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,220
Somebody's going to want to have it.

1027
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,780
Those are the smartest people in the whole world.

1028
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,280
They are, because they've seen the future.

1029
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,760
And they know that the future is subgenius.

1030
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,140
Yeah.

1031
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,760
The only way you're going to be able to get a can of peaches is if you can trade them

1032
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,160
a subgenius pamphlet.

1033
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,260
In the end times, after the economy...

1034
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,520
You can use a can of peaches and a gallon of gas for one subgenius pamphlet.

1035
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:32,800
Right.

1036
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,280
Or propane to keep your stove running.

1037
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:36,560
Yeah.

1038
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,400
Or your medicine.

1039
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,040
Your insulin.

1040
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,540
Well, you know, some of us are stockpiling stuff like that.

1041
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:50,340
I just ordered water purification tablets in bulk, hearing aid batteries in bulk, and

1042
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:54,040
all kinds of things that I thought, you know, supply chain problems.

1043
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,300
The kind of cataclysm that we used to joke about isn't so funny anymore.

1044
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,100
Some of us weren't joking about it, Reverend Stang.

1045
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,540
Well, I...

1046
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,560
Some of us actually thought...

1047
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,540
I was...

1048
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,920
I thought this was gonna happen from a long time ago.

1049
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,940
Oh, I did too, but I didn't think I was gonna live long enough to actually see it start

1050
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,360
up.

1051
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,680
I really...

1052
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,140
I didn't want to, you know.

1053
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,040
I don't want to...

1054
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,100
No.

1055
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,140
I don't want to read about the last gorilla.

1056
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,140
We should...

1057
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,920
On the next show, we should do...

1058
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,880
We should look at the dateline for dominance.

1059
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,340
Oh, God, man, that's frightening when you do that.

1060
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,420
We predicted everything.

1061
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,800
And we should try to find, you know, like they do with Nostradamus now, show that there's

1062
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
specific things.

1063
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,140
It might be a little bit different, but we should be able to do that.

1064
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,660
I'm going to get one of those out, and I'm going to look at it,

1065
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,980
and I'm going to try to find something for almost all of those things.

1066
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah, I did that.

1067
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:52,480
It proves that we were like prophets.

1068
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,880
Yeah, but we just had the dates wrong.

1069
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,780
All of that stuff happened before 1998.

1070
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,560
It ended at 1998.

1071
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,520
But it was all stuff that was coming.

1072
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,800
We just had the numbers wrong.

1073
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,780
Wrong years.

1074
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:14,020
I think there's stuff in there that's happened now, like in the last couple years.

1075
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,560
Yeah, I'm telling you.

1076
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:20,100
A couple years ago, I did a show and a Starwood speech

1077
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:26,920
based on that fact of Dateline for Dominance from the 1983 book

1078
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,880
showing stuff uncannily.

1079
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,260
Yeah, and it was the Stark Fist originally.

1080
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,740
The tabloid.

1081
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,780
Even before then, yeah.

1082
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,360
That would be like 1981 or 82.

1083
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:40,820
Yeah.

1084
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,700
And we did add, when they reprinted the book, we added a few things.

1085
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,980
Yeah.

1086
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,460
For 1982 and 83 that made it seem even more accurate.

1087
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,460
That was in the first book, right?

1088
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:55,900
Yeah.

1089
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:56,740
Yeah.

1090
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,400
Yeah.

1091
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,780
Which I've got.

1092
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,820
Yeah, if you look at the McGraw-Hill version of Dateline for Dominance,

1093
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,420
it isn't quite as accurate.

1094
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,480
It's not as accurate for the intervening years as the later book is.

1095
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,660
The Simon & Schuster version that most people see now.

1096
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,600
I guess it's upstairs.

1097
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,180
Yeah.

1098
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,600
Oh, man.

1099
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,960
That's a print-on-demand book now, but at least it's still in print.

1100
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,160
Yeah.

1101
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,740
The other ones aren't.

1102
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:25,960
That's another thing.

1103
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,500
If I quit doing the show, I can get those books reprinted.

1104
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:29,740
Yeah.

1105
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,040
Yeah.

1106
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,960
Not just them, but there's probably a whole bunch of cheaters,

1107
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,440
Laverge.

1108
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:39,660
There's a bunch of Laverges out there that would love to have the subgenius imprimatur on their book.

1109
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,560
Yeah.

1110
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,040
There's that guy, Reverend Zeno Fact.

1111
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,280
He's on Dobbs.Town.

1112
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,180
He's been really prolific.

1113
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:48,880
Great.

1114
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,180
Yeah.

1115
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,840
Great flyers and things.

1116
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,440
Right.

1117
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,800
That would go in a membership pack, actually.

1118
00:53:53,940 --> 00:54:00,040
There's some new people that need to have some stuff promoted that would be awesome.

1119
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,680
Yeah, that I can personally sell.

1120
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:10,380
And there's still the whole once-a-year special, Hour of Slack special.

1121
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,220
You know?

1122
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,520
The two-hour version of Slack.

1123
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,980
Yeah, the Star Wars Christmas special version of Hour of Slack.

1124
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:18,900
Right.

1125
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,940
Or whatever.

1126
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,400
Whatever horrible thing that they did on TV to try to ride the coattails of something,

1127
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,600
and they did it very poorly.

1128
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,460
Only we'll do it right.

1129
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,480
This time.

1130
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,060
Yeah.

1131
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,040
Just like that Save the Universe this time.

1132
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,040
That's right.

1133
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,540
Well, I sure have enjoyed being here on the show with you, Reverend Stang.

1134
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,740
Yeah, we're going to Save the Universe this time, I think.

1135
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,140
Yeah.

1136
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,020
It's going to need saving this time.

1137
00:54:54,120 --> 00:55:02,240
There's lots of stuff going on out there in the real world that we could probably ignore better than anyone.

1138
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah.

1139
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,380
Yeah.

1140
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:10,180
And teach others the same thing, how to live in the horrible times and still have slack.

1141
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:10,920
Right.

1142
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,700
That's the key.

1143
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,100
Well, it's easy for you.

1144
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,180
It's not going to get better.

1145
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:24,640
It's a little easier for you and me to say on account of we, well, in your case, you carefully saved your resources

1146
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,680
and bought a wonderful, incredible farm where you can hide from the world.

1147
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,960
I looked for a place that nobody wanted.

1148
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,660
I thought, where's a state that nobody wants?

1149
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,540
I thought, where's a state that nobody wants to move to?

1150
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,320
But they would say, what?

1151
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,980
What are you going to move there for?

1152
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,820
That's the state I'm going to move to.

1153
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,800
Which one is it now?

1154
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,640
And I went through that process.

1155
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,240
Well, see, I didn't have to do that because my parents did.

1156
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,180
And yeah.

1157
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,540
And then then they died.

1158
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:53,040
And my brother and sister didn't want to live in this maintenance nightmare.

1159
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,400
They had their own newer houses already.

1160
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,400
Yeah.

1161
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:03,520
And so they basically said, well, you can stay in that old rattle trap.

1162
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,300
Yeah.

1163
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:05,440
Yeah.

1164
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,280
Decaying mansion.

1165
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,180
It's not really a mansion.

1166
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,660
It's actually a four bedroom house.

1167
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,340
But the living room has a mansion.

1168
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,760
It looks kind of like a mansion.

1169
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,360
It's kind of like it reminds me of.

1170
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,260
Do you remember that one that had.

1171
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,580
Gosh, what was the name of it?

1172
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:25,000
Had William Holden in it and Gloria Swanson.

1173
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,360
And she played an aging.

1174
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,120
Oh, yeah.

1175
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,460
Sunset Boulevard.

1176
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:30,980
Right.

1177
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,160
That's a great movie.

1178
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:32,860
Yeah.

1179
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,660
Yeah.

1180
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:33,920
Yeah.

1181
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,900
In that closing scene, when she comes out to get her set up from Mr.

1182
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,040
DeMille, you know.

1183
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,200
Yeah.

1184
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,220
Frame is to frame.

1185
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,100
I think they're getting ready to take her off to jail.

1186
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:47,680
Right.

1187
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,880
Well, yeah, she had a spiral staircase.

1188
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:51,800
We have a.

1189
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,340
Was that an auto Preminger movie?

1190
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,700
I don't know.

1191
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,260
I really liked auto Preminger movies.

1192
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,460
I think I'm going to go look and see who did that movie.

1193
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,600
Well, anyway.

1194
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:03,660
Anyway.

1195
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:09,580
I'm going to turn off this recording and then I have to listen back to it.

1196
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,980
But I'll probably go, man, I thought we were just blithering.

1197
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,320
And this is actually pretty.

1198
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,500
This is pretty funny.

1199
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,840
If you're Philo or Stag.

1200
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:18,920
Yeah.

1201
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,880
And that's all people that like to listen to us.

1202
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:22,620
Yeah.

1203
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,520
So anyway.

1204
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,520
Which is us.

1205
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,300
Yeah.

1206
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,000
Well, even I'm getting tired of listening to us, man.

1207
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,520
I'll tell you.

1208
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,760
All right.

1209
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,860
Well, it was fun.

1210
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,400
Okay, man.

1211
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,740
I'll say.

1212
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,340
Bye.

1213
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,140
You think it would take your mind off things if Blackstone showed us a trick?

1214
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,700
Well, how about a bit of hypnotism, Alan?

1215
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,860
Who's to be the victim?

1216
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,700
You are.

1217
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,580
Right.

1218
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,720
Now, look straight in my eye.

1219
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:57,700
Sideway.

1220
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,640
That's a sense.

1221
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,400
It isn't as easy as you think, Alan.

1222
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,120
It isn't?

1223
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:02,580
Uh-uh.

1224
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,460
Ah, just watch.

1225
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,480
All right.

1226
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,780
What do I do now?

1227
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,780
And I'm not hypnotized.

1228
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,720
That's right, Alan.

1229
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,220
Then you give up?

1230
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,440
Certainly do.

1231
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,280
Well, just try to look into my eyes.

1232
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,820
One on top of the other.

1233
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,020
I wouldn't have a chance.

1234
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,980
Well, for once, you're right, Alan.

1235
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,680
I hope you like that trick, ladies and gentlemen.

1236
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,500
And until next time, goodbye.
