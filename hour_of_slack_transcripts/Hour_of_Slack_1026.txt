Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.
No, I'm going to compress it.
All into just this one intensive total rerun show.
Except that actually it's not.
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays
and holy days and the hole in head days, as it is for some people.
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling.
Selling.
Yes.
Oh.
You wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.
But anyway, happy whatever you do.
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmas, a guitar axmas.
It's cool, man.
Cool.
Cool.
And.
And.
Praise Bob and her.

And stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree
Who was that man?
He shoved it up my can
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree
When this angel heard
A dreadful fear went right into my heart
Those pine tree needles sting
And I'm in love with the way you love me

Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-nam-a-ding-dong
You'll never know how much that smarts
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-ho
Who put the stick up my hip-de-dip-de-dip
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush
He made this angel beg for mercy, please
I might squeeze him too tight
It's that psychedelic time of the year
Do you know where your brain cells are?
It's already 9 p.m.
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him
Don't go walking down to the bar
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard
I mean, I'm in the apartment store
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?
Yeah, you can.
I brought back the chainsaw.
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells
till I get the damn chainsaw fixed and back in my arm
the way it was Tuesday.
Now you boys be good, and I'll give you some of this here.
I ain't being okay with the body.
You ain't no good of a child.
That dog's running off with them brain cells.
Can you do something about that, boy?
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
What?
Merry Christmas!

Oh, Jaz is giving, gives Dave the show pill.

Boy, I, I really need one of that.
What am I gonna do about laundering his seat though.
I need the show bath.
The show delousing.
Oh, Dave doesn't even have a head.
That's enough of that.
And that's enough of that.
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.
It's been increased in size to...
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.
Look, it's swelling.
I have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.
I'll put more pills out for everybody.
Oh, those pills.
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.
And my brain feel like it's a puddle.
A puddle of liquefied crystals.
I'm shocked by the...
The red pills are really good.
I like to take the red one and the blue one.
The red one and the blue one.
At the same time.

Ah yes, and next up, The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.
And he had two eyes made out of coal.
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.
And he wanted his two front teeth.
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.
And he took all the presents from Whoville.
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.
But he couldn't.
He wanted tens and twenties.
Tens and twenties.
And he...
He got McDonald's gift certificates and he got Zuzu's pedals.
And that's the real story of Christmas.
Take the halls with the miles of holly
Tears of the season to be jolly

Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy-looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.
The station and the gateman.
The water tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

Santa Claus.
It is turnover.
The time of the year when all things sell.
The end of the year sale.
Ah, yes.
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.
Are we celebrating the birthday?
The birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.
Oh, yes.
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.
And it was something else in between there.
But before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was something else.
But I think they started.
The war over it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was weird.
Yeah.
Wow.
Wow.
People got obsessed with it.

Bob did a backflip, and from that day on, he too was a believer.
And from the snowdrift, a little child bearing flowers emerged.
Each one a dirty flower.
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows, as a bishop in, was it Constantinople?
It was an ancient Byzantium.
Asia Minor in general.
Yes, and he was known for sneaking into the rooms of young women and leaving gifts.
Light-sized lumps of coal, complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card.
A saint he was, the girl said.
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.
That's good.
That's you.
You got it, brother.
Snuck into people's houses through the chimney.
You got it, brother.
They knew when they were sleeping.
He knew when they were awake.
You got it, brother.
But like the CIA, he was protecting them.
St. Nick was a creeping, stinking spy.
He knows when you've been sleeping.
He knows what you've been eating.
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little brain?
Madison Avenue, of course.
No, the surveillance community.
And Disney.
Under your direction.
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.
Miller Bear.
He's a very powerful being.
If you're bad, he punishes you.
If you're good, he rewards you.
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus walking the earth.
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.
I think really if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know.
Could Dr. Claus in fact be the wandering, quote, milkman rumored to have fathered our savior,
James?
They are Bob Dobbs?
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here.
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.
You better watch out.
You better not.
You better not.
Because I'm telling you why.
St. Nicholas is coming to town.
St. Nicholas is coming to town.
St. Nicholas is coming to town.
Thank you very much.
There he is.

Here is the thing, he knows when you are away.
He knows when you're in bad or good.
So be good in this goodness sake.
Oh, you better watch out.
You better not cry.
You better not tell them how you are.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Do you think I'm psycho, mama?
I've seen my ex last night.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We all saw X-Mas last night.
A vision of Christmas that was dancing in Stank's head.
It would not live for the little sugar plums and berries dropping toxic things.
All those little sugar plums.
All those sweet and that plums.

Biological agents.

The Weir Bobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.
Well, friends, it's tough.
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.
You've got to send your money to the Santa Bob.
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.
Can you believe that?
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.
And the mom said, no, no, he won't.
Because he bills us.
We can't afford that.
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

I remember my father well, you know.
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.
He used to have, you know what caused it, Ben?
He used to put a stocking cap on his head and put a knock light in front of it.
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.
I said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas, but he's going to bring you something.
So daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air and come back inside and told us the biggest lie ever heard.
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?
Oh my gosh, dang, come on.
His father, Paul Bunyan.
And his mother, Big Sister.
Did they have Christmas before there were malls?
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas.
Yes, there was a down-home Norman Rockwell style, it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.
It was a kite flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas, not a crack smoking rubber snapping Christmas.
Rolling holy dough.
It was a...
Oh man, we have the chance.
When your little brother broke through the hole, it fell through a hole in the ice sling.
And you went and saved him, you didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.
It was a wonderful life back then.
And then we'd put candles, like most people have Christmas candles.
But today, Christmas is now.
It's me.
We've just eaten the crap out of Santa Claus.
Scott, you made your choice.
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.
And to your eternal soul, you have found that only could you afford to give to God that which was his.
But you could not afford to do otherwise.
The Senate still stands.

No!
No!

Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.
Dare I ask it? Yes.
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?
The answer? Yes, definitely.
Take that and shove it up the tube marked certainty,
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die.
The night Santa went crazy.
The night Saint Nick went insane.
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal.
Something finally must have snapped in his brain.
Well, the workshop is gone now.
He decided to bomb it.
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet.
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage.
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage.
He got desperate friends.
He was a great dancer with an old German Luger.
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer.
And he took a big bite to say that it tastes just like chicken.
The night Santa went crazy.
The night Kris Kringle went nuts.
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole without stepping in reindeer.
There's a National Guard and the FBI.
There's a van from the Eyewitness News.
And helicopters circling round in the sky.
And the bullets are flying.
The bodyguards rising.
And everyone's dying to know who Santa was.
My, my, my, my, my, my.
Santa's not here.









You used to be such a jolly guy.
He knows when you're sleeping.
He knows when you're awake.
He knows when you've been found.

You better not pout.

Who gave the Lord the claptrap?
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.
The time of the Lord.
How many before you reach your limit?
How many do you get?
Jesuses?
Yeah.
How many?
How many can you bag?
How many messiahs can you bag?
How many male Jesuses?
If you're doing it in season...
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.
Oh, you never do that.
And you can only take one.
Yeah, but I mean...
You never bag the Lord in C.
You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.
Obviously.
We are between a rock and a hard place.
Did you know the Lord walked through Kel-D in the old age
and he got a very, very hard foot?
And he got Elphintype.
Passage of the rectum.
You know, it's not something well-known by many Christian scholars.
That can be messy, messy, messy disease.
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...
Well, I like the story.
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies
and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West.
I like when he moves into a trailer park and cowboys walk with his dog.
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.
The ranger.
I like the...
The Texas ranger.
Jesus, Texas ranger.
Johnny River was a Jesus.
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force.
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.
Man.
The white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.
Well, what about old Peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois,

You didn't know that, did you?
See, I got you.

Oh, it tastes...

A clapping Jesus.
A future Jesus.
A pipe-smoking Jesus.
Hey, Dave, you know where it is.
Go kick that window open.
I already kicked it.
I'll kick it again, though.
Kick it good this time.
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.
We hope that...
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.
Clapping.
We appreciate all that.
And we're just trying to insult your...
We're just trying to insult your fan club.
That's all.
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?
Right.
I could hear him say that.
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.

Terrorist insurance.

You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob,
stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.
Now we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,
but we subgeni.
I may be bad, but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the evil of so, not all, by any means,
but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals, et cetera, in general, of course,
they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, et cetera,
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.
Sleeve, wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.
Jesus and Bob, like we say, our old drinking buddies, got nothing against Jesus.
It's just his fan club.
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.
He doesn't even sneeze.
We're made.
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,
and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things.
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.
Oh, and he's male.
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do,
because we sinned.
Oh, yeah, we all sinned.
We're bad.
We're worthless.
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.
First off.
Can we interrupt this?
This is our program for a special promotional announcement.
Return.
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this mess is over.

It's all Christmassy right now.
There's a bright green bob in the window
and Christmassy lights.
Is DJA out there?
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.
No, that's something just left for DJA.
It's all Christmassy.
It's all wrapped up in perfumed ribbon-wrapped presents.
Under the tree.
Smell that cinnamon.
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.
And those sugar plums.
Something's up the chimney hole in sight, isn't it?
Yeah.
Or Santa, I mean.
Otherwise, gosh.
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.
Oh, beloved Santa.
I have wanted to...

Merry Christmas!

It was the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the tree
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

Merry F**king Christmas!
Merry F**king Christmas!
T Commission, my dear, I offer you aria!
I have some confetti!
Maybe they're coming as我說
Merry F**king Christmas!


Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't despair just because it's Christmas
Children there are so gay at Christmas
All the children on the street
Hope they get something good to eat
But for me it's not so great
Fuck Christmas
