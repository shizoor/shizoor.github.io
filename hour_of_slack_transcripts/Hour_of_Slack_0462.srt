1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,920
Remember, we're sitting together listening to this.

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
And this was pleasing.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:28,820
Remember, we're sitting together listening to this.

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,180
And this was pleasing to God.

5
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,680
Oh, Reverend Stange.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,540
This is the good old days.

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,720
Well, if it was really the good old days, we'd be in a car.

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,060
We'd have gotten in a car so we could get away from our wives.

9
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,400
Yeah, now our wives don't want us around anymore.

10
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,860
They don't want to hear it anyway.

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,840
They really don't pay any attention.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,320
Can't you guys leave?

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,180
Go do something.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,480
Why don't you go do a radio show?

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,660
Yeah.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:58,800
Yeah.

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,600
Something so we don't have to listen to you.

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,480
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,600
The Self Genius Hour of Slack.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,480
Eternal Salvation.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,040
Or triple your money back.

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,540
The Church of the Subgenius.

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,840
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed,

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,580
eraglic functions over the quality audio-visual techniques

25
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,040
exacerbated and complicated by

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,180
The Church of the Subgenius.

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,580
Copyright 1985-86.

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,800
Oh, Dr. Stange.

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,360
Now, you know, as most of you probably already know,

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,980
within this rigidly hierarchical framework of the Church of the Subgenius,

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,920
the only real heresy in our church is orthodoxy.

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,460
Now, it occurs to me that I'm from the orthodox Stangean mega-fist temple lodge

33
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,780
of the fist temple rabbi,

34
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,820
of Dobbs Yeti resurrected, which is technically the most orthodox.

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,040
Well, it's the biggest heresy, see?

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,400
It can be the most orthodox of all the subgenius doctrines,

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,580
and yet, therefore, because it's so orthodox, it's the biggest heresy.

38
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,860
See, you can't beat me, no way.

39
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,220
Go ahead and try.

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,880
As most of you have figured out, peer pressure to somehow fit in with anything

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,660
is the conspiracy's biggest snare.

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,980
It's their best trick.

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,640
And most of you have already quit wishing you could be like those pink jerks.

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,640
You know, you've realized if you're a loner, then so be it.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,540
And friends, you can indeed learn to think completely for yourself.

46
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,200
But only J.R. Bob Dobbs can show you.

47
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,540
Show you how!

48
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,360
Show you how!

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,480
Now, firebirds and camaros.

50
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:39,580
Firebirds and camaros are what my friend Dr. Drummond terms clone mobiles.

51
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,540
They're the cars of choice of one of the mainstream types of pinks or normals.

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,080
The cars all look exactly alike,

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,080
and the people who drive,

54
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,660
they're all exactly alike.

55
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,580
They really, really are.

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,680
They all listen to the same radio station,

57
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,920
no matter what part of the country they're in,

58
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,800
because even if the call letters are different,

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,760
it's still the same radio station.

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,800
And the DJs all say the same jokes at the same time of day.

61
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,180
And it's always...

62
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,860
Real rock radio!

63
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,620
Real rock radio!

64
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,080
Because the same songs are always playing simultaneously

65
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,160
in every nook and cranny.

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,480
In every nook and cranny of this great nation.

67
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,420
It's the rise of the mediocritons, my friend.

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,220
Everything nowadays, if you look around,

69
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,340
everything's getting to where it really does look just like it does on TV.

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,200
Every city is the same city now.

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,380
They're all just spores of one gigantic, spreading, amoebic maw

72
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,640
that'll someday cover this globe like an endless ant bed.

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,200
And from any given...

74
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,060
It's already, you know, from any given day,

75
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,420
you can drive downtown, you can drive for hours,

76
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,220
for hours driving away from that downtown

77
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,780
through the same identical mini malls, the pizza huts,

78
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,680
the apartment complexes and housing developments

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,540
in endless, endless repetition.

80
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,940
Now, you know, I remember when that was considered

81
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,440
dystopian science fiction.

82
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,000
And now that it's here, we think it's completely normal!

83
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,040
And all the little towns,

84
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,660
you know, that used to have their own quaint, individualistic thing,

85
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,260
all different, now they all have the Whataburger,

86
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
they all have the Burger King and the mall and the Cinema Octoplex,

87
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,680
while everything that made them, you know,

88
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,280
their little quaint courthouse or their strange vegetable stands

89
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,780
and Dinosaur Park and so forth,

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,100
it's all being swallowed up by the devouring pinkness,

91
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,660
the clockwork orangutans.

92
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,840
Attention, pinks!

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,200
Incensate meat puppets!

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,060
If you can step away from your numbness

95
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,780
long enough to really look around you,

96
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,160
does what you see excite you?

97
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,460
Does it really give you slack?

98
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,900
Does it do anything for you but just prolong the numbness?

99
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,800
Oh, it's okay, you say.

100
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,980
Everything's okay.

101
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,120
In fact, I don't like things that are more than okay

102
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,520
because then that makes me think

103
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,720
there might be things that were less than okay.

104
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,460
As long as everything's okay, well, that's good enough.

105
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
You can't have your cake and eat it too, can you?

106
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,760
Don't make waves.

107
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,100
We're free enough.

108
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,240
We can indulge in all the properly ritualized bad behavior

109
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,680
like going to the lake and watching the game,

110
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,780
getting real drunk and beating our dogs and our wives,

111
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,100
but that's understood, you know, we all do that.

112
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,780
But now on the other hand, then, friends,

113
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,600
going to the lake and watching the game

114
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,280
and getting real drunk and launching golfer heads

115
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,040
while chanting and levitating,

116
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,720
naked, fropped to the gills,

117
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,420
performing acu-beatings with each other's spouses and dogs,

118
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
no way!

119
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,060
Uh-uh! No, no!

120
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,080
It's okay to sublimate.

121
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,300
Our sexual drives into things like despoiling the landscape

122
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,240
at the expense of health and self-awareness just for money

123
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,840
because the only thing that gives our tired, twisted, old nervous systems

124
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,120
any kind of a thrill is the thought that we can buy more things.

125
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,060
My friend, your body...

126
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,300
Just another thing to buy, my friends.

127
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,800
That is a thing to buy.

128
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,780
It's the thing to go by.

129
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,040
Your body keeps clocking in on the job,

130
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,940
functioning on not more than 10% of your life essence,

131
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,040
and the conspiracy gets the rest.

132
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,220
You moron.

133
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,920
They've got you thinking it's perfectly natural

134
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,280
to work for a living.

135
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,980
Now, what you want to do is real work.

136
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,520
There's nothing wrong with that, but what you have to do, that is slavery.

137
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,760
And no matter what they're paying,

138
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,800
you're working too cheap.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,900
We're not communists or anything, dear friends.

140
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,660
Bob Dobbs doesn't want everyone to be equally poor.

141
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,180
He wants everyone to be equally rich,

142
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,160
but without working!

143
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,960
Now, in the Middle Ages,

144
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,240
in the Middle Ages, they called it the obscene kiss.

145
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,760
Kissing Satan's bum was the way a warlock,

146
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,860
or a witch, was initiated.

147
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,660
Now, today we have corporate-style butt kissing,

148
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,580
bestowing that submissive kiss

149
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,480
upon the posterior of the chief executive devil.

150
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
The work ethic is Satanic!

151
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,140
That's the only thing that's Satanic in this whole crowd, I'll bet you.

152
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,180
It will be our doom, Mark Bobb's words.

153
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,660
Our little aquarium Earth is turning into a toxic,

154
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,460
toilet soul farm,

155
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,760
controlled by aliens and their stooges,

156
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,240
and day after day slips by.

157
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,900
Time that you could have invested in saving the universe with Bob,

158
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,580
but instead you sold it cheap to the conspiracy, like a sucker!

159
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,020
Stand still as we insert the probe.

160
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,100
You will not remember this.

161
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,140
Years out of your life, dear friends.

162
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,340
You will have no memory of this encounter.

163
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,880
They'll take years out,

164
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,840
and you'll have nothing to show for it,

165
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,880
but a lot of paid household bills.

166
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,460
You'll never get any of those years back.

167
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,900
You'll just get older and older,

168
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,980
and develop more chronic aches and pains and regrets,

169
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,820
and when you die, the conspirators will just say,

170
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,240
well, there's plenty more where that one came from.

171
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,420
Friends, it may be too late to stop being optimistic,

172
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,540
but it is never too late to start being bitterly, bitterly pessimistic.

173
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,720
Now you think about it.

174
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,500
Remember, things could be much, much worse.

175
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,700
That's the consolation, really.

176
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,640
That's what we're in it for.

177
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,860
You could suddenly, one minute from now,

178
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,140
be screaming in unimaginable pain,

179
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,360
trapped inside the white-hot, twisted metal,

180
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,680
and glass of wherever it is that you happen to be

181
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,440
when it happens.

182
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,860
Or you could, funny, ain't it?

183
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,380
Or you could be lying on parched ground

184
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,000
with bones so brittle from malnutrition

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,400
and a brain so ruined by disease

186
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,180
that all life for you has become that one little dry,

187
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,960
vermin-ridden grain of rice at the tip of your tongue.

188
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,900
Or you could be rich.

189
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,680
But afflicted, friends,

190
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,200
with something caused by your own lifestyle

191
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,920
that bites deeper and deeper into you,

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,220
but ever so slowly,

193
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,180
so that you never stop thinking about killing yourself.

194
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,620
Gosh, they'd be sorry then.

195
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,720
Or you could be so wrapped up in your job

196
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,700
that you haven't noticed that you've gone crazy,

197
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,780
and you've only been hypnotized into thinking that,

198
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,680
well, everything's basically okay.

199
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,000
But actually, there's starvation and misery all around you

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
that'll catch up with you sooner or later.

201
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,040
But...

202
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,640
Oh, but that hasn't happened yet,

203
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,620
so who cares?

204
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,140
Who cares?

205
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,540
As long as the power plants still run

206
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,480
and we can still televise yearly Earth Day rituals

207
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,620
when the liberals congratulate themselves for being liberals

208
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,340
and the conservatives congratulate themselves

209
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,200
for fooling the liberals another year,

210
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,460
and the ones in between are ground into dog food.

211
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,140
You'll love this new method Bob's come up with

212
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,660
for exterminating nine-tenths of the population at once.

213
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,120
You'll be able to drive a new Porsche every night

214
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,680
and crash it the next morning.

215
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,520
Because Bob has come to change all that,

216
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,660
to teach you acubating, time control, and memory editing.

217
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,720
To help you learn to pull the wool over your own eyes

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,820
and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

219
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,680
Hey brother,

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,300
beware

221
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,460
cause some of us

222
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,280
do care

223
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,920
and the world

224
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,560
may turn.

225
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,120
And the violence

226
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,980
in my head

227
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,260
is real.

228
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,100
Bam bam, just dance.

229
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,520
But the big brothers

230
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,220
got no parts

231
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,440
when I get my chance I'm gonna kick it up the...

232
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,560
Big brothers

233
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,200
got no parts

234
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,460
when I get my chance I'm gonna kick it up the...

235
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,740
Big brothers

236
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,640
got no parts

237
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,600
cause big brothers

238
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
got no hearts

239
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,720
when I get my chance I'm gonna kick it up the...

240
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,640
Big brothers

241
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,420
got no parts

242
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,940
when I get my chance I'm gonna kick it up the...

243
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,040
uh...

244
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,960
uh...

245
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:57,960
uh...

246
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,760
uh...

247
00:13:59,560 --> 00:13:59,600
parts.

248
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,420
Ox.

249
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,940
Oh, yeah, Hazel O'Connor has the right idea.

250
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,020
Ho, ho, ho.

251
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,720
Yeah, oh, I'm spinning plates on sticks here.

252
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,500
Let me cue up some nice ambiance for us.

253
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,360
Yes.

254
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,800
This should do it nicely.

255
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,460
Go ahead, hit it, babe.

256
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,680
Let's see what we've got here.

257
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,960
Oh, yeah.

258
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,580
Oh, that was close.

259
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,340
Oh, yeah.

260
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,660
That was real close.

261
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,520
Oh, it always helps to work with a little musical accompaniment.

262
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,400
Mm.

263
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,960
Oh, yeah, to work.

264
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,340
Oh, if only this were work.

265
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,080
Oh.

266
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,700
Oh, I could manage it if this were work.

267
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:17,420
Yeah, but the work ethic is yet enshrined in the hoary old pulp fiction Horatio Alger pedophilia operas

268
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:23,460
about grubby, apple-cheeked, oh-so-Caucasian immigrant street urchins

269
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:29,160
with just enough gumption and stick-to-itiveness to better their miserable lots

270
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,660
in the bright, shining, capitalistic new world.

271
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,160
Oh.

272
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:33,880
Oh.

273
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


274
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


275
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


276
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


277
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


278
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


279
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


280
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


281
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


282
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


283
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


284
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


285
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,660


286
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,500
Did you know that in the dozens of crappy, ground-out yarns

287
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,740
with titles like Ragged Dick, my personal favorite,

288
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,540
that not one of Alger's noble characters ever won fame in millions?

289
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,260
Not one stout lad ever got more than a doodly-squat nickel and dime raise

290
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,540
and, well, inflation and the Depression soon took care of that.

291
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,280
Oh, yeah, shoe-shining waifs becoming the captains of industry?

292
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,060
Ha!

293
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,240
The conspiracy don't work that way, Bo.

294
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,120
Ha!

295
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,700
Yeah.

296
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,480
Hey, the conspiracy hacks off your slack and then plays keep-away with it.

297
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:21,620
They tell you that life is supposed to be a bowl of steaming, black-buttered goat custard

298
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,600
with a handle on the inside.

299
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,540
Then I say, kick that bucket over on them and run!

300
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,980
Run for your life, for this is a life-and-living death matter!

301
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,920
Run!

302
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,160
Run!

303
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,640
Run!

304
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,760
Smithers!

305
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,260
Huh?

306
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
Turn on the surveillance monitors.

307
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,800
Yes, sir.

308
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,960
It's worse than I thought.

309
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,020
It's morning at night.

310
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,120
They trickle through the gate.

311
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,440
They go home early.

312
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,660
They go home early.

313
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:04,660


314
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,640
They come in late.

315
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,140
Reeking of cheap liquor, they stumble through the day.

316
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,420
Never give a thought to honest work for honest pay.

317
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,860
I know it shouldn't vex me.

318
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,820
I shouldn't take it hard.

319
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,100
I shouldn't know they're capering with a keenly disregard.

320
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,720
But look at all those idiots.

321
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,760
Oh, look at all those fools.

322
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,360
An office full of morons.

323
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,260
A factory full of fools.

324
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,820
Keep it in.

325
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,700
I wonder that I'm singing, singing the blues.

326
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,780
Yours is a heavy brown, sir.

327
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm just getting started.

328
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,540
They make personal phone calls on company time.

329
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,080
They Xerox their buttockses and guess who pays the dime?

330
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,580
Their blatant fever wounds me.

331
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,240
Their ingratitude is found.

332
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,040
I long to lure them to my home and then release the hounds.

333
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,940
I shouldn't grow unsettled when faced with such abuse.

334
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,800
That's the way I am.

335
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,660
I shouldn't let it plague me.

336
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,600
I shouldn't flow a fuse.

337
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,060
But look at all those idiots.

338
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,080
Oh, look at all those fools.

339
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,860
An office full of morons.

340
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,600
A factory full of fools.

341
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,900
Is it any wonder I'm singing, singing the blues?

342
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,660
What happened?

343
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,880
Where are the instruments?

344
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,080
I believe they call this a breakdown, sir.

345
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,780
I can't have any breakdowns, sir.

346
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:33,780


347
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:33,780


348
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:33,780


349
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:33,780


350
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,620
What if there was an inspector around?

351
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,080
Play a guitar solo.

352
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,240
I'm a little out of practice.

353
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,640
I said do it.

354
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,320
So do it, do it, do it.

355
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,340
Yes, sir.

356
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,240


357
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,940
Uh-huh.

358
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:48,940
.

359
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,180
Yes, excellent.

360
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,340
.

361
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,100
Well done.

362
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,240
And it's beginning to grate.

363
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,660
That will be sufficient, Smithers.

364
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,360
Excuse me?

365
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,320
I said that's enough.

366
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,660
Oh, sorry, sir.

367
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,720
Thought I had my mojo working.

368
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,080
That man by the cooler drinking water as if it's free.

369
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,060
Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir.

370
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,380
A drone from Sector 7G.

371
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,820
Yes, well, call this Simpson to my office and stay to watch the fun.

372
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,460
If he's six feet where he enters, he'll be two feet when I'm done.

373
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,220
It brings a ray of sunshine to my unfathomable home.

374
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm happy to make him kneel before me and slowly twist the knife.

375
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,160
.

376
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,560
Look at all those fools.

377
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,280
An office full of morons.

378
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,180
A factory full of fools.

379
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,480
Is it any wonder that I'm singing, singing the blues?

380
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,340
Take me home, sir.

381
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm trying.

382
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,660
I'm a cog in a wheel in a lubricated world and I want to marry an office girl.

383
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,980
I've got my pie on.

384
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,640
I've set my watch on, set my goals when I get on.

385
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,660
I want to be fat.

386
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,040
I've got my tie on.

387
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
It's a dream around my finger.

388
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,040
It's a noose around my neck.

389
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,500
I'll go to grass, take legs to prove I'm not a derelict.

390
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,640
I've got my time, so I'll be sure to hold my head up high.

391
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,840
I can't forget why I got out of bed even when the morning paper's red.

392
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,120
I've got my tie on.

393
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,480
I'm flying across the tile floor.

394
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,480
I've got my name on the office door.

395
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,880
I've got my tie on.

396
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,000
It's a dream around my finger.

397
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,760
It's a noose around my neck.

398
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,080
I'll go to grass, take legs to prove I'm not an idiot.

399
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,180
I've got my time, so I'll be sure to hold my head up high.

400
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,040
.

401
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,840
I've got my tie on.

402
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,580
.

403
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,260
.

404
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,260


405
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,540
.

406
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,440
.

407
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,320
.

408
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,360
.

409
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,980
.

410
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,100
.

411
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,540
.

412
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:27,920
.

413
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:27,940
.

414
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:27,980
.

415
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,100
.

416
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,240
.

417
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,800
It's a spring around my finger

418
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,600
It's a noose around my neck

419
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,440
I'll close a drastic lake

420
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,060
Prove I'm not a derelict

421
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,840
I've got my time

422
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,980
I'll be sure to shrink myself apart

423
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,660
Oh, oh

424
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,540
Oh, Lincolns

425
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,580
Thank you

426
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,220
Oh, thank you for bailing

427
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,200
my sorry buns out

428
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,180
Oh, yeah

429
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,700
Well, you know I told you

430
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,120
about that job I have

431
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,420
Well, there comes a time

432
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
when the conspiracy

433
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,800
has you in such a tight grip

434
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,500
that your eyes bug out

435
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,480
like a John Crispo Lucy effect

436
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,160
and you realize

437
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,980
that at that moment

438
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,440
give me slack

439
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,820
or kill me

440
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,780
means so much

441
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,200
Oh, oh

442
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,200


443
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,740
Oh, the pure crystalline truth

444
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,380
that one statement

445
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,120
There at the time

446
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,900
when you despair

447
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,340
of ever getting

448
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,600
that cosmic donut of slack

449
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,440
within your desperate reach

450
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,140
Oh, that moment

451
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,320
when you rail to the unfeeling skies

452
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,060
Isn't there anyone in this town

453
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,380
who hates me enough

454
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,920
to kill me?

455
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:01,880
Oh

456
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,820
Oh

457
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,060
Oh, but

458
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,780
no, Circe's comes

459
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,140
Oh, no, that would be too easy

460
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,720
And you know how the conspiracy

461
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,620
hates a quitter

462
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,500
But the end never comes

463
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,560
Just more episodes

464
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,060
in this endless progression

465
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,140
of crap

466
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,420
down the peristaltic

467
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,080
tube of life

468
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,220
And there's nothing

469
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,040
you can do

470
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,820
but roll the punches

471
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,080
and wish you had the nerve

472
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
to make your own

473
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,200
quietus

474
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,200
Oh, Bob!

475
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,940
Bob!

476
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,560
Has thou forsaken me?

477
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,200
Bob!

482
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,800
Now, what do we say every morning

483
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,020
on our way to work?

484
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,520
Every morning, when I get up,

485
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,980
I look into the mirror

486
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,100
And what do I say about that?

487
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:43,840
face i see you're a winner you're a winner you're a winner i can't hear you look into that rear view

488
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,340
mirror and say it again okay you're a winner you're a winner you're a winner

489
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
i'm a winner

490
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:02,440
under bob so to speak you can learn to masturbate without going blind

491
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:13,360
you can learn yes you can learn to perform astral sex with anyone you meet

492
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,380
oh but it's not pornography ma'am officer it's empowerment

493
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,380
that's right you can learn to live with your sins dear friends because

494
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,100
well that old bob bob he looks kind of limp now bob is a sex god

495
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,980
and and

496
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,620
you know, he has come and come again and again and again, as the old joke says, to rationalize

497
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,500
your sins. He is not so well connected that he's going to die for your sins. Even if he did,

498
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,400
it wouldn't do you any good. He's not going to forgive your sins because he doesn't think

499
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:56,120
there's anything you need to be forgiven for. He, Bob comes again and again to justify,

500
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,720
to rationalize your sins and to bring to you, dear friends, what you need far more than forgiveness

501
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:09,900
to bring an excuse on sale at our dealer's table after the show.

502
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:20,140
It's a purer, a purer squirt or ooze, my friend, than drugs, the Bible, or even television.

503
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:27,340
And the sweetest thing about all this, I think, the most understanding part of Bob's teaching is,

504
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,080
you know, and I know this is going to mean something to some of you out there,

505
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,700
you could,

506
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:37,200
you can be a virgin or an atheist and Bob will still let you be a subgenius.

507
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:45,340
Moses parted the Red Sea, Oppenheimer split the atom, but Bob cut the crap.

508
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,440
Take two was better. If man had been meant to feel guilt, as Papa Joe Mama said,

509
00:26:52,700 --> 00:27:00,900
he would not have been born with a Bob. God is everywhere, but J.R. Bob Dobbs has already been

510
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,340
everywhere.

511
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,540
He's not going anywhere else. And he does, in fact, bring slack that state in which you need nothing

512
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:12,980
because you have it already. And he brings slack without guilt because you will pay for it with no

513
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,000
strings attached. This is the first industrial church, friends. We're here to let the customer

514
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,640
decide what it needs in a religion. Not only that, but it's the first industrial church.

515
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:31,460
Bob Dobbs has actually paid all his taxes, and that means all the other religions still,

516
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,700
and come 1998, when we take power, they'll be paying up.

517
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:47,160
That is why they hate us, friends. Because it exploits women and men and how they love it.

518
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:55,420
So, well, my, my, let's see, what time is it? Two o'clock. Well, we've done about one hour of radio.

519
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,620
Should we on site take two or? Great. Well,

520
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,940
we're going to do it.

521
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,860
Oh, this is the organized part.

522
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,520
Yes, of course. This is the part that we secretly planned for years, actually.

523
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:17,560
We have a place for you, no matter what your background, no matter what your age, no matter

524
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:24,440
how simple your needs or how big your dreams. People have always been our most important

525
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,940
product.

526
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,400
People have always been our most important product.

527
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,780
We have a place for you, dear friends, here at the Church of the Subgenius. And because of that,

528
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:42,500
I probably should tell you just what people, quote, people, unquote, you've been listening to.

529
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:51,740
And starting from the top, a good place to start, I guess, would be that remember, we're all sitting

530
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:59,300
together listening to this. It's by Silica Gel. Then you heard Dr. Philo Drummond and myself

531
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:09,040
griping about our wives and radio shows. The long work rant by yours truly, Reverend

532
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Ivan Stang there, was, well, I was preaching from the new subgenius book due out in November,

533
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:29,140
Revelation X, at the Starwood Devival. It's a big pagan camp out they have up in New York.

534
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:37,920
Sponsored by Ace. And being helped out there by the good Reverend Blipo Abernathy.

535
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:49,500
And then, luckily for me, Susie the Floozy, our good friend who has a subgenius show on Noble WREK

536
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:59,040
in Atlanta, happened to do an anti-work show herself. And on that she played and we used the song

537
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,280
Black Death.

538
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:09,660
The Big Brother by Hazel O'Connor. The Simpsons sing the blues song called Look at Those Idiots.

539
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:20,040
Susie's little brother, whose band the Pink Lincolns, did that song I've Got My Tie On.

540
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:26,520
And the good Reverend Susie the Floozy herself, of course, delivered that beautiful despair rant.

541
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,280
That followed by a little bit more about Aspen.

542
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,480
And then, of course, Astral Sex from the Starwood Devival.

543
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:41,720
And oh, and Susie had her own little media barrage, a tape collage edit in there, which she calls her Slack Suite.

544
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:48,740
Now, we will be sweet and go to side two of show.

545
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:58,740
I believe that we'll go back to playing some more of Dr. Howell from his KPFA Berklee show with Puzzling Evidence.

546
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:07,760
And if we have time, we'll get to the legendary new recording I just got in of

547
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,660
... our planet into some of the familiar configurations we see today.

548
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:24,740
A piece of galactic debris in the shape of an enormous six-legged lizard once landed on the Earth and quickly crawled across its surface like a centipede landing on a peach.

549
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,740
But it created enormous destruction.

550
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:41,140
And the extinction of many species created tidal waves and giant sweeping walls of earth and rock, which buried entire countries and submerged continents.

551
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,200
Finally, it hopped off into space again.

552
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:57,720
But it might return at any time and destroy the world of questing man who does not realize by how thin a thread he hangs before that deadly wall.

553
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:12,960
And it's a game of cosmic bingo that we all are forced willy-nilly, inadvertently to play.

554
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,040
And one never knows when one's number will pop up.

555
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,160
So beware, you never know when the master cometh, as it says in the old moldy book.

556
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,700
Well, you've been very patient listening to this.

557
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:27,700


558
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:27,700


559
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:27,700


560
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:27,700


561
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,780
Oh, the, oh, listening to the, uh, uh, oh, I better get that one.

562
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,180
That seems like a high priority, uh...

563
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,560
Below 20 degrees, limbs will...

564
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,100
That's the plan of the bone.

565
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,680
Below zero, lungs will burn.

566
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,520
We're having a little bit of decompression here in the radio cubicle.

567
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,300
It might be a breach in our hull, or it might be that...

568
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:52,960
The breathing field is stuck.

569
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,680
It just might be puzzling evidence messing with our heads again, you know.

570
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,620
It could be perfectly all right.

571
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,820
You never know until it would be too late in this case.

572
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,460
...the breathing is...

573
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,680
...and 90 degrees...

574
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:15,340
You know, as we broadcast, and as I attempt, as always, to swim upstream against the sluggish tide of sludge,

575
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,960
the, uh, the compilers are working on the book of the subgenius volume two,

576
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,680
Bob Apocryphon, Revelation X, uh, and Ivan Stang,

577
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,560
and lies are...

578
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:33,820
are stirring up, uh, some, uh, trouble in their giant, uh, cauldron.

579
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,200
Oh, oh, well, I'm being drowned out by a piece of propaganda here, uh,

580
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
beamed from our central office.

581
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,220
...in a state of worry-free...

582
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,880
What the hell is going on?

583
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,460
...since the game...

584
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,220
...is done yet?

585
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,580
...please...

586
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,960
Perhaps some of you might wonder why I delve so frequently into eschatology.

587
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,500
Into the study of the beginnings of all things.

588
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,620
Yeah...

589
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
What about that?

590
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,700
Well, uh, are you dissatisfied to think of the early times?

591
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,000
One crown, centilla, Spanish for diamonds...

592
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,500
Uh, it would get me...

593
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:19,160
Perhaps you'd be interested in taking my award-winning source in financial accountability and real estate.

594
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,720
...the ratting of diamonds...

595
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,440
I fear your golden slow...

596
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,940
...of ignorance...

597
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,580
...the voice of rage and ruler's frontiers...

598
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,320
...the ratting of diamonds...

599
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,560
...the ratting of diamonds...

600
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,160
...the ratting of diamonds...

601
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,260
...the ratting of diamonds...

602
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,960
Uh-oh, aliens?

603
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:37,720
...as many as seven out of ten zillionaires in the United States made most of their money in real estate.

604
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,260
In successful investing in money management, you'll discover the smartest ways to use real estate in today's market to build your wealth.

605
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,900
...continued operation may damage the system...

606
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,200
...you'll learn how you can...

607
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,440
...you'll learn how you can...

608
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,700
...reap annualized returns of 50% a year or more on raw land investments...

609
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,900
...and a small fortune by investigating loans secured by mortgages or trust deeds.

610
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,580
Why do you think they call it land anyway? You know?

611
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,280
Because that's where you land on. And if you follow my course in real estate, you'll land on your feet.

612
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,800
And you'll land on your feet and run with the ball.

613
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,620
You'll run with the ball as you find the right mortgage for you.

614
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:27,840
And you'll be given a check list for evaluating any property that interests you.

615
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,180
Now, if you want to generate some rental income, you'll discover in my course on page 56...

616
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:43,080
...how to select the best type of income properties and how to screen for undesirable tenants and weirdos.

617
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,640
Keep them out of your houses.

618
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,960
Not cause trouble. Not damage the property.

619
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,780
Take good care of your investment.

620
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,520
No children. No pets.

621
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,360
That's right.

622
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,260
Even when I want to use the bathroom.

623
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:55,840
So much has been happening.

624
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,360
No.

625
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,020
So many strange things.

626
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:03,080
But perhaps you wouldn't be interested in retaining this, uh, rental property.

627
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,140
In that case, you might want to sell.

628
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:12,800
And on page 74 of my award-winning book, you'll know eight smart ways to get more potential buyers to make an offer on your house...

629
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,080
...even in a downwardly spiraling, doomed real estate market.

630
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,880
Wait, wait, wait. What award did it win?

631
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,500
Well, it won the subgenius...

632
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,760
...of the U.S. Award for Excellence in Hollywood.

633
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,100
Okay. All right.

634
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,360
But the most important investment principle you'll ever learn from me is...

635
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,640
...the one I've already shared with you.

636
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,440
That the egg came before the chicken.

637
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:49,520
And that God formed the embryos of all creatures out of an embryo which looked a little bit like you.

638
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,820
Me?

639
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,660
Like you.

640
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,280
An embryo.

641
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,640
I'm a scientist.

642
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,420
I'm a friend.

643
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,040
To dream from the impossible dream.

644
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,520
To fight the unfightable fight.

645
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,560
To eat the uneatable dinner.

646
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,500
To live and write the unwriteable right.

647
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,680
To drink the un-drinkable drink.

648
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,580
To eat the inedible food.

649
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,560
To wear the unwearable clothing.

650
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,720
When you'd rather be decently nude.

651
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,400
Oh, this is my 12th...

652
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,060
That's another award.

653
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,380
Fido.

654
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:47,460
Fido.

655
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,420
Yeah.

656
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,120
Oh.

657
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,800
Begin.

658
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,620
You gotta kiss a lot of ass, I bet.

659
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,060
Well, after a while, you don't make it.

660
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,160
You think I don't have to kiss ass?

661
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,200
Four dollars an hour?

662
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,540
The foreman? The shop steward?

663
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,080
The guy on a night shift who'd owned my purse and that?

664
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:26,740
It's important you say, I am never going back again.

665
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,880
I'm tired.

666
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,900
I'm never gonna look in a patient's mouth again.

667
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm never gonna have someone tell me I'm not doing a good job again.

668
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,960
My boss is never gonna insult me again.

669
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,620
My wife will never have to run in that file room with that turkey chasing her around again.

670
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,500
Dad!

671
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:43,520
Hey!

672
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,940
Quit your job!

673
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,920
Slap them!

674
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,580
Yes!

675
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,400
Yes, Bob!

676
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,120
I'm going to quit my job!

677
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm going to quit my job!

678
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,280
Oh, I'm going to quit my job, yes.

679
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,780
Oh, God, it feels so good.

680
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,960
Oh, I haven't slept a word for...

681
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,280
I don't think for weeks.

682
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,020
Oh, yes.

683
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,560
Yes, I'm going to quit this job.

684
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,340
Oh, bless you, Bob.

685
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,540
Oh, my teeth are vibrating.

686
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,780
Oh, yes.

687
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,840
Oh, yes.

688
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:31,600
Oh, yes, that was me on my way to quit my job the other day.

689
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,940
Oh, and I happened to pop a tape in the tape deck.

690
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,440
And guess what it was?

691
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,380
Oh.

692
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,080
It was our beloved Reverend telling me, yes, I was doing the right thing.

693
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:55,040
It's so nice to get justification in your slackness from your religious leaders.

694
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,200
Oh.

695
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,540
Yeah, I'm going to a farm.

696
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


697
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


698
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


699
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


700
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


701
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


702
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


703
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


704
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


705
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


706
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,400
I'm going to a far, far better place.

707
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,220
A place where there's always room for slack.

708
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:25,880
Where no one uses words like initiative or incentive.

709
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,700
Incentive?

710
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:34,560
How's the threat of a high colonic delivered by the stark fist of removal for incentive, buddy?

711
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:40,140
Yeah, my incentive plan can beat the living crap out of your incentive plan.

712
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,500
Oh, yeah, I'm not on the outside looking in.

713
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,960
I'm facing the other direction now because I'm mooning them.

714
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,600
I'm serving warning to the pinks.

715
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,480
The bitch is definitely oh so back.

716
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:59,040
And I'm tired of carrot and stick thinking, I want something for nothing for a change.

717
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,940
I want a good deal.

718
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,520
Oh, and Bob is the man who can get it for me.

719
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,300
Oh, yes.

720
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,920
Mmm.

721
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:23,600
Oh, it feels so nice to be in the ranks of the unemployed.

722
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,960
Oh, I'd started to lose the disrespect of my friends.

723
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,920
Oh, but yeah, it's time for a good deal for the flu.

724
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,360
And hey, it's time for a good deal for our listeners.

725
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,580
Now, don't jump the gun now, you premature dialing finger types.

726
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,880
Yeah, you'll have to answer a question.

727
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,680
We've got a free ticket here.

728
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,200
A set of tickets.

729
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:02,760
One lucky caller will receive two three-day memberships to this upcoming Dragon Con.

730
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,320
June 15th through 17th at the Atlanta Hilton and Towers.

731
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,080
Where they'll get to see up close and oh so personal.

732
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,140
The luminaries of the dark subgenius sky.

733
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,720
Wallowing, venting, spewing.

734
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,060
Yeah, that's us.

735
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,560
Oh, the hickening.

736
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,060
That's right.

737
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,600
The sickening.

738
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:31,980
However, that, as you may have guessed, that particular broadcast there by Reverend Susie the Floozy was quite a while back.

739
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,120
But she is talking about the Dragon Con subgenius devival.

740
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,420
Which was indeed a superb...

741
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,780
I don't know quite what to call it.

742
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:52,120
But I'm going to go to a recording from the musical performance at that convention.

743
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,040
By the Swinging Love Corpses.

744
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:06,100
That great old timey band that Dr. Philodrummond and his brother Sphinx and his cousin Ray started up.

745
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,920
And after he left Dallas.

746
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:15,320
After he helped Bob get the Subgenius Foundation started and hired me.

747
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,460
So let's go now to that live tape of this...

748
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:30,940
This is rather a different listen to of that band, the Swinging Love Corpses.

749
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,220
And they're doing their infamous Led Zeppelin medley.

750
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,580
Yes, it really is a Led Zeppelin medley.

751
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,420
But not...

752
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,400
Possibly not quite what you're used to.

753
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,500
So let's just check it out here, shall we?

754
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,620
What do you really want to hear?

755
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,060
Huh?

756
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,360
Dreamweaver?

757
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,440
How about some Jimi Hendrix?

758
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:28,260
It wasn't a Jimi Hendrix?

759
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:28,260


760
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:28,260


761
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,600
Are you playing Blood Unchained.

762
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:30,660


763
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,940
Is it one of the recordings?

764
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:32,720
I don't know.

765
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,060
I'veviewerend it one time and then it minute.

766
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,060


767
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,380
Okay, thank you.

768
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,540
Now what do you want to hear?

769
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,060
What do you want to hear?

770
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,560
How about some more Led Zeppelin?

771
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:02,880
Okay.

772
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,800
I want the Beatles.

773
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,940
Okay, thank you.

774
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,180
Thank you very much.

775
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,220
Jimi Hendrix.

776
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,820
Oh, bring it on!

777
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,660
Watch the head!

778
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,180
Watch the head!

779
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,920
Get these goons out of here!

780
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,100
Watch the head!

781
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,120
The security in this place sucks.

782
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,980
The show's over.

783
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,040
Okay.

784
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,020
Get these goons out of here.

785
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,880
How much money you got?

786
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,740
How can we play your favorite Led Zeppelin tunes

787
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,240
with goons on stage?

788
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,700
Okay, this is our Led Zeppelin medley for the evening.

789
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,920
And I don't know the words to these songs.

790
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,120
Really.

791
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:41,660
Really.

792
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,820
Just the other day, baby

793
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,600
What do you think I saw?

794
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,240
Okay, thank you, thank you.

795
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,000
Hey!

796
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,700
The hits just keep on coming.

797
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:02,780
Hey!

798
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,640
Hey!

799
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,040
Hey!

800
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


801
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


802
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


803
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


804
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


805
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


806
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


807
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


808
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


809
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


810
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


811
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


812
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,040


813
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,260
Leave me alone!

814
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,680
I've made your life such a heatclub!

815
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


816
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


817
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


818
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


819
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


820
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


821
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


822
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


823
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


824
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


825
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


826
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


827
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


828
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


829
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


830
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


831
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


832
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


833
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,680


834
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:11,980
Ahhhh!

835
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:20,260
Oh, spécial!

836
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:20,440
Your extent here?

837
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:20,440


838
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:20,440


839
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:20,440


840
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,180
Everything's going to be all right.

841
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:36,240
Beautiful.

842
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,720
Yeah.

843
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,640
Come to think of it, they're just lovely.

844
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,840
I mean, but that's all.

845
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,580
There's the Moronix Walkery,

846
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,500
one of the most unusual dinosaurs ever discovered.

847
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,520
With its gigantic primary digit,

848
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,920
it flips a finny meal up into its crocodile-like jaws.

849
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,040
This is a very suspenseful moment.

850
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,600
And close behind it, crawling over the land,

851
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,520
comes a giant crab.

852
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,880
Oh, he's so cute.

853
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,700
Just look at its tiny eyes darting about on stalks

854
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,200
while it clicks its gigantic claws.

855
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,200
Oh, I thought he was cute, but he's got me.

856
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,200
Go with the flow.

857
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,540
And there he goes, pulling the collar off

858
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,580
as he walks sideways.

859
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,400
Just go with him.

860
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,280
I'm sure you'll find out what it's all about.

861
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,880
Oh dear, I cut off his wind, it looks like.

862
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,220
You must admit, this is a very impressive crab,

863
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,820
and if you've gotta go some way,

864
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,020
you might as well go in an unusual way.

865
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

866
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

867
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,740
Kinda reminds me of that old movie,

868
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,620
Attack of the Crab Monsters, you know?

869
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,820
Damn you, crab!

870
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,020
Whoa!

871
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,920
Some people have lots of them,

872
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,100
but this just shows what one big one can do.

873
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:19,400


874
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,120
Whoa!

875
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:21,700


876
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,040
Whoa!

877
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,420
Whoa!

878
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,120
Whoa!

879
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,520
Gosh, that collar is battling for his very life

880
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,540
with this giant crab.

881
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,700
Who says this is a boring program?

882
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,480
Whoa!

883
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,020
Whoa!

884
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:33,180


885
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,220
Go with the air, you crab!

886
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:48,580
Yes, it's Jack Crab, the world's oldest living kettle of fish.

887
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,820
I mean, cuddle fish.

888
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,220
I mean, you know, shellfish.

889
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,360
Don't be selfish.

890
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,500
Kick back!

891
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,640
Kick back!

892
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,460
Ah!

893
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,520
Ah!

894
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,540
Oh, you're making him mad now.

895
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,360
Oh!

896
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,500
Oh, god!

897
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,160
Oh!

898
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:04,920
Oh!

899
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,240
Oh!

900
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:05,720


901
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,440
Oh!

902
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:06,600
Oh!

903
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,420
Oh, there, a little calypso crab.

904
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,140
Ah, see?

905
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,200
Look at him go around and around, he's happy.

906
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,400
And so should you be, having escaped that big one.

907
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,760
Yeah, I know, that was a rough one.

908
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,880
See how exciting your life can be?

909
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,620
Now, I'll tell you why you really can become a millionaire.

910
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,000
Not with a get-rich-quick scheme,

911
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,880
but with a simple, sensible, realistic plan

912
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,420
for achieving financial independence before X Day.

913
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,620
Just, uh, get rid of the crabs.

914
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,420
Yes, get rid of the crabs in your life

915
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:41,300
that are pinching your chances for financial forwardness.

916
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,460
That's right.

917
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
The hard shells of those shellfish

918
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,660
can easily be cracked, and you can savor the delicious meat

919
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,660
in the joint as you advance to new levels

920
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,380
of financial firmness.

921
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,560
Are you millionaire material?

922
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,060
Perhaps you'll be interested in taking my simple quiz

923
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,160
and finding out.

924
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:07,300
Then, during the next 12 months, your net worth will increase

925
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,980
from $75,000 to $80,000.

926
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,040
I don't have a net worth.

927
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,740
Well, you need a net to catch those megalo crabs

928
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,040
by the ocean's side.

929
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,100
You will learn at your own pace as you

930
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,740
live in our tropical retreat, Dining on Crab and Lobster.

931
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,680
Successful investing and money management

932
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:33,160
will help you, because you are a busy adult who already has a job.

933
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,160


934
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,360
And can devote only a small amount of time each week

935
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,720
to mastering the principles of successful investing.

936
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,840
Aren't crabs just big insects anyway?

937
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,040
Big what?

938
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,560
Insects.

939
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,200
Well, not exactly.

940
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,500
No, they are a sort of aquatic arthropod.

941
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,780
They're more like spiders than insects,

942
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,520
but in any case, they are an aquatic order.

943
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,580
But if it's interest in insect eating that you have,

944
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,140
I refer you to page 5.5.

945
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,020
I've got a page 5.5.5 of my award-winning book,

946
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,640
Insect Dinners as a Shortcut to Success.

947
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:15,160
How the Big Boss Can Be Softened by a Meal of Locusts and Honey,

948
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,760
So You Can Make That Big Killing in the Stock Market.

949
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,660
Just imagine an easy way to increase the value of your estate

950
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,400
by $100,000 or more in a single day,

951
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,120
with almost no significant change in your current cash position.

952
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:33,120


953
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,420
But you're wondering how you can do it.

954
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,260
Well, joining my real estate carnival,

955
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,820
you'll be able to do it as you swing around and around

956
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,920
and go up to the sky in the Ferris wheel.

957
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,160
Don't eat too much cotton candy in the investment booth.

958
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,020
Oh dear, a tragedy occurred.

959
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,840
You know, this machinery is 100% safe,

960
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,120
but there are some individuals who will mind,

961
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,120


962
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,340
and they will not keep their hands and legs inside the cars.

963
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:11,540
And so I'm afraid we'll remove that loser.

964
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,380
You know, some people have to go to the wall

965
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,300
so that others can reap the value of a course of financial investment.

966
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,240
Now at the very least, you must be open to the possibility

967
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,160
of becoming a godzillionaire.

968
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,020
Never set a limit on what you can achieve.

969
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,980
You'll see why it can be so exciting to put a zillion dollar gold

970
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:33,120
in your pocket.

971
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:33,640
You'll see why it can be so valuable in your life.

972
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,360
You need a simple, reliable, day-by-day plan,

973
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,680
not a fly-by-night, get-rich-quick scheme

974
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,820
for Dobbs-approved reality.

975
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,360
Now you'll discover such a plan,

976
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,080
which I call Dr. Howell's Successful Investing in Money Management.

977
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:54,640
It's already taught thousands of eager beaver yuppies

978
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,740
how to achieve financial goals.

979
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,900
You'll hear many of their stories.

980
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,900
Perhaps, like you, they began with skepticism

981
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,440
but are now well on their way to complete financial happiness

982
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,720
and orgasmic pleasure.

983
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,200
They are happy.

984
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,400
So have one of these bourbon and bong waters

985
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,640
or you can have a hot buttered rum martini like I am

986
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,540
and pretty soon we're going to go up on the balcony

987
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,560
and toast Benito Mussolini in a warm,

988
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,660
uh, glass of grog while all the rest of the little, uh,

989
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,320
serfs and peons labor down there in the office.

990
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,460
You know, the CEO doesn't have to push buttons

991
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:44,100
and staple staples like the Ahoy, uh, Palloy, uh, you know, uh...

992
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,620
Oh, yeah, we're looking for people who are interested

993
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:51,500
in sharing what's left of their thought patterns

994
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,740
with the mass mutations of upcoming Dragon Con.

995
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,660
So give us a call a little later.

996
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,120
The Reverend Microphone and I sure would like to hear from you.

997
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,880
We'll be doing the usual deep lobe scanning procedures

998
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,000
to weed out spies, so pink boys need not apply.

999
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:17,680
Just call us at 894-246-8968 tonight until 2 a.m.

1000
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,660
Or send a cassette of your spewin' and ventin'

1001
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:26,040
to Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

1002
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,960
Hey, you know enough to have your pencil ready, don't you?

1003
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,960
It's Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

1004
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,780
Care of W-R-E-K, Atlanta.

1005
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:55,020
165 8th Street, Northwest.

1006
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,340
Atlanta, Georgia.

1007
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,200
30332.

1008
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,560
0630.

1009
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,760
Oh, yeah, cause we'd like to hear your particular specialty.

1010
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,940
And I'm sure you'd like to wag your weirdness.

1011
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,740
Take it from me, it's so therapeutic.

1012
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:26,780
Ah.

1013
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:31,580
Ah, it's like a cerebral brain douche.

1014
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:44,080
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1015
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,560
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1016
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,500
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1017
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:59,480
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1018
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:07,280
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1019
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,440
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1020
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:20,120
So here at Oktoberfest, we treat our tired executives

1021
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,120
to a little treat.

1022
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,380
A little bit of sour brotten, a lederhosen,

1023
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,120
and a big stein of Liebfrau milk.

1024
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,620
Helga, get over there and unsnap for these gents.

1025
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,060
Perhaps this would be a time to retire from the field, as it were,

1026
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:46,780
and stoke up on the fires of money management

1027
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,060
and real estate planning.

1028
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,420
You want me dead?

1029
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:59,140
I want you alive and making money hand over fist over foot.

1030
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,400
Hand over fist.

1031
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,540
Hand over that fist and I'll show you how you can use it

1032
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,600
to make thousands and thousands of dollars

1033
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,940
while you sit on the toilet at home.

1034
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,780
All right, okay, hold on, let me get this faster.

1035
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,120
It's all a part of what I call the possible dream,

1036
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,420
Dr. Howell's amazing course in sex and real estate.

1037
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,160
Okay, I'm on the toilet.

1038
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,080
My dear fellow, you're taking me a little bit too literally.

1039
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,400
I don't need to see this.

1040
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,120
Cover up, for God's sake.

1041
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,360
That's a repulsive cycle.

1042
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,560
Now, don't do that.

1043
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,780
You're making me nervous.

1044
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,840
And above all, don't place a limitation on your own future.

1045
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:50,420
You know, my real estate course is merely a course to some people,

1046
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:50,940
an article.

1047
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,480
It's a course to make money.

1048
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:52,480


1049
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:52,480


1050
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:52,480


1051
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:52,480


1052
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,540
It's just another item of information to be tossed away.

1053
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,980
These short-sighted bobbies simply cannot see the great opportunity

1054
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:03,920
that lies before them in such a unique program as our show.

1055
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,860
You see, you should always bend over and with a cheerful grunt

1056
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,040
to pick up any dime that you find before you.

1057
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,520
And with a pocket full of these, you'll soon have a dollar.

1058
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:22,020
And, well, this dollar can be the first step

1059
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,100
in a series of stepping stones to high-stepping success.

1060
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:27,840
I don't want to see this.

1061
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,660
Soon you'll be goose-stepping over the bodies of the poor and decrepit

1062
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,120
as you march your way...

1063
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:33,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

1064
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,160
I was a little bit too exuberant there.

1065
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,400
These folks are going to have to go to the wall,

1066
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,960
but then that is necessary for you to achieve...

1067
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,780
I insist on seeing.

1068
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,060
True wealth and power, such as I, Dr. Howell Weald,

1069
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,340
in my giant mansion,

1070
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,840
with my fleet of expensive automobiles

1071
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,460
and terrified, cowering servants.

1072
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,460
And you can be like me

1073
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,240
and splash in my giant warm water pool

1074
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,300
with a bevy of idiots.

1075
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:05,980
What?

1076
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,460
It's all possible.

1077
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,820
Just grasp the brass ring.

1078
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,080
And with my robotized investment counselors,

1079
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,460
I need not lift a pencil to scratch my giant,

1080
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:22,460


1081
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:22,460


1082
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:22,460


1083
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:22,460


1084
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,180
but to use the power of John Hancock on a single document

1085
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:29,120
to get Rich's creases by 12 p.m. daily.

1086
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,360
Well, it's sensational. It's just no good.

1087
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,040
The most sophisticated robot on planet Earth.

1088
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,480
Yes, this giant robot will answer all your questions.

1089
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,540
And once you become a member of my real estate seminar,

1090
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,880
this robot will teach you

1091
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,780
how even a nonhuman can achieve financial parity

1092
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,480
in today's collapsing money market.

1093
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,260
Oh, that's a terrible example of a collapse right there,

1094
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:55,920
ladies and gentlemen.

1095
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,040
If you had been standing underneath

1096
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,800
that portion of Wall Street's finest,

1097
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,160
you would have been flattened

1098
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,000
to like these unfortunate adventures here.

1099
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,520
Oh, terrible. Terrible.

1100
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,760
Well, when you get up there on the radio,

1101
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,100
you have to do is to say the whole thing to frame up.

1102
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,840
How would you like to know how to borrow money

1103
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
at only 6% or 7%

1104
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,280
and invest it at higher rates?

1105
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,600
I'll give you $5,000 just to get up on the radio.

1106
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,460
$5,000 is a great way to get up on the radio.

1107
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,240
It's a painless way to knock down

1108
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,020
the interest rate you're paying on your bills.

1109
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,440
We'll show you where you can find,

1110
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,640
with your $5,000,

1111
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,200
medical insurance for some of your family.

1112
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,640
And you can invest so that the income

1113
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,060
from your investments one day

1114
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,840
surpasses the income from your job.

1115
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,740
Oh, I better get that.

1116
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,860
Meanwhile, you have some of these canapes

1117
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:41,860
and a hot butter drum...
