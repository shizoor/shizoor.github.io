1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,180
Like to drop by the fantastic bag. Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:16,940
Brady, Bob, Gold, and Connie drag. Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,960
Ah, yes, dear friends. Because we're in the middle of a cross-country trip,

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:35,800
using the iVan as a recording studio, this hour of slack, number 1,311, will actually be a glorious

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,600
rerun of one of the greatest episodes of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse from WREK Atlanta,

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:52,300
Reverend Susie the Flusie's incredible apocalypse special. Prepare to have everything blown.

7
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,940
Susie the Flusie.

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,000
Susie's amazing collage should get believers all pumped up for X-Day, July 5th, when everyone else

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,320
will be destroyed, along with every other thing on earth that subgeniuses don't keep for their

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:14,880
collections. Speaking of which, I personally have dibs on Wisteria, the campground in southern Ohio,

11
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:21,740
where both X-Day and Starwood are now held. In fact, we just stayed at Wisteria,

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,920
Wisteria.org.

13
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:32,320
By the way, to finalize plans for our July 5th weekend festival and subgenius mating event.

14
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:40,780
And it all looks as great as Susie's X-Day special show sounds as heard here. Praise Bob.

15
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,480
I just want to start a flame in your heart.

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:15,380
Oh, in my heart, I have but one desire.

17
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,460
And that one is you.

18
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,880
No other will do.

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:41,080
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim. I just want to be the one you love.

20
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:52,240
And with your admission that you feel the same, I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of.

21
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,220
Believe.

22
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,380
Believe me.

23
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,720
I don't want to set the world on fire.

24
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:12,580
I just want to start a flame in your heart.

25
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,940
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim.

26
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
I just want to be the one you love.

27
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:37,980
And with your admission that you feel the same, I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of.

28
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Believe me.

29
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,940
I don't want to set the world on fire.

30
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,900
I just want to start a flame in your heart.

31
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:53,900


32
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:53,900


33
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:53,900


34
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:53,900


35
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:53,900


36
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:53,900


37
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,780
A flame in your home

38
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,700
Oh, no.

39
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,800
Help us.

40
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,560
Help us now.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,600
No.

42
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,340
No.

43
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,500
Tomstown.

44
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,640
Crap.

45
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,700
I'm still in Tomstown.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,860
How is this world never going to end?

47
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,400
I want my apocalypse now.

48
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,480
This old earth ain't gonna stop rolling.

49
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,400
No.

50
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,600
Round the sun, boy.

51
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,320
This old earth ain't gonna stop rolling.

52
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:49,840
No.

53
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,380
Just because you're gone, boy.

54
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,680
Oh.

55
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,920
All the winds are gonna keep on blowing.

56
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,660
Rivers gonna keep on flowing.

57
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,480
Grass is gonna keep on growing, too.

58
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,020
And I'll be loving someone new.

59
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,680
This old earth ain't gonna stop rolling.

60
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,520
No.

61
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,960
Through the sky, boy.

62
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,440
This old earth ain't gonna stop rolling.

63
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,040
No.

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,480
Or just say goodbye, boy.

65
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,120
All the birds are gonna keep on singing.

66
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,880
No.

67
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:23,880


68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,620
The bells are gonna keep on ringing.

69
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,600
The love is gonna keep on swinging, too.

70
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,120
And I'll be loving someone new.

71
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,840
The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth.

72
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,640
Hear this.

73
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,160
You are to command the forces that pop up.

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
No one must survive.

75
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,600
That's the farthest it's done the boat since Betty.

76
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,860
The love must survive.

77
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,340
The love must be mad for sure this morning.

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,100
I wonder where Eddie's pitching them.

79
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,060
Every one of them is bound for the earth.

80
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,920
You mean that little old dream in place?

81
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,840
Carrie, don't you know the earth is a new scandal?

82
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,040
Everybody's talking about it.

83
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,380
The Lord is mad as can be at that measly little planet.

84
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,820
Or I should say the scum that's on it.

85
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,060
That's mankind down there.

86
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,400
They must be scum, too, to get the Lord so walked up.

87
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,340
He's certainly letting them feel the wrath.

88
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,860
He's certainly letting them feel the wrath.

89
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:23,860


90
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,060
Ain't it a shame to plague the Lord that way?

91
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,360
They've been begging for what they're getting.

92
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,240
My brother flew down to bring up a saint the other day.

93
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,640
And he said from what he can see, most of the population down there's done made the devil their king.

94
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,860
And they're working in three shifts for him.

95
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,080
Don't make me come over there.

96
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,420
Listen not to the devil, for he makes his life with the truth and for moose.

97
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,120
You promised me no one would get hurt.

98
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,200
Forget it.

99
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,460
When may I want a horse?

100
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,580
Oh, God, I've been misinformed.

101
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
Maybe you just better forget the whole thing.

102
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,340
Get your smarts.

103
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,760
Smart?

104
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, my.

105
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,960
Anyway.

106
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,780
No one could have believed that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space.

107
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:23,700
No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized as someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.

108
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,720
Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets.

109
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:37,020
And yet, across the gulf of space, minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this earth with envious eyes.

110
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,020
And slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us.

111
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,640
Are you serious, sir?

112
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,220
I mean, do you really think the world's going to end this afternoon?

113
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,660
Yes, in just over one minute and 35 seconds.

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,620
Isn't there anything we can do?

115
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,520
No, nothing.

116
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,940
Well, I always thought we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something.

117
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,940
If you like, yes.

118
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,780
Will that help?

119
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,340
No.

120
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,000
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.

121
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,500
Weird stuff.

122
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,880
Some sort of epidemic of violence, what they've been saying.

123
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,960
I was talking to one old boy.

124
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,300
He told me they got some sort of cult up there.

125
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,200
End of the world kind of stuff.

126
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,660
I mean, the cults – your college, the church, yeah, whatever, doesn't matter.

127
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


128
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


129
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


130
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


131
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


132
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


133
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


134
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


135
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


136
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


137
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


138
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,660


139
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,900
It's like the drake, because they're saying, there's a name to the word that we aunque

140
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,200
they may call it the impầnant malayo, it's no longer the same a there.

141
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,200


142
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,380
Looking at this video, I think just at half an hour for it.

143
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,900
Don't need a brain cause you got a G

144
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,640
And it keeps you in line

145
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,000
And it makes you divine

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,280
Wake up, get up

147
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,660
Who's gonna save the world?

148
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Wake up, I'm better

149
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,260
Who's gonna save the world?

150
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,000
Who's gonna save us?

151
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,100
Could it be somebody famous?

152
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,400
Or just a regular joke?

153
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,220
Tell me where I hear about

154
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,540
Who will protect us?

155
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,180
And who's gonna save the world?

156
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,300
We are going to save the universe

157
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,040
We are going to save the universe

158
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,100
We are going to save the universe

159
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,140
Goodbye

160
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,020
We are full of ground

161
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,540
We are grown up men

162
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,680
We are all happy

163
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,580
We've made some reasons

164
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,280
It is our mission

165
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,120
It is our task

166
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,680
It's all beyond

167
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,080
The future

168
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,420
We are gone

169
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,940
Inside the universe

170
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,480
We are gone

171
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
Inside the universe

172
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,160
We are gone

173
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,780
Inside the universe

174
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,120
Inside

175
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,400
Inside the universe

176
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,460
Inside the universe

177
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,260
Tradition

178
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,480
We are born and From this perspective

179
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,720
We are born of light

180
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,740
We are away, from where place

181
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


182
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


183
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


184
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


185
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


186
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


187
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


188
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


189
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


190
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


191
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


192
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,740


193
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,620
Inside the universe

194
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,240
Inside the universe

195
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,940
Inside

196
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,160
both

197
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,720
Well, maybe next time.

198
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,240
Take heed that no man deceive you,

199
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,600
for many shall come in my name,

200
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,160
saying, I am Christ,

201
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,980
and shall deceive many,

202
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
and ye shall hear of wars

203
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,520
and rumors of wars.

204
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,460
See that ye be not troubled,

205
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,300
for all these things must come to pass,

206
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,040
but the end is not yet.

207
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,440
Now I'll be the first to admit

208
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,500
that the odds of actually encountering

209
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,960
an aberrant phenomenon are infinitesimal.

210
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,140
But if you've been listening at all,

211
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,180
you've come to realize

212
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,920
that statistics dictate

213
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,080
that all of the weirdest events

214
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,720
will take place in the end times,

215
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,860
i.e. tonight.

216
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,300
So if you want to be a survivor,

217
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,740
you will prepare for the impossible.

218
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,320
And there shall be famines

219
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,420
and pestilences

220
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,720
and earthquakes in diverse places.

221
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,600
All these are the beginning of sorrows.

222
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,380
If these things that we're seeing in our day

223
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,540
are merely the beginning of sorrows,

224
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,080
think what it's going to be

225
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,500
when the end time is really upon us.

226
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,040
The sky,

227
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,980
the sky is red,

228
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,420
but the sun,

229
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,780
the sun is red,

230
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,340
but the sun,

231
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:08,720


232
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,740
the sun is red,

233
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,040
but the sun is red,

234
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,420
the sun is red,

235
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,540
because you too

236
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,880
discovered

237
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,520
and found

238
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:25,560
the treasure

239
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:25,620
of the world.

240
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,080
Therefore,

241
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
ulating

242
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,400
your field

243
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,400


244
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,400


245
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,260
theVES

246
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,260


247
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,260


248
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,600
then killed.

249
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:38,680
he came based

250
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:38,680


251
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:38,720
story

252
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:38,720


253
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:38,720
his boss,

254
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,900
We're down!

255
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,220
How many years, Lord?

256
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,920
How many days?

257
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,820
Can the world go on this way?

258
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,560
How many trials, Lord?

259
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,080
How many tears?

260
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,120
Cause we always live in fear

261
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,620
Oh, there'll come a day when

262
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,980
Hatred will cease

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,420
And all the world will have peace, Lord

264
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,200
And all the world will have peace, Lord

265
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,800
And all the world will have peace, Lord

266
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:59,940
And all the world will have peace, Lord

267
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,260
A flare spurting out from Mars

268
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,460
Bright green

269
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,040
Drawing a green mist behind it

270
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,460
A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight

271
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,900
Ogilvy, the astronomer

272
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,920
Assuredly, we were in no danger

273
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,100
He was convinced

274
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
There could be no living thing

275
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
On that remote, forbidding planet

276
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,700
The chances of anything coming from Mars

277
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,980
Are a million to one, he said

278
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,180
The chances of anything coming from Mars

279
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,780
Are a million to one

280
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,320
But still, there he comes

281
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,320
Drink up

282
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,300
Why three pints?

283
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,340
Muscle relaxant

284
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,060
You'll need it

285
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,620
Did I do something wrong today?

286
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,220
Or has the world always been like this

287
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,020
And I've been too wrapped up in myself to notice?

288
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,100
I'll try to explain

289
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,760
Drink up

290
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,760
How long have we known each other?

291
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,520
Five years, maybe six

292
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,840
Most of it seemed to make some kind of sense at the time

293
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,340
All right

294
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,620
How would you react if I said that I'm not from Guildford after all

295
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,940
But from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?

296
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,540
I don't know

297
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,120
Why, do you think it's the sort of thing you feel you're likely to say?

298
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,680
Drink up, the world's about to end

299
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,700
This must be Thursday

300
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,820
I never could get the hang of Thursdays

301
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,700
On this particular Thursday

302
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,020
Things were moving quietly through the ionosphere

303
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,400
Many miles above the surface of the planet

304
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,800
Several huge, yellow, slab-like somethings

305
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,120
Huge as office blocks

306
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,560
Silent as birds

307
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,540
Which hung in the air exactly the same way that bricks don't

308
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,360
The planet was almost totally unaware of their presence

309
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,780
They went unnoticed at Goonhilly

310
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,860
They passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip

311
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,440
And Woomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them

312
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,560
Which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years

313
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,280
Arthur, of course, was totally unaware of them

314
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,900
He was only aware of a sudden

315
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,820
Terrible, crashing noise

316
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,160
This displeases me greatly

317
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,600
What's the total?

318
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,840
18,960 for the morning

319
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,900
And that's including the village with the fortune tellers

320
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,940
They certainly can breathe fast

321
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,160
Look at them there

322
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,840
Squirming and fighting and bearing false witness

323
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Why did I ever make them?

324
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,540
Should I get some more thunderbolt?

325
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,580
No, they don't do no good

326
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,820
There's gotta be something else

327
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,100
Oh, how about this?

328
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,100


329
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,100


330
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,260
What would it be if you was to doom them all again

331
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,980
Like that time you sent down the flood?

332
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,100
I bet that would make them mine

333
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,200
You know how much good the flood did?

334
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,020
How about cleaning up the whole mess up

335
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,740
And starting all over again with some new kind of animal?

336
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,500
And admit that I'm licking?

337
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,360
Oh, no, of course not, Lord

338
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,280
Bitch, I'll f*** your ass up

339
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,340
Run, run, run, but you shouldn't leave her alone

340
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,540
And I'll pour it on, a tooth for a tooth

341
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,380
Both for me and I'll set you free

342
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,320
Raccoon, brother, raccoon

343
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,560
Well, the back of your face in the middle is

344
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,280
A provision to our nature

345
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,320
All the children

346
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,100
People are stunned, confused

347
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,500
They stagger about the malls

348
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,120
My gosh, it's like seeing

349
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,520
Truth

350
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,760
In advertising

351
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,540
Is this the apocalypse?

352
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,760
I don't know

353
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,460
Six pints

354
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,140
Right, keep the change

355
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,060
From a five, I thank you, sir

356
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,920
You've only got seven minutes left to spend it

357
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,660
Four, would you please tell me what the hell is going on?

358
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,860
Drink up, you've got three pints to get through

359
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,160
Three at lunchtime

360
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,680
Time is an illusion

361
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,620
Lunchtime doubly served

362
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,260
Drink up

363
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,900
So, you're confronting some shimmering crap

364
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,700
That your hypothalamus can't put into a category

365
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,300
And you've got about five minutes before your mind implodes permanent like

366
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,940
What do you do?

367
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,500
What do you do?

368
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:19,340
Well, since you've approached it with no basis other than some half-assed so-called objective perspective, you're dead

369
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,400
Try begging it for mercy

370
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,240
It never works, but it's worth a try

371
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,100
You've got nothing better to do while you die, so give it a shot

372
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,080
Hey, instead of writhing around and being a snob, you've got a chance to show your

373
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,080


374
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,080


375
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,080


376
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,080


377
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,080


378
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,080


379
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,140
in your own excrement wishing you'd paid attention,

380
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,440
why don't you pay attention right now

381
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,040
and enjoy writhing in your own excrement

382
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,540
by memorizing the following indirect observation technique.

383
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,960
They took me off! They got my truck!

384
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,020
It's all over, people!

385
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,940
We don't have a prayer!

386
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,220
Oh, man, yeah.

387
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,700
So, here we find ourselves

388
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,200
standing at the cosmic crossroads again.

389
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,640
Thumbs out expectantly as our eyes search the heavens

390
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,780
for the supernova light of the oncoming exosplea

391
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,460
and wishing with every fiber of our beings

392
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,300
that this time it will work!

393
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,520
This time we shall escape!

394
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,500
This time!

395
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:25,900
Oh!

396
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,900
Bob!

397
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,020
Please make it work!

398
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,060
This time I can't take it anymore!

399
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,240
July 5th at 7 a.m., Bob.

400
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,360
I'll be there.

401
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,740
Will you?

402
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,340
Have you seen Bob?

403
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,740
He ought to be here soon.

404
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,640
Yeah? Well, maybe.

405
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah, maybe.

406
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,720
Bob, you are testing my patience.

407
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,800
Oh, you're telling me.

408
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,980
If he doesn't get me off the planet this time,

409
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,320
I'm gonna rip his half-toed ass to shreds

410
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,020
and get me a decent savior.

411
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:01,900
Oh, my God!

412
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,280
Okay.

413
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,220
Girl, what have you done?

414
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,600
Beth?

415
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,060
She's dead!

416
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,240
Buried under the rubble!

417
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,040
Why?

418
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,800
Satan!

419
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,100
Why did you take one of your own?

420
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,760
Oh!

421
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,600
Oh!

422
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:23,580


423
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,620
Oh!

424
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:24,860
Oh!

425
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,300
Oh!

426
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,520
Oh!

427
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,520


428
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,520


429
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,520


430
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,520


431
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


432
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


433
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


434
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


435
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


436
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


437
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


438
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


439
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


440
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


441
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:25,560


442
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,300
Oh!

443
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


444
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


445
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


446
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


447
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


448
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


449
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


450
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


451
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


452
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,220


453
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


454
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


455
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


456
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


457
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


458
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


459
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


460
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


461
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


462
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


463
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


464
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


465
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


466
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,360


467
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,360


468
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,360


469
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,360


470
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,360


471
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,360


472
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,360


473
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,320
Oh!

474
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,280
Doomed!

475
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,440
Oh!

476
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:52,880
Oh!

477
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,200


478
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,440
Oh!

479
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,620
Oh!

480
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,780
Thank you.

481
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,460
Thank you.

482
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,340
Thank you.

483
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,340
Thank you.

484
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,560
Thank you.

485
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,680
Thank you.

486
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,100
Thank you.

487
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,860
Thank you.

488
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,700
Thank you.

489
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,240
Thank you.

490
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,920
Thank you.

491
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,820
Thank you.

492
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,460
Thank you.

493
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,700
Thank you.

494
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:44,620
Thank you.

495
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,520
throughout the day. I rate editors from all over the country were insistently

496
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,580
demanding more specific information. Newsman from the wire services, reporters

497
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,620
from local and out-of-town newspapers were hemming me in, he laboring me with

498
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,800
questions for which I had no answers. For the first couple of hours we at the

499
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,040
press desk had a terrible time getting the story straight ourselves, but bit by

500
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,780
bit I managed to piece it together. There had been both visual and radar contacts.

501
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,960
Andrews Field, the Air Force installation, had radar returns similar

502
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,540
to those on the CAA radar. Jets had been scrambled in an attempt to make an

503
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,740
intercept of the UFOs, but they had not been successful.

504
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,880
Yes, yes, but can you see the saucers? They should be there.

505
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,680
What's that? What's that? Suicidal impulses and remission? Doctor, another

506
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,680
patient cured. I'll say. Is he gone? Oh yeah.

507
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,000
Oh yeah.

508
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:30,500
He was over one attack. Now he's still alive. Still alive. Screaming in the streets.

509
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,020
But he was still alive. He's back to his place. He's okay.

510
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:52,240
He was over one attack. Now he's still alive.

511
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,160
Still alive. Screaming in the streets. But he was over one attack.

512
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,520
But he was over one attack. He was over one attack.

513
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,900
Still alive.

514
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,980
Still alive and screaming.

515
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,600
This is all TV stuff.

516
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,760
This is all radio stuff.

517
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:22,760


518
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,080
Still watching too.

519
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
Outlandish! Sal

520
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:36,060
still alive! It's screaming in the streets. What is it about!

521
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,700
They're frustration they didn't be coming.

522
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,340
Hauling! Sal

523
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,580
still alive! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

524
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,380
Sal I you talk to him, he kicks himself behind.

525
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,920
If OK…

526
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,340
.

527
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,280
. . . . . . . get this thing over here, and finish the job right here, if you want to.

528
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,740
Sal . If you will put this down here, that's the only solution.

529
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:52,740


530
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,820
Assignment, come, you smack bastard!

531
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,740
Oh, you know.

532
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,380
He's a f***er, that fella.

533
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,400
The hammering from the pit and the pounding of guns grew louder.

534
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,640
My fear rose at the sound of someone creeping into the house.

535
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,740
Then I saw it was a young artilleryman, weary, streaked with blood and dirt.

536
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,220
Anyone here?

537
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,400
Come in.

538
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,320
Here, drink this.

539
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,560
Thank you.

540
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,880
What's happened?

541
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,240
They wiped us out.

542
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,440
Hundreds dead.

543
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,560
Maybe thousands.

544
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,660
The heatwave.

545
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,620
The Martians.

546
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,840
They were inside the hoods of machines they'd made.

547
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,080
Massive metal things on legs.

548
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,980
Giant machines that walked.

549
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
They attacked us.

550
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,860
They wiped us out.

551
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,780
Machines?

552
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,800
Fighting machines.

553
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,580
Picking up men and bashing them against trees.

554
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,080
Just hunks of metal.

555
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,140
But they knew exactly what they were doing.

556
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:44,700
Hmm.

557
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,020
There was another cylinder game last night.

558
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,520
Yes.

559
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,480
As it looked bound for London.

560
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,160
London?

561
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,400
Carrie.

562
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,700
I hadn't dreamed there could be danger to Carrie and her father so many miles away.

563
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,760
I must go to London at once.

564
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,500
They're made.

565
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,000
Got to report to headquarters.

566
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,080
If there's anything left of it.

567
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,640
They're money because it's true.

568
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,920
It will be the end.

569
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,640
The apocalypse.

570
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,280
We're doomed.

571
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,200
Doomed.

572
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,260
We're doomed.

573
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,840
Doomed.

574
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,680
We're doomed.

575
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,420
Doomed.

576
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,200
Doomed.

577
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,360
Doomed.

578
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,640
Doomed.

579
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,300


580
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,280
It's all over, people.

581
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,120
Ah!

582
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,880
This party is over.

583
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,860
The apocalypse.

584
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,920
Great.

585
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
And I ain't begging.

586
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,420
I got a whole lot of shaking going on.

587
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,160
Well, I did shake.

588
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,320
I beg you to shake it.

589
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,480
I did shake it.

590
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,340
Beg you to shake it.

591
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,220
I did shake.

592
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,280
Don't you let it break now.

593
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,240
Shake it.

594
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,760
Shake it.

595
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,260
Shake it.

596
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,060
I'm a roll.

597
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,020
A whole lot of shaking going on.

598
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:46,960
Whoa!

599
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,160
Whoa!

600
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,760
Whoa!

601
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,380
Whoa!

602
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:49,980
Whoa!

603
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:50,660
Whoa!

604
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,100
Whoa!

605
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


606
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


607
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


608
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


609
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


610
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


611
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


612
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


613
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


614
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


615
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,360


616
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:51,480
Whoa!

617
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,040
There was a meltdown

618
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,260
happened last Tuesday

619
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,840
Now it's second chance to lose

620
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,720
It's just me and the jukebox

621
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,600
And it's playing a mournful tune

622
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,100
Just keeps on playing

623
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,120
those radiation blues

624
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,480
When the sun went down last Wednesday

625
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,260
I went walking in the park

626
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,380
I went walking in the park

627
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,380


628
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,380


629
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,380


630
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,380


631
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,840
Didn't mind there were no street lights

632
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,660
I was blowing in the dark

633
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,180
Just call me Glower

634
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,080
Got radiation blues

635
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,200
They had a wake for Jake LaBarber

636
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,240
One long drink and one short breath

637
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,860
He went and shot himself this morning

638
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,860
Cause the whole town lost its hair

639
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,400
Came out in handfuls

640
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,400
Got radiation blues

641
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,660
Ain't no use in going no place

642
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,900
Home and town is just like here

643
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,400
Boss man really fixed us this time

644
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,060
Think I'll have another beer

645
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,660
Ain't no use singing

646
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,560
Those radiation blues

647
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Those radiation blues

648
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,920
the way of the world

649
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,760
Is it just me

650
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,080
Or am I picking up

651
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,400
Some negative vibes out there?

652
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,200
I saw the earth

653
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
Turn brown and die

654
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,120
I saw

655
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,240
But I couldn't cry

656
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,760
Everything I knew so well

657
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,340
Disappeared

658
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,400
Before

659
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,380
I knew

660
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:18,740
I was calling out your name.

661
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,400
Calling out your name.

662
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,100
Bob!

663
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,260
Bob!

664
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,400
Bob!

665
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,360
Bob!

666
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,840
Bob!

667
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,760
Bob!

668
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,420
Bob!

669
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:41,500
Bob!

670
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:41,960
Bob!

671
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,020
Bob!

672
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,140
Bob!

673
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,140


674
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,140


675
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,140


676
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,600
That's what the world is today

677
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,580
The South wherein an all time high

678
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,380
You're both walking round with your heads in the sky

679
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,080
Cities aflame in a summertime

680
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,800
So our feet goes

681
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,140
F-o-l-u-tion.

682
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,940
Revolution down control the size of soul

683
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,500
Shooting rockets to the moon

684
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,940
Kids going up to zoom

685
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,000
There's not enough wire to open that door

686
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,520
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything

687
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,420
And the band played on

688
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,660
So I'm going to never, ever be alone

689
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,840
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide

690
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,680
When I stop and I turn and I couldn't go right

691
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,440
Till I get to the bottom and I sing again

692
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,340
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

693
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,880
Oh, do you think you want me to love you?

694
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,480
Coming down faster, miles above you

695
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,460
Come on, tell me, tell me, tell me

696
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,600
Come on, tell me the answer

697
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,880
Will you make me a lover, but you ain't no answer

698
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,640
Oh, do you think you want me to love you?

699
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:32,640


700
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,860
Come on, tell me, tell me, tell me

701
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:41,300
Come on, tell me, tell me, tell me

702
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,140
Come on, tell me, tell me, tell me

703
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,540
Catched with burning sunlight

704
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,760
On the inside of my eye

705
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,220
Will I burst into oblivion?

706
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,440
Burn in Armageddon

707
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,800
Will I

708
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,060
Flaming ashes

709
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,380
Light the sky

710
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,780
Oh, where will I be?

711
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,600
Where will I be?

712
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,180
Where?

713
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,500
Where will I be?

714
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,020
Where will I be?

715
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,340
When darkness descends on me?

716
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,920
Where will I be?

717
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,720
Where will I be?

718
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,060
Where will I be?

719
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,280
So we're living in a real crazy world, my friends.

720
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,480
We're living in a world where everyone is crying out for deliverance.

721
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:10,900
Now, many times you will see the president standing there in the Rose Garden with two of these smiling men from the East on each side.

722
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:18,280
One has got a tablecloth on his head, and he poses, they smile, and then they put there in the newspaper, uh, a priest.

723
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,740
I've got no problem with the peace treaties that they sign.

724
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,320
I have a problem with the people who signed the peace treaties.

725
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,880
Uh, that's, that's reality.

726
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,760
George, you should be ashamed of yourself.

727
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,300
And how.

728
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,460
Recently, another 400 scientists, scholars, businessmen, and politically-democratic leaders have been in the same situation.

729
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:32,460


730
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:32,460


731
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,680
They've met in Texas to ponder the problems facing mankind.

732
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,600
They said, it is a gloomy world indeed.

733
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:47,360
The energy crisis, famine, the financial problems of New York City, drug abuse, and other unrelated problems are all portents of the present darkness.

734
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,780
And the Bible says...

735
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,080
I am the God of Hellfire, and I bring you fire.

736
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,400
...woven destruction cometh upon them and they shall not escape.

737
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,720
That's what the Bible says here.

738
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,820
There shall be famine, pestilences in different places.

739
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,580
And I don't have to tell you these things.

740
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,960
You know, if there ever is a time that Bible prophecy is confirmed right before our eyes

741
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,080
is now, place, pestilences, and things like that.

742
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,560
Yeah, now the boss says this is a very bad thing for the country, because this contract

743
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,120
starts after the war.

744
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:29,540
And the boss has got an idea with all this Nazi and Jap money that, well, I haven't got

745
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,760
it quite straight, but anyway, the boss says it's a bad thing for the country.

746
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,540
So far you've told me what the boss has found out.

747
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,640
What did you find out?

748
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,920
I don't need the terrorists.

749
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,000
Boy, you're hotter than a firecracker on the 5th of July.

750
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,120
Who is it?

751
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,360
All right, listen up, everyone.

752
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,680
I want you to calmly file towards the exit.

753
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,700
That's it.

754
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,480
That's it.

755
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,660
Everybody run.

756
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,460
Just walk.

757
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,380
Now if we just stay calm, no one's going to be harmed by the huge bomb that's going to

758
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,300
explode any minute.

759
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,980
LUCAS!

760
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,740
Here's the car!

761
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,340
Here's the car!

762
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,880
It's、

763
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,340
PREVIOUS HARM,

764
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:23,340


765
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:23,640
BY LUCAS!

766
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:51,000
THIS WAS THE ARMS AND SHOT'S PROTEIN WHbrush Crime.

767
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,040
We have no alternative.

768
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,280
We must use all our nuclear weapons.

769
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,580
May I suggest we join in prayer?

770
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,460
I can't see how prayers will help.

771
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,860
Oh, yes. We can at least save our souls.

772
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,820
We must either attack them now or surrender to them.

773
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,880
Some more trouble.

774
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,500
The military men want to use all our nuclear weapons

775
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,360
and then resist them to the bitter end.

776
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,520
We'll be wiped out by the radioactivity.

777
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,160
We have a tiger at the front door and a wolf at the back.

778
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,460
What is that supposed to mean?

779
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,220
With the temptation, not in place of the temptation,

780
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,740
but with the temptation,

781
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,800
also make a way to escape

782
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,900
that you may be able to bear it.

783
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,580
See, lest the demons come on you,

784
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,160
oh, I mean, they've got power as you find out.

785
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,940
They can really come upon you.

786
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,300
But in order that you may be able to bear

787
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,680
the amount of temptation that he allows to come upon you,

788
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,080
he's made an escape route.

789
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,900
But if you don't climb in the capsule

790
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,020
and fire the thing off,

791
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,180
you won't escape.

792
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,340
And to many of us,

793
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,920
refuse to pull the D-ring,

794
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,320
that's what they call it when the ejection seat

795
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,980
blows you out of the canopy.

796
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,540
When your plane's on fire,

797
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
you've got to blow the ejection seat.

798
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,760
When it gets too hot,

799
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,120
you've got to pull the D-ring, as they say,

800
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,220
and blow it out, get out of there.

801
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,920
When these fiery trials are upon us

802
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,620
and the devil is tempting hot,

803
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,720
you can't stay in the middle of all the environment

804
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,320
of the demons and the temptations.

805
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,800
And wallowing the thing,

806
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,280
you've got to take the escape route.

807
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,540
Hey, what about Major Kong?

808
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,820
On the way!

809
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,840
I like the view!

810
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,760
Basic instructions before leaving Earth.

811
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,980
Basic instructions before leaving Earth.

812
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,260
Basic instructions before leaving Earth.

813
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,340
Basic instructions before leaving Earth.

814
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,140
Hey, hey, hey!

815
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,820
That's what you teach those kids.

816
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,660
Basic instructions before leaving Earth.

817
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,060
Are you there?

818
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,980
If you have any red pills left,

819
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,400
take them now.

820
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,320
Stay out of our medicine cabinet!

821
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,020
I'm sorry.

822
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:46,320
I'm sorry.

823
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,320


824
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,380
Yes, very much.

825
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:49,420
Thanks.

826
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,220
Setonium, polonium, and thallium,

827
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,260
and gallium, and bismuth, two-eleven.

828
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,040
We've got some carbon-14,

829
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,040
and astatine, and larynxium, two-five-seven.

830
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,100
Kerbelium, brachylium, and strontium-90,

831
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,720
and iodine-131.

832
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,160
We've got some technetium,

833
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,840
plutetium, brantium, radon,

834
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,260
and a little bit of radium.

835
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,920
Someday I'm gonna blow you up!

836
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:10,840
Get outta here.

837
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,020
I'm taking the freeway on my way home

838
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,740
Bringing my money, clothes and all my charm

839
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,600
Going to take freeway won't take very long

840
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,780
You know I'm going home today

841
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,220
Something that I have to say

842
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,140
I've been gone too long

843
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,260
And the people who came may be gone

844
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,080
I just have to say

845
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,880
Play the violin for me

846
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,860
So I'm taking the freeway

847
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,180
Gotta find my way back home

848
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,900
Use the right lane now

849
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,040
Soon I'll be home

850
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,980
I'm taking the freeway on my way home

851
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:47,980


852
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:47,980


853
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:47,980


854
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,460
You know I'm going home today

855
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,660
Something that I have to say

856
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,880
I've been gone too long

857
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,120
And the people who came may be gone

858
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,940
I just have to say

859
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,700
Play the violin for me

860
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:16,380
You know I'm going home today

861
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:16,980
Something that I have to say

862
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:16,980


863
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:16,980


864
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:16,980


865
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,600
I'm taking the freeway on my way home

866
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:22,840
I'm taking the freeway on my way home

867
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,800
Use the right lane now

868
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,080
Soon I'll be home

869
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,980
When I was young I used to dream of other worlds up there

870
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,460
I thought the god who made us all surely made others somewhere

871
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,160
I closed my eyes as I stared at the sky

872
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,900
Let my mind take leave of this body and fly

873
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,900
Over the yards and roofs of my small hometown

874
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,980
Up higher I'd go and from the clouds look down

875
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,060
To see the small spot of the earth that was mine

876
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:08,060


877
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:12,460
The street where I lived was but a thin line

878
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:16,500
And in those moments of fantasy I recall

879
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,460
How I realized my place in the scheme of things was small

880
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,640
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank

881
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,780
It raised itself to full height

882
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,020
Flourished the funnel high in the air

883
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,040
And the ghostly terrible wind blew it away

884
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,100
A terrible heat ray struck the town

885
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,040
Look!

886
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,180
My god, what's that I see just there?

887
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,260
Swirling and turning in the one-night air

888
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,000
Those lights keep on flashing me

889
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,940
They paralyze me

890
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,720
I can't seem to move but

891
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,260
I still can see

892
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,200
I'm going much lighter, but

893
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,000
I'm a heater off the ground

894
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,700
I'm being pulled toward the ship

895
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,320
Whirling round and round

896
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,340
I'm drawn to an opening by a powerful beam

897
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,200
This can't be happening

898
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,820
It must be a dream

899
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,220
A dream!

900
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:29,820
Ahhh!

901
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,640
This ain't right, Bob.

902
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,640
Nothing's right anymore.

903
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,320
Go on.

904
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,180
Go on, get going.

905
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,220
Didn't I warn them?

906
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,040
Pray I said.

907
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,660
Destroy the devil, I said.

908
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,400
They wouldn't listen.

909
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,580
I could have saved the world.

910
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,600
But now it's too late.

911
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,740
Too late.

912
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:26,160
Too late.

913
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,500
Me!

914
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,680
I'm a rocket.

915
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,960
Like a Saturn 5.

916
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,400
Like Apollo 9.

917
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,540
I'm a rocket.

918
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,920
Ready to rock.

919
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,360
Ready to roll.

920
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,060
Come on, come on.

921
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,220
Give me mission control.

922
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,720
I said I'm ready to rock.

923
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,300
Ready to roll.

924
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,880
Come on, come on.

925
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,200
Give me mission control.

926
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:51,740
Rock!

927
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:52,780
Rock!

928
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,600
Rock!

929
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,080
Rock!

930
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,520
Rock!

931
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:56,880
Go!

932
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,240
Like a spaceship

933
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,060
Going in the sky

934
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,260
Like a spaceship

935
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,040
Going in the sky

936
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,580
Like a sun and sleep

937
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,100
On a mountain top

938
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,660
Like a sun and sleep

939
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,160
I'm ready to rock

940
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,640
Ready to rock

941
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,120
Ready to roll

942
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,860
Come on, come on

943
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,780
Give me the control

944
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,600
I said I'm ready to rock

945
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,140
Ready to roll

946
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,780
Come on, come on

947
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,960
Come on, come on

948
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,560
Come on

949
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,120
Baby, I'm ready to rock

950
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:46,800
I said I'm ready to rock

951
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,140
Ready to roll

952
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,840
Come on, come on

953
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,740
Let the ghost walk upon me

954
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,940
Baby, I'm ready to rock

955
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,400
I said I'm ready to rock

956
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,900
I'm ready to rock

957
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,520
Because of my previous experience,

958
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,280
I was assigned to unidentified flying objects.

959
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,500
I was back in the flying saucer business.

960
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,720
Space cowboys

961
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,460
Flying up into the sky

962
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,380
Well, I'm flying up into the sky

963
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,080
Space cowboys

964
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,640
Bet you never thought I'd resign

965
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,440
Good lord, I'm rocking

966
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,620
Do the

967
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,140
Do the

968
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,060
Do the

969
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:49,060


970
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,300
Do the

971
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:50,820
Do the

972
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,060
Do the

973
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,280
Finally, the hot лиш, girls

974
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


975
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


976
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


977
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


978
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


979
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,480
Ready to roll

980
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:09,480


981
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:09,480


982
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,520
Get up and down

983
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,680
Ready to rock

984
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,640
To sleep

985
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:13,640


986
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:13,700
פ

987
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:13,700


988
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,040
It helped

989
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,960
What do you say?

990
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,040
Awoo

991
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,040


992
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,040


993
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,040


994
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,160
Till we meet again.

995
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,440
Good night.

996
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:41,200
Happy dreams to you.

997
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:48,860
May they all come true.

998
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,020
Till our next canoe.

999
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,580
Sleep tight.

1000
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:06,960
Sleep tight.

1001
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:12,080
As each day goes by.

1002
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:20,860
Keep your wishes.

1003
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,060
As each day goes by.

1004
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,780
Look out of your pipe and smoke it, whore.

1005
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,600
I don't know why I feel this way.

1006
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,220
As though someone should pay.

1007
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,460
For I'm so lonely.

1008
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,100
I'm so empty.

1009
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,020
I'm so empty.

1010
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:58,420
I too am dead.

1011
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,120
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

1012
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,020
Don't come crying to me, lady.

1013
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,820
You should have spent that membership money while you had the chance.

1014
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,960
Oh, but I have a feeling nothing could have persuaded you

1015
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,020
to come over to the subgenius side of the force.

1016
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,800
Not even listening to things like,

1017
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,240
we heard tonight, like Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds rock opera

1018
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,680
with that narration by Richard Burton.

1019
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,240
The BBC radio version of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

1020
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,220
The A's asking us who's gonna save the world.

1021
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,980
And the swingin' love corpses telling us that they're going to save the universe.

1022
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,260
This time, maybe.

1023
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,920
Oh, maybes.

1024
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,640
I wanna have Dr. P. Ellis of the lymph nodes.

1025
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,080
Institute destroying the world.

1026
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,060
Too bad that didn't take.

1027
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,260
Mofongo jumped in with the end of the world.

1028
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,700
And a little bit of the temptations of ball confusion.

1029
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,040
Some Ruby 3.

1030
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,760
A little bit of the tinklers.

1031
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,620
Talking about those link rays.

1032
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:18,320
And then that creepy Wayne Williams era darkness over Atlanta number was by Dave Barton.

1033
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,700
Followed by BGK.

1034
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,700
A Dutch hardcore band with no limbs.

1035
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,220
And then a little speeded up Jerry Lee lunatic.

1036
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,480
Survival Alliance came in with radiation blues.

1037
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,800
And then a little bit of Zeta Reticuli.

1038
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,580
A love story.

1039
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,360
Oh, man.

1040
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:43,760
You're so lucky you're only going to die July 5th.

1041
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,840
You didn't have to listen to that whole thing.

1042
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,480
And then that was a Don Harrison version of Helter Skelter.

1043
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:57,420
Don Barnett was this strange lisping creature talking about Bob and his escape hatch.

1044
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,980
A little more Survival Alliance.

1045
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,100
Oh, some Noel Coward telling us the party was over.

1046
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,520
The Griffin was trying to take the freeway.

1047
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,980
Spin Out came on like a rocket.

1048
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,320
And Space Cowboy 2.

1049
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,560
And then there was a little Doris Day.

1050
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,460
Oh, I can smell it.

1051
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,480
And the air seekers.

1052
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,780
And it smells like breakfast.

1053
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:34,060
Oh, the lure of galactic destruction is enough to break even me out of my usual reclusive shell.

1054
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:39,900
To my total astonishment, I find myself looking forward to the festivities.

1055
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,620
Oh, yes, at the Gathering of the Tribes.

1056
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,240
Oops, somewhere in South Ohio now.

1057
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,620
Subgenius.com has details.

1058
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,940
We will enact the beautiful and glorious.

1059
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,300
Rituals and traditions of the Yeti people.

1060
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,900
And prepare for our deliverance in the stars.

1061
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,600
Oh, it's probably too late to write for free information.

1062
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:06,940
But you can check out Subgenius.com for a listing of all the events.

1063
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,420
Yeah, that's Subgenius throwing another I'm the richest man in the universe party.

1064
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,320
I knew that son of a bitch was alive.

1065
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:19,020
Oh, yeah, and there will be the usual blood wrestling and hellish human sacrifices.

1066
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:23,600
Plus all the nudity and frappy we've come to expect from this church.

1067
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,420
So, seekers, good night.

1068
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,780
For the path is over now.

1069
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1070
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,220
Let's get the hell out of here.
