1
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,900
Followers of obsolete, unthinkable trades.

2
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,620
Let's put it this way, I'm gonna work from some book notes.

3
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,000
Addicts of drugs not yet synthesized.

4
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,420
Black marketeers of World War III.

5
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,860
Excisors of telepathic sensitivity.

6
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,880
Osteopaths of the spirit.

7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:57,880


8
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,200
Nothing like this.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,820
The subgenius hour of SWAT.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,480
Investigators of infractions denounced by bland, paranoid chess players.

11
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,280
Servers of fragmentary warrants taken down in hebephrenic shorthand.

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,020
It may sound a little, you can fill in the blanks.

13
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,480
Absolutely.

14
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:51,360
But you see, once the herd approaches a certain saturation, it's harvest time, friends.

15
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,660
And yet even as that day approaches, the pigs, the normals, the humans, you know what I'm

16
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:57,880
talking about.

17
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,640
The mediocratons, the Barbies and Kins, of all flavors, shapes, and sizes, and there's

18
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,420
some in this audience here today.

19
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,080
Uh-huh.

20
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,420
You think I'm talking about the next guy, don't you?

21
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:08,640
Yep.

22
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,480
They're...

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,680
Even as the herd is getting too big, the pigs yet keep throwing fuel on the fire.

24
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,360
They make it illegal not to have kids.

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,500
And they're falling straight into our trap, friends.

26
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,780
That's what they're doing.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,880
Because they were placed on this planet to swarm and murder.

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:27,880


29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,660
And they're going to multiply like microbes in a drop of water so that eventually they

30
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,540
could be harvested by the elder gods from Planet X and the sex goddesses who will come

31
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:37,720
down.

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,420
And they thrive.

33
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,940
They get off, friends, on human anguish extracted from the soul by a special process that only

34
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,180
Bob Dobbs understands.

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,760
And thereby the human race will complete its mission of nutrition.

36
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,860
Now, if you could but see a galaxy being born like the sperm of a human being, you would

37
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:07,400
be ashamed of your own puny little existence.

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,600
You'd see yourself as an abortion, a deformed hunk of snot that was hatefully spat out by

39
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,780
a stellar nebula.

40
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,500
Raise the form of snot!

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,240
But if you were sane enough or paranoid schizophrenic enough by society's standards to accept the

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,260
beauty and purity of this, you might gain the keys.

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:27,840
I'm not saying that I'm not.

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,660
Beloved, I'd give it back to this city, mosquito paramecia or dissolved insect Small

61
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,180
Mane Planor effectivement

62
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:45,040
I, T'Lone before I Todern above all, I'm a

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,340
S transitionist, you can't judge me and it's a lie.

64
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,340


65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,480
i work with mobiles

66
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,480


67
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,360
also fathered the supreme order of impurity the number of proof why they had certainly

68
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,740
now please please bye bye and uh the bucket of pills once i heard a universal harm like

69
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,760

how's this i can zoom now

71
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,700
by tearing down the fence by clearing away the obstacle

72
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:50,540
so that now we could draw near to god and god could once again look upon us with grace

73
00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:01,860
oh no you could call it the kinder gentler lobotomy our automated background bed of

74
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:10,680
non-intrusive sound fields will not be tolerated paranoid psychosis stems from an abnormal normality

75
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,200
near the subgenius stimulate his memory at least get the numbers ball on the 25. place to go when

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,720
you're in santa rosa go to cafe this cafe this you'll never know if it's open or not

77
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:30,960
you have written many times in reality from the brain and yet you give yourself the power to alter

78
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:39,000
another human being's reality had a bad childhood we can fix it i'm not your everyday scope your

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,360
memory shorten your perception or something why not and now to go to beat the clock okay in this

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,020
the object is to get to your your own personal conspiracy theory out in under 10 seconds all right

81
00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:02,500
okay ready set go july 4th is independence day for the normals july 5th is independence day for

83
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,540
of the world less than five years off now just a few years from now dear friends the end times will

84
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:22,620
culminate in ragnarok the eschaton the the judgment day the end of the world at the end of all we hold

85
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:31,340
the ultimate last call friends the landing of the exes the men from planet x and oh you know the

86
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,300
pinks love those fourth of july explosions on the fifth of july they'll be going well now i think

87
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,540
these explosions sound like they're much stronger to believe in one's dreams is a manifestation of

88
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,480
insanity and the sooner you accept this the sooner you'll get well but i think the archangel appeared

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,480
and whispered into my ear wait a minute what's all that small print there at the bottom oh if you have

90
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,940
dial information thank you for calling don't know

91
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:09,820
you are so abstract this is pure hysteria don't look at me like that maybe it's a

92
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,780
radio signal i read about a guy used to pick up broadcasts and fill in his tooth oh that feels good

93
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,200
alien species escaping

94
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,260
here

95
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,660
your thoughts are transmitted

96
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,680
can i tell you the sense of your

97
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,680
helmet into a computer the rest is automatic

98
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,740
i'm willing to join

99
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,020
well you've been burdened enough

100
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,500
i'm i'm

101
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,480
learn the coordinates

102
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,100
i'm different

103
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,780
then you may rest

104
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,300
i must be

105
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,220
you're different but how do you know when you can trust someone

106
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,320
Now we'll retrieve the signal

107
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,900
Scratched out as it passes

108
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,820
Cosmic distances

109
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,060
In interstellar space

110
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,020
Oh that blowhard

111
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,220
Why doesn't he sit down and shut up

112
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,380
Oh is this an open channel

113
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,680
Well just joking as you know

114
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,480
We maintain high standards

115
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,600
Of radio standards

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,020
Oh you say you wanted to buy

117
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,940
Toothpicks

118
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,620
Well toothpicks

119
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,140
Let me see

120
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,340
You go down

121
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,760
You get on the expressway

122
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,200
Going east

123
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,520
Right there

124
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,980
And you want to get off the third exit

125
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,040
Sporting goods

126
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,680
Swing around and head north

127
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,020
Towards hardware

128
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,080
But you want to get off

129
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,360
Before the expressway

130
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,360


131
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:53,860
Before hardware

132
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,380
You'll pass

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,200
Young mothers

134
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,020
And toys and tots

135
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,080
And then I think the next big whip around

136
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,060
Is the elevator

137
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,320
You park on the ferry there

138
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,280
And it'll take you down nine levels

139
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
You get off at 19

140
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,000
And head for the home furnishings

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,320
Boulevard east

142
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,940
And now you stay on

143
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,160
You stay in the five right hand lanes

144
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,620
For that and turn left

145
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,540
On to home furnishings

146
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,200
And it's all about

147
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,840
A mile

148
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,720
Three or four lights

149
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,880
You'll see this building

150
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,320
With a giant frog mural on it

151
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,040
On the left

152
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,580
That's dining goods

153
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,760
Now the place you're looking for

154
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,500
Is right after that

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,860
You go down behind the spoons building

156
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,160
And it'll be this one story warehouse

157
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,800
Looking thing with a big statue

158
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,480
On top of a bulldog

159
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,840
Toothpicks

160
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,840
They ought to have what you're looking for

161
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,480
But what

162
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,880
You don't want toothpicks

163
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,260
You say

164
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,040
You wanted more Wellman barrages

165
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,960
More edits like that puzzling evidence barrage

166
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,040
I was just playing there

167
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,660
Why

168
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,940
Well I did re-edit that some

169
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,160
But friends if you want to hear more of that

170
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,040
You're just going to have to pledge to the station here

171
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,940
The pressure to buy to give to pledge was relentless

172
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,860
And although we've got hundreds and thousands at our service here today

173
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:22,860


174
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,480
We're not so faithful

175
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,540
And God bless you

176
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,880
God bless you for your faithfulness

177
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,300
Still there are hundreds and hundreds maybe thousands

178
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,220
Who are not faithful

179
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,280
Who made the pledge and for some reason or another haven't sent it in

180
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,680
And if we count on that

181
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,040
And it doesn't come in everything

182
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,540
Everything suffers

183
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,160
We are even having a hard time meeting the payroll right now

184
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,640
And the people that we have working for PTL have families too

185
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,680
They have bills too

186
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,820
Jim Baker's running costs exceeded two million dollars a week

187
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,800
That's nothing compared to ours friends

188
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,400
This baby that I'm holding in my hands

189
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,780
Is one of the first babies that has been saved

190
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,540
8237490

191
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,900
Now listen to this dear friends

192
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,860
8237490

193
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,380
And here's some of our other friends

194
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,660
They call it the buckle on the bible belt

195
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,500
It has the largest quota of millionaires

196
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,100
The worst crime rate

197
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,040
And one of the severest poverty rates in any American city

198
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,440
Yet Dallas could also be described as the most Christian place on this earth

199
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,700
8237490

200
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,900
Hi, this is Pat Paulson

201
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,700
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election

202
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,660
And this is the hour of slack on the show today

203
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,480
And I want to say that I'm a big fan of the station K-N-O-N in Dallas Texas

204
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
You know I know where that is

205
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,700
Hello Bob this is Father Guido Sarducci

206
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,260
Formerly Pope Maurice of the People's Catholic Church

207
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,420
And all of my fellow popes from the People's Catholic Church

208
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,540
Salute to the church of the Sabbath Genius

209
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,740
Carry on

210
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh well thanks Father Guido Sarducci

211
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,060
But we ain't going to be able to carry on no where

212
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,860
Unless we get some help friends

213
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay okay

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,660
It's a good time to get some help friends

215
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,060
It has now become serious

216
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,460
I will have you paying Tiffany cufflinks

217
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,700
I'll demand that you pay up the money

218
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,120
The money that you have been withholding from Bob

219
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,280
You have to give unto Bob that which is Bob

220
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,040
Bob or Bob

221
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,000
Money is Bob

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,240
Sex is Bob

223
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,180
Slack is Bob

224
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,560
And you my friend what you've got in your pocket

225
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,880
And behind your pocket

226
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,260
Right next to your pocket up in front

227
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,500
That is Bob too

228
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,600
I want to see some calls coming in

229
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,060
I was lying earlier

230
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,040
I'll admit it

231
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,400
I'll admit it I was lying

232
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,480
These four mighty reverends are sitting here waiting to take calls and nothing is happening

233
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,760
Dallas is the buckle of the Bible belt

234
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,180
We're sitting here risking our very lives trying to unbuckle it

235
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,140
So that their pants may fall down around their ankles

236
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,180
And they may look upon their own private desires

237
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,360
That they would deny otherwise

238
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,580
And this is the only voice of a person who is willing to take a call

239
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:21,580


240
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:21,580


241
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,600
Here is my word

242
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:22,600


243
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:22,600


244
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:22,660
More aparece

245
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,660
Rick

246
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,080
You also view myself as an ungrateful person

247
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,500
That spit on the mócam

248
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,100
I acknowledge it

249
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,580
Or even it is not

250
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,180
Just being silently

251
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,520
Apost physiognomy

252
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:51,560
And perhaps disor citrus

253
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:58,000
your $20, you get that program schedule. For $20, you get the schedule and the bumper sticker. For

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,840
$25, the schedule, bumper sticker, and K-N-O-N button. For $30, the t-shirt, bumper sticker,

255
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,020
button, and schedule. But you will have to come to the station to pick up the t-shirt,

256
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:14,120
and we have to know what size t-shirt you're going to get. And $40, you get all that mail to you,

257
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:22,500
and so we got to get it called 823-7490. The blind and rebellious people did not believe

258
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:30,800
that God would bring judgment upon the earth until it was too late. Only righteous

259
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:38,160
Noab and his family were saved. Is it possible that today we're living in time similar to Noab's

260
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,920
time that Bob spoke of? It could be, friend.

261
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,720
Could be. The end times are definitely approaching.

262
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,380
Are you doing it? Are you doing it? That's what I want to know. I mean, when you think,

263
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:12,980
are you really, really doing it? Well, we could talk about doing it, yes. I think I will.

264
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,100
I'm going to...

265
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,340
Start reading, friends, from... Well, it's an article in my very favorite,

266
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,940
favoritest magazine just about in the whole world, I think. A magazine called Answer Me,

267
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:34,480
produced by the mighty Goads. And I'm going to give the address you can write to,

268
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:43,380
the new address of Goad to Hell Enterprises in Hollywood, of Answer Me magazine, after,

269
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,900
convincing you of how wonderfully it's written by... Well, this is just so... This is a pledge drive.

270
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:57,200
Show is a good time to read this article, or parts of it, actually. It's thousands of pages long here.

271
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:06,060
Killing Me Softly, roughly in just about every way imaginable. 100 Spectacular Suicides.

272
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,560
By the way, my background music, probably for the rest of the show, is going to be by, uh, Brain Rot.

273
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:23,340
A radio theater up in Cleveland. Or Ashtabula, actually. Um, so if you hear something clunking away in the background, it's them.

274
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:41,900
Hopeless. Hopeless. You see the big sun, the green grass, the happy, happy kids riding bikes and sucking on popsicles, and you feel shut off from it.

275
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,100
An invisible dustbubble.

276
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,000
A particle floating in the shade.

277
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,400
So you walk away from the crowd.

278
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
And keep walking.

279
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,040
Let's talk about suicide. The unforgivable sin.

280
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,360
The topic induces a static discomfort.

281
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,680
The thoughts of unutterable sacrilege.

282
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:13,160
Taking one's own life flies against every supposed survival instinct, yet it happens everywhere in numbers greater than murder.

283
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,100
Killing Me Softly. By the way, my background music, probably in just about every way imaginable. 100 Spectacular Suicides. By the way, my background music, probably in just about every way imaginable.

284
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,040
The

285
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:23,040
of byproduct of food chain economics, but killing yourself allows for no such easy rationales.

286
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:30,300
Murder is pretty much a cottage entertainment industry, but people recoil at suicide. They

287
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:37,380
pussyfoot around it trying not to rouse it from slumber. While studying murder can bring

288
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:44,020
the emotional release that comes with seeing a good explosion, mulling over suicide is

289
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,520
more like watching the walls slowly crumble on a condemned building.

290
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,160
That's because people like looking at a car crash as long as it's not their own. They

291
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,220
won't flinch at hours of atrocity footage but can't handle a nick on their own finger.

292
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,100
Humans are numbly aware that they're only a trauma or two away from yanking their own

293
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:12,820
plug. If you're the depressive type, suicide is never far away, always tapping on your

294
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,000
shoulder and trying to get away.

295
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,000


296
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:20,460
Even breathing softly down your neck. Personally, we're pro-choice on the matter, but we feel

297
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,080
it's better to fight death with your last scrap of strength to take your pain out on

298
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,640
someone else. They deserve it more. When we kill, it ain't gonna be ourselves.

299
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:40,600
But here we are, serving up a cornucopia of self-extinction. We hope all of our enemies

300
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,000
find it useful.

301
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,000
You know, it's a little bit of a shock to me to see that a lot of people have gotten

302
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,000


303
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,000


304
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,000


305
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,000


306
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,240
It's one of life's cruel paradoxes that truly worthless people never appreciate their worthlessness

307
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,140
and thus aren't prone to commit suicide.

308
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:01,480
That's why we have room in our otherwise impregnable hearts for the individuals on this list. They

309
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,880
all display an emotive capacity which makes them superior to the clueless pinks who drive

310
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,880
around in their tiny cars and never consider killing themselves.

311
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,960
The dumb jerk-off!

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,860
The dumb jerk-offs who swagger with beer-bellied self-assurance are the ones who should be

313
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:24,460
thinking about it, and seriously. In contrast, those who contemplate, attempt, or complete

314
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,340
suicide feel that life sucks a big fat purple.

315
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,540
And they're right. But if there were more people like them, this world wouldn't be

316
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:41,540
half as bad. Ironically, it's the non-suicidal who make life unbearable.

317
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,380
Well, let's start with number one here. Anonymous, actually, no name, Polish broad,

318
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:56,260
the human toolbox. Her consonant-clotted name is unknown, but this daughter of Polska's

319
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,580
self-mutilating doggedness warrants her inclusion on our honor roll.

320
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,140
Though available details are flimsy, this story involves a case of gustatory self-abasement

321
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,520
even odder than the gallons of sperm rumored to have been guzzled by rats.

322
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:11,520


323
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,440
The story of a woman named Rod Stewart, a few years back. What is known is that this

324
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:23,640
19th century maiden got the raw end of a failed romance. When her lover abandoned her, cavalierly

325
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:31,440
burying his kielbasa in another bed of sauerkraut, she began to eat compulsively. Whereas many

326
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:39,240
spurned girls turned to chocolate-drowned cheesecake or fistfuls of bonbons, she did

327
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,540
not.

328
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:45,800
Neither did she find comfort in potato pie, potato pudding, or lonely bowls of potato

329
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:54,220
soup. Instead, she put herself on an iron-rich diet. Over five months, she ate 101 pins,

330
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:02,960
three knives, seven window bolts, four spoons, a brass crucifix, 20 nails, and 19 coins.

331
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:09,120
She also scarfed down three glass fragments, a rock, and two rosary beads.

332
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:09,840
She also had a

333
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:09,840


334
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,900
The story of a woman named Rod Stewart is a mystery. It is uncertain which trinket dealt

335
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:19,880
the death blow, but one imagines the casket jingling as it was lowered into the cold, Polish

336
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,640
soil.

337
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,420
Here's suicide number four. Hope you're enjoying this, friends. I certainly am.

338
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,580
This is just some of the funniest reading I have gotten. I swear, it really is.

339
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,960
I don't know if I can finish this one. This is just a bunch of nonsense. I don't know

340
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,320
what to do with it.

341
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,320


342
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,520
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.

343
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:39,900
In the end, I'll just go back to my bedroom.

344
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:47,020
Yes, number four. Linda Marie Ault. Dogged by her parents. It was the free-loving year

345
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:53,520
of 1968, and Linda Ault felt she was old enough to spend a Friday away from home. It got lonely

346
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,360
out in the Arizona desert, and at 21, she couldn't be faulted if she sought solace in

347
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,680
a man's arms. Besides, he wasn't just some bum. He was an air force lieutenant.

348
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,320
Nature, though, had dealt the red-headed accounting major.

349
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,440
a set of Gila monsters for parents. They evidently felt that she was scattering her eggs about

350
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,280
like cactus pollen. They didn't appreciate the fact that the young officer spent the

351
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,280
night landing on their daughter's airstrip and that Linda, instead of resisting, seemed

352
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,220
more than willing to lube the flyboy's fuselage. The worst part of all was that she didn't

353
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:38,220
seem to be a damn bit sorry. They decided they were going to learn her a lesson, but

354
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,240
after whipping Linda with a mesquite branch, Mrs. Alt felt that the girl didn't exhibit

355
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,000
sufficient remorse. On Saturday afternoon, they withdrew her from college. Linda remained

356
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:56,540
unpenitent. I told Linda, Mrs. Alt would later say, that after she'd put so many people through,

357
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,460
after what she'd put so many people through and wasn't sorry, maybe she'd suffer over

358
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,340
an animal. She loved animals.

359
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,900
On Sunday morning, the Alts,

360
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,200
In the middle of the night,

361
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,600
intending to wake Linda up, commandeered their daughter and her pet dog, Beauty, into the

362
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:21,320
desert scrub. The Alts forced Linda to shovel a small grave for Beauty.

363
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:29,820
The best way is through the head, Mrs. Alt told Linda, handing her a loaded pistol and

364
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,280
holding Beauty out in front of her. Linda hesitated. Did they really expect her to kill

365
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,760
it? This was a dog whose poop she had cleaned, whose...

366
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Ahem, she may have stroked in softer moments, a varmint who obviously gave her more emotional

367
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:49,160
satisfaction than her crustacean-hearted parents. So, instead of drilling lead into the cowering

368
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:56,320
canine, she tore open her own head with one shot, departing this veil of tears and leaving

369
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,820
Beauty at her parents' questionable mercy.

370
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,620
One more. One more.

371
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,520
For now.

372
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,220
Number 6. Thomas Barker. Limey on a stick.

373
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,440
No one knew who the haggard-looking man was. As a small group sat before a fireplace in

374
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,560
Leeds, England hotel lobby two days before Christmas 1856, it didn't seem to matter.

375
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:30,580
He was welcome to share in the season's joy. Appearing troubled, he had wandered in from

376
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,840
the cold night, requested a pipe, and sat peevishly before the fire.

377
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,320
It didn't have to happen. He could have thrown another log on the fire, sipped some tea, and

378
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,620
quietly passed wind. He could have warmed his toes, cracked his knuckles, and inquired

379
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:56,280
about rugby scores. He could have read a Christmas carol while chewing on a buttered scone. If

380
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,780
he had felt the Yuletide spirit, he could have roasted marshmallows and handed them

381
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:07,740
out to indigent children. But the dancing flames seemed only to remind him of some kind

382
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:07,740


383
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,560
of personal hell. He just sat there looking angry.

384
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:19,060
Ten minutes passed. He approached the fire and placed a poker in the embers. He waited

385
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,740
until it glowed red-hot. He then removed it and tapped it on the floor, knocking off all

386
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:32,020
surplus dirt and ash. Then, in the manner of a sword-swallower, he shoved the simmering

387
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,040
ingot down his throat.

388
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,720
Within an instant, the pink mucoid tissues were completely gone.

389
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,020
The blood-spirting charcoal burger was all over the place.

390
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:48,700
Hotel patrons wrested the poker away from Barker, who was probably unable to bark at

391
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,920
this point, and spirited him away to a doctor's care. Over the course of the next five days,

392
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,520
someone asked him why he had attempted to become a human shish kebab. Barker said he

393
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,340
had no idea.

394
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,700
Then, as should happen only with everyone who can't explain their own actions, a man

395
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,380
came to him and said,

396
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:08,700
He died.

397
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Yeah, right. Here's some recordings from Starwood just recently. It's a real hippy-dippy thing.

398
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:26,680
Yeah, folks, Starwood this year has achieved something, I don't know how many, more than

399
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,140
a thousand people. Last year they hit the thousand mark, and that was the biggest pagan

400
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:37,300
gathering anybody knew of, at least, of this kind. And this time, what, the last time I

401
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,680
looked, it was a lot of people. It was a lot of people. I mean, I was walking around the

402
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,380
There's like 600 cars registered.

403
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,320
Starwood is a city, man!

404
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,580
Tear down the fences!

405
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,280
It's a free concert!

406
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,940
There have been three babies born,

407
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,020
17 muggings, 47 rapes, three killings.

408
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,440
It's a city, man!

409
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,640
We're dying people!

410
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,420
Mention, we've got to, for the first time,

411
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,700
Starwood, now that it's so big,

412
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,440
is being covered by CNN and CBS,

413
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,000
couple of these cameras here.

414
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,080
Don't worry, they won't take pictures of you.

415
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,620
But just for the media,

416
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,700
we wanted to do a little section for the media.

417
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,200
They wanted a nice snippet, you know,

418
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,740
a sound bite of a typical pagan occultist,

419
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,280
you know, just typical progressive,

420
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,400
just a moment that they could use on the news.

421
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,020
So this is our moment to represent.

422
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,680
And we may not have a lot of culture,

423
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,600
but we got a lot of cult.

424
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,380
We have, in fact.

425
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,780
Okay, well, let's, okay, CBS and CNN, ready?

426
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,700
You must worship Satan

427
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,600
and his cult.

428
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,760
And you must worship his son as gods.

429
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,640
Swear total loyalty to him and his plan.

430
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,740
And publicly take this satanic initiation right

431
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,860
into this new age of mankind.

432
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,340
And you will receive a visible mark

433
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,340
upon your forehead or right hand,

434
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,280
showing all that you are a Luciferian.

435
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,000
And it will be a bright red and orange pentagram,

436
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,320
666 in the name of the Antichrist.

437
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,940
Okay, you got that?

438
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,120
Actually, that book,

439
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,960
that came from a Christian book

440
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,780
that Dr. Leigh Gidham handed me,

441
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,100
this by Harry Walther.

442
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,200
It's called The Answer to Raptures.

443
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,180
And today, my friend,

444
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,920
these red letters are printed in ink,

445
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,680
but tomorrow they shall be printed in blood,

446
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,280
the blood of the saints.

447
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,960
That's what it says in here.

448
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,580
And I, I think, I'm going to have to go to church.

449
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,580
I think that I want to share some of this with you

450
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,420
because it's, they've got some good ideas in here, frankly.

451
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:49,580
It's, it's about, well, the bloodbath that will follow,

452
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,140
that comes in the end times.

453
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,440
The Antichrist will lead the world in a global

454
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,200
witch hunt for the devil people,

455
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,320
the non-initiates, and by that he means the Christians, okay?

456
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,780
The true Christians.

457
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,400
Now, the horrible possibility is that,

458
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,020
and this scares us,

459
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,240
that the rapture has happened

460
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,640
and they, they didn't qualify.

461
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,700
Some old farmer got raptured and nobody missed him.

462
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,420
And so we're stuck with them, you know?

463
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,820
Anyway, all Christians will be hunted down,

464
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,060
arrested, beaten, and dragged off to prisons.

465
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,640
Imagine hordes of satanically crazed teenagers,

466
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,520
all armed with guns, clubs, baseball bats,

467
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,400
hunting down Christians.

468
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,680
I'm skipping through this.

469
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,000
We've circled the best parts.

470
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,680
Imagine children turning in their parents

471
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,020
and parents dragging their, quote,

472
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,580
tainted children to prisons.

473
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,220
Imagine a group of young teenage girls

474
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,400
attacking non-initiated Christian men

475
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,760
with baseball bats, knocking them senseless.

476
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,200
Oh, I can tell this guy, he really gets into prophecy.

477
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,760
There's a prediction of Koresh in here.

478
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,580
This was written in 1980.

479
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,420
1986.

480
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,940
And yet it says,

481
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,820
and a heavily armed super-trained SWAT team

482
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,620
will be called in.

483
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,740
They will easily drive the Christians out

484
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,960
with tear gas, stun grenades, and M16s.

485
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,040
Well, wasn't that easy, see?

486
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,660
Not the true Branch Davidian Christians.

487
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,980
But what happens when a few Christians

488
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,140
are heavily armed with bulletproof vests,

489
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,140
tear gas masks, automatic weapons,

490
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,080
and high-powered rifles?

491
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,180
No problem.

492
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,980
You just use the Philadelphia Plan

493
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,620
invented by Mayor Wilson Good.

494
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,080
You drop an incendiary bomb by a helicopter

495
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,480
and blow the house apart in flames.

496
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,220
And if the Christians don't run out,

497
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,440
they burn to death.

498
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,200
And if they do run out shooting,

499
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,460
they will be blown away by police snipers.

500
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,760
If they run out aflame, they will either be...

501
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,220
Oh, well.

502
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,660
Okie-dokie.

503
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:13,500
You didn't win by turning your République

504
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,540
Tell them we threw you over the Partnership line

505
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:14,640
Comradelightly You made the socialists

506
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:14,640


507
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:14,640


508
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,520
Lookin' So terrible

509
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,100
Well!

510
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,580
We put that supereintelligence

511
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:18,580


512
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:18,580


513
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,820
Well, it's Dann lemonade

514
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:20,820


515
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,180
we abandon with you

516
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,480
something otherwise

517
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:33,580
I'm so sorry

518
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:33,580


519
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,760
oh and the whole world can join this of course this is once again this is a christian guy talking

520
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,460
and the whole world can join in this cosmic battle between the jedi warriors those of light

521
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:56,760
that's a satanist versus the dark side of the force christians and star wars will occur upon

522
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,020
the face of the earth star wars on the face now this is the thing is these guys don't go

523
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:12,240
far enough i mean they got part of it you know uh and this it oh no doubt they will be stripped

524
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,260
naked yeah the christians this is great okay no then the christians will be tossed into their

525
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,420
death chambers no doubt they will be stripped naked and kept in handcuffs so they cannot resist

526
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,820
what is soon to come later on they will be fed nothing or given any fresh water

527
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,840
will have to lay in their own feces and urine

528
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,640
you

529
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:39,720
and possibly water will be sprayed in with hoses so that they are forced to lap it up as dogs

530
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:49,980
amidst the urine waste and blood from injuries and mewnstration this is christian propaganda friends

531
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,920
about but like i said they had some good ideas the most the most brutal rapists murderers and

532
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,400
perverts will be assigned to take care of the christians select boys girls and women will be

533
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,000
chosen for the christians and they will be given the right to life and the right to death and the

534
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,400
group is pvcs Aggravated

535
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,040
is definite

536
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,580
women should start

537
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,240
by

538
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,520
by

539
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,980
before

540
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,000
first

541
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,360
bet on

542
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,600
there

543
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:32,340
at 610

544
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,000
to

545
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,960
stadium cheering madly.

546
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And then you are gone.

547
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,980
Bleeding head good.

548
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,060
Healed head bad.

549
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,260
Bleeding head good.

550
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,300
Healed head bad.

551
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,040
Praise the bleeding head.

552
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,040
Which could not be here tonight

553
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,320
by the way. It wasn't the right time.

554
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,020
Okay, and no doubt

555
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,980
as Christians are led to the slaughter

556
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,980
in these giant sports stadiums

557
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,820
and complexes, the rock

558
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,820
bands will be blurring away

559
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,920
some satanic tunes.

560
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,240
Possibly the old

561
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,460
Rolling Stones classic,

562
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,260
Sympathy for the Devil.

563
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,100
Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love.

564
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:12,840
Atlantis

565
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,120
by Donovan.

566
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,960
Or possibly

567
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,180
even Pat Benatar's

568
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,280
We Are Invincible.

569
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,680
Maybe they will even

570
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,900
slice or chop the heads off of

571
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,240
Christians in synchronicity

572
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,560
to the beat of the

573
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,300
rock band.

574
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,180
Woo-hoo!

575
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,840
Bump, bump, bump.

576
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,260
So, for three and a half years

577
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,700
blood shall flow through the streets of the world.

578
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,500
Today the blood on this book cover

579
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,480
is only simulated.

580
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,360
If one day in the future it shall be real

581
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,820
human blood, the blood of saints,

582
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,260
and possibly even your own

583
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,840
blood.

584
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:51,780
And he calls

585
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,700
the rapture

586
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,580
Zap 1 and Zap 2.

587
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,620
There's two raptures.

588
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
And he says,

589
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,440
this is the last sentence from this,

590
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,860
and possibly at Zap 2,

591
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,760
for special effects,

592
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,800
God will blast apart

593
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,820
every cemetery and graveyard

594
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,880
on this planet.

595
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,800
Whole cemeteries literally exploding

596
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,580
and the seas may roar and turn over

597
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,060
as the dead in Christ,

598
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,580
quote, sleeping,

599
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,260
in them are caught away as well.

600
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,200
So, friends, it'll be like

601
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,760
Night of the Living Dead,

602
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,320
the rapture will, with these zombies

603
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,820
shuffling through the streets.

604
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,260
Rusting to eat human brains.

605
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,480
Now,

606
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,300
the interesting thing about

607
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,080
this little

608
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,300
crackpot,

609
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,220
two-bit Christian book,

610
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,600
the answer is that

611
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,900
not a word of it is actually untrue.

612
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,420
According to Dobbs' prophecy,

613
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,440
on X-Day, these are only a small

614
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,480
portion, a tiny,

615
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,260
these are like a little party.

616
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,880
It's a damn cocaine party

617
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,180
compared to what's going to happen to these boys.

618
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,360
But it's not just the Christians, nay.

619
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,440
All come to earth.

620
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,100
No, no, no.

621
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,500
People tend to pick on the poor Christians.

622
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,040
There's Mormons

623
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,020
and the Jews

624
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,320
and even some of the subgeniuses

625
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,580
who haven't spent their

626
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,320
$20 on a membership

627
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,800
in this church.

628
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,320
What they said was going to happen to the Christians,

629
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,500
you see, and Bob,

630
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,180
you could say, well, it's not just Christians,

631
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,640
it's anybody who has not become,

632
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,100
who has not fully accepted J.R. Bob Dobbs,

633
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,600
into their life.

634
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,700
Praise Bob.

635
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,360
Praise Bob.

636
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:33,880
Praise Bob.

637
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,780
Praise that damn Bob.

638
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,740
Because every day is X-Day

639
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,260
when you have a gun

640
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,100
coined the words of the same prophet,

641
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,220
it is appointed to men once to die,

642
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,580
but then the judgment.

643
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,120
And I want to talk about X-Day this afternoon.

644
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,020
We had expected Pope Meyer

645
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,020
to be preaching here today.

646
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,020
Can't do it.

647
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,540
That's all right.

648
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,460
I've got plenty,

649
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,480
plenty,

650
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,160
A bloodthirsty prophecy to share with you.

651
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,180
Well, I wish I could share it with your friends.

652
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,460
We have...

653
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,260
Well, what is X-Day?

654
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,160
Some of you, some few of you,

655
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,720
some poor, ignorant, pathetic, bastard,

656
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,820
two-bit, never-read-anything idiots

657
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,000
may not know what X-Day means to the subgenius.

658
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,540
X-Day, of course, is that day.

659
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,000
Well, let's put it this way.

660
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm going to work from some book notes.

661
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,800
They're just notes, and so if I may sound a little...

662
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,300
You can fill in the blanks.

663
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,200
Yeah, we'll let you fill in the blanks, dear friends,

664
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,880
on that day, that day to come,

665
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,080
when you actually do call the station

666
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,820
and pledge to your favorite...

667
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,180
Whoa!

668
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,380
Your favoritest radio show.

669
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,080
Someday, those who will hear the mystery tape,

670
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,520
those who call in...

671
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,740
Oh!

672
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,160
Will has been...

673
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,600
And Cecilia have been on the phone here.

674
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,340
They've been yakking,

675
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,460
but they ain't been taking down no numbers.

676
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,060
No, sir.

677
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,380
Numbers, it's all that counts

678
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,780
during a pledge drive, folks.

679
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,700
Now, you don't want to...

680
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,380
You don't want to end up like this guy, do you?

681
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,480
Number 17, William Corcoran.

682
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,260
He who hesitates.

683
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,680
Perched atop a hundred-foot flagpole,

684
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,540
one bright day in May 1975,

685
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,560
William Corcoran knew he had made the right decision

686
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,200
in choosing to end his life.

687
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,120
No one seemed to care.

688
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,560
He had his fill of emotional bruises,

689
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,020
mild betrayals,

690
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,400
the whole nottering jangle of human existence.

691
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,540
Life was a bitter lime to suck.

692
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,140
But as he stared down at the unforgiving earth

693
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,740
of Palmyra, New York,

694
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,560
pondering how it would feel to shatter into a thousand pieces

695
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,640
a la Humpty Dumpty,

696
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,540
his life instinct rose like a swarm of bats fleeing a cave.

697
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,480
Maybe the crowd which formed at the pole's base

698
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,160
knew what it felt like to be lonely.

699
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,080
And the fireman who was coming to save him

700
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,100
seemed like a decent enough guy.

701
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,880
Perhaps he could be a buddy,

702
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,620
a shoulder to cry on,

703
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,620
someone with whom to share a round of Michelobes

704
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,000
and a handful of beer nuts.

705
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,860
Yeah, this new feeling which blew through his soul

706
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,480
felt pretty dang good.

707
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,800
He'd make a pact with God,

708
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,140
agreeing to appreciate the twinkle in a child's eye,

709
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,940
the soft curl of a woman's smile,

710
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,260
the beneficent nod of an old man feeding pigeons.

711
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,920
But God would have none of it.

712
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,300
As Corcoran was being rescued,

713
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,400
he accidentally slipped and plummeted earthward.

714
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,020
His indecisive frame smacking into the ground like a giant egg.

715
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,200
Uh, yes, and that's what's going to happen to this radio station

716
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,100
if you don't call in with your pledges, friend.

717
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,120
There have been other incidences of suicidal overreactions.

718
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,000
Uh, unable to decipher a complicated income tax form,

719
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,760
a Frenchman hanged himself in 1947

720
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,900
after saying,

721
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,300
I'd rather die, I'd rather die

722
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,500
than go through another day of this.

723
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,600
Claiming to be depressed over the popularity of modern jazz,

724
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,500
Roy Baker of Venice took the gas route in 1921.

725
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,560
Well, he would have hated this show.

726
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,080
Patrick Lynch, 28,

727
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,420
ended it all in 1985

728
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,040
upon discovering that a termite

729
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,920
had caused $200 worth of damage

730
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,340
in the London flat he had just rented.

731
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,460
And Harvard freshman Barton Fay

732
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,560
flipped the off switch in 1922,

733
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,460
nauseated with the rampant use of eggs

734
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,620
in campus restaurant menus.

735
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,820
Friends, these were subgeniuses without slack.

736
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,320
Now, the only reason you aren't dead yet

737
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,060
is because you've been given slack.

738
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,280
You are living by the grace of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

739
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,860
but yet you don't believe on Bob, do you?

740
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,980
No, you ain't calling in your pledges, Bob.

741
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:27,980


742
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
We ain't heard nothing from you.

743
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
Well, maybe I should try this.

744
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,700
In 1878, a man named George W. Burleigh

745
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,020
handed out flyers advertising that he would culminate

746
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,220
his lecture at Chicago's Thornton Hall

747
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,720
by shooting himself.

748
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,320
Naturally, he packed the auditorium to the rafters.

749
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,140
After an impressive oratory,

750
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,100
he pulled out a large caliber derringer

751
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,020
and tore his head open with one shot.

752
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,980
The crowd undoubtedly left feeling the shock.

753
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:57,980


754
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,280
They were feeling that their one dollar admission price

755
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,160
had been worth every penny.

756
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,840
Now, nobody...

757
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,060
Oh, here's a...

758
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,760
This one made my mouth water.

759
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,760
Although James Green was fitted with a wooden leg,

760
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,400
he was an anthropoid like the rest of us.

761
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,320
He limped around New York's five boroughs

762
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,800
like Captain Ahab,

763
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,980
leaving a trail of bad memories and tiny splinters.

764
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:30,060
In 1974, when the errant amputee set fire

765
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,300
to his Brooklyn apartment,

766
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,480
police treated him no differently than they'd treat a two-legged criminal.

767
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,380
They threw him in the clink.

768
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,960
Having reached his limit,

769
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,040
the stumpy felon removed that Louisville slugger of his,

770
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,960
jammed it between the cell bars,

771
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,220
wrapped its connective straps around his neck,

772
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,680
and hanged himself.

773
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,160
The peg-legged pyromaniac's earlier act of arson

774
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,500
may have itself been a veiled suicide attempt,

775
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,000
given the fact that his leg was a virtual Duraflame log.

776
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,440
His leg's on fire!

777
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,980
His leg's on fire, dear friends.

778
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:08,920
I...

779
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,560
Oh, and let's hear about number 33

780
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,780
in Answer Me's Suicide Hall of Fame,

781
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,140
William Gordon Hall, Driller Killer.

782
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,500
Holy, holy, holy.

783
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:23,940
Autotrepination,

784
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,240
the practice of boring a hole in one's head

785
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,680
as a means of self-illumination,

786
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,420
can be traced back almost to the days of the woolly mammoth.

787
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,000
Since it's painful, senseless,

788
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,040
and tailor-made for the atavistically naive,

789
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,200
you can bet your nipple rings

790
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,460
that the beautiful people's skulls will soon look like wiffle balls.

791
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,460
Bill Hall,

792
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,220
a 57-year-old Belfast executive,

793
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,460
took a less affected but more decisive path

794
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,520
to enlightenment in March 1971.

795
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,400
Unlike the fashion trepon...

796
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,240
trepanatist...

797
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,280
trepanationists...

798
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,340
Unlike the fashion trepanationists

799
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,380
who chisel through their crania

800
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,160
yet leave the soft brain matter untouched,

801
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,720
Hall seized a portable power drill

802
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,200
and sent the twirling steel bit deep into his head

803
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,500
eight times.

804
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,280
Eight times, dear friends.

805
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,460
Now, burrowing into your own head once seems brazen enough,

806
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,700
but Hall's seven additional excavations command quiet respect.

807
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,840
A hastily summoned surgical team tried without success

808
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,440
to plug holes in Hall's mind,

809
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,560
which by that time had become the proverbial sieve.

810
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,100
Well, we pass over Ernest Hemingway here.

811
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,800
Oh, there's a long section on...

812
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,820
Adolf Hitler,

813
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,100
bang goes der Fuhrer.

814
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,720
Long section on him.

815
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,120
Abbie Hoffman,

816
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,200
steal this life.

817
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,600
Joey, the boy with elastic skin.

818
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,700
His heart was stretched beyond repair.

819
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,400
That was a good one.

820
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,620
And Doug Kenny of National Lampoon,

821
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,160
but what I really wanted to make sure that you all heard,

822
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,540
number 52,

823
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,840
Diane Linkletter.

824
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,820
Kids do the darndest things on acid.

825
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,940
Art Linkletter was the voice of reactionary reason

826
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,800
back in the turbulent 60s,

827
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,800
the silent majority's super mellow father confessor.

828
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,620
He was the easy-going paternal type

829
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,780
who calls you into his den fragrant with rum and maple pipe tobacco

830
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,400
and shows you his model ship collection.

831
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,940
He had no discernible talent

832
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,700
apart from a certain homespun cuddliness,

833
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,800
but it was enough to make him a TV superstar.

834
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,100
He was a warm teddy bear of a man,

835
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,840
someone whose mildly rising flatulence

836
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,920
was as reassuring as the smell of butter cookies baking in the oven.

837
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,500
So, when his daughter Diane's LSD-crazed suicide hit the news,

838
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,000
Art must have felt like plucking out his eyeballs

839
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,900
and hiding them in the cupboard.

840
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,980
It was all the more tragic because Diane,

841
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:20,160
a young Caucasian girl with a heart as wide as the big blue sky,

842
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,220
a girl ready to snuggle puppies,

843
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,360
was a mere damsel of twenty.

844
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,060
We've all heard third-hand accounts of the underground scene,

845
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,000
particularly the notorious acid flashback,

846
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,920
where microcosmic fire-breathing winged Buddhas

847
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,140
tear at your genitals and rummage through your record collection,

848
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,800
leaving everything out of alphabetical order.

849
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,960
Ever since she experimented,

850
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,480
with LSD in the spring of 1969,

851
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,980
an act she deeply regretted

852
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,560
and admitted to her father was nothing short of stupid,

853
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,720
Diane had been rattled with flashbacks,

854
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,740
each one rolling over her like an earthquake's aftershocks.

855
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,160
On October 4th, 1969,

856
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,200
the big one hit.

857
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,120
Diane, her eyes,

858
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,840
two spitting peppermint candies,

859
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,240
her perky bouffant hairdo,

860
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,580
a thicket of worms,

861
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,380
jumped from the windows of her tenth-story Hollywood apartment.

862
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,200
Ironically, Art was at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs,

863
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:28,120
all set to deliver a lecture on our permissive, affluent society.

864
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,920
When he received word of Diane's death plunge,

865
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,460
he flew home and marshaled the link letters together.

866
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,120
The family decided that it would best serve the nation's interest

867
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,920
if they were honest about what drove their little bumpkin to kill herself.

868
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:48,060
They knew there was a stigma attached to the fact that drugs had touched their family,

869
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:53,680
but their testimony might be able to steer some misguided youngster away from the evil microdot.

870
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,260
I immersed myself in the drug scene,

871
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,380
Art was to write in a nakedly confessional article for Good Housekeeping.

872
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,920
I'm told that a shot of speed can be like a full-body orgasm.

873
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,040
Art came to realize that drug experimentation was a normal,

874
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,780
but potentially lethal part of adolescent curiosity.

875
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:21,880
So a bunch of them climb into a car with a few joints they bought from an older kid,

876
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,620
and they hide out just as you and I used to do to smoke corn silk behind the barn.

877
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,780
Art, you delinquent.

878
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:36,460
He concluded that Diane's belly flop onto concrete wasn't technically a suicide.

879
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,640
She had been murdered. By drugs.

880
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,300
And, well, here's a guy who nailed himself to a cross and hung out the window.

881
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,800
And, uh, died, and...

882
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:58,220
Over the course of one day in 1948, a Los Angeles man bungled several desperate attempts to end his life.

883
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,320
He made six deep gashes in his throat with a butcher knife.

884
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,420
It didn't kill him.

885
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:08,100
He jammed the knife's handle into a wall at chest level and sprinted into the blade three times.

886
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,580
It didn't kill him.

887
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,160
He gulped down a bottle of poison and turned on his kitchen's gas fumes.

888
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,940
Uh, gas jets.

889
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,260
Sniffing fumes, his neighbors phoned the cops who rescued him.

890
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,020
Well, another suicide chump.

891
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:28,280
Dear friends, well, perhaps next week, if there's still a radio station here,

892
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:37,600
we may continue to read the, uh, suicide, the 100 greatest suicides from Answer Me magazine.

893
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,680
And now, as I promised, the address of Answer Me magazine, which, uh,

894
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,600
you should definitely, let's see, what, uh, counting...

895
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,160
Additional copies of number three. That's this one.

896
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,800
Oh, the first two are sold out, friends.

897
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,960
But number three is five bucks if, uh, including postage.

898
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,640
From Answer Me.

899
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,500
1608.

900
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:12,120
That's 1608 North Cahuenga Boulevard.

901
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,580
Cahuenga Boulevard.

902
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,680
North Cahuenga Boulevard.

903
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,560
That's C-A-H-U-E-N-G-A Boulevard.

904
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,860
Number 666.

905
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,940
It really is.

906
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,720
Hollywood, California.

907
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,640
90028.

908
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,340
So, if you dare...

909
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,300
Well, this one has an article, an interview.

910
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,480
With Jack Kevorkian.

911
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,400
Actually, they called him up.

912
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,760
They did a prank call on Dr. Kevorkian.

913
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,100
And, uh, oh, that's fun to read.

914
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,200
Uh, interview with Al Sharpton.

915
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,700
The kids of Whitney High.

916
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,080
Yeah.

917
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,860
And some incredible tirades.

918
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,100
The homeless can eat.

919
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,720
Bah.

920
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,420
So, impotent Superman.

921
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,540
Pederastic Park.

922
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,520
It's beautiful.

923
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,160
And, uh, you won't hear any of it.

924
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,480
Because, well, you're just all gonna go to...

925
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,680
To the hell, I guess.

926
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,000
It's sad.

927
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,840
I wanna go home now.

928
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,820
It's amusing to me.

929
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,040
But I would like to...

930
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,400
I would like to really relieve myself first.

931
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:19,660
And then, like, remove, you know, expunge some of these, like, weird garments you guys got me dressed up in.

932
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,540
You forgot about the bathroom.

933
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,180
Take some of the feathers off my hat.

934
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,440
I look silly as hell.

935
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,560
Go on.

936
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,280
You want bathroom break?

937
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,660
Go on to the bathroom, babe.

938
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,100
You'll love the bathrooms in Seamless.

939
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,560
Just don't hook your thing up to that...

940
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:32,460
Thing.

941
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,380
I don't have anything on my thing with which to hook it.

942
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,640
I don't understand what you're talking about.

943
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,500
Oh, have you looked recently?

944
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:38,880
Recently?

945
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,020
That's changed, too.

946
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,780
Remember when we changed Monica...

947
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,280
Yes!

948
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,380
...into Psycho Pathfinder?

949
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,060
And then I...

950
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,920
Oh, he doesn't remember.

951
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,780
That's not...

952
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,280
He thinks that really is Psycho Pathfinder.

953
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:48,380
Psycho Pathfinder.

954
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,800
Oh, he's checking.

955
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
Oh, my God.

956
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,700
Did you see what I had to be in that cube with?

957
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,120
Do you see what I had to look at in that cube with?

958
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,620
I tried to like it.

959
00:51:59,620 --> 00:51:59,900
I didn't...

960
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,500
I tried.

961
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,820
I can't keep it.

962
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,240
Truly, you had something on, girl.

963
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,560
Thank you, Mike.

964
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:04,620
Thank you.

965
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,260
What's wrong?

966
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:05,360
What's wrong?

967
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:05,360


968
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:05,360


969
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:05,360


970
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:05,920
I don't understand what you're talking about.

971
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,800
It's just a top Reverend calls, but...

972
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,300
Nothing happened.

973
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,780
Maybe we should...

974
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,920
Maybe we should send him out.

975
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,680
Maybe we shouldn't...

976
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,060
Maybe we...

977
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:12,280
I tried.

978
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,600
Maybe we don't even want him here.

979
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,600
I looked down there.

980
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,140
There's absolutely nothing down there at all.

981
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,460
I got a chump of syrup on everything, and I did my best piggy voice.

982
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,700
I just couldn't keep up the shriek.

983
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,740
He said it's a real pig voice.

984
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,300
I've never seen anything like that.

985
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,480
In fact, I didn't see anything there at all.

986
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,200
I don't understand being made a pork butt if someone else didn't use them in the park.

987
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,460
You don't see it until it's inside you.

988
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,560
And then once it's inside...

989
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,920
That is creepy.

990
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,120
It vibrates.

991
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:35,340
It vibrates.

992
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:35,940
What does?

993
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,480
I can see it.

994
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,160
I don't know what it is.

995
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,980
Oh, I've been staying here since two.

996
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,500
Oh, oh, it spews.

997
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,160
Oh, oh.

998
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,800
Yes, the word of Bob can...

999
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,480
What did you say?

1000
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,760
...spew from many sources.

1001
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:53,840
Oh.

1002
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,300
Oh.

1003
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:55,900
Oh.

1004
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,320
Lick my love, you love pump.

1005
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,880
Oh, that was too much.

1006
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,520
Yeah, I'm about ready for some bacon myself.

1007
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,780
Yeah, let's...

1008
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,520
Let's...

1009
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:04,760
Let's...

1010
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,160
Let's...

1011
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,280
Let's...

1012
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,280


1013
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,280


1014
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,280


1015
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,280


1016
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,280


1017
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,280


1018
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,280


1019
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,280


1020
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,280


1021
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,320
Let's...

1022
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:10,520
Let's have Dave here flay and flange those hogs.

1023
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,680
I bet he'd like that job.

1024
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,860
What is that supposed to mean?

1025
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,280
Send him into the flanging hog flanging channel.

1026
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,040
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

1027
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:16,860
No, wait, wait.

1028
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,240
Don't...

1029
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:17,420
Don't...

1030
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:17,880
No, wait, no.

1031
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,460
I'm not going to flange in...

1032
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,020
Flange in any hogs.

1033
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,200
Go ahead, Dave.

1034
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,680
I don't even know what it means, first off.

1035
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,060
Flange, flange the hogs.

1036
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,680
But I'm sure it's going to get my fingers dirty, and I don't...

1037
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,260
I don't want...

1038
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,820
Now he's worried about getting his fingers dirty.

1039
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,320
He doesn't want any ditty bitty fingers.

1040
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,780
Well, then you can always use your toes.

1041
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,040
Oh, no.

1042
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,980
I just washed my hands.

1043
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,420
I don't want to flange the hogs.

1044
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,160
Anything that grows really protrudes.

1045
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,080
What is a flanging?

1046
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,480
I don't...

1047
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,380
You don't have any...

1048
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,300
You don't have to.

1049
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,080
You don't have to.

1050
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:39,880
I don't know what it means.

1051
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,800
I don't know what a flanging is.

1052
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,260
I don't know how to flange a hog.

1053
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:43,540
Show...

1054
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:43,540


1055
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,300
Hand him the flanging tool.

1056
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,880
Now insert...

1057
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,540
This is...

1058
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,560
What did...

1059
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,220
What does the top of this thing do?

1060
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,200
It's got three points.

1061
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,360
Large hog.

1062
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,800
This looks like it goes in someone's sphincter or something.

1063
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,600
Now, that speculum is cold, we'll admit.

1064
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,960
And the hogs...

1065
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,480
Speculum.

1066
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:01,880
Yes.

1067
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,100
Speculum.

1068
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,100


1069
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,060
And between the hogs, you'll see that president there.

1070
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,820
Now, whatever you want you to do first...

1071
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,740
That's Harding, isn't it?

1072
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,700
Inspect him and crank it up.

1073
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,760
Oh, a president's a hog.

1074
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,120
That's...

1075
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,580
See, the bulb is opening now.

1076
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,380
We're back to the beginning where we started with the bulb opening.

1077
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,280
Enlightenment.

1078
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,940
Yes, I would like a mint.

1079
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,260
Does anyone have a mint here?

1080
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,080
You hear that faint ripping inside?

1081
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,700
It's like life or something.

1082
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:28,380
It's music to the ears of Bob to hear that internal rupturing.

1083
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,260
That's the fleasancing of the pig.

1084
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,960
It feels good in a way, doesn't it?

1085
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,580
Well, it's abrasive in a way, and it clears away some of the raw sewage, I suppose, but

1086
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,760
is it doing the pig any damage?

1087
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:43,060
Oh, it's not doing him any good either, but the scrapings are what...

1088
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,580
Along the leg, if you scrape the leg...

1089
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,320
Just like a sacrificial scraping?

1090
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,140
That's where the...

1091
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,360
Where do you think the flavoring for the antidote pudding comes from, Dave?

1092
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,980
Couldn't you taste the hog flank?

1093
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,700
That's hog flank?

1094
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,340
The faint savoring of hog flank scraping.

1095
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,120
That's that smoky light taste?

1096
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,100
Oh, I'd rather enjoy that.

1097
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,240
Oh, good.

1098
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:06,860
Then you'll probably like those big gumdrops, those chocolate drops on the ground there.

1099
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,800
I don't know if I'd want to taste one of those in your guys' company.

1100
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,660
Oh, I'll try one.

1101
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,800
I'll eat one.

1102
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,380
Oh, yeah, well, you go ahead and do it.

1103
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,080
It's okay if you go ahead and eat one.

1104
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:15,340
Hey, man, fool.

1105
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:15,340


1106
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,980
Yeah, go ahead, Dave.

1107
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:18,780
Mmm.

1108
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,580
Oh, this is so good.

1109
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,240
I've been...

1110
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,200
I've been...

1111
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,300
Oh, no, I don't think so.

1112
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:24,820
She digs it, man.

1113
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,240
No.

1114
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,820
I love it.

1115
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,660
Go ahead, try one.

1116
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,100
Oh, no, I've been fooled before.

1117
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,420
Oh, what the hell?

1118
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,020
What's the matter, you chicken?

1119
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,420
What the hell?

1120
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,720
What's the matter, you afraid?

1121
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:32,740
What the hell?

1122
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,560
There, there you go.

1123
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,560
See, he's a good man.

1124
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,000
Chew it up.

1125
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,640
Chew it up.

1126
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,320
Chew it up.

1127
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,240
It's kind of a rubbery texture.

1128
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:39,620
It is.

1129
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,760
You gotta let it melt in your mouth, David.

1130
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,200
Just let it melt in your mouth.

1131
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,740
This is like Mugu Gai Pan or something, right?

1132
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,100
Mmm.

1133
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,500
I mean, I could taste some kind of Chinese vegetables in there.

1134
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,860
He almost acts like a real Texan.

1135
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,860
Listen to that.

1136
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,980
What's this after flavor?

1137
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,880
This is like burning dingy thingy ding ding.

1138
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,360
Oh, that's just...

1139
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:56,960
It's just the...

1140
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,920
The real flavor.

1141
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,520
It's not like pepper.

1142
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:58,980
It's like...

1143
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,800
No, I'm just kidding.

1144
00:55:59,800 --> 00:55:59,960
I'm just kidding.

1145
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,220
What's the flavor?

1146
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,140
Uric acid.

1147
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,460
Keep your throat open.

1148
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,620
You need your throat open.

1149
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,740
It'll open your chakra, your throat chakra and your heart chakra.

1150
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,040
Use the speculum.

1151
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,520
I, uh, but I can get like...

1152
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,540
If he can't voluntarily open his throat, yank that thing out of that pig.

1153
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,140
Crank it.

1154
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,560
We're doing you a favor.

1155
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,580
We're bringing the inside out to you.

1156
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,420
I'm getting an impaction here from this stuff.

1157
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:23,120
Uric acid is bad for you, for your fallopian tubes and stuff, and the rest of your procreative

1158
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,340
things.

1159
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,520
I could never have children again if I drank too much of this.

1160
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,200
I, I, I want to do something else.

1161
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,620
This food's bad.

1162
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,660
He doesn't like food land.

1163
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,460
He doesn't like parking lot land.

1164
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,240
He doesn't like sex hurt land.

1165
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:37,860
He doesn't like reality land.

1166
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,340
He doesn't like sex hurt land.

1167
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:39,940
Oh, no.

1168
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:40,660
I know.

1169
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,320
I know.

1170
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,160
You could just have a sex parking here.

1171
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,760
He doesn't like hell land.

1172
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,120
He doesn't like parking lot or reality.

1173
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,740
That's where I want to go.

1174
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,520
He threw, he stuck his finger down his throat and disgorged the pills.

1175
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,240
I know.

1176
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,660
He doesn't like the little...

1177
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,840
He must be one of them Hindu Buddhist types that don't want to do anything.

1178
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,600
If you don't like it, then you're not going to be able to do anything.

1179
00:56:59,600 --> 00:56:59,600


1180
00:56:59,600 --> 00:56:59,600


1181
00:56:59,600 --> 00:56:59,600


1182
00:56:59,600 --> 00:56:59,600


1183
00:56:59,600 --> 00:56:59,600


1184
00:56:59,600 --> 00:56:59,600


1185
00:56:59,600 --> 00:56:59,600


1186
00:56:59,600 --> 00:56:59,600


1187
00:56:59,600 --> 00:56:59,620
I'm fluffy dumb.

1188
00:56:59,620 --> 00:56:59,620


1189
00:56:59,620 --> 00:56:59,620


1190
00:56:59,620 --> 00:56:59,620


1191
00:56:59,620 --> 00:56:59,620


1192
00:56:59,620 --> 00:56:59,620


1193
00:56:59,620 --> 00:56:59,780
Well, you didn't take it here.

1194
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,240
You can leave.

1195
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:00,680
Nothing.

1196
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,620
You can just go.

1197
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,560
You've told me four times so far, you had to leave, and each time, I've been refused.

1198
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,100
Escape land.

1199
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:06,200
I haven't tried the escape land yet.

1200
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,340
I've been refused...

1201
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,580
Why won't you go into the escape land?

1202
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:10,860
Because...

1203
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,440
Why won't you go?

1204
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,480
Because you are scared.

1205
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,280
You are frightened.

1206
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,200
You do not know.

1207
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,960
You had the password and then you forgot.

1208
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:16,280
You did.

1209
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:16,860
And then you forgot.

1210
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,180
Learn your lessons.

1211
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:19,420
Open your...

1212
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,240
too much comic books.

1213
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,200
I didn't know there was a password.

1214
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:27,060
I just began to ejaculate words, and suddenly you two nincompoops

1215
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,460
started screaming, oh, the password to escape plan.

1216
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:29,960
You're out.

1217
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,260
And then I said another word.

1218
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:31,600
Log on.

1219
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,100
Log on and off correctly.

1220
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,620
Every minute must be accounted for.

1221
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,660
Learn your lessons.

1222
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:37,660
Example.

1223
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,580
Go ahead.

1224
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:39,840
Check.

1225
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,260
Yes.

1226
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:40,860
X, no.

1227
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,580
Yes.

1228
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,120
Did I check the right one?

1229
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:43,660
No, yes.

1230
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,360
X, no.

1231
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,520
Come on.

1232
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,120
Come on.

1233
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,260
Snappy Gonzalez, you can do better than that.

1234
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,800
Yes, no.

1235
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:48,980
No.

1236
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,540
And now, can you last two or no?

1237
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:52,520
How was that?

1238
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:52,740
He was right.

1239
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,140
He was right on the last two.

1240
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,900
On the last two.

1241
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,900
That's 45% of this thing.

1242
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,720
Your bill is getting bigger and bigger and bigger, Dave,

1243
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,940
and the interest rates are not easy.

1244
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,520
I mean, I got like a bird beak on my face now.

1245
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,580
You're just getting in deeper, and you're ignoring.

1246
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,140
You let the last 10,000 ticks run right by.

1247
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,900
You are stewing in your own juice, David.

1248
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,580
You could have just.

1249
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:18,700
You didn't even have to.

1250
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,520
You wouldn't be trying to hit him.

1251
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,760
If you had just held your finger on the button,

1252
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,280
if you had held your callus on the button that whole time,

1253
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,140
you would at least be a few hundred lives ahead.

1254
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:27,640
But no.

1255
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:28,980
I know, but.

1256
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,360
You let yourself get distracted.

1257
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,180
Got jumpy and distracted.

1258
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,720
You have to concentrate.

1259
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,740
You have to relax and center yourself.

1260
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,600
Focus.

1261
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,360
Grounding and self-centering.

1262
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,440
I have the idea of shooting ticks infinitely ad nauseam

1263
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,520
and infinitum for the rest of time.

1264
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,300
It doesn't seem to really.

1265
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:46,860
Sing a little song.

1266
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,400
Huh?

1267
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,460
They could play something.

1268
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,180
Play something while I'm doing.

1269
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,580
Count the ticks while you.

1270
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:51,980
I'll give them names.

1271
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,100
I'll give them names.

1272
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,240
Sure, you go name them.

1273
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:54,680
Name the ticks.

1274
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:54,940
That's sweet.

1275
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,800
That's real sweet.

1276
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,940
You'll name them and then kill them.

1277
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:58,520
This one I'll get.

1278
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,520
Name them and name them.

1279
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,860
That's pickle.

1280
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:00,420
You die.

1281
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,120
Name them and name them.

1282
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:02,620
Well, that sounds.

1283
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,940
I like my new murder.

1284
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:04,300
I like my new murder.

1285
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,060
Boy, look.

1286
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,500
There's little Henrietta tick.

1287
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,120
Bam.

1288
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,800
There she goes.

1289
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,140
Yeah.

1290
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,280
And there's a cactus pops up right where they die.

1291
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,960
Little swiney Margaret pig ticklet.

1292
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,440
There you go.

1293
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,420
Kill, kill, kill.

1294
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,680
And Eric, the impossible.

1295
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,560
Kill, kill.

1296
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,460
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

1297
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,100
And.

1298
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,880
All his unrequited loves.

1299
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,380
Yeah, right.

1300
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,180
He's naming them after the unrequited loves.

1301
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,140
Joe Zed.

1302
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,380
What a stupid name.

1303
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,920
I hate that's not even a real name.

1304
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,460
But kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

1305
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,600
I can't think of any that didn't think of it.

1306
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,260
Getting like flies.

1307
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,000
It's just like there's like thousands of them now.

1308
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,740
It's like open this thing up and you start shooting.

1309
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,280
Hey, man.

1310
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:36,620
Don't go.

1311
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:36,980
You better.

1312
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,300
Yeah, you better get them.

1313
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,880
I mean, that's the whole idea.

1314
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,880
I got my cows down to.

1315
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,160
If you kill more, more will come.

1316
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,420
I'm holding this thing down and it's not making a dent in it.

1317
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,460
That desert's going to be full of cactuses in a minute.

1318
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:47,960
If you kill them, they will come.

1319
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,100
If you kill them, they will come.

1320
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,760
And maybe we will.

1321
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,960
Maybe we will too.

1322
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,440
What are you doing out there?

1323
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,000
They're starting to build up on the windshield now.

1324
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,040
I can't keep track of all these ticks.

1325
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:05,840
Those aren't ticks.

1326
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,080
Those are hogs, man.

1327
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,620
You got the ticks mixed up with the hogs.

1328
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,260
Oh, we're back to the pigs again.

1329
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,280
Oh, it's back to the pigs.

1330
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,520
The pigs grow ticks.

1331
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,280
The pigs have.

1332
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,200
They have all kinds of vernaculars for the different little fleas and stuff on their bodies.

1333
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:19,620
I'm tired.

1334
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:20,920
I'm tired too.

1335
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,400
I'm bored with torturing lonesome cowboys.

1336
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,140
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1337
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:26,880
He's not a worthy victim.

1338
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,140
I'm not a worthy victim.

1339
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,680
Why don't you let me out of here?

1340
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,880
I think we should end it.

1341
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,800
Or for us anyway.

1342
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,700
We can leave him.

1343
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,000
No.

1344
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,720
Why don't you end it for me too?

1345
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,440
This has the ticks to keep him company.

1346
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,200
Do you want to go to escape land?

1347
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:37,560
We do.

1348
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,480
We can leave him with the ticks and the pigs.

1349
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,140
I'll give him the pigs.

1350
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,700
Let's stop by Sex Hurt Land on the way.

1351
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,180
Oh, OK.

1352
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,320
That's between my neck.

1353
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,480
And the restrooms.

1354
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:44,980
Right.

1355
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,540
We need to pick up some of the organs that he left in there.

1356
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,040
Oh, yeah.

1357
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,020
I could use a few more.

1358
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,380
He's sweating profusely.

1359
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,180
He went behind his barbecue apron.

1360
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,620
Jesus Christ almighty.

1361
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,580
I can't keep track of all these.

1362
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,460
God, if only it was just a show.

1363
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,080
I've had enough.

1364
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,140
I've had enough too.

1365
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,220
Do I actually get to get out of here?

1366
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:14,980
Well, what that was was the tail end of the lonesome cowboy Dave

1367
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:19,800
in hell sequence starring Sister Mary Squared and lonesome cowboy Dave

1368
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,300
on WCSB in Cleveland.

1369
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:31,080
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1370
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:35,440
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1371
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:39,300
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1372
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:44,260
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1373
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:44,960

01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,100
75214.

1375
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:52,000
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1376
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,640
75214.

1377
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,740
Stay tuned and praise Bob.
