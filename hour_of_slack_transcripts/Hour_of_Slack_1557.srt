1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:13,320
I'm dreaming of the subgenius power of swatting.

2
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:31,560
Yes, dear friends, and welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,440
In this case, number 1074, or 75, or I don't know why.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,180
Because friends, in this show, and in the last couple,

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,400
and in the next few, we are traveling through time.

6
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,980
Yes, we are delving deep into the past of the subgenius church.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,800
And in seeing exciting and terrifying memories,

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,900
and things you never knew before.

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,100
Are you ready?

10
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,720
Because it's going to be quite a trip.

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,780
It's been quite a trip for me, friends.

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,300
We're doing this for the Maybe Logic Academy online course.

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,080
A course in how to run your own mind control cult, do's and don'ts.

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,800
And history of the church of the subgenius the first 100 years.

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,360
Honest.

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,420
If you don't believe me, check out maybelogic.org.

17
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:38,640
Anyway, friends, we've been studying the events of the years of 1981 and 1982.

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,820
And 1980.

19
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,560
And 1980.

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,140
The early years when we first encountered our dear, dear friends,

21
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,140
such as Palmer Freedies of Lies,

22
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,320
a dead woman of puzzling evidence,

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,620
St. J. King,

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,600
St. Byron Werner,

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,660
Pope Sternodox Kiekefer,

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,040
St. Janger Hypercletes,

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,840
and the great Snavely Eklund,

28
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,160
and so forth, friends.

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,480
Yes.

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,740
Well, so join me

31
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,600
as we go, in this episode,

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,480
back in time to the year of 1981,

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,540
the time of the first world subgenius convention,

34
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,460
which luckily was filmed professionally by Larry Silkus of Showtime's What's Up America.

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,680
That's why some of the audio actually sounds pretty good in these.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,040
And friends, the spirit was so high.

37
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,880
And so were we, I must admit, in some cases.

38
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,160
Not all of the doctors survived.

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,920
Those early years.

40
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,420
Some lost their faith in Bob.

41
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,980
Some lost their love of Reverend Stang.

42
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,880
Some just simply died.

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,500
Quite a few have died since then.

44
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,080
It's a shame.

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,700
Anyway, friends,

46
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,000
you will see and hear in your mind's eyeball

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,340
the fervor and the intensity

48
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,580
of the early subgenius.

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,320
The early subgenius years,

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,600
when Bob was new to us,

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,080
and we had just rediscovered our own inborn slack.

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,400
Uh, yes, yes, yes.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,440
And so, friends, won't you join me

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,520
as we pull the lever back

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,960
on our machine,

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,680
our Wayback Machine,

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,160
and watch as the calendar pages fall away,

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,420
night and day,

59
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,980
flap like a giant black wing,

60
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,320
and we watch the seasons wheel,

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,640
and pass in reverse,

62
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,340
going back, back, back,

63
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
to the year of 1981,

64
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,100
and the beginning.

65
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,880
So actually, this was in November,

66
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,380
uh, 20, 21 and 22,

67
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,100
the day of the John F. Kennedy re-assassination,

68
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,180
and the 1981 first World Subgenius Convention

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,060
in Dallas.

70
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,440
And we're going to be doing a little bit of a tour

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,240
of the convention,

72
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,240


73
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,260
of the convention.

74
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,260
But what is there

75
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,520
is Kilar, man, Kilar.

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,840
It will be, it will be breaking our brain cells asunder.

77
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,500
We'll mix it in the water supply at the convention.

78
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,440
I think we should put it in the hamburgers that we give away.

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,820
Uh, Doug, I'm sorry.

80
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,220
The Kool-Aid.

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,160
You, Jim, you'll have to pardon Doug.

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,380
His mind is completely gone since the convention.

83
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,300
He still thinks it's, it's going to happen.

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,300


85
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,300


86
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,300


87
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,300


88
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,300


89
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,300


90
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,300


91
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,300


92
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,300


93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,500
He doesn't realize that it's already happening.

94
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,100
It's over with.

95
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,400
The convention will be a great success.

96
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,540
I can see it now.

97
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:47,880
He already knows.

98
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,420
300 men dressed as Bob.

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,020
He already feels like it's going to be something in the near future.

100
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,120
Men and women with Bob masks marching down the main street straight to Dealey Plaza.

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,140
It's past safe.

102
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,140


103
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,140


104
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,140


105
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,540
Oh, we'll have a limousine with a,

106
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,020
Poor old Doug.

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,600
with a Jesus and a John Kennedy inside.

108
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,040


109
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,800
And his dreams get more and more bizarre every day.

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,140
We'll have everyone shoot at it with real guns.

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,280
And, oh, it's going to be a blast.

112
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,280


113
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,280


114
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,880
It will be wonderful.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,880
The froth and the water.

116
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,680
Tell Doug to send lots of tapes.

117
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,240
That's a perfect idea.

118
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,160
And Kool-Aid.

119
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,900
We'll force everyone to drink Kool-Aid.

120
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,540
Buck will bring the Kool-Aid.

121
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,040
Buck has a...

122
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:31,220
I should mention, friends, for the sake of clarity, that back in those days, I was Doug

123
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,940
Smith.

124
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,380
There were too many Dugs in the church.

125
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,100
There's also Doug Wellman of Puzzling Evidence.

126
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,260
And, so, I became I.D.

127
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:42,260


128
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,720
And I became a

129
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,580
So, this is the big time.

130
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
So, this is the world subgenius convention.

131
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,420
Six or seven guys standing around with their eyes half open.

132
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,440
I bet you guys sitting around picking their notes.

133
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,260
I bet you guys sitting around picking their notes.

134
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,940
Poo-da, poo-da, whoa, can I.

135
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,740
None of them are the real dicks.

136
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,640
We have to have all those dicks on hand.

137
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,480
Just in case the convention gets too big and there's more people than we expect.

138
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,680
And if we don't have anything left to do, we'll pass out the dicks and let them all

139
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,800
have a...

140
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,240
Well, these dicks only last about five minutes.

141
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,220
But they will get their taste of what it's like to have a Bob dick.

142
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,340
Yes, indeedy.

143
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,260
All right.

144
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


145
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


146
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


147
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


148
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


149
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


150
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


151
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


152
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


153
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,260


154
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,620
And what do you think, Doug?

155
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,400
Do you think it would be in poor taste to put Bob dicks on everybody and Bob...

156
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,720
And more especially than that, the Bob dicks we can forego.

157
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,220
But what about putting Bob heads on 50 to 150 people, carting them down to Dealey Plaza

158
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,780
for 15 minutes?

159
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,460
That's all the time any of us have to record the scene.

160
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,760
15 minutes.

161
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,300
Hell, that's four Super 8 cartridges.

162
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,620
That's a change and a half in an Aeroflex.

163
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,740
So I say, yeah.

164
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,420
What do you say, Doug?

165
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,020
I really...

166
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,860
I mean, here in Dallas, Dealey Plaza is sort of a sacred place, but most people have forgotten

167
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,040
who that guy was that got shot there.

168
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,880
And like me, they didn't even know where it was.

169
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,820
So, you know, now they will.

170
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:37,280
They'll know that Dealey Plaza is where 500 Bobs shot the President and the pictures of

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,060
the 500 Bobs shooting the President.

172
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,600
And I want to know what...

173
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:41,600


174
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,340
What part you want to play in this.

175
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,140
I mean, Doug, this Dealey Plaza thing, you haven't said anything about it, hardly, except

176
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,700
for the black cardboard limousine and wanting to do some separate shoots earlier in the

177
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,920
charade.

178
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,660
But, I mean, surely you must have a role in this great...

179
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,320
This is like a damn passion play.

180
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
How much of the convention is ready, Dr. Drummond?

181
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,020
How much of the convention is actually ready?

182
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,140
Oh, it's about 72.8% ready.

183
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,420
It's Friday night at 6 o'clock?

184
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,120
Nope, it's 72.9.

185
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,340
But if nothing else, I can get the big piece out.

186
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,320
Focus up on the face, please.

187
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,140
Hey, what's up?

188
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,700
So I had a good time with you in Dallas.

189
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,560
What a job.

190
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,180
Hey, man, I thought there was going to be 20 people here tonight.

191
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,220
I don't know who.

192
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,540
Aren't there, huh?

193
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,520
Maybe there will be.

194
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,520
We won't even go.

195
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,900
I mean, earlier I've been thinking, I've been thinking, you know, there couldn't be

196
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,820
too few people.

197
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,660
But now I'm thinking, I hope there is, you know, I hope there's very few people.

198
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,540
Yeah!

199
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,280
Where did the mix board go?

200
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,720
The biggest panel discussion.

201
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,400
Yeah!

202
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:02,840
Yeah!

203
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:03,940
Woo!

204
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,920
Two microphones to every garage, two chicken in every amplifier.

205
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's have it.

206
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,420
Oh, boy.

207
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:39,740
People in the room, there's been somebody in the other room saying they heard the

208
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:39,740


209
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:39,780


210
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:39,780


211
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:39,780


212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:53,560
We represent a segment of the myriad doctor bands abounding now from coast to coast.

213
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,100
Have you been getting news on doctor bands?

214
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,840
Doctors for Odin, Doctors for Wotan, Black and White Oakland, Doctors for Pain,

215
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,560
Doctors for Bob, the Arch Emulators.

216
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,300
There's Devo who's stolen everything.

217
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,240
Quiet!

218
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,540
Has life been bending you over lately, brothers and sisters?

219
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,920
Has it been your night in the barrel for the past few months?

220
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,700
Have you been down so long it looks like up to you?

221
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,040
Well, the problem is not a lack of Jesus, no!

222
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,700
The problem is not a lack of Yahweh, no no no!

223
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,280
The problem is not a lack of the Reverend Moses!

224
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,240
The problem is a lack of slack!

225
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,780
A lack of slack!

226
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,960
A lack of slack!

227
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,880
A lack of slack!

228
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,800
A lack of slack, children!

229
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,360
The conspiracy's all around you, it surrounds you, it's in these walls.

230
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,320
Look at that paneling!

231
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,720
Ordinarily that would be conspiracy paneling, conspiracy floorboards, and ass-deadening conspiracy chairs!

232
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,160
Right from your high school gymnasium, but tonight those chairs, that paneling, those grints, that floorboard,

233
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,280
this floor, it's dead!

234
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,420
It belongs to Bob!

235
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,040
It's Bob's floorboard!

236
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,020
It contains slack!

237
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,520
It delivers slack up until you lay barely!

238
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,780
Give me a slack!

239
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,780
Slack!

240
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,300
Give me another slack!

241
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,140
Slack!

242
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,240
Good God almighty!

243
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,660
Come forward, young man!

244
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,860
The voice is normal speed, should be normal speed on this recording.

245
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,740
If the batteries are still...

246
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,760
Yeah, here in Texas everything's gen time, it's tough.

247
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,300
Well, anybody who knows how to play high school...

248
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,160
Ha ha ha ha!

249
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,420
Ha ha ha ha!

250
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,140
Oh, hell no!

251
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,240
It is...

252
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,600
We're here at the beginning of the subgenius.

253
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,120
Tape on your situation.

254
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,360
And you, you, dear over-modulated friends, are here on the right channel.

255
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,220
But does that stop us?

256
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,360
No!

257
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,680
It doesn't stop Doug Smith.

258
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,480
You'll be able to hear on the exciting left channel...

259
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,280
Thanks to Cheekasm, to your area.

260
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,420
In the background, Dr. Philo Garner on saxophone.

261
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,640
Ivan Stang on speech.

262
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,760
Palmer Vides.

263
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,480
Palmer Vides on bass guitar.

264
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,480
The unknown musician on lead guitar.

265
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,100
And Mr. Cheekasm himself, unconsciously inside the bass drum.

266
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,780
Okay.

267
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,860
Now I'd like to...

268
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,380
Ha!

269
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,200
What?

270
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,180
Stop!

271
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,560
Ha!

272
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:35,360


273
00:13:35,360 --> 00:14:05,360


274
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:35,360


275
00:14:35,360 --> 00:15:05,360


276
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,340
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,620
What does it say?

278
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,160
Rockwang Odin Wotang.

279
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,880
I believe that the message got through to our children out there tonight.

280
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,520
And that's why I came here, was to try and influence our young persons.

281
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,940
To try to better...

282
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,520
And this young man, of course, was saved.

283
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,640
Saved, and I'm trying to say bye.

284
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,880
Praise Bob, brother.

285
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,540
Praise Bob!

286
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,320
Praise Bob, brother.

287
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,440
Praise, of course, the sacrificial victim.

288
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:30,920
Yeah.

289
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,860
That's right.

290
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,040
How did you feel, Bob?

291
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,580
When you were there on the block?

292
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,220
It was weird, man.

293
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,580
Because I was just laying there.

294
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,020
It was like every refrigerator you had ever opened in your life all day.

295
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,660
It was Tom Kato for beer.

296
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,860
The problem with the subgenius is they don't pay well.

297
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,700
There's not enough money in this.

298
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,900
Yeah, I don't think the Cadillac that I got was good pay.

299
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,800
I mean, that by itself is...

300
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,140
I can get a Cadillac.

301
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,940
My parents already got me three Cadillacs.

302
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,120
I don't care about that stuff.

303
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,060
The business is to use time.

304
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,060


305
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,560
And what I was trying to say was, you know, I don't know how to do it.

306
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:04,560


307
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:04,560


308
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:04,560


309
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:04,560


310
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,200
You know, the TV dinners and the room with the fair mama while I'm here.

311
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,640
Is that supposed to be money?

312
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,500
The nine irons that you accumulated breathed not into your loathful...

313
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:12,860
Is that something that...

314
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,000
What?

315
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,060
Is that the room with the fair mama?

316
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,400
Yeah.

317
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,600
Oh, God.

318
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,220
Yeah, I'm sorry.

319
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,120
They're paying for it?

320
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,800
No.

321
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,660
You said your neighbors' nine irons were...

322
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:19,680
No.

323
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,040
Not for you.

324
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,560
Yeah, but...

325
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
But for the camera, yes.

326
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,080
They're paying for it.

327
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,180
Bob Ecclesians, 15, verse 33, day 66.

328
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,080
Wow, holy .

329
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,820
For low Arnold Palmer's first words, his first utterances were, .

330
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,320
How about that?

331
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,840
This is just...

332
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:33,840


333
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:33,840


334
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:33,960
Is that the way you feel?

335
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,900
Yeah, well, I'm real glad I flew down from Oregon to this, you guys.

336
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,780
Yeah, yeah, I've spent all that money to come here.

337
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,940
Yeah, I'm real glad I think I'm going to get fired from my job for taking off the whole last half of the league.

338
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,200
Big deal, right?

339
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,940
Yeah, I'm so glad to be here.

340
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,960
I mean, it's like...

341
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,000
Thanks anyway, Doug.

342
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,220
Yeah, where's Bob, Doug?

343
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,160
Many people may wonder, who is Gebro Frank?

344
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,800
What is his message for humanity today?

345
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,940
What is the difference between Gebro Frank, for instance, and Jehovah Warren?

346
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,220
What's the difference between Gebro Frank and he, Jehovah Frank?

347
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,140
How come we always talk about Wotan instead of Jehovah Warren?

348
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,980
How come we always talk about Wotan instead of Wotan?

349
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,080
Yeah, yeah, I mean, what kind of odiness are we?

350
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,700
How come all you people pay $10?

351
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,140
No, I can't wait for the convention.

352
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,120
I can't wait for the convention.

353
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,740
It's wonderful.

354
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,820
Well...

355
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,580
Put Jim down on the Xeroxes.

356
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,640
I was going to roll a smeeper of 14.

357
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,600
Are you ready to receive slack, child?

358
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,540
I do.

359
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,280
Stand there before him.

360
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,280
Come this way.

361
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,480
Boys, is this young man ready for slack?

362
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,240
Is this man ready to receive?

363
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,120
Follow him. Come here.

364
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,320
Come here.

365
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,380
Come here.

366
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,980
All of you, come here.

367
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,860
Yes, you and you.

368
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Hold still, young man.

369
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,240
Hold still.

370
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,320
Stay right here.

371
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,040
Stay right here.

372
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,740
When we lay hands on this boy, look for the spirit of the conspiracy to leave the room.

373
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
But stand next to him and hold his arm.

374
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,940
This might be violent.

375
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,680
This might be violent.

376
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,360
Give me that.

377
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,100
When the conspiracy leaves this boy, take his other arm.

378
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,920
When the conspiracy leaves this boy, the force will be violent.

379
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,640
It's not a fit sight for children.

380
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,820
Take off that mask, son.

381
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,340
Are you ready, boy?

382
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,380
Hey, Douglas.

383
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,160
Watch your eyes, ladies and gentlemen.

384
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,660
When the conspiracy leaves this boy, this room will become a place for the devil.

385
00:18:59,660 --> 00:18:59,660


386
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,500
And I'm not responsible for the forces unleashed.

387
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,700
You saw the Raiders of the Lost Ark.

388
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,940
And when a Nazi scum opened that artifact and they were turned to wax.

389
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,900
You saw the end of the devil's reign.

390
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,260
And when Ernest Borne un-melted before your eyes.

391
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,640
That's nothing compared to the force of the conspiracy.

392
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,480
But the force of the conspiracy always yields to the force of whom?

393
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,620
To the force of whom?

394
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,940
To the force of whom?

395
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,560
I'm going to lay hands on this boy.

396
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,280
Are you ready, son?

397
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,660
Yes, sir.

398
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,000
Silence, please.

399
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,420
When I lay hands on this boy, I want to out.

400
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:43,100
In the name of our conspiracy, McDonald's French fries, Trans Am T38 with those white

401
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,880
mag wheels, and chrome reflecting glass buildings, leave this boy!

402
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
Now, hit it.

403
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,940
The power bomb.

404
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,560
The plan!

405
00:19:59,620 --> 00:19:59,640
The plan!

406
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,640


407
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,640


408
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,640


409
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,640


410
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,640


411
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,640


412
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,640


413
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,340
The sacred power of Bob.

414
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,960
Will the pipe bring this boy back?

415
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,300
Yes!

416
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,780
The force of the conspiracy is strong.

417
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,460
But the force of Bob is stronger.

418
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
A pump on the Bob pipe will free this boy.

419
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,160
He rises!

420
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,000
He rises!

421
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,600
He's filled with the spirit of Bob!

422
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,060
Say hallelujah!

423
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,560
Say hallelujah!

424
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,220
Say Hosanna!

425
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,640
Raise your hands!

426
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,100
Woo!

427
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,620
Raise your hands!

428
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:29,620


429
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:29,620


430
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:29,620


431
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:29,620


432
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:29,620


433
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,140
Children!

434
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,760
Raise your hands!

435
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,420
Woo!

436
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,080
It looks like your problems are all over.

437
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,420
Yeah?

438
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,720
I bet.

439
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,920
Well, it looks like there's nothing left for you to do but cut down.

440
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,500
Well, it was a weird, strange experience.

441
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,740
I wasn't expecting it, but I accepted it.

442
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,040
And now, though?

443
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,040


444
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,440
Was that a good rant?

445
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,860
You can.

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,480
But I thought he'd never do it.

447
00:20:59,520 --> 00:20:59,600
I thought he'd never do it.

448
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,600


449
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,600


450
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,600


451
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,600


452
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,600


453
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,600


454
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,600


455
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,600


456
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,600


457
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,760
I thought this subjeaned shirt was a lie that never gave me industrial consultation

458
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,900
or exorcism of the demon Negi.

459
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
But I found out I was wrong.

460
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,480
It's a bit of cheating.

461
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,320
With the love and the hate of Bob.

462
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:12,700
We'll see.

463
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,260
We'll see.

464
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,480
We'll see how long this transformation lasts.

465
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,440
We'll see if people should spend their money for this.

466
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,160
We'll see if it's as useful to you as your high school diploma.

467
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,540
Whatever.

468
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,540
Go to high school in bedroom slippers.

469
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,680
Yeah.

470
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,600
Appreciate it.

471
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


472
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


473
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


474
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


475
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


476
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


477
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


478
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


479
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,100
I'm speaking in tongues.

480
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,260
Is this doctors for Bob or some cheap invitation?

481
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,280
Or is this doctors for Bob that blows the reed out of even toy saxophones?

482
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,860
Or is this an entirely different bunch of doctors?

483
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
It doesn't really matter what kind of doctor.

484
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,420
I mean, there's general practitioners.

485
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,460
There's orthodontists.

486
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,680
There's orthopedists.

487
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,040
There's podiatrists.

488
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,580
There's doctors for all kinds of things.

489
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,660
There's pediatricians.

490
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,560
There's pediatrists.

491
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:31,920
There's pederasts.

492
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,520
There's all kinds of guys to fix up what you need.

493
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,740
But really, you've got to ask yourself.

494
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,060
Is it the doctor you need or is it just the pills?

495
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,460
Wouldn't the pills be fine?

496
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,380
I mean, that way you don't have to go sit around in the waiting room and hope Dr. Chet

497
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,520
never can get to you.

498
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,520
You don't have to talk to all those dumb nurses and write them a check.

499
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,580
You can just sit at home and get those pills from the mail.

500
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,320
Really, that's all you need?

501
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:03,900
Probably.

502
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,800
The pills?

503
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,580
The pills?

504
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,060
Well, it might help to get a better attitude.

505
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,100
That's the whole difference between life and medical situation.

506
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,940
We're not prepared to consult with you about it until we've talked to your bank.

507
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,800
That truly you must lead the child as the father to the man.

508
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,700
Which man?

509
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,960
The man.

510
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,200
The man!

511
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,280
The man!

512
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,260
The man!

513
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,720
The man!

514
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:29,900
The man!

515
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,540
The man!

516
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,520
Hey, there's the man!

517
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,300
Well, officially, Philo, any comments before the end?

518
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,340
Just waiting for the Transfiguration.

519
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,860
Oh, sorry.

520
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,980
The Transfiguration is tonight.

521
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,320
It's tonight.

522
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,420
It's going to happen to me in just a few short minutes.

523
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,500
You're going to behold the Transfiguration on that stage.

524
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm going to perform the Transfiguration on that stage.

525
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,560
What moves?

526
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,220
I'm going to come on demure.

527
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,940
I'm going to start off leading the child.

528
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,320

You can't blame me for askin' Doug.

No, I can't.

540
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,220
Yeah, it feels sorta like...

541
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,920
sorta like that time of...

542
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,060
well, I better not talk about that time,

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,860
but that other time,

544
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,420
yeah, it feels like that.

545
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,220
It was like that time.

546
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,660
Yeah, that was pretty...

547
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,800
yeah, it was just like that.

548
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,820
I haven't felt this way since...

549
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,480
well, since...

550
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,520
since the...

551
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,480
World's Simpsons, this convention.

552
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,840
Maybe it's okay, maybe it's...

553
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,480
You mean you spent $700 to come to this convention of 580?

554
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,940
No, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, take one of these pills.

555
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,220
Where can I get one of these pills?

556
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,640
$300.

557
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,000
Wait, wait, wait.

558
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,900
That pill's too big.

559
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,620
You'll kill me.

560
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,360
You're flippin' your back to God.

561
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,940
No, take that pill.

562
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,540
Listen, you'll hear laughter in your head.

563
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,220
That pill's too big, it'll choke me, it'll kill me.

564
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,600
It's okay.

565
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,340
No, no, go ahead, go ahead.

566
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,180
It'll work, it'll work.

567
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,120
I did it, I did it.

568
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,480
All right, all right, I'll break it up.

569
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,380
Hey, this pill tastes, tastes, it tastes, it tastes kinda good.

570
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,040
In fact, I'm starting to feel pretty good.

571
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,320
Whoa!

572
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,640
There's Bob.

573
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,560
There's Bob.

574
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,400
He's been here all along.

575
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,760
Yeah!

576
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,940
Yeah!

577
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,520
Yeah!

578
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:01,960
That's right!

579
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,820
The one-take rhythm killers!

580
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,120
The music haters!

581
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
The jackasses!

582
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,460
The jackasses!

583
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,100
The Jackasses!

584
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,540
The Shitty Beetles!

585
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,460
The Shitty Beetles!

586
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,380
Also known as Doctors for Bob!

587
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,420
The men of covenant men!

588
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,440
Jehovah-One made a covenant with us!

589
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,220
He's met a mighty man!

590
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,780
Mighty healing!

591
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,500
Doctors for Bob!

592
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,080
Woo!

593
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,820
Robert!

594
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,620
All hail Doctors For Bob!

595
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,180
Doctors For Bob!

596
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,300
Doctors For Bob!

597
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,880
Boo!

598
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,460
Boo!

599
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,960
Doctors for Bob!

600
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,600
Doctors for Bob!

601
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,680
Doctors!

602
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,500
Doctors for Bob!

603
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:15,220
That's right, and a lot of you people who haven't spent enough money yet can talk Philo about getting the foot gland operation.

604
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,300
He is doing that during this convention.

605
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,020
He was a little bit drunk last night.

606
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,100
There will be rumors of our doctors for Bob present for glanscaping.

607
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,320
Another clinic has just been recently constructed in Dallas.

608
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,440
You no longer have to incur the expenses of flying all the way to Malaya.

609
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,620
Yeah, and the one that was burned down in Little Rock is...

610
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,520
Well, it's way to the end.

611
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,700
Thanks to your donations.

612
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,900
That's right.

613
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,320
But we can always use more, that doesn't mean...

614
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:51,140
But in the meantime, if you really think there's something dreadfully wrong with you,

615
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,720
well, we're Samaritans, we're here to help the masses of the ill people, the sick, the depraved, the tired people.

616
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,480
And it's not the pills, it's not the prescriptions, it's not the doctors or the below.

617
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,400
We're here to help you in whatever way we can.

618
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:14,580
Well, then maybe the music of heaven itself can serve to clean out those...

619
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,380
Well, the tubes of things that you have.

620
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,300
The tubes that are plugged up.

621
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,220
The tubes that are plugged up maybe by having a little bit too much money on you.

622
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,940
Yes, you can unplug those tubes.

623
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,660
We can sit down with you.

624
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,260
It won't take more than a half hour initial session.

625
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,520
You can fill out one of the applications for us.

626
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,460
Fill out our straighted application.

627
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,460
You'll walk out of here with a bucket of pills.

628
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Yeah, a bucket of pills.

629
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,860
A big of pills.

630
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,020
They're big pills, they're little pills.

631
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,020
We got little tiny pills.

632
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:53,120
Some of the pills, some of the pills you can crack open and pour them out into a glass of water or a glass of coke.

633
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,040
Some of the pills you have to put in other places besides your mouth.

634
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:03,740
Some of the pills, well, some of the pills you just put them in your shirtline, keep them near your heart all day.

635
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,920
Some of the pills, well, they're dangerous.

636
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,100
And you should operate machinery when you're on those pills.

637
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,920
What else do pills have to do with that?

638
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,760
Well, it depends upon if you're talking about the buckets of pills or the quarts of pills.

639
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,620
Like we're talking about, and what we mean by a bunch of pills is not like half a bathtub full of pills.

640
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,900
What is the world, not a half a reality of those rotten buckets of pills.

641
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,120
And we're talking about it not being much fun when Johnny Law comes here and takes them pills away.

642
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,280
It's not much more trouble than these pills that we're talking about.

643
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,600
It's called the very simply put the bunch more theory.

644
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:47,100
In other words, if you send us a little money now, we guarantee you'll get a bunch more later.

645
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,540
Not a little bit more, not just, not just this much, not just this much more.

646
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,600
Not just this much more, not just this much more.

647
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:59,060
The ring lock was money, I'm talking a bunch more money.

648
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,660
A bunch more money.

649
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,620
Raise the bar.

650
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,080
Raise the bar.

651
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:10,680
And with the word of Bob becoming nothing but worn out cliché, that's when we'll get a whole bunch more.

652
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,480
If you'll meet us behind the park closet building, thank you my son.

653
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,740
Oh yes, thank you.

654
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,720
Thank you.

655
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:16,720


656
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,080
Thank you.

657
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,680
Thank you.

658
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:18,960


659
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:27,020
One of the floor work has just thrown a large handful of pocket change at the doctors.

660
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,820
We don't use money in a traditional way.

661
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,000
And you, Sheriff?

662
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,940
I'm supposed to honor your work.

663
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,780
I mean I'm gonna get it.

664
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,300
We used to call it looking money.

665
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,380
To Hey

666
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,020
Well don't be going capture annually.

667
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,360
By 2019 you can use the New Trump Standard Lifeгор.

668
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:57,480
We're gonna have to ask the Sheriff more than anything.

669
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:57,540
Of course, not if we're gonna create him by the end of 2024.

670
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,520
They're calling more and more as I'the term cuál don't know.

671
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:58,840


672
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,120
Well, part and parcel.

673
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,140
What took the respected youtube channel gave solving the problem.

674
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,820
I told you the first time we saw was a joke about what you kept Homer in the Titanic.

675
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:01,840
You're going to require a different country's government.

676
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:01,920
We'll have to change the character of the thing that we're off does.

677
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,240
They say the smoke, the souls are going up to heaven.

678
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,020
The blood head of John Kennedy is being rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital.

679
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,040
Wonderful.

680
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,520
Yes, I can see that the bloody head of John Kennedy is being rushed to Parkland Memorial

681
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,000
Hospital, leaving at the spot.

682
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,900
The memorial motorcade here, 18 years to the death.

683
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,100
Two days later, the head of John Kennedy was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital.

684
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,100


685
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,100


686
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,100


687
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,100


688
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,100


689
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,080
One day, after the sneaky head was still alive in Dallas.

690
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,780
How many members are there?

691
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,820
There's too many!

692
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,140
Any other misconceptions?

693
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,900
What do you do with the money?

694
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,280
There's three members.

695
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,240
Nobody knows the weight of Slackman's children.

696
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:29,640
I tell you what, nine-tenths of the continent of Asia have not yet heard the word of God.

697
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,860
These people need to be told.

698
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:31,880
They're not going to be told the word of God.

699
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:31,880


700
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,300
We've got millions of Bob's. I've got two Eplets in 65 different languages.

701
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,980
It's Bob's pills. It all comes together.

702
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,820
And one of the exes has to do with us.

703
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,260
Well, the exes have brought these invented pills down.

704
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,640
There's an exes in there.

705
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,660
I can see two.

706
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,860
I can see two.

707
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,260
I can see the exes.

708
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,140
I want to know about the exes.

709
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,600
Yeah, there they are.

710
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,060
It's not a manner of liking exes or disliking them.

711
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,920
It's a problem.

712
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,420
Being around them.

713
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,880
Or not finding them.

714
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,060
Or having to get your license in an exes area.

715
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,900
You guys are a band of doctors, right?

716
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,560
Right.

717
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,280
We're actually three different bands.

718
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,140
There's three different bands represented in this case.

719
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,380
Doctors for Bob is...

720
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,840
Historically the father band.

721
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,700
Spawning an unlimited number of other doctor bands.

722
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,180
Which this...

723
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,580
This fads of genius music is making us a lot of money right now.

724
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,020
And that's my primary motivation for being here.

725
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,140
Bob has very little to do with everything.

726
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,080
And a lot to do about this.

727
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,260
So, have a proposition like this.

728
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,720
What about our father's daughter who did ask us?

729
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,240
What about our father's daughter who did ask us?

730
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,860
I'm gonna get her out of a window.

731
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,640
No comment.

732
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,520
Oh yeah, I'm crying.

733
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,160
I'm cryin'.

734
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,160
I'm cryin' a lot.

735
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,580
I'm cryin' a whole lot.

736
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,080
I'm cryin' a lot, lot.

737
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm cryin' real lot of much a whole lot.

738
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,020
I'm cryin' so much it's spilling out buckets.

739
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,360
It's spilling out my house.

740
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,600
It's spilling out my yard.

741
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,420
It's spilling out my street.

742
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,200
The whole city's a river.

743
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,860
Cause I've been cryin' a lot.

744
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,940
Yeah, there's lots of water around.

745
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,520
From all the tear drops that's been squirtin' out of my head.

746
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,400
I think I'll cry a whole lot of tears.

747
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,460
Yeah, I've had tears.

748
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,920
I've squirted out of my head in the last minute and a half.

749
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,460
Oh now it's one second every second.

750
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,020
96 tears, they've squirted out of my head.

751
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh my head's a mess.

752
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000


753
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000


754
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000


755
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000


756
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000


757
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000


758
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,860
And I've been squirtin' tears a lot.

759
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,040
Then I turn around and I've squirted a lot more.

760
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,180
Oh, I've been cryin' 96 tears.

761
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,300
And I've squirted the town.

762
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,320
Now we're floatin' out.

763
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,000
Now we're in the ocean.

764
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,060
And we're floatin' around on a lot of tear drops.

765
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,400
Cause you left me.

766
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,640
And it's your fault, bitch.

767
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,240
You left me.

768
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,840
You've flooded the world.

769
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,740
It's your fault.

770
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,760
You have the lives of millions on your conscience for the rest of your life.

771
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,280
Because you left me.

772
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,500
And I've been cryin' a lot.

773
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,480
And I've squirted the world.

774
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:29,980
But I'm cryin' a lot.

775
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:29,980


776
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:29,980


777
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:29,980


778
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,900
Oh mama, look, I'm so mad at you I could just piss.

779
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,060
But if I piss some more, then it'll flood the rest of the world.

780
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,000
So I'm cryin'.

781
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,620
And I keep on cryin'.

782
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,300
And now it's your fault.

783
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,120
And all those people are dyin'.

784
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,620
Oh, I'm cryin'.

785
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,560
And baby, you can just go jump in the lake.

786
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,220
Cause I've been cryin', cryin', cryin'.

787
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,560
And don't come back no more.

788
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,680
I know you've been cryin'.

789
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Oh, I've been cryin' 96 tears.

790
00:35:59,800 --> 00:35:59,960
And I've squirted a lot.

791
00:35:59,960 --> 00:35:59,960


792
00:35:59,960 --> 00:35:59,960


793
00:35:59,960 --> 00:35:59,960


794
00:35:59,960 --> 00:35:59,960


795
00:35:59,960 --> 00:35:59,960


796
00:35:59,960 --> 00:35:59,960


797
00:35:59,960 --> 00:35:59,960


798
00:35:59,960 --> 00:35:59,960


799
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,480
Ninety-six million, it was plenty about 99.

800
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,880
Oh, ninety-six big tears.

801
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,200
I've cried...

802
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,040
Another day.

803
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,180
ật

804
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,320
But back at that time, when I was cryin' a lot,

805
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,880
I cried one big, old tear.

806
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,860
And it was the 96 big tears I've cried that day.

807
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:29,940
And it was over thing like this, baby.

808
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,040
that minute or that second, because I was crying a lot, I didn't keep track of all of them, and I cried,

809
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:42,240
but it was that one tear, that one big old giant tear, that one tear that just made my head split

810
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,800
open when I cried it out, yeah, I split my brains out, and my head was open, and I cried that one

811
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:55,880
giant big old tear, that was the tear that I sent back, because it was big, too big for me,

812
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:09,180
too big for me, too big for Smith and Jones, that one big old tear, was what I was crying,

813
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,780
and it took me two days to pass that tear, oh yeah, and I'm not lying, I passed that big old tear,

814
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:24,220
and I split my head and ripped it open, because it was crying a lot, and now, this next line is going to be

815
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,860
the end of the line.

816
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,680
Oh yeah.

817
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,580
Well, now that we're here in Potato Land, why don't we go searching for some of the things we couldn't find back in the real world?

818
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Ah, the convention. If I could control time, I'd be right back on that stage with Doctors for Wotan,

819
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,460
with our five guitarists, and horn section, and three synthesizers, and two drummers, and,

820
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,860
inspired madness.

821
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:12,920
My, my truth, Colin, of course, at the church, and the church is, let me assure you, making lots of money now.

822
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:23,580
I, Reverend Stang, took the money from the convention, and absconded with it.

823
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,400
I went to Bolivia,

824
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,600
with the convention right now.

825
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,840
And the foundation has been pretty much broke ever since.

826
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,480
I've left my post at Sacred Strive

827
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,440
and let young John Pretorius take over.

828
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,780
It's tough.

829
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,400
I mean, we literally do burn Sacred Strive out.

830
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,740
We burn them out about a year at a time.

831
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,820
I was about burned out.

832
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,340
So I've spent all the money.

833
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,160
I'm back in Dallas.

834
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,840
And I was supposed to be an overman by now,

835
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,620
but that didn't happen.

836
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,040
Still haven't had my third nostril open,

837
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,680
but they did do some of the surgery.

838
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,860
Biologed it a little bit

839
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,580
during the last Doctors for Wotan practice session.

840
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,680
We've never practiced.

841
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,220
Doctors for Wotan has never practiced.

842
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,160
We have only recorded albums.

843
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,360
And we've just recorded our 17th album,

844
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,420
this time using the new Japanese cheap synthesizers,

845
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,300
the Casios or Casios or whatever,

846
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,840
that Allsupgenius is now on,

847
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,700
along with their tape.

848
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,200
We're gonna record it.

849
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:26,880
Yeah!

850
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,300
Hey.

851
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,560
Okay, where's my...

852
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:29,900
What?

853
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,680
The wild Doctors for Wotan,

854
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,620
album number 18.

855
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,100
Yeah, we're glad you could all make it tonight.

856
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,540
Doctor Wotan over there is shooting up.

857
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,300
We're gonna have some Doctor time.

858
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,480
We're gonna be healing and cutting.

859
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,560
We're gonna be hurting and screaming.

860
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,960
We're gonna be a-fropping and a-cutting.

861
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,560
Yeah.

862
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,600
We'll get that fropping done.

863
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,900
We know the Froplords are with us.

864
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,460
Yeah.

865
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:55,760
Yeah.

866
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:55,760


867
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,600
Hey, there's the Froplord number six down there,

868
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,420
just in from Tibet.

869
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:58,740
Ha.

870
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,140
Yeah, same to you, Froplord number six.

871
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,640
The convention is over.

872
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,820
The subgeniuses are dead.

873
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,400
The convention is over.

874
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,260
The subgeniuses are dead.

875
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:23,680
Just turn off your music.

876
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,580
Okay, hold it up for a second.

877
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,720
I think I can.

878
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,440
I think I can.

879
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,160
I think I can.

880
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,020
I think I can.

881
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
I think I can.

882
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,340
I think...

883
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
I think I can.

884
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,360
I think...

885
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,380
I can.

886
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,800
I think I can.

887
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,660
I think I can.

888
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,620
I think I can.

889
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,040
Hey.

890
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,720
I hear a tank delay.

891
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,280
A tank coming in.

892
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,760
Zandy, you can be anything you want to be when you grow up.

893
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,940
Zandy, you can be a fireman.

894
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,680
Or you can be Spider-Man.

895
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,260
Or you can be a politician.

896
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,760
Or Zandy, you can be a terrorist and hurt people very much.

897
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,260
You can be what you want.

898
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,380
You can be what you want.

899
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,380
You can be what you want.

900
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,960
You can be what you want.

901
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,140
You can be what you want.

902
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,720
Do you hear a thud?

903
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,000
Snap films. We'll show snap films. We're doctors.

904
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,960
Prepare yourself.

905
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,800
Prepare yourself for the shock of your life.

906
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,260
You are about to come face to face with the most monstrous crime of all time.

907
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,020
For this is the story of a demagogue.

908
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,060
A demoniacal genius with criminal sadistic proclivities

909
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,680
and his ruthless cohort participants.

910
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,560
A story about a gang of killers

911
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,860
who embarked on a mass annihilation of millions of human beings.

912
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:07,580
Yeah!

913
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,740
Who are you?

914
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,480
Who are you?

915
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,220
Who are you?

916
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,340
Who is the god, the devil?

917
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,980
Come on.

918
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,780
What are you doing,itted,I know nothing.

919
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,620
What's up?

920
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,160
Who are you?

921
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,180
A denigrant!

922
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,780
A cheap and hand almost git-

923
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,980
Kneel your True does.

924
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,800
Give him your杣

925
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,200
.

926
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,200


927
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,200


928
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,200


929
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,280
.

930
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,880
But we're?,

931
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,760
Even the time contains enclosed game.

932
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,340
Now, how could we bring them back,

933
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,400
Was that paid for by the church of the subgenius?

934
00:42:52,340 --> 00:43:00,140
We demand that Roman law be replaced by German law!

935
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,540
And they accompanied their promises with music.

936
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,480
Martial music that was appropriate for millions of goose-stepping Germans.

937
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,480
Music that began with a fanfare and thundering drums.

938
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,620
Music that inflamed people with wild patriotic fervor.

939
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,240
Music that was a source of joy for the people of the world.

940
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:43,240


941
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,420
Like this march played by a Nazi stormtrooper band.

942
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,580
I barely even remember being on stage.

943
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,080
It's all like a dream.

944
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,580
And I drove home literally in a trance from Dallas.

945
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:27,500
As you can well imagine, that much input in that short of time

946
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:37,260
probably couldn't be endured by anyone less than an apprentice overman or overwoman.

947
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,380
As the case may be, over hermaphrodite.

948
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:50,420
Of which that species I'm sure were represented by more than a few examples.

949
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:58,720
I haven't had that much cerebral stimulation since I don't know when.

950
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,100
But Bob was there.

951
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,380
Bob was all over the tapes.

952
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,100
You never hear Bob's voice.

953
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:12,440
We can't release the tapes that have Bob speaking because of the voice print problems.

954
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,240
And I'm not sure if that's the case.

955
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,340
But the reenactments are on the way.

956
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,460
And Bob at the convention.

957
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,120
Bob did possess the living bodies of many great doctors.

958
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:23,980
Subgenius doctors.

959
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,100
Jane of hyperclites.

960
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,300
Sterno Keckhaver.

961
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,500
Even myself for a very short period of time.

962
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,160
Almost all of us were at different times possessed by Bob.

963
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,660
And every now and then something we say on those tapes is not being said by us.

964
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,180
It's being said by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

965
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,820
And believe you me.

966
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,400
Being the vessel for the voice of Bob can wear you out quicker than running a subgenius convention.

967
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,840
It can wear you out quicker than taking the drugs that show up at a subgenius convention.

968
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,660
Which by the way I did not do until the convention was over.

969
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,100
There is nothing like being possessed by Bob.

970
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,380
It is horrible.

971
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,760
And it's wonderful.

972
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,540
I mean look at me.

973
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,560
I've been able to abscond with all the bucks and spend it all.

974
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,220
And come back safe and sound.

975
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,700
And all the subgeniuses think it's fine.

976
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,660
Because yes I deserve it.

977
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,040
It's true.

978
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,540
I deserve all the money that the convention made.

979
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,260
Well I can't even go into any detail on that.

980
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,240
It was just such a resounding success.

981
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,440
So unbelievably financially successful.

982
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,440
That surely the mark of Bob was spurting all over it.

983
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,920
And I believe that it's important.

984
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,360
That there be a subgenius convention in your area.

985
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,420
In your area.

986
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,320
All I can say is gut blowout.

987
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,520
Unprecedent.

988
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:04,920
That was the absolute greatest party that I have ever attended in my entire existence in this life.

989
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:11,540
And I can only hope that the next convention will equal it.

990
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,580
I don't see how it possibly could.

991
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:21,760
Just from the point of Doctors for Bob being accepted as well as we were.

992
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,500
Blows my mind.

993
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,900
We've never had a receptive audience.

994
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,700
Much less an appreciative audience.

995
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,780
And to see.

996
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,860
To actually see.

997
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,780
The power of Bob kept me on my feet.

998
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,660
I only committed suicide once during the entire convention.

999
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,340
Was risen from the grave.

1000
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,080
Oh God you should have been there.

1001
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,200
But you will be there.

1002
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,240
You are there on the tape.

1003
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,840
When will we be sued?

1004
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,780
And which city will sue us?

1005
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,460
The answer to these and other questions.

1006
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,780
Probably will never be answered.

1007
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,060
And are we protected by the fact that we're now in the operating room?

1008
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,160
Are they going to nail us anyway for my house?

1009
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,680
They'll nail us.

1010
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,900
My little Bob-mobile.

1011
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:01,860
Hey.

1012
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,260
Hey.

1013
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,060
This subgenius convention is great.

1014
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:05,720
Hey.

1015
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,700
I work for People Magazine.

1016
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,480
I'm going to get you guys in there.

1017
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,580
For sure.

1018
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,980
You'll be big stars.

1019
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,060
And you'll make lots of money.

1020
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,220
Subgenius audience.

1021
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,100
Audience.

1022
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,360
Irritation techniques.

1023
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,920
Total success.

1024
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,540
The Bob-friend be praised.

1025
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,320
Well aren't you going to ask us about Elvis?

1026
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,060
Yeah.

1027
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,240
The mega-fifth of a lot.

1028
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,320
The Archangel of the Church of the Subgenius of Little Rock, Arkansas.

1029
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:47,000
This is one of the original schisms that was manifested in the first blight of dobsiple

1030
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,900
energy that descended upon central Arkansas, which has been referred to by Bob himself

1031
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,040
as the savage mind of the country's interior.

1032
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:02,500
The first temple was burnt to the ground by this radical, the RD conspiracy, which we'll

1033
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,060
go into later, threw a fire bomb into our first mega-fifth temple lodge, burned it to

1034
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,400
the ground. So we aligned ourselves immediately with the first feces temple

1035
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,500
Gog of Dobbs Orthodox and the first whiskey Glorp church and the first drug

1036
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:22,620
abuse church manifested by a chemical engineer Radon C-22. So this explains our

1037
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:27,980
involvement in the Dallas Clinch and the journeys that have taken place across

1038
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,880
the boundaries of the many states that were eliminated and have brought Texas

1039
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,000
and California and Arkansas together in an unholy triad can bring about this

1040
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,040
power that we're talking about to bring us unlimited slack in the form of

1041
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,980
hundred-dollar bills, thousand-dollar bills, and some such, you know, solid gold nine irons.

1042
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:56,840
I'm currently the sacred scribe just temporarily of the Church of the

1043
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,200
subgenius. I'm going to get out of the position as soon as I can because we

1044
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,400
burn the sacred scribes out very quickly.

1045
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,060
Sad, isn't it?

1046
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,560
I've been up since 11 o'clock at night yesterday.

1047
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,120
Sleep, brother.

1048
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,700
You can be by the head.

1049
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,780
You can be

1050
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,020
by the head.

1051
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,360


1052
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,360


1053
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,460
You can be

1054
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,000
in the head.

1055
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:51,180
But if you're not up the head, you're going to burn.

1056
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,300
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1057
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,320
That's what it is.

1058
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,860
Now you can lock it.

1059
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:02,860


1060
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,560
You can lock your bleeding head of San Tramino.

1061
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,300
You can skyrocket your head of Jack Nicklaus.

1062
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:16,500
You can bling your head of Sonny Fono.

1063
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,860
You can hurl your head of Didi Amin.

1064
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,220
You can lock your head of Ronald Reagan.

1065
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,120
You can lock your head of Arnold Palmer.

1066
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,860
But if you don't lock the head of Arnold Palmer, you're going to burn.

1067
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:40,060
If you don't lock the head of Arnold Palmer, you're going to burn.

1068
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:48,660
As Bob said to L. Ron Hubbard in the letter, he said, L. Ron, sure they may be pink, but

1069
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,780
their money is green.

1070
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:57,880
And this is why we know that the word of Bob can come through even in the time of payment.

1071
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,600
We're not asking for one penny for ourselves.

1072
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,800
If we get dollar bills, hell no.

1073
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,880
I won't tear them off, but it's the kids of the world that need to hear the word of

1074
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,120
Bob.

1075
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:12,860
Roman!

1076
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:13,980
Roman!

1077
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,060
Do you scan us on your view screen?

1078
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,340
Yes, Earthman, I see you.

1079
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,620
This means only one thing.

1080
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,300
You have decided to take the easy way out.

1081
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,600
No, Roman.

1082
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,800
We have fought you to a standstill.

1083
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,400
And we will go on doing it as long as necessary.

1084
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:32,780
I'm going to go and get my money.

1085
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:32,780


1086
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:37,680
If you try to figure out our position, you are wasting your time.

1087
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,740
None shall escape me.

1088
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,580
I shall find a way to rid this Earth planet of humans.

1089
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:45,920
No!

1090
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,600
We humans will not give up this bird of ours.

1091
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,560
But let me ask you something else.

1092
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,840
What do you have to fear from us?

1093
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,420
I want to know.

1094
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,980
I want to know.

1095
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:02,760
My heart.

1096
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,000
I want to know.

1097
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,040
I want to know.

1098
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:05,260


1099
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,220
I'm telling you that.

1100
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,740
Well, some people say you can't run, you can't have two people talking at one time

1101
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,500
on those tapes.

1102
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,500
That's right.

1103
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,820
We can't have two.

1104
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,140
We can't have three.

1105
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,220
We've got to have one.

1106
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,140
We've got to have four.

1107
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,800
We've got to have five.

1108
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,320
We've got to have six.

1109
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,340
We've got to have five.

1110
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:21,860
I read it.

1111
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,480
I don't care.

1112
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,640
You can imagine yourself.

1113
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,000
You won't understand.

1114
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,280
We can understand.

1115
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:26,760
No.

1116
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,220
We can understand.

1117
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,140
No.

1118
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,060
No.

1119
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,160
No.

1120
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,660
No.

1121
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:29,900
No.

1122
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,740
We can understand that.

1123
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:39,740


1124
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,980
No.

1125
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:43,060


1126
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:43,240
Me neither.

1127
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,960
And every night we fight.

1128
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,260
And when I say 평소, we both have to fight.

1129
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:47,760
We both have to know.

1130
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,200
We don't change.

1131
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,200


1132
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,200


1133
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,200


1134
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,200


1135
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,040
All four of the minutes are taken.

1136
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,040


1137
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,640
All four of the minutes are taken!

1138
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:55,760
Now now let's talk about setzen.

1139
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,880
�ουν 살ylene

1140
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,660
sy 이거

1141
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,560
All right.

1142
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:00,680
The man on my father's level.

1143
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:00,680


1144
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,760
Yeah?

1145
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,900
The power of Dobbs!

1146
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,740
This microphone is healed!

1147
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,520
Healed by the powers of Dobbs!

1148
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,780
The microphone is healed!

1149
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,540
Was that Dobbs over there?

1150
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,860
Did you see Dobbs?

1151
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,740
We have reports that Dobbs is here tonight

1152
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,780
in flesh, ladies and gentlemen.

1153
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,000
Was that Dobbs?

1154
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,300
Was that Dobbs on your foot?

1155
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,160
Was Dobbs right on your foot?

1156
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,260
I gotta swear I saw Dobbs!

1157
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,700
Was that...

1158
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,960
There's Dobbs! He's over there on the wall!

1159
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,300
There's Dobbs! There's a whole bunch of him right there!

1160
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,620
It's the Dobbs!

1161
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,800
The doctors do not need to know

1162
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,360
the law!

1163
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,560
The doctors defy the law!

1164
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,320
The doctors walk on all fours!

1165
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,740
The doctors do not need to know the law!

1166
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,840
Elijah could bring fire down from the sky

1167
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,780
in the eyes of men!

1168
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,700
David's mighty men were shielded from death

1169
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,360
by the covenant!

1170
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,040
Bob, Bob, though some people may maintain

1171
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,180
that the head is filled with plastic medical tubing

1172
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,440
and pumping fake theater blood through that damn thing.

1173
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,500
That's just a theory, though.

1174
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,320
It's coagulating. It's not true.

1175
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,120
Other people that might claim that it's the bleeding torso

1176
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,840
that demands recognition, that's not true either.

1177
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,780
We maintain that it is the head.

1178
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,940
There's a church that deals with it.

1179
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,700
I mean, neck up.

1180
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,380
I'm not bloody, but now,

1181
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,980
I'm a rotting, a rotting pussy head as opposed to a...

1182
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,680
Hello.

1183
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,460
Really?

1184
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,140
Really.

1185
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:33,440
Hello, Doug.

1186
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,260
One of our mottoes,

1187
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,540
Wounded head good, heel head bad.

1188
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,220
Well, you are now listening to...

1189
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,940
Wounded head good, heel head bad.

1190
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,400
...an interview with Palmer Reedys.

1191
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,040
Palmer Reedys.

1192
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,460
Doug Weldick.

1193
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,480
And Sternodon himself, who did most of the talking.

1194
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,600
Is this what it sounds like inside a subgenius's head?

1195
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,440
The big subgenius conference is going to be happening.

1196
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,620
The convention, the subcon.

1197
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,740
And I wouldn't be able to either if I was,

1198
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,680
if the convention was in Oakland,

1199
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,500
and I was cutting glass here and starving to death.

1200
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,280
I'm cutting glass in Oakland,

1201
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,680
I'm just starving to death.

1202
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,120
It's cold, it's wet outside.

1203
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,660
I wish I had the money to get on an airplane.

1204
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:52,540
I'd ride that sucker and I'd ride, ride, ride.

1205
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,320
Ride to Dallas, Texas,

1206
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,360
the subgenius convention.

1207
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,340
Get together and praise Bob.

1208
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,260
Ride to Dallas, Texas,

1209
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,700
and join all the subgeniuss,

1210
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,340
praising Bob for the job.

1211
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,060
I'm cutting glass in Oakland,

1212
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,280
I'm trying to make a buck.

1213
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:28,680
I'm trying to make a buck.

1214
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,700
Hoping if I keep going,

1215
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,460
I'll increase my luck.

1216
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:38,180
I'm hoping and I'm praying that things get better fast.

1217
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,300
If I don't improve,

1218
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,020
I don't know if I'm gonna last.

1219
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,520
Oh, I'm cutting glass in Oakland,

1220
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,960
hoping for Dallas, Texas,

1221
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,740
hoping that I get there before the X's.

1222
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,260
Cutting glass in Oakland,

1223
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,360
trying to make a buck.

1224
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,380
Hoping to improve my luck.

1225
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,160
Hoping to improve my luck.

1226
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,780
Music

1227
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,320
Well I won't be there in Dallas,

1228
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,260
November 22.

1229
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,260
You know I got a lot of things to do

1230
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,360
Hoping and I'm praying that I'll crawl from this hole

1231
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,000
Before them dice begin to roll

1232
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,300
Subvenience in Dallas, Texas

1233
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,240
On November 22

1234
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,780
I won't be there

1235
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,900
Celebrate with me

1236
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,500
I hope you are
