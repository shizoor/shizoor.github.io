1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,280
Oh yes, manifest occultation of a thought form. Yes.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,400
Yeah. They have a tachypneutism.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,400
Oh, to be sure. And strange.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,120
You know, that's interesting because, you know, that's really interesting.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,640
Yes. Give them false pride, false ego, false negativity, false power, false kick.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,380
And then you destroy them.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,900
So it wouldn't matter what they would endeavor to do. It would go all wrong.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,440
Yes.

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:47,060
And if they personally are not, they have in their employ those who are.

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,260
From PR News in Washington, I'm placed on administrative leave by sex priests

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,620
after a supreme pro-sex leader was killed in an apparent sex.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,100
Sex last yesterday. But Israel is praising the move.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,540
The Kremlin says to end PR News in Washington.

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,560
Oh, dear God.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,500
You see, my name's Billy and I just won king of the ring.

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,220
But there's one problem. Everybody still thinks that I absolutely suck.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,280
And then at that point, Billy.

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,480
Your house started to shake. The heavens opened up.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,240
And God himself spoke to you and said this.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,340
Bob, but my name's Billy.

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,180
It doesn't matter what your name is.

22
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,240
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,780
And our background music for the credits here will be Cyber Chump.

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,960
From their CD, Their Moment of Perfect Happiness.

25
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,540
And, uh...

26
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,720
Yes, this is the Hour of Slack once again.

27
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,220
And we're going to be hearing rants from different people.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,320
And new music from things or people.

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,500
Let's start with Onan Canobite.

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,850
Canobite. Doctor, father, uncle.

31
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,010
Onan Canobite.

32
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,630
Who, in some ways, is kind of like my co-speech writer.

33
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,870
I use his stuff.

34
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,290
I was about to say I use him.

35
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,830
But I don't like to think of it that way.

36
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,270
We use each other.

37
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,710
Anyway, here is Onan Canobite.

38
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,490
And this is happening.

39
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,730
She asked if I had anything further to say.

40
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,450
And now, a few years later, the answer is yes.

41
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,570
This is happening right now.

42
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,710
The Church of the Subgenius, as orchestrated by the subgenius,

43
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:27,970
is a great place to be.

44
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,510
And the Subgenius Foundation, and visible at subgenius.com,

45
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,110
is an ongoing concern.

46
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,630
There was a good party going on in 1915 at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich.

47
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,230
But you didn't go.

48
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,350
The fun moved to Paris in 1920.

49
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,490
And you dilly-dallied around until it was over.

50
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,150
Paris hosted a fine situation in 1957.

51
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,330
But you let it drift away.

52
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,030
You could have stayed right where you are now

53
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,110
and had an experience with the hippies in the 60s.

54
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,490
But you sat it out.

55
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,050
Just like you sat out the punks of the 1970s.

56
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,070
Tell yourself you weren't born yet, or were just an infant,

57
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,810
if that makes you feel better.

58
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,750
The point is, this is happening right now.

59
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,070
The Church of the Subgenius, as orchestrated by the subgenius,

60
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,650
is a great place to be.

61
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,490
And the Subgenius Foundation, and visible at subgenius.com,

62
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,110
is an ongoing concern.

63
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,470
And by concernation, you had best not be the last mutant on the bust.

64
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,790
The Church of the Subgenius is something that you can take or leave a DNA sample of.

65
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,870
Some invisible monster that lives in the sky saw fit to give you a unique thumbprint,

66
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,890
and now you have a blackberry pie you can stick it in.

67
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,910
You can go to a subgenius event.

68
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,810
You can put one on yourself.

69
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,750
You can meet or avoid every subgenius walking this planet.

70
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:19,150
You might come up with the next good joke that you hear some other subgenius tell you back someday.

71
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,130
Or you might be a frog watcher off to the side,

72
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,270
but a frog watcher that showed up nonetheless.

73
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,430
When you see the saucers leave this planet,

74
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,430
and that one subgenius you were too shy to talk to,

75
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,150
or punch in the snout,

76
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,630
has their face mashed up against the window,

77
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,510
and is giving you the bird,

78
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,290
will you be saying,

79
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,090
gosh, I blew it again?

80
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,570
Or will you be that subgenius?

81
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,290
Why not both?

82
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,130
So the incomprised humanack

83
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,130


84
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,070
He's happy to be free!

85
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,070


86
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,570
Perhaps I'm lucky enough to be here.

87
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:20,650
Ha, not so much that I can't leave Earth,

88
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:20,650


89
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,050
A silent failure for the myself of midKledUlose entonces.

90
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,370
公oga

91
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:23,790
I was a little lost,

92
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,110
so it all started in anoker.

93
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,770
One long month, or four.

94
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,750
Yeah, we missed a show last week.

95
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,850
The broadcast stations will get them normally, but the internet listeners didn't get last week's fix.

96
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,850
So I'm whipping out two right now, right this very second, to catch up.

97
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,930
This one's number 1,699.

98
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:55,570
And next, we round the corner for show number 1,700.

99
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,010
Nice round number.

100
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:06,110
Bob granted us slack, so that's all okay as far as the hour of slack schedule goes.

101
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,890
My own schedule has been messed up.

102
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,330
Not nearly as messed up as some of my friends' and family's schedules.

103
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,210
There's...

104
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:18,290
It's...

105
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,030
Just got simply terminated.

106
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,590
People keep dying.

107
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,330
Or getting real, real sick and threatening to die.

108
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,730
Some geniuses dying.

109
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,270
Think of that.

110
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,070
Boarding the escape saucers of the exes way before the rest of us.

111
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,130
It's not fair, but as my little sister says a lot,

112
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,450
fair's where you take your pig and hope to win a prize.

113
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:54,950
Speaking of which, my incarcerated sister unexpectedly got some good news.

114
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,830
She was offered a plea by the DA and took it.

115
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:06,270
And long story short, we'll have her back from state prison after only about two years.

116
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,550
That was actually the best we had dared to hope for.

117
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:17,530
The Texas justice system was actually both smart and merciful.

118
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,190
And this is a very good example of that.

119
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,190


120
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,190


121
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,190


122
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,190


123
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,190


124
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,490
And I'm not going to go into too much detail about this case.

125
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:27,250
For you see, my sister's daughter, my late niece Claire,

126
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:35,710
was dying of a truly horrible disease called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

127
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,910
And no, you haven't heard of it.

128
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,390
That's correct.

129
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,870
It's pretty rare.

130
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,570
And sometimes all it does is make people hypermobile.

131
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,910
But that is extremely limber and double-jointed.

132
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,950
Other times what it does is cause all the connective tissue in your body

133
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,030
to slowly just sort of dissolve.

134
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,390
That includes your skin, your joints, the membranes that hold your guts in place,

135
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,770
the stuff that keeps your arms and legs in their sockets,

136
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,730
and your ribs from coming loose and poking holes in your organs.

137
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,530
My niece had all of that.

138
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,330
She was literally falling apart.

139
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,170
Just rolling over in bedrock.

140
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,190
Could send her to the emergency room.

141
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,830
She was also in non-stop pain.

142
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,730
From merely very painful to unthinkably painful.

143
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,570
There is no cure.

144
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,750
She was only 27 years old.

145
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,930
And could no longer drive or even walk very far.

146
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,070
And she just wanted to die.

147
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,710
I mean, she really wanted to die.

148
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,470
But she was scared of doing it wrong.

149
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,750
And she didn't want to know when it was coming.

150
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:08,950
So my sister essentially sacrificed herself to make her daughter's wish come true.

151
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,270
And yes, friends, I know that there are states like the ones on the far west coast

152
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,170
where the health system is not working.

153
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,330
But it actually helps you.

154
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,190
If I'd known then what I know now,

155
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,210
I would have cashed in my savings a year ago and said,

156
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,250
Here, move to Washington state where you won't be penalized for being ill and poor.

157
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,890
She could have gotten life in prison.

158
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,790
Instead, the state took the trouble of looking into what went down

159
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:47,530
and mercifully gave her the minimum sentence for ending her daughter's pain.

160
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,290
Since early July, I've been visiting my sister in the local jail

161
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,650
every visitation period three times a week.

162
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,790
Soon, she'll be transferred to state prison

163
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,070
and I'll be able to pick up where I left off,

164
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,270
which was trying to finish emptying and fixing up our old house in Cleveland

165
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,930
so we can sell it and stop going deeper and deeper and deeper into debt.

166
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:17,890
And the dogs and I will finally be reunited with my wife, Princess Wee, and our mom, Weemaw.

167
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,270
who both had to stay in Ohio while I went back to Texas.

168
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,290
So, yeah.

169
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,910
Yeah, that's right.

170
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,410
This is the show called The Hour Slack.

171
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,290
And I guess this hasn't been all that Slack-inducing so far.

172
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,250
It gets worse.

173
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,570
One month ago today, on October 12th,

174
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,850
our very good friend in Ohio, Reverend Heathen,

175
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,090
human street name,

176
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,070
David Lair,

177
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,930
suddenly died in his sleep of obstructive pulmonary disease.

178
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,150
That one was a shock.

179
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,990
He knew he was sick, but the doctors thought he'd be getting better.

180
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,210
Once again, he was one of the nicest, sanest, smartest,

181
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,170
and in fact, strongest guys any of us knew.

182
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,170
For instance, he fed everybody at the last dozen.

183
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,930
or so, X-Day Drills.

184
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,530
Just as a for instance.

185
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:29,910
Not counting all the repairs he did to the homes of non-handy subgeniuses like me.

186
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,330
He was part of the small gang of old Cleveland area subgeniuses

187
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,890
that used to meet every week or so for dinner or movies

188
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,990
or the Greek Festival or X-Day,

189
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,910
along with Mr. Sister and Son and the Nostrils

190
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,350
and Her Highness Hell-Knowing Dr. Dark.

191
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,710
Well, Dr. Dark ordered the saucers a few months earlier

192
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,070
after a long, long fight with just about every kind of cancer.

193
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,230
And we did a show about him.

194
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,970
In between those two deaths,

195
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,670
Reverend Ann Atrocity died in a horrible accident

196
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,330
murdered by arson by a schizophrenic loved one.

197
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,950
And that was a case where the mental health system

198
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,750
ignored all the warnings she tried to give him until the worst happened.

199
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,270
So, thanks, Ronald Reagan administration

200
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,250
for gutting the loony bins back in the 80s

201
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,490
and keeping the sick out on the street.

202
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,230
And everybody since then who's been beating back social services

203
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,210
so that big companies can make bigger money.

204
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,690
Welcome to modern, advanced, futuristic America.

205
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,110
And I spent last week in Seattle visiting my old pal Dr. Lake Gale.

206
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,170
Now, if any of you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

207
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,270
I'm Dr. Lake Gale.

208
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,270


209
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,550
if anybody can beat cancer of the stomach and spine, it's him.

210
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,350
But it's possible that nobody can.

211
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,750
He's still grinning and making the sickest, sickest, sickest jokes

212
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,230
through the unimaginable pain.

213
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,970
But those grins are not normal grins.

214
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,490
They're savage-looking grins that keep him from screaming, I guess.

215
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,830
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have lasted anywhere near this long.

216
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,210
It's true that in 1995, due to some serious conclusion jumping,

217
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,070
everybody thought Legume had died in a highway accident back then.

218
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,890
And there was even a wake in Cleveland for him at which I got to say,

219
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,690
if there really was a Bob, Legume would still be alive!

220
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,170
Which was his cue to emerge from a closet, lift me off the floor by my lapels,

221
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:45,470
and jump off the roof.

222
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:45,690
And I'd be like,

223
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,890
Next time, you better poke me with a stick before you decide I'm dead.

224
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:59,670
So, some people have been sheepishly asking me if this isn't just another sick hoax.

225
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,790
It ain't.

226
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:11,230
So friends, next time you get a chance to tell a friend or loved one that you love them,

227
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,510
go ahead and do so.

228
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,730
It might be the last chance.

229
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,570
As lonesome cowboy Dave's friend, Psycho Pathfinder put it,

230
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,910
maybe we should treat our friends more like they're already dead.

231
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,450
So, friend, if you're the kind of hour of slack listener that's a friend of mine,

232
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,750
I love you, man.

233
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,550
Or woman.

234
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,330
Or whatever.

235
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,610
Thanks for all the slack you've given me.

236
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,490
I love you, man.

237
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,410
So, okay, the morose part is done.

238
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:53,670
Subgenius has been sending in lots of cool music and collages and doing their own podcasts.

239
00:15:54,130 --> 00:16:00,950
That Subgenius documentary movie did in fact get finished and is in fact being entered in film festivals.

240
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,930
Everything I've heard, that I'm not supposed to know yet, tells me that it's really good.

241
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,070
And we'll be glad it's out there.

242
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,330
And lonesome cowboy Dave will be calling in.

243
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:13,610
And I'll be back soon.

244
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:22,490
Oh, and friends, if my voice sounds all cracky and hoarse, it's not because I'm dying.

245
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,890
I just have a cold with a nagging cough.

246
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,230
And the cough is what's got me sounding cracky.

247
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,970
So, let there be slacky.

248
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,150
And it feels so good.

249
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,590
You are risking your life.

250
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,110
It was only later that I knew he'd murdered almost a million people.

251
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,530
Just a little later, got it?

252
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,990
Know what I'm saying?

253
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,050
Show now.

254
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,710
Yo, it's a wonderful world and yeah, I'm living.

255
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,990
What can I say? I'm a liberated male.

256
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,790
I may have something for you.

257
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,530
What, what is going on here?

258
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,450
Uh, I'm on my grind, baby.

259
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,850
Cause I want the life.

260
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,010
The golden child.

261
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,550
I, I, I want the night.

262
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,750
And I think that that's the part of the song that really tells all.

263
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,970
I just might stop to

264
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,930
Run away from the pain.

265
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

266
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,230
Come on, I'll dance.

267
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,630
Right now.

268
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,830
Excuse me.

269
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,550
Which do you think would be the more exciting?

270
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,970
The more sadomasochistic?

271
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,750
Look, I know.

272
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,570
It is a strange request, but I need to get up that mountain to the equipment.

273
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,790
There's valuable information up there.

274
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,510
With all due respect, sir, Dr. Oscar Valian is the leading authority on.

275
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,790
The stuff that stops you hard.

276
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,990
Learning obscenities out of random.

277
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,950
I think you got some rats.

278
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,250
And yo, we stay honest.

279
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,830
Won't make a fake promise.

280
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,730
Pay homage to truth and never straight from it.

281
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,410
I'm inside my lab stabbing wild old black poor pirates.

282
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,130
I'm trying to chill though, even though situation looking kinda ill, yo.

283
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,270
It came to me like a song I wrote.

284
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,830
I'm very susceptible to this.

285
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,230
I'm a little bit of a peer pressure.

286
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,410
Right.

287
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:25,910
We got, we've been getting collages from a person named Silas Jensen.

288
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,730
Jansen, I think.

289
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,410
And sometimes I rearrange them a little bit.

290
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,870
Sometimes I shorten them.

291
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,090
And sometimes I don't do anything.

292
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,810
But we also got a song from a friend of mine.

293
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,250
From, this is a new contributor.

294
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,630
Slim Reaper.

295
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,110
Slim Reaper.

296
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:58,230
Doing a hip hop or rap type style with this song called Pusher.

297
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,350
You've been so good today that now we're going to watch a cartoon.

298
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,670
I'll be your guide on this trip through reality.

299
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,730
And on this trip, I can make you see anything I want you to see.

300
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,850
I can show you everything.

301
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,610
You have no choice.

302
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,230
You may even see things you can't stand to see.

303
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,350
Or I may show you lies which you will call truth.

304
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,490
So remember, this is not your story.

305
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,790
And you are not the only one.

306
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:42,790


307
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:42,790


308
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:42,790


309
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:42,790


310
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:42,790


311
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,670
You are the spirit.

312
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,530
I am throwing it to you.

313
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,690
Hit the mic like it's stress weed.

314
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,250
I spit the spite.

315
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,450
Don't test me.

316
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,690
Impress fiends when I bust out the next thing.

317
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,090
Goal is to roll.

318
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,150
Fingers shift like I'm texting.

319
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,230
Linger and lift.

320
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,610
Chug another fifth.

321
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,310
Falling cannabis abyss.

322
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,070
What bliss.

323
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,370
No more indifference if you hit this.

324
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,550
Makes me miss ignorance.

325
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,170
Reminisce on tolerance.

326
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,450
But true relief is to holler riffs.

327
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,090
Little sis said flow.

328
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:13,790
Tata this.

329
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,050
Still I blow.

330
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,190
Hot as shit.

331
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,490
And say a rap to keep my lungs slick.

332
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,390
Like whoa.

333
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,930
That pale chap just sung Rick.

334
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,970
I'm like Ladi Dadi here to fuck up the party.

335
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,970
Armed with Bacardi.

336
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,430
They didn't even card me.

337
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,150
Broken empty but smartly sharp free.

338
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,550
Don't let me start heat.

339
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,370
Cause it darts to the heart when I spark a beat.

340
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,290
I'm the Fisher turned shepherd.

341
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,110
Homie shout truth that.

342
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,430
Kick a freestyle.

343
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,290
Did you know we could do that?

344
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,930
Bitch I bring back the boom bap.

345
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,490
And put the city of Jerusalem on the map.

346
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,370
Spit smoke.

347
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,550
Spit rhythm.

348
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,390
Spit fire and indecision.

349
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,310
Spit spiteful inhibition.

350
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,550
Spit phlegm when they say pay tuition.

351
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,790
I spit like it's a fucking addiction.

352
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,210
And pens the drug you're picking.

353
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,630
Spit out medication.

354
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:00,990
Get a dose of dedication.

355
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:01,950
No vacation.

356
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,030
I can't relax.

357
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,350
Spit with two feet on the gas.

358
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,830
Leave the soul in the booth.

359
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,570
Try to spit shrewd for the youth.

360
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,250
Like friends come and go.

361
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,430
But fiends will never leave.

362
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,990
I let you go.

363
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,610
Call me up just to holler yo.

364
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,550
Slachli achi odeshi niyet a sachi.

365
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,090
Avach faloch patli.

366
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,510
Azboni pagesh.

367
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,090
Oh.

368
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,370
Thanks for asking.

369
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,150
And yourself.

370
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,550
I guess I need you to entertain me.

371
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,090
Cause lately I've been stir crazy.

372
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,110
Bumpin juicy till I get loopy with disordered fantasies.

373
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,670
Plus music all I got since I aborted Hennessy.

374
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,610
Caught menacing saying school is where you better be.

375
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,250
My temper heats cause I've never been stung by a deader bee.

376
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,050
Shit.

377
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,190
I've open creative me.

378
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,190


379
00:21:42,190 --> 00:22:11,330
I guess it's вся uczuš gu ним et şuš во yu dissebuka kifuś hhiğdsee suposuz

380
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:11,390
So goodbye nut.

381
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,110
Holy shout, true that

382
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,270
Kick a freestyle, did you know we could do that

383
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,670
Bitch, I bring back the boom back

384
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,550
And put the city of Jerusalem on the map

385
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,610
You can look up that song and performer.

386
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,410
Slim Reaper is the performer.

387
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,350
Pusher is the name of the song.

388
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,130
Just Google that.

389
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,830
I'm sure it'll pop up like this did.

390
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,530
Bob

391
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,510
Bob

392
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,190
Bob

393
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:41,890
Bob

394
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,090
It takes more than intellect to be a musician.

395
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,430
The machine gave me my penny back.

396
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,030
Okay.

397
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:53,970
Yeah!

398
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,090
Okay.

399
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,490
Okay.

400
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,930
Yeah, okay.

401
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,650
Oh, okay.

402
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,670
I've got a rant here.

403
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,550
It's not by me, it's by Onan.

404
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,990
Dr. Onan Canobite.

405
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,070
Uh, remember.

406
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,830
Today, he says, I remembered.

407
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,210
I don't have to keep up with current events that I cannot influence in any way, much less resolve.

408
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,330
Phew.

409
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:26,510
It's nice to put down and walk away from all that anxiety and anger.

410
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,770
I've got enough self-generated anxiety and anger.

411
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,230
I don't need anybody else's.

412
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,110
And I sure don't need the conspiracy's anxiety and anger.

413
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,190
All kinds of bad things.

414
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,490
And sad things are happening in the world.

415
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,270
And even right down the street.

416
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,830
And there's not a thing I can do about them.

417
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,230
Nothing!

418
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,810
Not even stay informed.

419
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,970
Or quote-unquote spread awareness.

420
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:58,190
And those things I can do something about, well, I am doing them and usually not telling anybody.

421
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,670
The telling anybody part, that's not worked out so well.

422
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,070
Hey, I'm doing this good thing.

423
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,910
Yeah, but it's not that other good thing.

424
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,990
You're enough of that good thing itself.

425
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,150
You don't have to remember what I remembered today.

426
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,610
But you do have to remember.

427
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,710
Remember, you're a subgenius.

428
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,230
Remember, this planet is Mars.

429
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,850
Remember, you are not just different, but better than most people.

430
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,570
Remember to send one dollar.

431
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,170
Remember that last one often.

432
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,090
Remember the people who got you down that one time.

433
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,470
They're suffering too.

434
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:50,050
Not so you can forgive them, but so you can gloat and bask in your effort-free revenge.

435
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,590
Remember, you will die.

436
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,850
And not too long from now.

437
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:01,090
Remember that Bob has probably forgotten you already.

438
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:07,730
But some important funny old-time subgenie think your thing was pretty great.

439
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,890
And they want you dead.

440
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,590
And they want you to have slack.

441
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,610
Do you demand proof?

442
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:20,490
Then know that the anagram for subgenius remember is...

443
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,970
Gibber Sneer Museum.

444
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:34,770
And those were the words of Reverend Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite.

445
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,410
And now this.

446
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,670
And, uh...

447
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,810
And I guess now it's time to call Dave.

448
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:54,850
We'll put up the magical background music.

449
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,050
This is CyberChump.

450
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,950
Which is part of the band Exposed Foreheads.

451
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,530
With our friend Mark G.E.

452
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,450
And Jim Skeel.

453
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,430
And this is a CD called Sankhara.

454
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,450
It's pretty and won't bother us, I hope.

455
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,270
So...

456
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,990
Call the Dave-men.

457
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,670
Come in, Dave.

458
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,890
Come in, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

459
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,870
End your lonesomeness.

460
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,130
By picking up the phone.

461
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,630
Come, Dave, come.

462
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,090
Well...

463
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,170
Uh, uh...

464
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,750
Approach, Dave, approach.

465
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,710
Call me, call me, call me, call me.

466
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,530
Call me right back.

467
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,450
Oh, great.

468
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,690
In three, three and a half minutes.

469
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,890
Three, three, three, three, three, three, three and a half minutes.

470
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:04,930
Yeah.

471
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,130
Yeah, I'm a little light.

472
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,150
Okay.

473
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,430
It's okay, Dave.

474
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,470
But see, that's...

475
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,310
Because of time control and, uh...

476
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,770
See, two, three, three, three and a half minutes.

477
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,730
Half minutes, man.

478
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,410
What?

479
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,750
Three, three and a half...

480
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,230
Speak up, Dave.

481
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,870
Ha, ha, ha.

482
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,630
Don't make me slap you.

483
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,790
Speak up.

484
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,070
Well, why would you want to slap me anyway?

485
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,830
Don't you...

486
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,390
For mumbling.

487
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,010
Oh, okay.

488
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:34,930
But there's listeners.

489
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,490
Yeah, right.

490
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,070
They can't read your mind.

491
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,430
I forgot about that.

492
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,970
They can't read at all.

493
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,110
So what's this, what's this whistler, this monogram, idiot thing?

494
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,410
I don't know.

495
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,990
That's why they listen to the radio, is they can't read your mind.

496
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,670
They can only hear your mouth.

497
00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:00,070
So, you have to wake that mouth up, make it, make it enunciate and dict.

498
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,130
You know, get your diction going.

499
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:02,590
But wouldn't it be great...

500
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,190
Yeah.

501
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,190
You don't want to be an undict person.

502
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,750
Be a diction person.

503
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,090
A diction person.

504
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,470
Yeah.

505
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,310
I just wonder if you didn't stand up for the right things, you know, the right religious

506
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:17,210
causes and artifacture, you know, you might like wear like a dental brace or something.

507
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,750
Oh, hell, I died for the right religious causes.

508
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,590
Well, I have to go close the window.

509
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,590
I'll be back in three and a half, three, three, I'll be right back.

510
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:31,970
I knew that they would, I knew that it was the right religious cause because I was resurrected

511
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:32,510
again.

512
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,910
But you can't bank on that.

513
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,450
Oh, man.

514
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,010
You definitely can't bank on that.

515
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:51,510
I've had to keep reminding myself that, well, yeah, sure, my friend is, is probably dying.

516
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,570
But what isn't?

517
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,090
That kind of goes with existing.

518
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:06,550
Even inanimate objects shrivel up and get turned back into atoms.

519
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:13,450
And dinosaur pee, as the idiots like to say.

520
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,830
I just said it, so there you go.

521
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,350
It must prove I'm an idiot.

522
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,950
But, you know, we prefer the term subgenius.

523
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,690
It's just somehow more polite.

524
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,930
And it sure beats the R word.

525
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,210
I don't even remember what that one is.

526
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,210
What?

527
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,610
I guess that means I R1.

528
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,410
That must be what the R word means.

529
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,270
I R1.

530
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:50,750
I wonder if Dave's really gone to shut a window or if that was just like a, some sort of a

531
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,710
polite way of saying he really had to go to the bathroom.

532
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,310
Are you talking to me?

533
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,010
No, I was talking to them.

534
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,090
I didn't know you were back.

535
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,190
Did you have a good window closing?

536
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,350
Yeah, I closed the window.

537
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,930
Well, for two, you know, a lot of things in the last few hundred thousand years.

538
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,150
They explained the reason why you stole all the artifacts.

539
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:13,910
Dave, speak up.

540
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,790
Remember, I'm deaf.

541
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,550
Ish.

542
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,070
I remember.

543
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,570
That's why.

544
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,090
But I'm not going to want to yell.

545
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,310
I might miss a button and close your head.

546
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:27,390
Well, I don't want you to hit miss the button and close my head or whatever you just said.

547
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,090
I've got it turned up as loud as it'll go, man.

548
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:37,810
And I've got my earplugs in, my earmuff on.

549
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,250
Oh, no, I'm supposed to have hearing aids and headphones.

550
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,490
I messed up.

551
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:42,750
Hold on.

552
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,770
I've got to go close the window for three and a half minutes.

553
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:45,850
Okay.

554
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,170
Okay, I'm back.

555
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,390
That took a long time, man.

556
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,910
I was starting to cry.

557
00:30:55,030 --> 00:31:01,070
I was thinking about all the spoiled onions and all the bad burgers we've had to make over the past few days.

558
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,070


559
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,650
I was thinking about all the bad burgers we've had to make over the past few days.

560
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,310
I don't know if it's even.

561
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,390
Dave, when you're crying, I can't understand the words.

562
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,650
I don't get the lyrics when you're weeping.

563
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,870
Like, be more masculine.

564
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,470
Yeah.

565
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,590
Assert those lyrics.

566
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:31,070
I was wondering if you were to point your suppositories at the average college radio station or alternative station in a small building somewhere in a small town.

567
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,070


568
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,030
Or a large town.

569
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:38,290
You might find these people trying to totally reconfigure their personalities and become different humans.

570
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,850
Than they are.

571
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,550
A few, yeah.

572
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:50,990
I've been in most of those college stations at one point or another.

573
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:58,730
Well, I was just so intrigued by that idea after it was already pre-reproduced and presented to me.

574
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,110
Which idea was that again?

575
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:13,670
That if you point the suppository in the right direction of your local neighborhood college or alternative radio station, you will get the deep impressions from outer space.

576
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,030
Right. You don't want to put it in sideways.

577
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,030
No.

578
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,430
You could, but, you know, why?

579
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,430
It's a lipstick tube shaped thing.

580
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,950
Well, each direction has a function. Yeah.

581
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,010
Yeah.

582
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,710
Speaking of suppositories.

583
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:36,590
I was in Seattle last week visiting the ailing Dr. Le Guin.

584
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:43,910
And, you know, they legalized that marijuana stuff there.

585
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,950
I mean, totally anybody can buy it.

586
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,290
Anybody over 21.

587
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,170
Like Canada or Colorado type places.

588
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:58,530
Well, in some of those places it's medical only and they're kind of, you can only get so much.

589
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,390
You can't get so much per day.

590
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,190
And, you know, you have to have a license.

591
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:11,950
But, no, in Seattle, five minutes after they picked me up at the airport, they stopped for painkillers.

592
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:21,750
And I was looking at a little box on the counter of cannabis suppositories.

593
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,230
Not a joke.

594
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,710
They sound delicious.

595
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,430
And get this.

596
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:31,090
The brand name, Rectify.

597
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,310
Yeah.

598
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,490
Rectify.

599
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,310
The cannabis suppositories.

600
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,370
And I thought, well, I've seen everything now.

601
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,570
I must be on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

602
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:49,090
Must be X day because I can't believe I'm seeing a store like this in the United States.

603
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,890
I thought you gave it a little try.

604
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,770
Just to see, you know, there's not what the enemy knows.

605
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,590
Or not the enemy.

606
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,750
I mean, the archangels and the aardvarks.

607
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,910
Oh, not the, what, me?

608
00:33:59,150 --> 00:33:59,950
Are you kidding?

609
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,030
Do I look like somebody who would try marijuana?

610
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,470
No, not try marijuana.

611
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,450
You made me forget what I was saying.

612
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,090
But it was not like when Robert De Niro called the president a warthog.

613
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:15,870
No.

614
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,610
Or a salesman or anything.

615
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,030
No.

616
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:24,530
It was something different than that because, you know, there's only three perfunctory interesting stories to think about.

617
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,330
And they're all dead.

618
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,330
But there's been a lot of that going around.

619
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,130
Yeah.

620
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,190
Did I tell, speaking of marijuana suppositories.

621
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:33,950
Yeah.

622
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:40,690
Did I tell you about what happened to the two dogs of a friend of mine?

623
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:48,970
He had gotten a package from another friend in one of those states.

624
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,810
Colorado in this case, I think.

625
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:52,710
It was cookies.

626
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,010
Yummy, buttery cookies.

627
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,090
Thank goodness they weren't chocolate.

628
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:10,270
Because even though they were in, sealed up in a freezer bag, and that bag was inside a wooden box that had a latch on it on a high shelf.

629
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:20,910
Dog number one, my friend's dog, apparently smelled the cookies in there and pulled the thing down.

630
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,950
It broke open.

631
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,810
And he ate all of the cookies.

632
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,350
And my friend said there were about 50 of them.

633
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,010
It was a stuffed gallon freezer bag full of them.

634
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:41,870
And they were so strong that he never took them unless he needed something to knock him out because he was having trouble sleeping.

635
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,510
Well, he didn't notice.

636
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:51,930
He didn't know what had happened until he noticed his dog standing with a dog.

637
00:35:51,930 --> 00:36:05,670
He was in a really unusual posture, swaying with his four legs splayed as far apart from each other as possible without just flopping down to the belly.

638
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:09,290
And he was just swaying and staring.

639
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,030
And my friend thought, oh my God, he's been poisoned.

640
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,430
He must have eaten a toad.

641
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,850
That was his first thought.

642
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,010
He didn't just mouth it.

643
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,030
He ate one.

644
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,430
That would have been my first thought, especially every time we speak together.

645
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,010
Well, he ran down.

646
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:34,630
He went down to the next room and saw the box that had four and one cookie left in the bag and the bag torn open.

647
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,630
And he went, oh my God.

648
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,670
Well, he ran back.

649
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,350
The dog had puked in the corner.

650
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,290
And he thought, oh my God, that's good.

651
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:41,930
Oh, good.

652
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,870
The dog puked.

653
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,750
And the dog still, you know, he was dosed.

654
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,270
He was swaying around.

655
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:54,670
So my friend goes, oh, man, I better go get, I better clean up that puke before the other dog comes and eats it.

656
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,890
Too late.

657
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:06,070
The other dog just gobbled up that puked up marijuana cookie bulk.

658
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,330
It was like, looked like a, I mean, it was a huge amount.

659
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:15,750
Well, so then that dog had to start having twitches and falling.

660
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,870
Falling down and puked.

661
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,730
Thank goodness.

662
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:27,330
And my friend got on the internet and got his friends to all get on the internet to figure out what do we do?

663
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,010
Because this was like in the middle of the night.

664
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,470
It would have cost a thousand bucks to get a vet out of bed.

665
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:45,550
And they couldn't find a single, apparently this is like an epidemic that's been going on in Washington State and Colorado and other places.

666
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:51,290
Where you'll find a lot of these cookies sitting out on the breakfast room table, mayhap.

667
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:56,610
And a lot of dogs have overdosed in the last couple of years.

668
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,390
But none of them died.

669
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,630
We could not find a single example of a dog dying.

670
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:08,410
Now, my friend said that the next morning the dogs were a little woozy.

671
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:14,030
But by that afternoon, they were rollicking and romping in the yard.

672
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,510
And romping and romping.

673
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,870
After that, they started a punk band.

674
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:23,690
And the female burned her bra and the male burned his draft card.

675
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,690
And they started being sassy to him.

676
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:38,050
Well, that's always what happens, especially if you're from the osteopathic fraternity or one of the other associations devoted to the liquidation of mankind.

677
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,750
This is the important thing we've got to remember.

678
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,850
This is more like the liquidation of dog kind.

679
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,190
Well, yeah, starting with dogs.

680
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:50,090
I wonder what the guy did with the second time puked puke.

681
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:54,050
Because that would be like 50 hits.

682
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,270
Think about how lucky that dog was to you.

683
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,650
Not only was it buttery cookies, it was puke.

684
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:10,930
Well, you know, as the famous internet meme dog that I saw once, looking noble by a beach, had the caption that said,

685
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,530
"'Tis better to have eaten."

686
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,090
Than puked.

687
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,150
Than eaten the puke.

688
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,350
Than it is to never have puked at all.

689
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,430
See these door side dams?

690
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,010
These Darling Republican...

691
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,050
Calumniastical.

692
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,470
Not calumny per se.

693
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,810
I know that's...

694
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:44,490
Now see, if that dog had had installed in its neck one of those diverter inventions,

695
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,130
that I invented.

696
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,390
Well, I thought of it.

697
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,830
I haven't made one yet.

698
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,410
Where you can...

699
00:39:52,410 --> 00:40:02,550
Where you can eat all the ice cream you want, but when you swallow, it is diverted away from your stomach and into a little sack that's strapped to your side.

700
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:08,370
It goes right past where you swallow and then out into the sack.

701
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,090
So that you can, you know, keep your ice cream and re-eat it later or sell it.

702
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,750
Or give it to the poor.

703
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,490
You know?

704
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:21,190
That's where we stand at least religiously, isn't it, Stang?

705
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:26,670
We should give our unstrapped vehicles, our unstrapped, you know, to the poor.

706
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,350
Right, I mean you could...

707
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:32,170
You'd eat a salad and swallow that down into your stomach.

708
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:41,450
And then you could eat all the candy and cake and ice cream and marijuana cookies you wanted and divert them into a sack.

709
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,370
Although, I guess you would...

710
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:43,550
Yeah.

711
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,750
I guess you wouldn't want to do that with drugs.

712
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,950
Well, maybe you might want to anyway.

713
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,530
I was just thinking if we bring back any kind of like medieval times, you know?

714
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,470
Where like town criers would go from one road to the next one.

715
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,770
They'd be like saying, send us your bags and your oatmeal.

716
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:09,350
Well, now I'm thinking, I'm hoping that my friend put his re-puked marijuana cookie puke in the freezer.

717
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,030
You know, and then he could...

718
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,650
He could...

719
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:15,490
Pull it out and cut off a slice now and then.

720
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,230
You know, offer it to friends.

721
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:21,350
If they didn't know what it was, they'd go, what is this?

722
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,970
Oh, well, this is the latest thing the kids are doing.

723
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,490
It's a, you know, tincture.

724
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,750
It's an India Pale puke.

725
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,870
I mean cookie vomit.

726
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,330
I mean, you know, candy.

727
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:38,690
Yeah.

728
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,250
Yeah.

729
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:39,490
Yeah.

730
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:44,330
It's supposed to be, taste like, sort of like bile from a dog's stomach.

731
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,430
Mixed with sugar and butter and whatever.

732
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,050
Dogs like it at the moment.

733
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:51,930
Yeah.

734
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,070
You know, they're sometimes they're very strange, hard to articulate.

735
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,850
To mount up now and be as pompous as they are.

736
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,710
Some of them, you can see it in their eyes and their ears.

737
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,830
I would never want to be one of them kind of dogs.

738
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:16,750
Well, friends, don't leave your medical, your edible medicals out where the dog can get to them.

739
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:22,190
Because it's really, as much as you might think, oh boy, dog's going to be tripping.

740
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,230
It's going to be great.

741
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:23,890
He'll love it.

742
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,430
No.

743
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:33,430
No, it doesn't have the same effect on dogs as it does on people or even subgeniuses.

744
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,270
Right.

745
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:37,490
And remember, Giants and children and grandparents.

746
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:42,270
Especially that once you consume, did you make that sound to mock me?

747
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,750
No, I didn't make any sound.

748
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,890
That's the thing in your head.

749
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,630
Or your teeth.

750
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,390
Made like a fart sound?

751
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,190
You know, or like a, a screaming place and sound?

752
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:53,990
It wasn't me.

753
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,570
It was the dog.

754
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:55,970
It was the dog.

755
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,370
Well, everybody blames the same dog for the same mistakes.

756
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,570
And none of us ever win the race.

757
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,430
It was Bob.

758
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,590
It wasn't me or the dog.

759
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,110
It was Bob.

760
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:05,910
Bob farted.

761
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:07,530
It was Bob.

762
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:07,530


763
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:07,530


764
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:07,530


765
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:07,530


766
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:07,530


767
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:07,530


768
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:07,530


769
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,390
That's what I call true.

770
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:08,770
That's what I call true.

771
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,910
That's salvation to me.

772
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,750
To be able to look over your shoulder and see that smile on your face and just think,

773
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,190
that's where it comes from.

774
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,630
That's where it's going back to anyway.

775
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,070
You know what I mean?

776
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:18,890
Yeah.

777
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:26,930
Well, he can, he can expel gas and then suck it back in and then expel it again from either

778
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:27,610
opening.

779
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,630
That's how much control Bob has over his body.

780
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,010
Like an Indian fakir.

781
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:35,770
A.

782
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:35,890
A.

783
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,910
Or a daddy fakir or a mother fakir in India.

784
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,950
All of us fakirs.

785
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:51,450
Yeah, it's not to be confused with fakir news, which is not the most trustworthy.

786
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:56,510
Right, it's shoveled out like on a pancake with a snow shovel on the side.

787
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,850
Right, they tell you it's...

788
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,190
Waiting for the skunks to come out from under the bushes.

789
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,510
It's one of those irritable vegetable times of bloatage.

790
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,830
Some people experience vast amounts of bloatage.

791
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,310
Other people experience panic and anxiety.

792
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,330
But they think it might be from something else nearby, like loud vehicle sounds,

793
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,750
you know, like the poppings and the moanings of the great ships of the Northwest, you know.

794
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,290
So it's pretty hard to figure out.

795
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,110
Dave, did you eat your dog's medical cookies?

796
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:28,650
Yes, I did.

797
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,110
I was just going to say that.

798
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,470
Don't leave those gummy bears out where Grandpa didn't get them.

799
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,870
You know how those older people like gummy bears?

800
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,450
Oh, yeah.

801
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:45,490
You know, it doesn't always make their dementias any better.

802
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,530
Sometimes it kind of multiplies it.

803
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:49,590
Yeah.

804
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,170
I'm sad to say I've seen that happen.

805
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,270
Not me.

806
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,590
I wasn't looking in the mirror when that happened.

807
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,910
Oh, no, that's true.

808
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:04,110
What did you discover looking in the mirror?

809
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,450
I...

810
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:06,610
Let's not talk about it.

811
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:07,970
Please.

812
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,530
We did a show, what, two shows ago where we just talked the whole hour.

813
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,130
It didn't even have any music or anything in it to speak of, I think.

814
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,470
Mm-hmm.

815
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,990
Well, one of our regular listeners said,

816
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,030
The name of that episode should be,

817
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,610
Stang and Dave are old.

818
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,350
Why were you bringing the four of the four skin?

819
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,870
The neutral thoughts contained in the conversation?

820
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,030
The ones that don't match up to the gray thoughts?

821
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:45,730
I mean, you know, we've all walked down that street and came back blubbering and crying.

822
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,230
Yeah.

823
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,190
Why didn't she let me?

824
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,310
I just, I wasn't going to eat her panties or anything.

825
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,550
I was just going to, you know, go look at them.

826
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,090
I just, you know, everybody's different.

827
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,990
Some way or another.

828
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,450
Yeah, that's what they all tell the judge.

829
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,270
Well, everybody, come on, judge.

830
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,310
Everybody's different.

831
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:05,710
Yeah.

832
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:05,870


833
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:05,870


834
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,410
You know, different strokes for different tokes and chokes.

835
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:10,630
Right.

836
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,450
That's when the judge showed him his belly button.

837
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:17,430
True out in every sense of the word, about three, four inches long,

838
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,350
protruding from the bottom of his belt buckle out.

839
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,430
That's the kind of grandparents that I want to invite to my marriage and wedding.

840
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,430
Well, anyway, we don't want to sound too old.

841
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,210
So let's cut to something else for a change.

842
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,750
Like, for instance, this.

843
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:36,970
Scissor space.

844
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:37,270
This...

845
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:55,890
Um...

846
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,750
Please cut down, please?

847
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:58,810


848
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:58,810


849
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,650
No huge profits, no money, no women, no Emperor Xthra.

850
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:01,650


851
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,490
Stephen, when you started nothing, and when you decided to let all your principal handle

852
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,990
do you want to get a road sign for SCEMEE?

853
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:03,990


854
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:03,990


855
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:03,990


856
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:03,990


857
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,810
I know you want to show off, get your full miss,

858
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:04,810


859
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:04,810


860
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,110
The other two.

861
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,810
Use your mutant powers, think about

862
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,990
When your blood is low in sugar

863
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,150
When you're picking out a bugger

864
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,850
When you shoot him with a looter, think about

865
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,810
When you're outside exercising, think about

866
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,810
When you're using sex devices, think about

867
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,030
When you're walking through the woods

868
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,950
When you make out with girls

869
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,850
When you beat up two little hoods, think about

870
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,170
So hoppy, hoppy, hoppy, hoppy happiness

871
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:38,170


872
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:38,170


873
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:38,170


874
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:38,170


875
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,410
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la-la-la-la, blah-la-la-la-la-la

876
00:47:41,410 --> 00:48:06,090
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Life, life, life, life, life, life-life-life

877
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:13,970
Here he comes He's coming bud

878
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:24,010
Go to come and take your slack away He's back

879
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:39,910
When you see a flock of birds, think about When you just run out of words, think about

880
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:45,090
When a ring falls round your collar When you hear a given holler

881
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:51,730
When you write checks for one dollar, think about When you write to the subgenius, think about

882
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:52,690
Be a genius, think about

883
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,690
Be a boss, one for all, three of six, think about

884
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:01,030
When you cast your mojo hexes When you ride through Dallas, Texas

885
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,690
When you're all die-lexing, think about

886
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,550
He wants an audience

887
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:36,390
Be aesse

888
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,390


889
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,190
Don't need noppo

890
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:48,070
He wants speed della

891
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,490
Come to take your slack away

892
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,630
We'll take it too

893
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:55,830
That big bad bob

894
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,630
Heaven in the sky

895
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:02,110
That's right

896
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,690
Just send us your

897
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:04,830
One dollar

898
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,270
You get a lot more for your money

899
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:14,570
Heck, one dollar

900
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,990
You get Bob

901
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,390
One dollar

902
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:22,390


903
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,010
Think about

904
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:25,090
Yeah think about

905
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,870
We're all thinking about Bob

906
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,490
Yeah it makes us

907
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,070
Think about

908
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,370
Everybody's thinking about Bob

909
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,590
Everybody wants to think about

910
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:36,810
Yeah

911
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:40,150
We're all thinking about Bob

912
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,550
We're all thinking about Bob

913
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:46,370
Yeah we're thinking about Bob

914
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,910
Everybody's thinking about Bob

915
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,610
And those were the words of

916
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:57,250
Reverend Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite

917
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:00,510
From PR News in Washington

918
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,930
I'm barefoot in response to a Costa Rican

919
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,350
sex abuse and forced women's rowing and basketball

920
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:09,430
at the Asian Games in Ireland last weekend

921
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,910
in Costa Rica

922
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,130
PR's reports

923
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,350
Joe did not

924
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,330
Joe were left

925
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,930
It's the first ever gold PR news

926
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,090
to be reported

927
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,230
Warner has on our teams

928
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:29,770
who heard the incendiary

929
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,510
that hit Vaiviti

930
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,610
took away each at

931
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:37,390
Selfie was calling that night in question.

932
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,070
He said, let it rip, and it ripped.

933
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,730
Right.

934
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:47,930
And another thing we have to do is rip ourselves a new end hole

935
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:51,790
so that we can end the show twice.

936
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:57,430
You see, once now and once for next episode.

937
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:08,190
And one of these episodes is going to be a nice roundly numbered number, 1,700.

938
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:13,790
We've gone from 1699 to the year of 1700.

939
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,010
Hours of slack.

940
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,190
That's a lot of hours.

941
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,250
I wonder how many I should calculate later.

942
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:27,210
How many weeks or days or months or whatever.

943
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:27,730
That is.

944
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,150
Yeah.

945
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,290
I start with the big numbers in the middle of my way down

946
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:36,110
until I got to maybe 2 times 24 or something like that.

947
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:36,470
You know.

948
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:39,930
Let's see.

949
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,430
Maybe I could do that even while we're on the phone.

950
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:52,470
I can always cut the part out where I'm fiddling around

951
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:57,290
trying to find my damn calculator program on this interocitor.

952
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,530
Here.

953
00:52:59,870 --> 00:52:59,970
Okay.

954
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:07,330
1,700 divided by 24.

955
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:12,090
70 days of slack.

956
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,750
We've rounded off to 71.

957
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,090
Well, no, that one was a rerun.

958
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:24,190
So it's been 70 days of slack since October 1985.

959
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,410
So this is like a new chapter.

960
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


961
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


962
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


963
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


964
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


965
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


966
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


967
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


968
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


969
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


970
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,410


971
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:33,310
This is like our 33rd anniversary or is it more like 38th anniversary?

972
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:34,330
Something.

973
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,810
Now, see, I need the calculator for everything.

974
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,330
Yeah, I mean, it's still going to come up saying the same stupid things

975
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:42,830
that don't make any sense or any difference.

976
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,410
So 70 days, that's 10 weeks.

977
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,690
Yeah, but if you were to divide it by 365 days per year,

978
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:50,690
that would tell you how many?

979
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,730
Two and a half months of slack.

980
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,010
If you just sat and listened to them all at once,

981
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:57,410
all day and all night, you'd be able to calculate that.

982
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:57,410


983
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:57,410


984
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:57,410


985
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:57,710
All night.

986
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:02,570
They would go on for two and a half months.

987
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:08,370
And at the end of that, there probably wouldn't be much left of you.

988
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:13,710
No, the wolves would come and take you out to dinner.

989
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:14,950
They'd just fill you up.

990
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,050
So, friends, that's it.

991
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,350
That's how many.

992
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:22,790
And this show, if you want to find out more about the churches,

993
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:26,330
don't hang up, Dave, because we've got to do this again in half an hour.

994
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:27,390
All right.

995
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:27,390


996
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:31,730
Friends, if you need to know more about the Church of the Subgenius

997
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,890
or anything we play on this show,

998
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:37,750
you can usually find it at subgenius.com.

999
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:43,050
You can also find all 1,700 shows pretty soon.

1000
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,370
I think the first 300, 400 weren't digitized yet,

1001
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,530
but they're being digitized now.

1002
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,830
That's the Colonel Beans, yeah.

1003
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:56,550
Yeah, I left him with Reverend Sinek in Ohio,

1004
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:00,590
and he's copying them for Reverend Botner to put online.

1005
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:03,930
Yes, that makes sense.

1006
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,710
That's the way I do it.

1007
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,830
Some of them, we all sound like babies.

1008
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,130
You weren't even born.

1009
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:16,510
I mean, you were born, but you were only born on ESO Swamp Radio

1010
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:21,010
and other Cleveland outlets, all those bands you were in.

1011
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,490
Yeah, dressed up like a little baby.

1012
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,750
You know, they...

1013
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,590
Things they do for you just to take care of your relatives in East Germany.

1014
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:34,690
Is that why you smelled so much like urine back then, back in those days?

1015
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,330
I mean, I don't want to wreck your chances of a date now,

1016
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:39,170
but that was a long time ago.

1017
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:40,710
Actually, that didn't stop.

1018
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:41,890
Man, you had girls.

1019
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,210
You had young, beautiful girls chasing you back then.

1020
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,150
They loved the smell of old man urine.

1021
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,250
It's like goats.

1022
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,910
No wonder goats pee on their own beards.

1023
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:53,190
Was that what you were...

1024
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,290
But you never had a beard.

1025
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:55,730
What were you peeing on?

1026
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:55,930
I did.

1027
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:56,250
I did.

1028
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:56,490
Come on.

1029
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:56,530
I did.

1030
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:57,150
What's your secret?

1031
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:01,730
I did have a little goatee, not a big one, for about three years,

1032
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,190
which I urinated on frequently.

1033
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,290
And I used to take down...

1034
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:10,410
I digitized a whole library of information on the effects of smoking,

1035
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:15,470
rampant manure, and pre-squeaking on the human beard.

1036
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,970
Oh, by the way, this music in the background...

1037
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,950
And this is for all ethnic groups and everything.

1038
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:25,590
This just measured humans as per humans as opposed to goats.

1039
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,170
Can we find this research online?

1040
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:33,950
I would Google it first because sometimes, you know, there's severe watchers,

1041
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:40,370
and there's serious kidney failure, and there's serious sailors and stuff.

1042
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,250
I don't know about any of those people.

1043
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:45,230
I mean, I tried to figure them out, but...

1044
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:49,030
I knew Kidney Failure.

1045
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:53,910
He was a hardworking but short-lived individual.

1046
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,570
Hey, this music in the background...

1047
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:56,710
Let me give a credit here.

1048
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,930
Music in the background, the beautiful guitar music,

1049
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:04,430
is Brian Henke of Northern Ohio.

1050
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,970
It's an album called The Nature of Light.

1051
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:14,290
And I've used this music for my nature videos on my YouTube channel

1052
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,670
and my unnatural videos as well.

1053
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,070
But mostly I use other stuff for the unnatural ones.

1054
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:24,510
So, yeah, Brian Henke, H-E-N-K-E.

1055
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:28,450
He's got a bunch of albums like this.

1056
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,910
Sound very, very beautiful.

1057
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,270
Listen to that.

1058
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:38,830
Can you hear anything like guitar music?

1059
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,650
It's like a buzzy sound.

1060
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:44,490
I can be playing with three levels of...

1061
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:46,590
Yeah.

1062
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:50,070
Oh, you're using the hearing aid in my right ear.

1063
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,610
That's why it sounds like that.

1064
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,330
But you'll take my word for it.

1065
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,170
It sounds pretty good.

1066
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,410
That one...

1067
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:56,610
You're for the gun anyway.

1068
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:57,730
Yeah, I'm supposed to...

1069
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:01,430
Okay, so I think this is the end of that show.

1070
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,750
And that means...

1071
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,970
I told you that I was thinking about...

1072
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,590
What exactly are your speculations, sweetie?

1073
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:12,110
Sir, I filled you in up till 1800 hours tonight.

1074
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:13,210
Will you keep silent?

1075
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:16,470
I can understand you feeling bad about all this, but...

1076
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,170
My frustration is...

1077
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:25,550
And what they're doing is they're going directly into the...

1078
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,610
Sight center of the brain and stimulating it electronically.

1079
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:31,730
We make the fly girls scream in ecstasy.

1080
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:34,190
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party.

1081
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,950
We put all the fellas in a daze.

1082
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,390
But in my heart I found...

1083
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,370
A new thing, baby.

1084
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:47,110
A new thing is taking shape.

1085
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,230
But then you have some black people who just don't give a damn.

1086
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,530
Well, we just run off that little bit to give you an idea of what goes on.

1087
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,570
Fred, perhaps we should...

1088
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:58,650
We could just see how you do some of these trick endings of yours, could we?

1089
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:01,590
Oh, I'm sorry, I'd love to, but I think any moment now we're going to run out of time.

1090
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:02,470
Oh, what is...
