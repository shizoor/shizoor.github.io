1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
From PR News in Washington, I'm still slowing efforts to reach the victims.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,500
The hard, heavy airbus has been found.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,280
Good.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,580
Government scientists say President Obama is degrading more quickly than expected and more difficult to see on the surface.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,320
Wall Street 2010, 5, 19, 14, 22, 74.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,520
Eleven Somalis charged with piracy say they're listening to PR News.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,680
Authorities say they're worried it'll get worse, as forecast.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,780
In the podcast, Pakistani investigators say they aren't certain of much else at this point.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,160
Burundi is considering doubling the number of its troops to combat Bob.

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,320
Bob's spokesperson said 9 million people combat about 75 people.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,640
He said the only thing holding them back right now is a lack of PR News.

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,880
If convicted, they could face PR News.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,580
What is it? What's the matter?

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,480
I just had a terrible dream.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,980
It was blood and fire and thunder.

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,780
And there was something awful was moving in the middle of it.

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,540
I could hear it roar and bellow.

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,620
The Self-Genius.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,820
Power of Self-Genius.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,740
If I were to allow that to continue, he would blow every circuit in his body.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,560
That is correct, sir.

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,440
Just leave it and you'll be free.

23
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,620
I am the Departing software...

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:46,620


25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:46,620


26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,700
And I'll tell you something else, doctor.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,780
The jungle is no place for bitterness.

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,520
The jungle's every place for bitterness.

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,320
It sows and reaps it like so much cane sugar.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,660
The jungle gets into your blood and builds.

31
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,720
tiny little houses of pain.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
And you better not be there when the rent's due,

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,820
because the Anaconda, funny thing,

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
they don't know how to read a lease.

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,400
Seems they never learned.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
And the only thing longer than a croc's mouth

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,100
is the time it takes to swallow you whole.

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,300
So, next time you talk to me about jungles and bitterness,

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,280
next time you're trying to find your eyes with both hands,

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,220
just keep that in mind.

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,060
That is, if you still have a mind.

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,380
The jungle is a dangerous place, that's true.

43
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,140
But anyone who's ever seen two monkeys give each other things

44
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,400
knows it's a happy place, too.

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,400
So let's remember that.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,180
And keep in mind, you can pretty much eat anything you see,

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,740
so have fun.

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,460
Clicking then, careful, recycle Bob.

49
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,420
Owner Bob is important to our busy team.

50
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,280
I can easily view a different Bob.

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,300
I just click Bob.

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,260
See this dotted line?

53
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,820
It's a Bob I like, Bob.

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,680
I can click Bob.

55
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,540
Great way to view and respond to Bob.

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,160
To find specific content, I use Bob.

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,080
I can click Bob.

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,620
I start by clicking Bob.

59
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,620
I search for Bob.

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,180
Welcome, Bob.

61
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,560
Now Bob can start planning wiki for our manual.

62
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,640
I hope you're ready to explore, Bob.

63
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,520
People, it's finished.

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,120
Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, we have to,

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,600
we have to, we have to, we have to,

66
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,060
we can, we can, we need, we need, uh, uh, uh, um,

67
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,340
uh, I lost track.

68
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,500
Uh, I'm, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,

69
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,120
I mean, how, how, how, how, I mean,

70
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,960
how, I mean, what is, what is, what is, what is,

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,980
what is Facebook, Twitter, and blogs, huh?

72
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,740
It's, I mean, what, what, it is, it is,

73
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,580
let us, let us, let us, oh, we do,

74
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,360
even Jews, but, but, we have, we have some, some,

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,760
some kind of big, just a real stupid, super big Jesus.

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,080
It, it, it doesn't fit.

77
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,040
He was, he was normal or abnormal.

78
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
I mean, I mean, I mean, you, you,

79
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,600
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a,

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,320
I mean, what, what, what,

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
I mean, what, what, what,

82
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,380
I mean, what, what, what,

83
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,180
what, what, what, what,

84
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,200
Court stands adjourned till 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

85
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,560
Look, on that stump,

86
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,400
is it a chipmunk?

87
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,600
It looks like a chipmunk, all right,

88
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,040
but it's really Bob.

89
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,200
We call him that because his name is Bob.

90
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,140
All day long, Bob looks for nuts.

91
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,120
We'll fool him with a mirror.

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,520
Well, he thinks that nut in the mirror will run away.

93
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
If you hold very still, Bob will come up and eat your hand.

94
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,700
See how he bites off what he wants?

95
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,320
He goes right after that food.

96
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,540
See how his cheeks bulge?

97
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,900
And still he keeps getting more.

98
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,120
Now, let's try something new.

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,060
Let's see how smart Bob really is.

100
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,100
Can he learn something he hasn't tried before?

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,040
If you hold very still, Bob will shove your nuts in his cheeks.

102
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,000
See how his cheeks bulge?

103
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,020
If you tie your nuts to a string, Bob grabs it.

104
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,480
He's beginning to get curious about that string.

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,040
See him sniff at it?

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,540
Do you think Bob can learn to pull the string?

107
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,760
He can reach, and this time he pulls the string with his teeth.

108
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,060
The more you pull, the harder he pulls.

109
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,860
Do you think he can get your nuts?

110
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
He uses his tongue to reach them.

111
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,420
Let's push your nuts in a little farther and try again.

112
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,000
Now his tongue isn't long enough, so he sniffs and licks.

113
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,160
He moves his nose back and forth under your nuts.

114
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,040
He tries to push his face into the nuts that he can see.

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,600
No, that didn't work.

116
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,060
Don't you think so?

117
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,300
You can see that the domesticated

118
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,540
tooth knows which 90% Dent Score skin is engaged in.

119
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,380
No, that didn't help.

120
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:13,580
Great!

121
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,420
Mine was that cash.

122
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,600
Okay.

123
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,620
We never mentioned one thing about killing.

124
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,840
That's enough.

125
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,400
This land is my land.

126
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,900
From the Californians to the New Yorkers.

127
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,460
This land is my land.

128
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,700
This land is for me.

129
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,260
Made just for him.

130
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,840
Him.

131
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,960
And a lot of people seem to think that this land was made just for them.

132
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,120
By the way, the collages there were by, in this order, Lemur, the large.

133
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,820
A clip from The Lost Skeleton returns again.

134
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,560
Nor El Pref.

135
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,400
Lemur, Lemur.

136
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,620
Heart Ignition, Lemur.

137
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,380
And friends, welcome to Hour of Slack.

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,160
1,274.

139
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:17,100
I goofed up and didn't notice that last issue was number 1,273.

140
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,600
And 273 is a subgenius magic number.

141
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,820
And I'm such a bad numbers kook, I paid no attention to that.

142
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,220
Didn't even know Princess Wee is here.

143
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,260
And we have something special for you tonight.

144
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,520
It ought to make some people angry, I hope.

145
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,780
I've mentioned before that I have developed a bad habit.

146
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:48,100
Not only reading the news on Yahoo.com just to see what the pinks get.

147
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,100
But I've been reading the comments from what we call the Raging Peanut Gallery.

148
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:05,620
And they made me anxious and filled me with anxiety and upsetness for a while there.

149
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,780
But I've come up with a way that makes me feel better about it.

150
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,020
And that is, when I come to one.

151
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,500
It's hilariously stupid.

152
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,640
I copy and paste it into a special document I have called the Yahoo's of Yahoo.

153
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,200
And at first, friends, I thought he had done this just to entertain me.

154
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,560
But here we are bringing it to you.

155
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,820
So what we're going to do is read to you some samples from our cross section.

156
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,240
Some of the tender commentary that has built up during this.

157
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,720
This week to 9-11.

158
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,380
We're broadcasting this on 9-12.

159
00:08:47,660 --> 00:09:01,980
And so these are some of the captured moments from our fellow regular garden variety everyday normal Americans.

160
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,460
We're going to try to duplicate the unique spelling that so many people,

161
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,060
who I suppose were hooked on,

162
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,760
phonics,

163
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,200
have used.

164
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,100
So if you hear us pronounce certain, a lot of words in an interesting way,

165
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,300
we're trying to duplicate the way they wrote it.

166
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,160
Here's one from Jay Pyers,

167
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,740
who says,

168
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,680
Now friends, before we do this,

169
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:39,900
this, anything, nothing we say reflects the station or its managers or anybody else.

170
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,760
Not even us.

171
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,240
We're reading stuff we found on the internet that's so dumb, we had to share it with you.

172
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,780
This fellow here.

173
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,700
Oh, this guy uses the name God.

174
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,560
I am God and all the Islam followers are terrorist.

175
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,020
Singular.

176
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:08,920
Remember 9-11 or was it just a justification to kill those stupid Iraqis like we are doing the Afghanistan's?

177
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,240
Also deport the lazy Mexicans.

178
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:17,960
And their pregnant women that are only to have babies and apply for welfare benefits.

179
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,480
Now here's Robert Smithfield.

180
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,100
He says,

181
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,340
Do it, Mexico.

182
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,760
Tie, not it, will be a great example to us.

183
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:38,160
In all probability, we will throw even more money at you just to maintain the statuesque.

184
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,740
The worst thing is a good example.

185
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,240
And this is the worst thing.

186
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,380
In this case.

187
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,320
The statuesque.

188
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,840
You know, say that again.

189
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,700
I think he meant status quo.

190
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,380
Yes.

191
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,180
But it says statuesque.

192
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,140
Statuesque.

193
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,980
Yeah, the statuesque.

194
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,160
Statuesque.

195
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,960
I remember that one.

196
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,040
That was one of my favorites.

197
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,000
If a mosque is built anywhere in the U.S.,

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,980
then the U.N. will have declared war upon themselves by the nation.

199
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:19,440
If so, they will declare martial law and attempt to wipe us out so nothing stains in their way.

200
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,600
There is uproar of the news of a Muslim church being built.

201
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,800
As far as I see the situation, hell is close to breaking loose on our land once again.

202
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,760
A second civil war, as you would say, may come if this event continues.

203
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:48,180
And many of us will have no choice but to take arms on both sides as before in the 1800s.

204
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,920
No one wants another war such as that, and neither do I.

205
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,360
But if it continues, there will be no alternative than to fight for what we believe in

206
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,360
and what our forefathers lived for and died for.

207
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,460
Numerals used here.

208
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,080
If you have a disagreement with what I say now, speak now or forever hold peace.

209
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,160
This is from Osama Obambe.

210
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,460
This is all part of Obambo's plot to discredit this heroic woman.

211
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,760
Clearly, Osama had something up his sleeve.

212
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,720
It wouldn't surprise me if he literally pulled the words out of her mouth

213
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,080
through one of his secretive Obamabot agents.

214
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,900
With all the illicit high-tech stuff Osama has been buying from Iran,

215
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:47,960
he probably has found ways to silence his opposition at the most critically of times.

216
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,840
It's truly sickening what Osama, I mean, Osama has done to the USS, now the USA,

217
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,680
the United States of Saudi Arabia, EIA.

218
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,340
We want our country back.

219
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,420
Screw the American government for suppressing the voice rights, freedoms, and honor

220
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,320
of its own country and people in support of these backwards evil killers

221
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:25,760
and screw the moose lives for their intolerant, one-sided, uneducated, useless lives.

222
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,840
The only freedom of speech is if you are not white.

223
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,180
We do not have freedom.

224
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,320
We do not have freedom.

225
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
We do not have freedom of speech anymore.

226
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,040
I am waiting to build the concrete wall.

227
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,680
How about you?

228
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Now, friends, remember, we're just reading comments that we copied from Yahoo.com news.

229
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,680
Comments.

230
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,800
Including, oh, here's a good one from John.

231
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,960
Everyone should have a large party in the White House Oval Office

232
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,180
while Obama is on another vacation that consists of no clothes,

233
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,160
P.S. Leave bodily fluids on his coffee mug.

234
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,640
This is not the United States of America.

235
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,780
This is a country that if you offend somebody, you are a criminal.

236
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,640
I bet if the Muslims wanted to fly their flag, it would be okay.

237
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,740
Or the MLK NAACP Black Panthers, it would be okay.

238
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,340
What's funny?

239
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,300
If they would not be okay, then they would be okay.

240
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,500
If they would not say anything about the flag, we would not have known about it.

241
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,100
You can't do anything in this country without making somebody mad.

242
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,080
Boy, that's for sure.

243
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,140
I hope all the libtard women running their mouths that we must accept the Muslims

244
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,960
and we must allow them to have their traditions, live to be a part of a Muslim world.

245
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,280
I would be amongst the crowd stoning them or whipping them to show them how infallible

246
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,700
and inferior they are to man.

247
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,920
They need a taste of this to understand that you need to know what you are asking for

248
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,180
because in many cases, you will get it.

249
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:23,540
Ooh, let the Muslim Moscow be built, but don't allow this historic flag to be flown.

250
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,140
This is the reason for the Second Amendment.

251
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,600
Here's one from Jeep Jeep.

252
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,280
So, D, now we're saying the current government is not going to be able to do anything about it.

253
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,280


254
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,280


255
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,220
The president caused this problem in the USA.

256
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,580
And yes, he knew he was black.

257
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,780
He has two children by a black woman.

258
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,400
The question is why did he not marry a white woman?

259
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,960
Please tell me. I know his grandmother raised him.

260
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,440
And what else? I need help with this question.

261
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:02,840
After years of taking oil out of the goal, golf, goal, all of a sudden oil rigs are blowing up.

262
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,780
Let's see who doesn't want to drill in the golf.

263
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,840
Obama and all his wing nuts.

264
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,660
What luck, right boys?

265
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:18,080
Sort of reminds me of the suspicious Greek restaurant fires.

266
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,540
Then they reopen bigger and bigger.

267
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,080
This is a reflection on all Greek owners because it's true.

268
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,120
It would be funny to burn an effigy of Allah.

269
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:30,840
Lol.

270
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,260
Ha.

271
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,900
Ha. Ha.

272
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,560
The government took God out of our schools but not Muhammad.

273
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,100
Anybody else see a patron?

274
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,900
Obama did this one because he needs a crisis because he cannot do the job he was elected for.

275
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,820
Is all this progressive outrage over Koran burning about their respect for religion?

276
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,960
Or is it their outrage?

277
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,240
A display of their visceral and cowardly behavior?

278
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,400
Or is it their cowardly fear of Muslim people?

279
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,120
Your only motivation for attacking this pastor, the guy who's going to burn the Koran,

280
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:15,540
is your pathetic, self-serving cowardice and spineless groveling before the enemies of America.

281
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,720
You're prepared to bow your knees only to those you fear will blow you up or shoot you in your spineless back for looking at them the wrong way.

282
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,560
Nice show, cowards.

283
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,840
Proof once again, liberalism is a mental disorder.

284
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,220
And the creed of weakly, weakling, girly man.

285
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,380
Hmph.

286
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,280
Well, there you have it.

287
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,440
Enviro-terrorism in the time of Obama.

288
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,900
These rigs never exploded before the enviro-nuts man headed the Justice Department.

289
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,000
Holder will never prosecute the real people behind these terrorist attacks.

290
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,840
That's their fight against us energy independents.

291
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,060
U.S. energy independents.

292
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,160
Vote them out. They are killing us.

293
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,660
Santa Claus posted,

294
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,260
It prophesied Iran will knock, Saudi Arabia will burn, the oil will burn.

295
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,960
Then when Israel is act, God his self will destroy the ones that act Israel.

296
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,220
Iran-foo-ther is rightin'.

297
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,340
Muslim God can't save them. People don't believe Nazis.

298
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,440
And Dave is calling in, I think, here.

299
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,000
But, uh, here, let's see what happens if we push a little Dave on.

300
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
Dave on there. Do we see Dave on?

301
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,300
You pushed my nose?

302
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,140
It's Darvon.

303
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,200
Oh, here's the last, here's two more.

304
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,060
These are really in keeping, Dave.

305
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,740
I know you've been listening to all these.

306
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,340
Comments. These are comments, friends, once again.

307
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,120
We're not reflecting the attitudes nor opinions of the station, the station management,

308
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,560
or any other DJs.

309
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,100
Or the DJs speaking now.

310
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,740
Absolutely not.

311
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,900
Or anyone we know.

312
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,780
These are quote-unquote.

313
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,820
I'm only reading from, from Yahoo News comments that follow the articles.

314
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,740
And here are two that I found in a row.

315
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
Joe said,

316
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,460
Yahoo is owned by Jews.

317
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,200
They can only stifle so much speech and they know it.

318
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,860
Now that was followed by a post by Mr. Good Guy who said,

319
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,040
Yahoo is owned by Muslims.

320
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,920
You can tell.

321
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,040
How can you tell by the feathers in the cap or the little string of bologna hanging from the arm?

322
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,180
Oh, they change their, you know, I mean, one minute it's the Jews, the next minute it's the Muslims,

323
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,920
and the next minute it's the libtards, and the next minute it's the hipsters.

324
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,620
It's growth in the public.

325
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,800
And the next minute it's the Republicans.

326
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,020
So many of us anyway.

327
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,880
Or the Republicans.

328
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,080
Regardless of our skewings on the political spectrum.

329
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,920
It's, it's, I talk to so many people.

330
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,960
And I talk to so many people that are just fed up with hearing what they're hearing from these people.

331
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,820
And you know whose fault it is.

332
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,180
Well, it's our fault for repeating what they say.

333
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,040
In some ways it is.

334
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,600
Oh, Dave!

335
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,240
But you have to say it three times and spin around for it to actually work.

336
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,460
We almost forgot something.

337
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,320
I have an introduction for you.

338
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,560
Here, this, maybe we should have music with this.

339
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,360
Okay.

340
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,140
What are you introducing?

341
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,320
Shut up, shut up.

342
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,240
Let me introduce you.

343
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,560
This is a professional.

344
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,120
This is a professional.

345
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,140
In the parlance of the 20th century, this is an oddball.

346
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,580
His name is Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

347
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:48,040
And his tastes lean toward stuffed animals, zither music, professional mooseball, Charles Dickens, golfer heads, carnivals, dogs, children, and young ladies.

348
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:55,900
Dave is accident prone, a little vague, a little discombobulated with a life that possesses him.

349
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,880
And he possesses all the security of a floating crap game.

350
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,860
But this can be said of our Dave.

351
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,500
Without him, without his warmth, without his kindness, the world would be a considerably poorer place.

352
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,220
Albeit, perhaps, a little saner.

353
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,620
As long as we avoid that bizarre casino that we call the hour of slack.

354
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,040
Isn't that nice?

355
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,920
There was a Twilight Zone, Dave.

356
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,680
About a subgenius.

357
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,560
It was called Mr. Beavis.

358
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,340
I remember the Mr. Beavis episode.

359
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,020
But I can't remember if he lost his glasses or if he was in the library too long with the vampire.

360
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:44,480
No, this was the one who met Mr. Fate or Mr. Destiny or Mr. Death or Mr. Lucifer.

361
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:54,340
Somebody who was going to make him normal so that he wouldn't be, you know, a crazy subgenius who couldn't hold down a job.

362
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,120
A chicken.

363
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,880
A squirrel.

364
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:56,960


365
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,680
Some other.

366
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:05,200
So they turned Mr. Beavis in that episode into, well, his guardian angel turned him into a suit wearing normal.

367
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,400
Got rid of the bow tie and the checkered coat.

368
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,300
And the jalopy gave him a sports car and a nice suit and made him an executive.

369
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,560
Oh, yeah.

370
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,500
And nobody liked him anymore.

371
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:15,980
Right.

372
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,540
And nobody was friendly to him anymore.

373
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,920
And he wanted to go back.

374
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,780
He was a little bit silly.

375
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,900
He was kind of a little bit of a character too at his desk.

376
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:31,920
And people, although they resented it in some ways, they kind of got used to it because he was kind of a nice guy.

377
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,420
He was that accent of spice in their lives.

378
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,160
Huh?

379
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,260
He was that accent of spice in their lives.

380
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,860
It's kind of a rancid spice in some ways, like cumin that's gone bad after you've sat on it for too long.

381
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:53,340
But when I was thinking about the tea party, I was thinking that the thing with all of these people is they don't remember Lewis Carroll.

382
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,140
Or John Carroll University either, which is another rival of Cleveland State's.

383
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,700
Princess, will you don't cough on the microphones now?

384
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,980
Oh, wouldn't think of it.

385
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,680
Don't put your disease in them.

386
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,360
I would not think of it.

387
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,540
I think they're taking the orders.

388
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,180
There are orders from the Mad Hatter.

389
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,680
Yes, there are indeed.

390
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:22,980
Well, as Mr. Ed said, don't vote conservative or you will be censored by Barack Hus and Yahoo.

391
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,780
Oh, my God, it's just getting so strange lately.

392
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:37,740
I mean, I just read, interestingly enough, on the Internet, some research done by scientists who claim that from so far from observation,

393
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:46,460
it appears that a lot of people who get their information the tea party way, you know, via the radio and Fox News on TV and stuff like that.

394
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,000
Right.

395
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,320
Those from each other, basically.

396
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,840
That even when presented with facts that are irrefutable.

397
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:52,960
Right.

398
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,000
It tends to make them more irascible and convinced that they're right.

399
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,160
So they're putting pugnacious juice in the airwaves somehow.

400
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,520
Well, it works.

401
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,920
I mean, it works in certain countries previously.

402
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,920
You know, the big lie is the one they'll believe.

403
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,820
You repeat one often enough.

404
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,340
It becomes the truth.

405
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,140
You know, the M&E is worried about the M&E.

406
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:30,800
As this person says, the M&E is the Islam and one is destroying America from within.

407
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,280
It makes me want to weep like a child with too big of a load to carry.

408
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,480
But at the same time, it makes me weep for this land we're in.

409
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,800
Terra X, we might call it, but it's now known as the U.X.A.

410
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,540
It's known as the U.S.S.A.

411
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,520
Pretty soon now.

412
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,320
Because Civil War is coming.

413
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,420
Burn, baby, burn.

414
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:08,640
I got the feeling if everybody who had a shotgun was sitting on their porch waiting for their neighbor to come on by so they could shoot them when they stepped on their property, we would have firefights throughout the land.

415
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,500
Well.

416
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,940
And it's, I mean, that has nothing to do with anything.

417
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:21,220
Nenslow pointed out that get off my lawn is the new make my day.

418
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,620
Both were Clint Eastwood lines.

419
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,660
Yes, I know.

420
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:33,580
And that's kind of transmogrified into make my lawn, have my day, get off of my lawnmower.

421
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,280
You know, any kind of, because it was kind of delivered in the same style.

422
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:48,860
And I think that diluted the previous line, which was, you know, I thought maybe right up there was, man's got to know his limitations.

423
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,060
Well, fine.

424
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,760
Do you remember that one?

425
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,940
A man's got to know his limitations.

426
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,120
He said that to the guy who played Lincoln or whatever his name was.

427
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,440
You don't remember that from Dirty Harry, I think, perhaps?

428
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,280
It's been a long time.

429
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:15,820
The only line I really remember from that was something like, do you feel lucky pink?

430
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,840
Well, do you?

431
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,800
Yeah, do you feel lucky pink?

432
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,520
Well, do you?

433
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:19,820
Yeah.

434
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,220
Now, here's a comment from Meme.

435
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,520
She say, I do my part to keep the rich people rich.

436
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,400
I play in casino.

437
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,360
I know that I am not going to win, but we have to have some rich people.

438
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,860
Not everyone had to be poor.

439
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,720
Oh, yeah.

440
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,260
I've noticed all of a sudden.

441
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,640
I think because.

442
00:26:49,640 --> 00:27:00,200
Because the liberal socialist communist traitor Muslims are sort of against rich people not

443
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,520
getting taxed a lot.

444
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,620
In other words, because the.

445
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,920
Are you saying there's something fishy going on here?

446
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,280
The libtards think that rich people should be taxed a little more than poor people.

447
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:19,440
Suddenly, that means those others seem to feel that.

448
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
That means they should defend the rich people.

449
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:31,440
So all of a sudden you've got all these trailer park denizens sticking up for the richest oligarchs

450
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,860
in the country.

451
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,900
Because when was the last time a poor guy gave you a job?

452
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,920
The only time you get a job is from rich guys.

453
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,160
It's when you enlist the common man and feed him a line of BS and he'll follow the king

454
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,040
or queen anywhere.

455
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,920
Well, no kidding.

456
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,440
Well, depending.

457
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,360
Depending on which king or queen it is.

458
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,300
If it's their special king or queen, then they can do anything.

459
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,020
It's okay.

460
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:57,940
What?

461
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,400
Like a Princess We or something?

462
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,300
Yeah, sure.

463
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:00,960
Like in my.

464
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,540
Yeah, Princess.

465
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,180
Or Queen of all the.

466
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,800
She can do no wrong.

467
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:10,840
But, you know, I hate to say it, but I sometimes wonder if, Dave, do you suppose there could

468
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,700
still be a little problem with racism in this country?

469
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,920
It seems like there's a big, big fat one, isn't there?

470
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,420
I mean, there's all these people.

471
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:24,040
There's people who are just, they want to complain about something and I don't, it's.

472
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, it's gotta be somebody's fault besides theirs.

473
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,000
It's the biggest elephant in the living room we've had.

474
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,660
Eleven Fink.

475
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,220
Who the hell is Eleven Fink?

476
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,940
Ellie Fink.

477
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,640
The Eleven Fink in the living room.

478
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:36,880
Oh, the Ellie Fink.

479
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,120
You know.

480
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,140
Up in, you know, that big old thing.

481
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,700
The gorilla.

482
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
With the big ears and the.

483
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,340
Yeah.

484
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,320
The gorilla in the.

485
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,600
Yeah.

486
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:42,780
Big ones.

487
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,100
In the bedroom.

488
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah.

489
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,080
Yeah.

490
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,200
Pink Ellie Fink.

491
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,560
Yeah.

492
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,720
Jay here says that Mohamed fornificated with goats.

493
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,820
Well, that's a common fallacy because.

494
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,820
That's, didn't it, don't every, that's every subgenius.

495
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,340
Fallacy, so to speak.

496
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,660
I think not only every subgenius, but I think perhaps even a few of the other religious

497
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,940
deities, which we commonly follow in United Snakes, also had cannobial light.

498
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,260
Oh my God, I just realized something.

499
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,680
Bob didn't mean goats.

500
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
He meant ghosts.

501
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,920
We were supposed to be fornificating with ghosts all this time.

502
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,280
Oh man.

503
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,500
And instead we've been using common barnyard goats.

504
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:28,640
But at least it was fornification and not just, you know, your usual dirty stuff.

505
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,720
And then there was, there were the followers of dis-fornification who believed that if the

506
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,860
element of random chaos was introduced, the true fornification would either get better

507
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,760
or get worse or stay the same, depending on their scientific gigolo.

508
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,800
I've run into a lot of people online who don't seem to like science either.

509
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,300
They've said over and over again, they've said, these scientists are so dumb.

510
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,360
They prefer to use the word stupid.

511
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,600
And oddly enough, they, they so often spell stupid with an E.

512
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,720
Like step it or stu- like making it a do.

513
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,420
Stupid.

514
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,440
Yeah.

515
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,540
This is stupid.

516
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:09,900
Stupid.

517
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,520
I've had that said to me personally.

518
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:20,460
I know there's a lot of strange, very, very strange misspellings that if you were a Jungian

519
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:27,760
or even a Freudian, you could probably find out more than you needed to know about most

520
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,540
of these people, unfortunately, that maybe they're a little around the bend, you know?

521
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,300
Well, now not all the crazies hate the libtards.

522
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,960
Some of them hate the repuglicans.

523
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,020
For instance, this guy here, Bush Daddy is the so-called Jesuit occult, the anointed one.

524
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,180
It is called Project Omega.

525
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,840
Even the tsunami in Indonesia was a manmade.

526
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,600
They used micro-nukes called Thermate and placed them in the fault lines underground.

527
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,480
They wanted to take over the oil monopoly in Indonesia and they did.

528
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,160
Yay.

529
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,740
And the American people was still blind and dumb of truth.

530
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,440
Search for HAARP.

531
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,280
What it can do when it is pointed up in the sky and what it can do when it is pointed

532
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,500
it below and what it can do when it is pointed to humans?

533
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,080
The Bush got paid $2.1 trillion by the Queen of England, who is, by the way, Bush is the

534
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,100
13th cousin of the Queen Mother's side for mission accomplished.

535
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,040
Bush was knighted by the Queen.

536
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,280
Why?

537
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,960
Think about it.

538
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,120
Why?

539
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,120
Oh, oh, and I should keep my mouth shut for I will be subject to Illuminati or the New

540
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,200
World Order order?

541
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,000
Question mark.

542
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,340
Now, that is true quackery, but I believe most of it.

543
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,820
Now, Dave, you know that harp thing that's just for music.

544
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,580
Angels don't reappear and change shapes like so many ghosts do that Bob's been trying to

545
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,180
wend his mighty proboscis into or out of.

546
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,500
That's the thing.

547
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,600
See, Bob can do a ghost.

548
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,100
But the rest of us, it's like he's just saying, you're just going to have to use your brain.

549
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,260
Use your imagination, kids.

550
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:12,880
But there is a special form of Jolly, which is the old African word for essence, male

551
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,240
essence.

552
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,660
But it's also a spiritual thing, too.

553
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,020
And Bob has quite a bit of that.

554
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,120
Oh, he's got to do with it.

555
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,060
It's buckets and buckets.

556
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,080
Yes, he's got a big load of love, baby.

557
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:31,020
It's too bad that so many of his ideas had to be burned like so many Korans.

558
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
We had to burn Revelation X.

559
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,160
We were quite happy to do it.

560
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,400
Remember?

561
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,040
Well, that's the funny thing.

562
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,800
You know, we've been burning holy books in Church of the Subgenius since 1980.

563
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,580
I can prove it on old Betamax tapes.

564
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,400
Our own.

565
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:54,160
But Naked stood there at Dockstock eating a Bible, ripping pages out of a Bible and

566
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,300
shoving them in his mouth.

567
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,600
Yum, yum, yum.

568
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,720
At one of the X Days, I remember Pastor Pressure deep fried.

569
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,220
Oh, yeah.

570
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,240
And he was eating a holy Bible.

571
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,840
And it was delicious, too.

572
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Well, the crust was...

573
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,580
Well, it was battered and deep fried.

574
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,560
The batter was good.

575
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,620
Yeah, the batter was good.

576
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,300
The leather was leathery.

577
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,980
And, of course, we burned, I'm sure...

578
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,840
But we didn't make a big deal out of it.

579
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,640
It's like we burn any old holy book.

580
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:27,440
I think we left the complete works of L. Ron Hubbard sitting behind the latrines two

581
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,320
X Days ago.

582
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:28,660
We indeed did.

583
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,160
Because nobody would buy them in the Bulldada auction.

584
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:31,700
And they could be used for what they were offering.

585
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,580
And it was one of the few things...

586
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,200
And they could be used for what they were offering.

587
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,200


588
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,200


589
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,360
And they were most needed for.

590
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,640
That's a utilitarian society that Bob wants to create beyond the stars.

591
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:45,080
That's the kind of world that he wants to build deep within you before you even accept

592
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,460
whether this may or may not be...

593
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,960
My favorite ones are the ones...

594
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,780
The comments that are...

595
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,280
Have a built-in contradiction.

596
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,400
And they're not being ironic, either.

597
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,160
Here's one from Marion who says,

598
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,140
Hey, LushTundra58.

599
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:07,740
People who support a mosque at Ground Zero should be stoned to death.

600
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,540
Why did I laugh?

601
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:10,920
I'm sorry.

602
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,900
Give them money.

603
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,480
We Americans need more than they do.

604
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,480
And you numbnuts think that the Islam pukes already in this country should be treated

605
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,340
as real Americans?

606
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,180
They are not real Americans and never will be!

607
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,940
You freaking idiots that think otherwise are not real Americans.

608
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,120
I'm sorry.

609
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,880
And Bill spoignello says...

610
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,900
Kenzoa says...

611
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:40,840
The Obamas live their best, gearboxious life that they have with all the taxpayers dollar

612
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,040
signs that they can now before they leave the WH in two years.

613
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:51,900
So, they sure are taking a great advantage of it without any consideration of how starve

614
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,360
millions of Americans out of working without homes.

615
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,880
But, they take vacation after vacation and dance all fun stuff.

616
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,120
I think that they're boring,laughs!

617
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,120


618
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,120


619
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:12,280
they are so insensitive of how others' feeling and have entirement attitude as usual. Stop

620
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:19,260
them from spending our dollar sign, our grandchildren dollar sign, and our griot, too. Vote them

621
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,900
all out in two years, people.

622
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,500
Boy, oh boy, that lady is on every week saying that Obama's on a vacation.

623
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,760
I think it's griot grandchildren, but it was too much to tie.

624
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,420
Well, it really, and then people come along and cheat by pointing out Bush's vacation

625
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:46,000
record, which was like a quarter to a third of his presidency. So, I don't know. And then

626
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,960
they get all upset. Oh, here's a good one. Do It Right said, I don't know about you,

627
00:35:52,100 --> 00:36:00,400
but I couldn't have been killed on 9-11 because I would never would have lived in any of the

628
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,280
liberal states.

629
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,560
Which are a lot more stupid, careless, and lawless, and a favorite target of terrorists.

630
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,960
Eh, Eh, San says, that's one of my favorite ones so far.

631
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:22,460
This Moran just needs attention, just like a baby. Sorry, I have two babies of my own

632
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,620
to pay attention to. At least mine are cute.

633
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,060
Now, there was one great comment among all of this stuff.

634
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,180
What would Dr. Zayas think?

635
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:44,420
I think we should ask a werewolf what they might think. Or someone who changes shapes

636
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:44,900
and stuff.

637
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,340
He would say, quote, war on everyone who doesn't believe what I believe. Purge the Islam scum.

638
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:58,440
I can't believe how people got into this after nine years after thinking it was the Islams,

639
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
rather than wondering really what happened.

640
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:07,660
How could they get so sidetracked? Do you think maybe some big fat hands that are large

641
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,680
and they don't have very many calluses on them, that's for sure, and they're big and

642
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,340
they're huge and large, and they run the banking something or another?

643
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:28,140
Well, I'm not a women cowboy, Dave. Oh, let me tell you that Muslim people are not nice.

644
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,920
I know this because I...

645
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,340
I'm not a Muslim. I'm not a Muslim. I'm not a Muslim. I'm not a Muslim. I'm not a Muslim.

646
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,340


647
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,940
I was...

648
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:31,940


649
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,180


650
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,640
There was a Muslim man who got me fired from a job, and I trusted him. I knew that he is

651
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,600
satanic now and hates Jesus.

652
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,440
That one you've done yourself.

653
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,080
No, I did not. I did not.

654
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,540
No, that is a stage subgenius.

655
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,460
And I was reading it...

656
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:55,740
No, sir, it was not a stage subgenius. None of these were our stage subgenius fake idiots.

657
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,780
They're verbatim.

658
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,340
These are real, true, non-sagist love.

659
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:01,340


660
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:01,340


661
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,320
subgenius idiot. Subgeniuses are too

662
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,300
dumb to come up with stuff like this.

663
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,220
Because we're subgeniuses.

664
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,940
These are the geniuses of America

665
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,700
that are speaking.

666
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,920
Cut and paste it onto this paper.

667
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,940
The life of humanity.

668
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,460
The mind power. The genius.

669
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,440
Now here's what I think

670
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,260
is fake. Every now

671
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,320
and then you'll get a redneck

672
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,460
trying to be

673
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,140
an evil Muslim to show you how

674
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,700
bad the Muslim people are.

675
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,060
And here's the insane fake Muslim

676
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,080
who says

677
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:37,120
this is too much.

678
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,780
Okay, get ready.

679
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,900
The Torah and New Testament are forgeries as they make

680
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,700
gods of the Jews while making

681
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,520
virtual slaves of the children of Adam.

682
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,860
All non-Jews. It is time Chris Staines

683
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,920
recognized the New Testament for what it is.

684
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,820
An instruction manual. How to serve and

685
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,560
worship your hostile jinn

686
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,280
aka Jew masters

687
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,740
for dummies. Yes, Allah chose

688
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,780
the Jews. He chose the species

689
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,640
consisting of monkeys, swine,

690
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,720
devils, and jinn to return

691
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,600
back to the hellfire from which they were created.

692
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,620
The Chris Staines diabolical worship

693
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,440
of a partially eaten Jew corpse

694
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,040
and their worshiping and serving

695
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,660
clinically insane barn and zoo

696
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,320
animals in the life of this world

697
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,600
mandates they receive the harshest

698
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,520
punishment in the hellfire.

699
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,640
I would just like to

700
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,980
interject something right there.

701
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,380
How many Americans know that

702
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,020
it's illegal in Islam

703
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,460
for Islamic people to

704
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,520
burn the Torah or the New

705
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,360
Testament because they're parts of the

706
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,660
Haditha, which is

707
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,440
like the Old Testament

708
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,420
to, you know, how we got the

709
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,460
Old Testament and New Testament that Christians do

710
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,180
anyway, you know?

711
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,240
And so the Torah and the

712
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,040
New Testament

713
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,760
are their Old Testament.

714
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,540
You can't burn it. It's not as cool as the

715
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,520
Quran may be. When you're burning the Quran

716
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,340
you're kind of also burning

717
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,420
the old books that are

718
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,340
in it,

719
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,400
which are the Holy

720
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,280
Bible. Oh, well. And the Torah.

721
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,440
Right. Well, the Holy Bible

722
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,020
includes a

723
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,260
retranslation, tweaked up

724
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,380
version of the Torah. Yes, but the

725
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,220
Torah was first.

726
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,260
Well, actually, Princess Wee, if

727
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,420
Pappy was here, he would point out to

728
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,200
you that in fact those

729
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,840
desert tribes of Israel

730
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,280
picked up a whole lot of their stuff from

731
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,020
the good old Zoroastrians.

732
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,080
You don't see many of them around,

733
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,000
but none of these

734
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,080
religions are

735
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,580
especially original.

736
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,480
As John

737
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,400
41 here said,

738
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,140
this is one of the few intelligent

739
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,420
comments on Yahoo,

740
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,300
religion will keep us from evolving

741
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,300
to civilization type one.

742
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,400
Obviously, John is

743
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,080
from the future, or an alien.

744
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,880
Oh, there was a great

745
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,720
Bob line in here somewhere.

746
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,260
I found, where was it?

747
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,320
Do you have it, Princess Wee?

748
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,120
Yes, but I want you to read it.

749
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,620
I think the problem with it is...

750
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:00,620


751
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:00,620


752
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:00,620


753
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:00,620


754
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:00,620


755
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,800
It would sound so much better in your voice,

756
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:04,920
Dan.

757
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,600
Okay, okay.

758
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,960
They're incapable of

759
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,600
processing information.

760
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,380
Many parts of their brain

761
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,520
have been fused.

762
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
The neurons and neurological

763
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,120
pockets.

764
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:17,900
I'm sorry.

765
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,040
Dave, here is a line

766
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,040
that I'm going to steal

767
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,100
for our purposes.

768
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,420
It originally said,

769
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,340
there are those who believe,

770
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,400
there are those who believe in God,

771
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,440
and there are those who don't.

772
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,420
Only one group will be able to say,

773
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,540
I told you so.

774
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,700
But listen how much better

775
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,260
it sounds if you do it this way.

776
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,000
Backwards?

777
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,180
There are those who believe in Bob,

778
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,060
and there are those who don't.

779
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,120
Only one group will be able to say,

780
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,260
I told you so.

781
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,720
With X-Day in mind,

782
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,260
doesn't that sort of...

783
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,340
That's better for Bob

784
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,800
than it is for old God.

785
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,260
Old God.

786
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,380
You know, old God,

787
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,320
remember old God?

788
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,100
Old God, he had Peter play,

789
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,440
though I remember old God

790
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,540
got up one time so fast

791
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,260
that he claimed his sacroiliac

792
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,220
was out of action.

793
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,940
But instead...

794
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,620
And God posts frequently

795
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,100
to Yahoo.com.

796
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,400
His spelling is unusual.

797
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,940
He's a night owl.

798
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,820
Or, you know, with a small H.

799
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,860
I mean, with a capital H,

800
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,180
he's quite a night owl.

801
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,960
Because he's in part of the vast night.

802
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,140
The aeon of night,

803
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,600
we like to call it.

804
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,460
Usually,

805
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,960
it usually lasts about 100,000 years.

806
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,520
No chance of escape

807
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,860
if you want to spiritually evolve.

808
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,360
Unless, of course,

809
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,300
you come to Bob

810
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,300
on your hands and knees

811
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,760
like a dog

812
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,160
wanting a biscuit.

813
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,780
Well, so much for freedom.

814
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,780
Yeah, that's right.

815
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,240
Yeah, you can't...

816
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,620
You don't have freedom of speech

817
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,580
if you're a real American.

818
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,280
Only unreal Americans

819
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,200
have real freedom of speech.

820
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,900
They can burn anything they want.

821
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,380
But if you're an American,

822
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,140
a real American,

823
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,280
you can't burn nothing.

824
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,940
You see.

825
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,360
I can't see how they would equate

826
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:07,820
a Quran,

827
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,220
which is a book,

828
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,300
with a brassiere,

829
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,360
which is an object

830
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,080
that women burned in the 70s.

831
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,000
Actually, Dave,

832
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,880
I believe that that was an urban myth.

833
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,500
And there are not really

834
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,560
hardly any examples

835
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,280
of women's libers

836
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,460
actually burning bras.

837
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:25,760
Wow.

838
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,600
That was a media invention.

839
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,140
There have been a couple...

840
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,060
Huh?

841
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,980
Just like the old, you know,

842
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,320
everybody was spitting on soldiers.

843
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,200
I never...

844
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,760
I knew a lot of soldiers.

845
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,280
Well, when I came back from NAM,

846
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,600
ain't nobody spit on me.

847
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,060
They chewed on your leg, though,

848
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,060
because the gangrene produced...

849
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,280
It was so hot.

850
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,060
I couldn't use somebody spitting on me.

851
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,840
Oh, my God.

852
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,820
My God.

853
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,460
Roland.

854
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,320
You were never the same.

855
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,040
But you were never the same

856
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,480
before you were different.

857
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,960
You were always never the same.

858
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,920
And what about...

859
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,360
Oh, Libmeister said this.

860
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,300
And what about

861
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,360
Oh, Nub Nuts bending over

862
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,620
to kiss all the other leaders

863
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,680
in the world?

864
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,300
What was he kissing?

865
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,740
And what was it all about?

866
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,040
They all still hate us.

867
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,780
Speak for yourself, buddy.

868
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,620
These people are very literate.

869
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
I mean, you can tell

870
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,000
they've taken on a lot of sources.

871
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,020
Maybe read a lot of papers.

872
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,520
I think they've read

873
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,940
a lot of Yahoo comments.

874
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,140
By each other.

875
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:30,780
Yeah.

876
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,360
Maybe that's it.

877
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,760
As I was saying, Roland,

878
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,920
she says,

879
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,740
white people are sick and tired

880
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,720
of Obama

881
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,100
and anybody who supports him.

882
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,740
I want all black people

883
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,780
and liberals to die.

884
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,280
That's not a real dream.

885
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,260
Yes, it is.

886
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:53,700
It is.

887
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,940
It is only a dream.

888
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,760
Yeah, she said it's only a dream.

889
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,700
But she really...

890
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,940
This nice girl,

891
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,520
this Christian wants

892
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,680
all black people

893
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
and liberals.

894
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,020
Oh, Lord.

895
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,300
Which I guess that means

896
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,320
two different things.

897
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:05,580
Right.

898
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,660
All black people

899
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,040
and liberals to die.

900
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:08,440
Yeah.

901
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,240
She left out Hamas.

902
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:10,920
That's freedom.

903
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:11,920
That's what freedom...

904
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,960
Hamas?

905
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,920
She left that one.

906
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,560
That's another one

907
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,820
they're all arguing about.

908
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,540
They hate Hamas, too.

909
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,780
Oh, the Hamas,

910
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,280
the homosexuals

911
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,080
or the Hamas in Palestine.

912
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,660
Yeah, and Halitoshis, too.

913
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,820
The Hamas,

914
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,620
the homosexuals.

915
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,240
Oh, my God.

916
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,640
That's the worst of all.

917
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,160
They're, they're moose,

918
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,020
moose slimes.

919
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,680
Gay Muslims.

920
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,940
There you go, buddy.

921
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,560
Moose slimes.

922
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,920
The very worst

923
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,380
you could possibly be

924
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,980
on this planet.

925
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,500
The Hamas sexuals.

926
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,720
They actually have sex

927
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,680
with members of Hamas.

928
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,340
Yep.

929
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,080
In Hamas.

930
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,040
Yeah, they make a big room

931
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,020
full of Hamas.

932
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,200
And then they get a humping

933
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,560
of the Hamas sexuals.

934
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,660
Next thing you know,

935
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:57,960
they're more,

936
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,080
the little tires

937
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,960
are starting to squeal

938
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,400
and them truck drivers

939
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,480
are getting mad, you know,

940
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,740
and them horns is a honking.

941
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,280
And you should get out of that

942
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,220
room with your Hamas, say,

943
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,320
get a mitten Hamas side

944
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,620
on Zeus and whatnot.

945
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,320
This one has a little

946
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,260
built-in joke.

947
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,800
It's by Blanca Alexicon.

948
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,000
Oh.

949
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,260
USA has free speech.

950
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,400
Can say and do what want to.

951
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,660
And spell too.

952
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,720
I've seen the word mosque spelled with a U.

953
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,580
Well, as musk.

954
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,460
In fact, one of these guys thought that mosque

955
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,080
was sort of a subtle way of saying musk,

956
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,560
which I don't, could not make any sense

957
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,380
of that one at all.

958
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,920
I've lost track of where that one is.

959
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,140
Google Obama and Black Panthers

960
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,220
and kill white babies.

961
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,380
Oh, man.

962
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,940
I guess if you Google that,

963
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,040
you can Google anything you can find.

964
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,420
Hey, the true subgeniuses

965
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,200
who got tired of all the hate on,

966
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,160
I got to talk about yahoo.com,

967
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,400
alt.slack.

968
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:06,660
Yeah.

969
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,820
Is about as retarded as yahoo.com.

970
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,720
And I've been meaning to tell you, Dave,

971
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,820
I keep forgetting to do this.

972
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,460
I need to send you an invitation

973
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,640
to the true subgenius news group,

974
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,380
which is called Scrub Genius

975
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,540
on Google Groups.

976
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,640
It was actually started several months ago,

977
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,300
but I've been kind of lax

978
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,180
in letting the true subgeni

979
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,780
know about it.

980
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,040
We didn't want it flooded.

981
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,660
And the thing is,

982
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,300
I actually check everybody

983
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,620
before we let them in.

984
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,640
I check to see if they're in the book of life.

985
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,180
But rather than email me that,

986
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,600
you chose to say it on the air.

987
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,440
Yeah, that's okay.

988
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,260
We've got lots of true subgeniuses listening

989
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,600
and very few of anybody else listening,

990
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,240
I would think.

991
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,120
So if Bob has their name in the book,

992
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,340
then we'll know and we can let them in.

993
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,660
And if they don't, they don't.

994
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:57,920
But I think that's the thing.

995
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,300
Speaking of which,

996
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,800
also, Dave,

997
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,040
you know,

998
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,320
it's not a mosque

999
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,600
and it's not at ground zero,

1000
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,620
but...

1001
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,540
It is a pornographic YMCA

1002
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,280
for Islamic children.

1003
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,400
Yeah, but the subgeniuses

1004
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,700
are going to be having

1005
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,980
their own sacred ground

1006
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,980
9-11 mosque

1007
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,740
deflowering

1008
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,380
on October 9th

1009
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,080
in New York City

1010
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,840
within shelling distance

1011
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,280
of the sacred ground zero.

1012
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,200
It's actually in Astoria,

1013
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,340
but that's close enough.

1014
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,540
And it's not on 9-11,

1015
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,860
but it is on 9-9.

1016
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,960
No, it's on 10-9.

1017
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,220
So that's close enough.

1018
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,800
October 9th.

1019
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,120
It's actually kind of a big show

1020
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,860
and I wish we could drag you there, Dave,

1021
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,180
but I don't think we can.

1022
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,300
Because we're going to be leaving

1023
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
like a week early.

1024
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,780
Princess We will be there.

1025
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,760
Fat Mandy will be there.

1026
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,540
Duke of Uke will be there.

1027
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,020
Susie the Flusie will be there.

1028
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,640
Bleepo, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

1029
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,340
will be there.

1030
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,960
Priestess Pisces.

1031
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,440
Fat Free.

1032
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,040
There's also a DeVival coming up

1033
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,260
in Detroit on November 13th

1034
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,440
and in Little Rock on November 20th,

1035
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,140
but I don't know exactly

1036
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,080
any details on those,

1037
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,320
except that I'm supposed to go to them.

1038
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,860
And welcome to new station WESU.

1039
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,360
Actually, it's an old station

1040
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,580
that used to play Hour of Slack,

1041
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,140
and they're playing Hour of Slack again.

1042
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,560
Hi, WESU in Middletown, Connecticut.

1043
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,880
Hi, WESU.

1044
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,380
There's Hour of Slack all over the airwaves

1045
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,800
in Middletown, Connecticut.

1046
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,200
There's hamburger on the highway

1047
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,800
right outside your window there.

1048
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,040
And I have another announcement,

1049
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,560
which is that

1050
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,000
the band called Revelry,

1051
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,560
which features Princess We Are Doe,

1052
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,960
will be singing at Ingenuity Fest

1053
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,720
on the Span stage

1054
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,620
on September 24th.

1055
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:10,480
It's a Friday.

1056
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,820
That's only in Cleveland.

1057
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,220
It's only in Cleveland.

1058
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,180
But it's under the bridge, man.

1059
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,500
Yeah, it's under the bridge.

1060
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,180
It's a barrage.

1061
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:18,940
You know what I mean?

1062
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,100
When they say under the bridge,

1063
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,900
it's like it's a barrage.

1064
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,440
Well, they don't mean in the river,

1065
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,360
but there's this...

1066
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,820
They used to run...

1067
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,700
Street cars.

1068
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,520
Yeah, street cars

1069
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:27,880
and have shops.

1070
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,260
It's the street car level, yes.

1071
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,060
And it's been abandoned for years,

1072
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,380
but now they have festivals down there.

1073
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,140
Last year, it was a very, very strange scene,

1074
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,320
I must say,

1075
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,800
because it's a strange environment.

1076
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,980
It's a fabulous, strange environment.

1077
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,360
Back in the days before there were festivals under the bridge,

1078
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,100
some people actually camped under the bridge.

1079
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,700
Oh, they've been run out.

1080
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,640
And cooked beans and forest fires and stuff like that.

1081
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,260
There are no homeless.

1082
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,560
Drank acetylene and acetone.

1083
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,220
No homeless people in Cleveland.

1084
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,340
No longer.

1085
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,260
No.

1086
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,160
No, no, no.

1087
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,380
They have a booth now, as a matter of fact.

1088
00:50:59,380 --> 00:50:59,600
The homeless.

1089
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,140
You can go kiss the homeless

1090
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,520
at the Kiss the Homeless booth.

1091
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,440
It's free.

1092
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,480
You don't even have to give them a dollar.

1093
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,760
Can't I even just have one little kiss?

1094
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,100
Somebody.

1095
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,280
Well...

1096
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,120
Now, if anyone actually listened to that announcement,

1097
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,220
I'd just like to one more thing say.

1098
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,720
We'll sing from 6 o'clock to 7 o'clock

1099
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,940
on Friday,

1100
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,100
September 24th.

1101
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,800
Just a little note,

1102
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:30,460
just to let local Clevelandians...

1103
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:30,860
Stalkers.

1104
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,940
Now you just, for the first time in an hour of Slack,

1105
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,060
you just opened us up to the stalkers.

1106
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,580
Way to go.

1107
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,280
Please, Lord, stalkers on the prowl.

1108
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,440
Now, see, if it's a Church of the Subgenius show,

1109
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,600
we don't get stalkers.

1110
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,040
If it's Princess Wee singing,

1111
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,900
oh yeah, then it's stalker heaven, baby.

1112
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,500
We've had a few...

1113
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,480
Gumless old ladies chase us down the street

1114
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,400
wearing tennis shoes.

1115
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,300
Remember?

1116
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,260
Oh, I remember one time they took off after you.

1117
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,800
They were after me.

1118
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,240
They were gonna try and beat me up or something.

1119
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,320
You were the only one they ever chased, Dave.

1120
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,240
You and Jayner.

1121
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,120
The only ones that ever had groupies were you and Jayner.

1122
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,040
Well, yeah.

1123
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,680
And Jayner is like, ugh.

1124
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,020
They flocked to them.

1125
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,980
You know, the subgenius weirdo ladies, they're...

1126
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,980
They're different, those conny tights are.

1127
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,540
They're not necessarily beautiful, but mutated.

1128
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,760
Some of them do have parts of their brain exposed,

1129
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,540
which is good to check

1130
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,920
when you want to see if you're truly compatible with somebody.

1131
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,780
Well, their heads and their brains are...

1132
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,040
You look inside someone's head and see what's going on there,

1133
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,340
and you can literally actually do that.

1134
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:51,000
There are subgenius women whose heads are so gigantically...

1135
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,300
Beautiful.

1136
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,460
...vast.

1137
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,100
Well, they can't get through the door, not even to the big house,

1138
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,520
much less the little house.

1139
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,860
There's usually an exclusionary collage.

1140
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,440
I hear you, noggin, but you can't come in.

1141
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,160
Yeah.

1142
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,400
Sour, soft.

1143
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,200
That's a special message to a little special somebody out there.

1144
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:16,460
I'm sure she'll have a ball with that.

1145
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,620
Ya big-headed yacht.

1146
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,540
Yeah.

1147
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:19,960
Yeah.

1148
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:25,000
Ya giant cranium B-O-Yacht.

1149
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,020
Can't you hear me, noggin?

1150
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,640
On your window.

1151
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,340
Can I spare a...

1152
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:30,820
Noture sign.

1153
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:31,560
Noture?

1154
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,700
Noture sign.

1155
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:33,700
Sutures?

1156
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,160
Boy, did we screw that one up.

1157
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:37,480
Oh, well.

1158
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,780
We'll get around to it.

1159
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,940
We'll do that one next week.

1160
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,520
Yes.

1161
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,300
You know, when we go off the air,

1162
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:54,880
probably Dr. Sinister won't jump in and start doing his show.

1163
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,600
He'll leave my background stuff playing for a long time,

1164
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,640
and it will be by the large...

1165
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:08,260
by Leemur and Hazel of the Windmills,

1166
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,980
who is kind of a new person.

1167
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,160
I don't think she's exactly a new person, per se.

1168
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,700
Perhaps new to your reckoning.

1169
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,760
Anyway, friends, you are listening to the Hour of Slack

1170
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,720
from the Church of the Subgenius,

1171
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,000
and you can get more information about all the stuff we've been talking about.

1172
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:34,780
Oh, and the Subgenius online class

1173
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:38,940
at MaybeLogicAcademy.org.

1174
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:43,780
That starts up again this fall on October 25th.

1175
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,980
Learn all you can, kid.

1176
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,640
It's a lot different than it has been before,

1177
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,780
and a lot bigger.

1178
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,900
All of this can be learned,

1179
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,180
and should only be learned,

1180
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,760
at Subgenius.com

1181
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,940
if you want to know these things.

1182
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,180
We can't call you to action on such things.

1183
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,980
But there's a motivation.

1184
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,920
Yes.

1185
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,820
A drive, like the sands that sweep across the desert.

1186
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,900
And for our prisoner listeners,

1187
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,160
which apparently there's quite a few of

1188
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,340
around Madison and Atlanta,

1189
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,140
who aren't on the internets,

1190
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,140
you can write for free information

1191
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,780
from Subgenius at

1192
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:30,280
Post Office Box 181-417

1193
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:37,000
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1194
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,560
That's Box 181-417

1195
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,540
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1196
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,060
Subgenius.com

1197
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,660
And for those yahoo.com posters,

1198
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,300
Subgenius does not have an O in it,

1199
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,700
but com does.

1200
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,900
And you don't write dot out,

1201
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,220
you just put a dot.

1202
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,560
You type the dot that's called a period.

1203
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,540
And, uh...

1204
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,000
Oh, please, please, please, just one more.

1205
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,640
This is from Beto.

1206
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,540
It seems celestial events are falling through dot dot dot

1207
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,720
in line of a great schism between beliefs,

1208
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,420
dot dot dot,

1209
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,460
a demand for the people to stand

1210
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,020
where they truly belongs,

1211
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,280
dot dot dot.

1212
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,160
This schism was actually rooted to the triggered

1213
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,500
by 9-11 tragedy, dot dot dot.

1214
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,240
And May Americans has been reading

1215
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,440
quranic teachings already,

1216
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,380
dot dot dot.

1217
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,560
And the gaps are clearly written and preached,

1218
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,400
dot dot dot.

1219
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,700
I wonder why they call it the quran,

1220
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,440
dot dot dot.

1221
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,160
Question mark?

1222
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,480
Just because of what we discussed earlier.

1223
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,580
Disgust is right.

1224
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,560
About the influenza passing quickly

1225
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,740
like an air and gas through a madman's head.

1226
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,940
Disgust is right.

1227
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,920
And so we must flee.

1228
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,400
We must go away.

1229
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,620
Oh, the music we were playing earlier in the background

1230
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,640
was from Rural War Room.

1231
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,480
Yay, Rural War Room!

1232
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,100
And FegmoTactic.

1233
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,560
Yay, FegmoTactic!

1234
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,640
Which is related to negative land.

1235
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,300
And in the background now is just a bunch of exotic lounge music

1236
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,060
that I don't know what it is really.

1237
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,660
But it's old and we can get away with it.

1238
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,700
And so now, Dave, I must bid you adieu.

1239
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,940
This woman does sound a little bit like Amy Kamish.

1240
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,360
Ema Sumac?

1241
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,240
Ema Sumac.

1242
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:36,960
It probably is.

1243
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,240
Yeah, listen to that.

1244
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,040
Maybe I just...

1245
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,160
OK, Dave, I'm fading her out, I'm fading her out.

1246
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,660
You're going...

1247
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,900
Going, going...

1248
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,500
Going, Dave...

1249
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,300
No!

1250
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,160
No!

1251
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,640
No!

1252
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:07,740
No!

1253
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:08,320
No!

1254
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,220
No!

1255
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:10,800
No!

1256
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000


1257
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000


1258
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000


1259
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000


1260
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000


1261
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,960
I happen to know Bob.

1262
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,080
I happen to know Bob.

1263
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,420
I haven't known Bob.

1264
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,520
Know what I'm saying?

1265
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:51,020
It's so hard for me to hide.

1266
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,120
She could drag me away.

1267
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,560
Down by the bay.

1268
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,040
Shot her dead.

1269
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,860
She could drag me away.

1270
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,120
Down by the bay.

1271
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,900
We just finished up a very cool record from Fingerprints,

1272
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,720
on which you can perform live at Fingerprints,

1273
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,860
from the soundtrack today for The Life on Mars.

1274
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,560
The great jazz musician and usually the quartet

1275
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,020
is...

1276
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:38,920
is coming up at the bakery,

1277
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,920
but his Bjork song as well.

1278
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,080
From the police and the police,

1279
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,720
we had the police because just, boy, a few things.

1280
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,340
Grand National, Grand National,

1281
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,240
a police, which I didn't know,

1282
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,160
and I'm assuming just making that up.

1283
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,280
All right, I'll believe you.

1284
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,700
Go see Sandra producing Everything Bad

1285
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,340
happening at the Silent Movie Theater.

1286
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:01,800
And let here with 89.88.88.1 and 89.1 Radio Community Service.

1287
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,160
I'm Ann. Let's stay with us.
