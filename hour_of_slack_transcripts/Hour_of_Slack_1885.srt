1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,300
This is not a rerun.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,980
You can tell because this episode will have way more girl voices than usual.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,420
Bob, would you help me please?

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,200
Bob!

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,560
Bob, what do you mean Bob?

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,140
The thing wasn't weird.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,460
Well, you pulled it too hard.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,460
Well, it's a good thing I don't believe in ghosts.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,300
Neither do I, but let's get out of here anyway.

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,960
Bob, who attended a party in the country last night and on the way home, took a detour.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,720
Most of us on waking in the morning know exactly where we are.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,220
The rooster or the alarm clock brings us out of sleep into the familiar sights,

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,740
sound,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,980
aromas of home and the comfort of a routine day ahead.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,280
Not so with our young friends.

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,700
This will be a day like none they've ever spent.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,280
And they'll spend it in the

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,360
Self-Genius Power Rolls

19
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,200
Work.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,260
Is this a test?

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,660
They're trying to find out how much of this we can take before we turn into blabbering idiots?

22
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,720
Honey, look at this.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,660
This is bound to be an explanation.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,420
What?

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:30,720
What?

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,020
Grass.

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,620
Come on.

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,500
Grass?

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,700
Just calm down.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,260
Here.

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,560
Grass?

32
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,400
Come on, get up now.

33
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:56,860
Come on.

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,360
Oh.

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,520
Oh.

36
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,660
Oh.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,560
Oh.

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,320
Oh.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,100
Well, I knew you were swacked, but really.

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,560
Oh, boy.

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,320
I didn't have that much.

42
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,800
Oh.

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,160
Hoo-hoo.

44
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,780
Where are we, Bob?

45
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,380
Where are we?

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,120
Where'd everybody go?

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,820
There isn't anybody.

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,640
Just us.

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,440
Oh, come on.

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,840
There isn't a person or a thing alive in this town.

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,380
And yet?

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,520
What?

53
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,420
We're being watched.

54
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,640
No.

55
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,340
Now you're getting delusions.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,860
Nothing in this town is real.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,820
The house we slept in.

58
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,980
His child was gone.

59
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


60
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


61
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


63
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


64
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


65
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


67
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


68
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


69
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


70
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


71
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


72
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,800
we can't find.

74
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,980
That squirrel

75
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,820
stuffed with sawdust.

76
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,640
Show me one thing

77
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,240
that's real.

78
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,380
Bob is real.

79
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,020
That's where they must be.

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640
They're in church.

81
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,340
Maybe they're praying.

82
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,540
Was that a delusion?

83
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
Here's the church.

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,100
There's the steeple.

85
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,140
Open the door.

86
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,540
Open.

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
Is this some kind of a joke?

88
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,440
Is this some kind of a joke?

89
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:35,960
Church?

90
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,560
I don't get it.

91
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,100
Bob, where are we?

92
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,940
I had hoped we were in

93
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,600
the self-genius

94
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,120
power of

95
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,260
the squad.

96
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,600
Well, we're not.

97
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,600
I don't know what it is.

98
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,720
A trick, a joke.

99
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,180
I don't get it.

100
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,900
Nothing moving.

101
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,240
Nothing real.

102
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,080
How did we get back there?

103
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,400
Why?

104
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,220
Why?

105
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Well, this...

106
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,860
This isn't grass.

107
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,060
This is a...

108
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,160
It's a prop.

109
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,900
Maybe we're dead, Bob.

110
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,520
Maybe this place is hell.

111
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,500
Did you ever hear of a railroad in hell?

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,020
Huh.

113
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
What a nutty little tongue.

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,100
And how.

115
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,800
I still wonder how we got there.

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,180
Well, somewhere along the line,

117
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,320
your drinks caught up with you.

118
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,260
And you got lost.

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,500
And we ended up here in

120
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,260
Centerville.

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,280
I suppose it's the kind of screwball thing that I would do.

122
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,240
How do you put up with me?

123
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:02,900
I don't know.

124
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,640
I guess I just have a weakness for screwballs.

125
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,240
Well, you certainly have a good one.

126
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,160
Well, well.

127
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,400
No.

128
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,740
No.

129
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,240
No.

130
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,440
Well, uh...

131
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
Maybe it's not the same Centerville.

132
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,620
Centerville.

133
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,840
A real nice place to raise your kids up.

134
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,660
Centerville.

135
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,940
It's really neat.

136
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
Churches.

137
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,240
Churches.

138
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,640
Churches!

139
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,440
And liquor stores!

140
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,400
Yes!

141
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,660
Be careful with your pets, dear. Daddy brought them all away from Earth.

142
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,140
Oh, can I play with them, Mommy?

143
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,920
After lunch, dear. Right now, put them back.

144
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,380
Oh.

145
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,520
Go on.

146
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,160
The moral of what you've just seen is clear.

147
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,340
If you drink, don't drive.

148
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,480
And if your wife has had a couple, she shouldn't drive either.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,580
You might both just wake up with a whale of a headache in a deserted village.

150
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,640
The Self-Genius Power of Self.

151
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,200
Bob, please don't try to find out anything more.

152
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,600
Let's just keep going.

153
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,800
Well, I used to be a sinner, cause I truly did believe

154
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,840
That the Virgin Mary, Jesus, and me were together

155
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,000
And I used to give my daughter televangelistic nods

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,240
But then the light, it showed me that I was wrong

157
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,240


158
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,060
And I found J.R. Bob Dobbs

159
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,580
And now my wallet belongs to Bob

160
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,180
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

161
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,260
Well, my heart is for my honey

162
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,280
And my brain is for my job

163
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,780
But my wallet belongs to Bob

164
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,600
And my wallet belongs to Bob

165
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,460
And I was just saying

166
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,500
Well, Bobby goes to profit

167
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,220
Every day of my life

168
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,220


169
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,220


170
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,220


171
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,440
And I'm just saying

172
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,440


173
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,520
Every chance that he can get

174
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,740
He can outperform the biggest

175
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,800
Without even breaking sweat

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,160
So I gave him all my money

177
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,220
Reverend thanks that it was right

178
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,560
And for only twenty dollars

179
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,500
He just saved my soul tonight

180
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,060
And now my wallet belongs to Bob

181
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,520
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

182
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,560
No more can the conspiracy

183
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,900
My lonely wages rob

184
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,220
And my wallet belongs to Bob

185
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,600
And my wallet belongs to Bob

186
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,040
And my wallet belongs to Bob

187
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,340
And my wallet belongs to Bob

188
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,000
And my wallet belongs to Bob

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,060
Well, Bobby's got a sweetie

190
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,300
And Connie is her name

191
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,580
And her ways could put the sacred whore of Babylon to shame

192
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,900
She reaches in Bob's pocket

193
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,240
Feels around for something hard

194
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,340
Then pulls her hand out holding on to his mighty credit card

195
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,780
And now my wallet belongs to Bob

196
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,220
And my wallet belongs to Bob

197
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,220


198
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,200
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

199
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,260
And I never have to fear

200
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,300
Cause I know Connie's on the job

201
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,460
And my wallet belongs to Bob

202
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,700
Well, you may have your lady

203
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,860
And your horny green man too

204
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,240
Their existential energy may be what's right for you

205
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,580
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cunts

206
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,760
And give away your money to the one that gets results

207
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,240
And then your wallet will be for Bob

208
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,880
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob

209
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,240
And you will be subgenius

210
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
Not another stupid slob

211
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,600
And your wallet will be for Bob

212
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,720
Well, I believe I am much calmer

213
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,760
Got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

214
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,460
Sitting on the dashboard of my car

215
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,720
Praise Bob!

216
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,920
Praise Bob!

217
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,180
Praise Bob!

218
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Praise Bob!

219
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


220
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,620
Praise Bob!

221
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,800
My wallet belongs to Bob

222
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,060
Friends, by the, as of last night, late Reverend Melodious Chops

223
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,880
Late to us, early to board the saucers

224
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,040
It was sudden and not fully expected

225
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,020
You know, if you live long enough

226
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,360
Watching your contemporaries drop like flies

227
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,000
is enough to make you want to drop acid and become like the fly, the Jeff Goldblum version.

228
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:07,180
Princess Wee and I are pushing 70, and it seems like some old friends and some not that old

229
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,100
dies every month or week.

230
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,320
Rock stars and billionaires younger than me are kicking the bucket right and left.

231
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,700
I'm not surprised.

232
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,980
I've watched my parents and my mother-in-law go through that period

233
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,140
where your friends vanish into the saucers or heaven or the crematorium or wherever

234
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,440
until they're the only one left.

235
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Bummer, man.

236
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,060
Bob predicted it, and he was spot on.

237
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,760
He said, it's going to be a bummer, man.

238
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,340
Quote, unquote, it's going to be a bummer, man.

239
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,400
Boy, was he ever right.

240
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,960
All this is building up to this episode's obituary.

241
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,220
Because after a short struggle with everything imaginable,

242
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,960
Sister Melodious Chops boarded the saucers.

243
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:08,560
She was known in subgenius world for several clever and well-recorded songs about Bob and Connie,

244
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,800
but she did a whole lot more than that as Victoria Ganger and Revelry.

245
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,440
My wife, Princess Wee, was one of the other two singers in that folk trio,

246
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:20,900
Four.

247
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,040
For 30 years, along with our friend, M.A., who is okay.

248
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,120
The songs were almost all originals by Vicky.

249
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,800
Vicky Ganger, like so many of these artistic types, was a complex person.

250
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,760
I mean, she could be a bit of a challenge to get along with.

251
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:50,680
She was mercilessly sharp-eyed and a razor-tongued,

252
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,280
critic and a control freak.

253
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,720
And she partied pretty hard.

254
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,460
You know all that stuff Mom tells you not to do?

255
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,300
She did all that.

256
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,580
She was also one of the most talented, funny people I ever knew.

257
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,360
And Princess Wee and I are sure going to miss her.

258
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,960
So tonight, we'll be hearing the Bob works of Sister Melodious Chops,

259
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,700
also known as Vicky Ganger,

260
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,540
and also some non-Bob songs.

261
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,360
So,

262
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,460
let's now hear her classic,

263
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,500
The Marriage of Bob and Connie.

264
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,820
The Marriage of Bob and Connie

265
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:27,820


266
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,300
by Bob and Connie

267
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:41,040
by Bob and Connie

268
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,240
In the world of mating,

269
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,840
in the world of mating habits,

270
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,660
I have seen it all the more.

271
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,200
I see the 98-year-old couple lock their walkers right on this floor.

272
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,900
I've seen communal carnal relations nearly turn into a mob.

273
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,320
But for a truly unique sensation,

274
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,460
you get to turn to Connie and Bob.

275
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,400
Oh,

276
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,500
it's the miracle of the 90s,

277
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,100
it's the talk of all the abyss,

278
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,220
it's the manhood of the 90s,

279
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,220


280
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,860
it's the marriage of Bob and Connie,

281
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,440
in the church of subgenius.

282
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,140
I've seen the mating of the iguana,

283
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,920
on the rocks is what they prefer.

284
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,100
While the sloths just like to hang around,

285
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,280
hoping something will occur.

286
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,540
And though the rabbit is most unsteady,

287
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,140
he is always ready once more.

288
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,940
But when it comes to Bob and Connie,

289
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,380
there's no way of keeping score.

290
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,400
Oh,

291
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,620
it's the miracle of the 90s,

292
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,160
it's the talk of all the abyss,

293
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,040
it's the marriage of Bob and Connie,

294
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,380
in the church of subgenius.

295
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,960
La la la la la la.

296
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,840
Ay!

297
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,440
A dragon's lie has balance,

298
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,340
a black widow has panache,

299
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,460
but Bob and Connie got their hands

300
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,940
on each other's personal stash.

301
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,800
An anaconda has got constriction,

302
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,520
and a crocodile has her grin,

303
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,440
but Bob and Connie are the one true origin of sin.

304
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,200
Oh,

305
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,140
it's the miracle of the 90s,

306
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,680
it's the talk of all the abyss,

307
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,760
it's the marriage of Bob and Connie,

308
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,200
in the church of subgenius.

309
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,020
La la la la la la.

310
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,680
Ay!

311
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,360
An anaconda has balance,

312
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,440
a black widow has constriction,

313
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,640
but Bob and Connie has a grin,

314
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,600
and a crocodile has a stature.

315
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,240
Oh,

316
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,240


317
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,240


318
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,240


319
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,240


320
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,900
La la la la la la.

321
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,180
Ay!

322
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,180


323
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,080
la la la la dear Bob.

324
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,040
La la la la la.

325
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:15,980
Ay!

326
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,180
La la la la la la.

327
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,180


328
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,400
La la la la la la dear Bob.

329
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,880
Brown-eyed Bob!

330
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,160
The ostrich do it in circles,

331
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,880
with her head stuck in de ground,

332
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,260
while the lemmings like to get it done

333
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,240
with lots of folk around.

334
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,020
So many combinations!

335
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,460
The results are always

336
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,240
is the same

337
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,420
You're prepared to get it on

338
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,540
In Bob and Connie's name

339
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,340
Oh

340
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,100

341
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,400
miracle of the 90s

344
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,800

Say Connie, you get around quite a bit don't you?

380
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,080
I'm going to ball girls.

381
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,960
Yes Bob, girls cunt.

382
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,400
So many plugs in there, Tommy.

383
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,040
Bob, one more cuck like that.

384
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,900
Did they ball girls too?

385
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,300
Yeah, I had a lot of fun.

386
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,360
Isn't that wonderful guys?

387
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,680
Butch.

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,440
Bob, you're a good boy.

389
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,740
I'm a good boy.

390
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,160
I'm a good boy.

391
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,160


392
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,160


393
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,160


394
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,160


395
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,160


396
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,960
Philo, you're a genius in a moronic sort of way.

397
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,000
Say, where's Philo?

398
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
He's in the back room listening to gang bangsters.

399
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,700
Gang bangsters.

400
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,480
Get that Philo.

401
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,340
Hello.

402
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:45,940
Shut up.

403
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,140
Hello.

404
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,760
Shut up.

405
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,960
Down Philo.

406
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,040
Say Connie, why are there three girls going around and around without stopping?

407
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,840
Look Bob.

408
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,360
What?

409
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:54,800
There's a woman.

410
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,540
Let's go right over there.

411
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,780
Let's ball girls Connie.

412
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,300
Okay Bob, but leave the nipples.

413
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,900
That like what?

414
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,640
Quiet Philo.

415
00:18:59,640 --> 00:18:59,940
Bob.

416
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,960
Yeah, well I'll buy the tickets.

417
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,540
I got the right tickets.

418
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:01,960
No, no, no Bob.

419
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,860
Bob, I'll get them.

420
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,740
I've got some money.

421
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
Yeah, what have we got for 20 cents?

422
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,460
Bob, what?

423
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:07,880
That woman.

424
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,560
Say Connie, who's that blonde down her face?

425
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,380
Who is that?

426
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,600
Oh, that's the brunette who taught me how to move my lips.

427
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,860
A little torture on a loose lip.

428
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,480
Yeah, sing the torture song Philo.

429
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,900
Well, that song's here again, but this time we get Bob's own version of it.

430
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
My yellow mommy.

431
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:36,880
A woke up son in one.

432
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,160
Oh, Bob.

433
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,840
Yeah.

434
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,520
Couldn't find my soul.

435
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,320
When I woke up Sunday morning.

436
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,720
Couldn't find my soul.

437
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,480
Well my toilet seat was freezing.

438
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,100
And my bagel didn't have no hole in it.

439
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,460
I went down to the river.

440
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,160
I didn't have any money.

441
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


442
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


443
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


444
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


445
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


446
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


447
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


448
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


449
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


450
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


451
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


452
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


453
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


454
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


455
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


456
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


457
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


458
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


459
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


460
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


461
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,160


462
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,300
I saw Bob say goodbye

463
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,860
I went by the river

464
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,220
I saw Bob say goodbye

465
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,200
A pipe clashed between his molars

466
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,840
And a twinkle in his eye

467
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,040
I said, Bob, you're coming

468
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,480
Bob, you're coming

469
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,000
Bob, you're coming

470
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,080
Bob, you're coming

471
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,920
Bob, you're coming

472
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,260
Bob, you're coming

473
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,320
BOB, YOU'RE COMING…!

474
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,320
You said I can give salvation

475
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,900
And I can show you a real good time

476
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,820
You said I can give salvation

477
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,480
And I can show you a real good time

478
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,060
I said, won't you set your card in

479
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:40,240
So you're just a friend of mine for tonight

480
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,020
Well, that's all

481
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,760
I said, won't you set your card in

482
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,200
Well, she plays them and she finds them

483
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,680
She don't stack the deck no more

484
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,080
Well, she plays them and she finds them

485
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,820
She don't stack the deck no more

486
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,260
You better save your contribution

487
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,980
Or she'll kick your bling

488
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,740
And head right out the door

489
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:47,860
I said, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming

490
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:57,300
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming

491
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,520
I'm coming to you

492
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,800
Come inside my room

493
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,500
Come inside your room

494
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,860
Come inside my room

495
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,820
Where you're off, every Hph

496
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,600
Lose yourenen

497
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:23,600
Lose yourenen

498
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,380
Then you can get your ticks

499
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,320
Lose yourenen

500
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,760
Pulling your awnings

501
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,800
There's no turning back

502
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:29,800


503
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,340
All of your fucking life

504
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:31,860
So stop the beating

505
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,520
Say it's opposite to law

506
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,040
Say it's opposite to discourse

507
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,960
Cause it ain't no use in denying

508
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,560
She's the one that gives you the slack

509
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,480
One more time

510
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,140
Bobby Connie

511
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,780
Bobby Connie

512
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,160
Bobby Connie

513
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,640
Bobby Connie

514
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,760
Bobby Connie

515
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,180
Bobby Connie

516
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,520
Bobby Connie

517
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,200
Bobby Connie

518
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,320
Bobby Connie

519
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,040
Oh, so right

520
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,720
If you want to go to marriage

521
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:27,180
Oh, so right

522
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,100
Well, then you've got to tie the knot

523
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Well, you've got to tie the knot

524
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,400
Well, you've got to tie the knot

525
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,220
Well, are you in or out of the program?

526
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,320
Are you on or off?

527
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,520
On or off?

528
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,240
On or off?

529
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,320
On or off?

530
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,620
On or off?

531
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,200
On or off?

532
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,420


533
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:08,980
On or off?

534
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,900
On or off?

535
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:10,480
On or off?

536
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,940
O.K.

537
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,300
On or off?

538
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,400
One, two three

539
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,460
One, two three

540
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:13,460


541
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,080
One, two three

542
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,880
This is my life

543
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:30,540
Aw, you can't believe it

544
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,100
with the ladies.

545
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,820
You got fools.

546
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,140
You should see them.

547
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,060
Mine are bigger.

548
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,540
Penetrate my body.

549
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,000
Gentlemen, I drink.

550
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,920
Not polite cocktails.

551
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,540
I mean, I drink.

552
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,860
Connie said she was gonna ream us

553
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,460
with 20-inch cattle prods

554
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,500
and I'm still waiting.

555
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,600
Mom, you can play with your pecker

556
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,480
for all I care,

557
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,060
just as long as you don't do it

558
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,040
in my control room.

559
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,320
Dismissed.

560
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,700
But then why?

561
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,420
Because Bob is inside each one of us.

562
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,860
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.

563
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,980
That band,

564
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,840
Victoria, Ganger, and Revelry,

565
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
well, to me, that was Vicky and M.A.

566
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
and Princess Wee.

567
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,040
They played out a lot.

568
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,400
They were regulars at the legendary

569
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,660
and beautifully named Cleveland Bar,

570
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,420
The Barking Spider,

571
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,640
and subgenius devivals

572
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,880
at the Beachland Ballroom

573
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,020
and lots of other places,

574
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,740
but their real audience

575
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,240
was the folks at pagan festivals,

576
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,920
especially Starwood and Winterstar,

577
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,920
of which she was one of the first organizers.

578
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,040
Now, some of you subgeniuses

579
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,240
might be all like,

580
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,600
ooh, pagan festivals,

581
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,300
all those New Age love burgers.

582
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,880
How can you stand it, Stag?

583
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,820
Well, let me tell you a thing or two

584
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
about pagans,

585
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,260
the ones up north anyway.

586
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,300
They know how to party.

587
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,980
And what you may have heard

588
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,280
about the temperature of a witch's breast,

589
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,940
that's not true.

590
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,940
I can't speak for gravediggers' butts,

591
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,820
but I mean, they probably are pretty cold.

592
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,160
Only about half of the pagans

593
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,660
are humorless, fundamentalist New Agers.

594
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,180
The other half are mischievous weirdos

595
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,840
who love to tick off the fundy pagans,

596
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,180
which is why I, the mascot skeptic,

597
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,180
was hired for almost every festival

598
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,920
until I married the Starwood Festival

599
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,540
and the former Princess Wee,

600
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,260
after which I worked for free, mostly.

601
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,180
Anyway, being married to one of Vicki's

602
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,040
trio, I saw many, many revelry performances indeed.

603
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,180
And another thing I'll tell you

604
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,700
is that Vicki Ganger was funny.

605
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,540
Her onstage banter between songs was really fun.

606
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,920
And what I'll play next was recorded live at Starwood,

607
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,160
the song Tool Time,

608
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,260
a very funny and naughty song

609
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,540
about sex and magic.

610
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,940
Basically, it's about doing,

611
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,720
doing a ritual to get the perfect boyfriend

612
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,380
with a great big tool set, let's say.

613
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,380
See if you can recognize all the male gods

614
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,440
she rattles off in this.

615
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,120
One dark and stormy night

616
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,240
I thought I'd do me some magic

617
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,640
And work me a spell that was cool

618
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,920
Not to be a fool, not to be a fool

619
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:28,920


620
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,460
Not to summon up a pixie

621
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,060
Or think something tragic

622
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,680
Just get me a magical tool

623
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,580
I had cups and wands and cauldrons

624
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,700
Even an altar with daddies carved out of stone

625
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,240
But I was feeling all frustrated

626
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,960
Cause I was lacking a magical tool of my own

627
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,280
One with the heart of a god

628
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,220
And the mind of a druid

629
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,980
And built like the bull of Queen Maeve too

630
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,360
But I spent too much time

631
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,460
In the arms of Bacchus

632
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,180
So I'll probably settle for you

633
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,900
Be careful what you wish for

634
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,620
Now that's a lesson

635
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,020
And I've tried a long time to learn

636
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,780
So I knew that it was risky

637
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,560
But I was frisky

638
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,020
And I had some power to burn

639
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,440
So I did some meditating

640
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,600
And gazed at some crystals

641
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,340
And splashed in my vision

642
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,940
And I was in a visionary pool

643
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,480
I threw caution to the winds

644
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,220
And then I started to spin

645
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,060
And called for a magical tool

646
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,540
That had the heart of a god

647
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,260
Oh please don't make him dizzy

648
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,140
Built like the bull of Queen Maeve too

649
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,400
But Osiris is unwilling

650
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,200
And Odin's busy

651
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,380
So I'll probably settle for you

652
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,280
With my higher power

653
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,340
Yo yo can you hear me

654
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,720
I'm praying with all of my might

655
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,920
For the planets to align

656
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,940
With every magic sign

657
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,520
And you'll bring my tool here tonight

658
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,440
Now I know you don't like whining

659
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,320
So here's some candy

660
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,720
And maybe I'll pour you a beer

661
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,380
And if it's not too much trouble

662
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,060
It would be handy

663
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,940
If you'd manifest him right here

664
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,240
And with the heart of a god

665
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
And the mind of a druid

666
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,960
And built like the bull of Queen Maeve too

667
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,300
But Cthulhu is outrageous

668
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,000
And Krishna's contagious

669
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,140
So I'll probably settle for you

670
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,860
And up and down and in and out

671
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,500
Cause that's what magic's all about

672
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,880
I really want me a magical tool

673
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,660
And round and round and round we go

674
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,220
With me above and you below

675
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,220
I really need me a magic tool

676
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,360
That has the heart of a god

677
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,260
And the mind of a druid

678
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,980
And built like the bull of Queen Maeve too

679
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,380
But Poseidon is suspicious

680
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,300
Thor can be vicious

681
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,320
So I'll probably settle for you

682
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,300
Dearest higher power

683
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,320
Now don't you tease me

684
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,600
I'm not asking much of you here

685
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,220
Just to sing your song

686
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


687
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


688
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


689
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


690
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


691
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


692
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


693
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


694
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


695
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


696
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


697
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


698
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


699
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


700
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


701
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


702
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


703
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,220


704
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,080
My name's not a single magic tool

705
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,180
That will try to please me

706
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,660
And help me to be of good cheer

707
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,140
I have practiced long and hard

708
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,260
So you will reward me

709
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,620
The way that you know that you should

710
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,520
And I swear I won't abuse him

711
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,360
I'll never lose him

712
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,840
And I'll only use him for good

713
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,220
Give him the heart of a god

714
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,020
Oh, please don't make him lazy

715
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,800
And built like the bull of Queen Maeve too

716
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,240
But Apollo's such a player

717
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,200
And a god like me

718
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,200


719
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,200


720
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,200


721
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,960
And Loki's crazy, so I'll probably settle for you.

722
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,460
I want some magic, I want some magic.

723
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,880
I want some magical tool.

724
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,500
Oh, I want some magic, I want some magic.

725
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,900
I want some magical tool.

726
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,620
I want some magic.

727
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,920
I want some magic, I want some magical tools

728
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,460
I want some magic, I want some magic

729
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,000
I want some magical tools

730
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,960
I don't want to be depressed

731
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,380
I demand the best

732
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:43,760
So I'll probably settle for you

733
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:43,940
Do you?

734
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,160
It's all her fault. Don't blame us.

735
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:04,120
For some reason, people my age are referred to as boom operators or something like that.

736
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,780
Many of us had love-hate relationships with computers and the internet when those things hit the home and office.

737
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,720
Not me, I had love only.

738
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,780
was more of a typical early computer user. On her day job, she was a professional freelance

739
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:27,560
copywriter, someone who writes ads. So she had to learn the new technology, and this resulted in a

740
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:37,520
whimsical song called Comp U Blues, probably from the early 90s. Later, however, after computing

741
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:45,080
moved from desktops in the home to phones on the subway, she wrote a still funny but also somewhat

742
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:54,100
darker song, Technologized, which addressed the weird isolation in a crowd brought on by smartphones.

743
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,660
Now, I'll play the lighter, earlier, more innocent type song first.

744
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,080
? Blues news,!. spies!

745
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,340
Must 그렇게 alles onde você come seguir?

746
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,080
Well, everybody got one, I wanted one too For many things, and then there was theおお

747
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,740
My very own computer, all brand new, of my very own computer, all brand new

748
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,180
? I was dreaming! ? I was dreaming!

749
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,820
A multi-task dream, irradiumanknight Boulder

750
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,500
Making other things I could do, doing other things I could do

751
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,580
on the screen. I read articles, surveys, and asked by the score. Then I screwed up my courage and I

752
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:50,600
went to the store. It was homeless. I wish I was dead. I called to the salesman and here's what I

753
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:58,900
said. Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram. Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram. There's too much to see.

754
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,880
I can't possibly choose. I got the drag and drop screen, save a Pentium Blues. I got the blues,

755
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:19,980
blues, blues, Pentium Blues. I took my baby home from the computer store.

756
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:28,120
She sat on the couch about a week or two more. It was a monster. A sight to behold, about 15 tons,

757
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,580
and it cost a load. Then late one night, I gave in to the call. Put it together,

758
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,720
plugged it into the wall. I might just get sat. Looking so pretty, then it blew every fuse in the

759
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:50,780
goddamn city. Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram. Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram. Everything I save,

760
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:57,000
I eventually use. I got the drag and drop screen, save a Pentium Blues. I got the blues, blues,

761
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:03,280
blues, Pentium Blues. Blues, blues, Pentium Blues. Blues, blues, Pentium Blues. Blues,

762
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,860
blues, Pentium Blues.

763
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:16,240
I got books to peruse. I got articles to read. I got everything I could possibly need. I'm not stupid,

764
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:24,000
but I'm telling you, to figure it out, I need a higher IQ. What's a Windows? A manager? And what

765
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,080
is a PIF? I think my mouse just died. His tail is getting stiff. The application, I wanted today.

766
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,360
I double clicked twice and it went away.

767
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:44,140
Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram. Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram. Everything I save, I eventually use.

768
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,880
I got the drag and drop screen, save a Pentium Blues. I got the blues, blues, blues, Pentium

769
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,260
& stable-play-boost, pentium-balse. I need your disciples fond of Jebus blues,

770
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,660
my mentor's shoes, Mic それ以勇者服,

771
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:04,860
make yourimport takes all. Now, one of the things I wanted to do. Which studio? Let's go!onyata,

772
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:04,860


773
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:04,860


774
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:04,860


775
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:04,860


776
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,760
I'll be surfing in a minute or two.

777
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,820
Oh, yeah, right.

778
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,740
Caught in the net, been pointing and clicking,

779
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,180
and I ain't there yet.

780
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,220
Still, I managed to find America online.

781
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,860
Got in the chats, and I was doing fine.

782
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,040
I got an upgrade.

783
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,160
It was such a thrill till I got the $123 bill.

784
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,340
Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram.

785
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,540
Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram.

786
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,960
Everything I save, I eventually lose.

787
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,260
I got the drag and drop screen, save up heavy, I'm loose.

788
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,400
Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram.

789
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,640
Gigabyte, megabyte, ram, ram.

790
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,820
Everything I save, I eventually lose.

791
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,160
I got the drag and drop screen, save up heavy, I'm loose.

792
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,820
First it was 386.

793
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,880
SX.

794
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,120
Then it was 486.

795
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,000
SX.

796
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,380
Then it was 486.

797
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:00,940
DX.

798
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,520
Then it was 486.

799
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:02,620
DX.

800
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,220
Then it was 33, 60, 75, 90, 101.

801
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,100
Pentium fun.

802
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,160
I got the Pentium Blues.

803
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,860
Everything I save, I eventually lose.

804
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,380
I got the drag and drop screen, save up Pentium.

805
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,060
Lose.

806
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,140
Two, three, go.

807
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,220
And those technologies, oh.

808
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,960
Everybody's on a cell phone.

809
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,100
Got an iPod in their ear.

810
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,780
Text messaging and pointing cameras.

811
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,720
And nobody's left to hear.

812
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,120
So I got a phone.

813
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,120


814
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,740
Everything is on a charger

815
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,940
Chargers plugged into a wall

816
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,120
Cordless battery convenience

817
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,580
Means no outlets left at all

818
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,300
And I make my way through darkened rooms now

819
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,880
By the light of the LEDs

820
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,600
Oh, those technologies

821
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,720
I've been technologies

822
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,960
I've been technologies

823
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,800
Oh no

824
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,900
Those technologies

825
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
I've been technologies

826
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
I've been technologies

827
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,360
Oh no

828
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,280
Got no I.O.

829
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,860
upon the road now got no hands upon the wheel everybody's multitasking like a fool

830
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:14,020
got a buzzing in the brain now got a ring tone in the ear it's the vacant plugged in look that makes

831
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:19,200
you cool did she say something oh yeah and a cell phone

832
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:40,560
seems like every life is running on a tiny little screen everyone is off the wire every place

833
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:51,400
wonder if this is the future living in a world where no one sees

834
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:59,100
those technologies oh i've been technologies oh i've been technologies

835
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,040
those technologies

836
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,280
oh

837
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,440
no

838
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,760
everybody's on ourself

839
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,160
can you hear me now

840
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:07,020
that was victoria ganger and revelry live at starwood festival and i'll never get to see

841
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:13,900
that band again bummer i have to admit putting the show together has made me weepy

842
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:22,100
at times we just heard the news of vicky's passing last night and you know how it is it takes a while

843
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:28,580
to sink in and seem real that's another thing i wish i wasn't getting used to on the other hand

844
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:34,980
at least i'm still around to get bummed out it beats the alternative as old folks say and say

845
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:43,380
and say anyway vicky liked to pick apart the little paradoxes and big contradictions of daily life

846
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:50,280
she was kind of like a hippie pagan irma bombeck actually i guess she was a little more like tom

847
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,960
wearer she came up with clever lyrics that lightened up the things that can ruin your day

848
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,280
so

849
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,280


850
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:21,840
monday morning and i go to my employment to discover that the fax machine is jammed

851
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:28,920
that the copier's completely out of paper and the printer cover now needs to be slammed

852
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:36,200
so i look it up in my employee handbook to find the proper places where i now must go

853
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
but when i find the designated person they proceed to shrug and say hell i don't know i'm not sure i'm

854
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:57,080
everyone's mystified everyone's mystified everyone's mystified and it sure beats the hell out of me

855
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,920
i take my car in cause it's making noises like a cross between a buffalo and cat

856
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:21,480
some mechanics give professional opinions then conclude that they don't know imagine that

857
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,980
at the store i asked the clerk whatever happened to the service and the products on the shelf

858
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:36,400
but she shakes her head at me like i am crazy said you'll have to solve that mystery yourself

859
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,160
you're sort of mystified

860
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,920
everyone's mystified

861
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,980
they are so mystified and it still beats the hell out of me

862
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:06,740
last night i saw a sort of celebration where the druids and the techno heads combined

863
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,760
they dance around a fire in a disco

864
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,980
then they put on these machines to blow it off

865
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:13,980


866
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,700
and they blow their minds

867
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,300
oh this smile of me with faces so beatific

868
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,040
and the music that they made was so serene

869
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,800
that i couldn't help but think that i was missing

870
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,540
something cosmic in the make up of my jeans

871
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,000
they were so mystified

872
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,100
they were so myst

873
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,620
hadn't a clue

874
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,660
they were so mystified

875
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,600
and it still beats the hell out of me

876
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:07,080
now if you're on the horns of a dilemma and you haven't got a clue where you should go

877
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,740
you might as well just hang it up completely

878
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,580
oh man

879
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:12,580


880
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:12,580


881
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,560
you're gonna make your own solutions as you go

882
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,520
cause there ain't nobody gonna give you answers

883
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,060
nobody's got the means to set you free

884
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,860
and if you're asking for the hidden meaning

885
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,500
why i even wrote this song

886
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
don't ask me

887
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,040
you can be mystified

888
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,860
you can be mystified

889
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,760
you can be mystified

890
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,560
and it'll still beat the hell out of me

891
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,580
everyone's mystified

892
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,320
for sure

893
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,540
so mystified

894
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,100
no clue

895
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,240
so mystified

896
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,520
and it sure beats the hell

897
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,320
you never can tell

898
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,740
it still beats the hell

899
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,300
out of

900
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:06,680
me

901
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,380
I don't know how people do that

902
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:33,280
I should also mention that while I'm playing mostly her funny songs

903
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:41,200
her CD albums have more sensitive and mystical type songs of love and magic and the moon

904
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,360
and all that nice stuff

905
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:42,540
but no, I don't really have a clue

906
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:42,540


907
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:42,540


908
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:42,540


909
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:42,540


910
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,100
but this is a subgenius show.

911
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,420
I wish I could tell you where you could get her recordings,

912
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,780
but you can't.

913
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:53,060
Maybe look for concert videos on YouTube.

914
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,820
Okay, all right, okay, all right.

915
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,820
Change of pace.

916
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,680
How about some Zappa compositions

917
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,220
performed by the Empire Jazz Orchestra,

918
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,800
conducted by our buddy, Reverend P...

919
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,060
I don't know how to pronounce his subgenius name.

920
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,040
Bill Meckley.

921
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,180
Bill Meckley.

922
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,760
He's a subgenius we got to know

923
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,360
on the mostly online Diaspora Zoom meetings,

924
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,960
and we had him as a house guest last week.

925
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,600
Praise Bob.

926
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,980
And he didn't die of old age during his visit,

927
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,880
despite being almost my age.

928
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,560
In fact, he was rocking out and having fun with us,

929
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,440
within reasons.

930
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,320
We have to be careful how we rock out

931
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,560
if we want to keep rocking.

932
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,540
Now see if you can recognize the songs

933
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,620
in this instrumental medley.

934
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,200
Here we go.

935
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,620
Here we go.

936
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,400
Here we go.

937
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,900
Here we go.

938
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,420
Here we go.

939
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,320
Here we go.

940
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,960
Here we go.

941
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,700
Here we go.

942
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,280
Here we go.

943
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,040
Let's do this thing a bit faster.

944
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,120
Here we go.

945
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:01,380
Here we go.

946
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:01,920
Here we go.

947
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:02,240
Here we go.

948
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,040
Here we go.

949
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,780
Here we go.

950
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,980
Here we go.

951
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,940
guitar solo

952
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,740
guitar solo

953
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,720
guitar solo

954
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,500
guitar solo

955
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,420
guitar solo

956
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:14,420


957
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,040
guitar solo

958
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,920
guitar solo

959
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,320
applause

960
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,620
applause

961
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,900
Frank Zappa's

962
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,940
Who Are The Brain Police and Holiday

963
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,820
in Berlin performed

964
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,960
by the Empire Jazz

965
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,580
Orchestra. Also

966
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,920
heard in the background.

967
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,440
Too cool.

968
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,900
Thank you Empire Jazz Orchestra

969
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,000
and our pal Reverend Billy

970
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
for more information and worse

971
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
see subgenius.com

972
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,920
I'm going to let our departed

973
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,080
pal Victoria Ganger end the

974
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,960
show with her crowd favorite at the

975
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,080
Pagan Festivals because it's

976
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,180
about the Pagan Festivals and a certain

977
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,080
type of person one meets at

978
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,640
those. Pagan Fest

979
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,960
Barbie by Victoria

980
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,260
Ganger and Revelry.

981
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,360
Most of you

982
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,400
probably won't cry like I did.

983
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,180
Pagan Festivals

984
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:22,340
Pagan Festivals

985
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,340


986
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,340


987
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,340


988
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,340


989
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,860
You came to my festival

990
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,180
all pretty and pink

991
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,460
You brought your own

992
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,120
mirror and your dream

993
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,720
house and your sink

994
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,960
I tried to resist

995
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,380
falling under your

996
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,320
spell but when I

997
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,520
saw you Barbie

998
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,160
spiritual

999
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,980
spirituality went

1000
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,640
to hell

1001
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,240
doo doo-doo-do

1002
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,460
Whoo Bree-doo

1003
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,180
Whoa

1004
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:50,680
Whoa

1005
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:56,360
Any

1006
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:57,780
Deeds

1007
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:57,780


1008
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Whoa

1009
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,980
Bye.

1010
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,700
Dip, dip, dip, dip.

1011
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,860
Dip, dip, dip, dip.

1012
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,000
Whoa.

1013
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,820
Oh, Pagan Fest Barbie.

1014
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,180
You walk on your toes.

1015
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,300
Must be the heel.

1016
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,240
Your nails are all polished.

1017
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,280
A gem in your nose.

1018
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,520
Genuine pearl.

1019
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,540
I see true magic when I look at you.

1020
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,560
Pagan Fest Barbie, I love you.

1021
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,140
Never dresses in leather.

1022
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,340
Leather of feathers or fur.

1023
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,760
Politically perfect.

1024
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,060
You're polyester.

1025
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,560
Pagan angel.

1026
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,500
That's her.

1027
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,000
She's polyamorous.

1028
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,580
With anyone.

1029
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,040
True.

1030
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,280
But Pagan Fest Barbie, I love you.

1031
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,660
You came and you danced by the firelight.

1032
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,820
With your sweet smile fixed on your face.

1033
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,100
It's so plastic.

1034
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,120
And you're so pretty.

1035
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,460
And all of the gods of the day and the night.

1036
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,380
No, no one can ever take your place.

1037
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,540
You're unique, Barb.

1038
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,180
A starry blue running deer.

1039
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,040
Deep crystal in flame.

1040
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,520
Wait, there's more.

1041
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,920
Yeah, you love Jim McKenzie.

1042
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,440
Well, that is her legal name.

1043
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,320
I hate to admit it.

1044
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,860
But what can I do?

1045
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,840
Pagan Fest Barbie, I love you.

1046
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,620
She likes to take showers.

1047
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,540
Anytime, anywhere.

1048
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,140
On and off.

1049
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,800
She may stay there for hours.

1050
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,240
With her razor and her nails.

1051
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,500
Water's gone.

1052
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,180
You can talk conservation.

1053
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,680
And she won't have a clue.

1054
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,980
Pagan Fest Barbie, I love you.

1055
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:58,320
You came and you stole my heart away.

1056
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,940
Take it, baby.

1057
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,100
With your sweet smile.

1058
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,340
Yeah.

1059
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,440
You have my big style.

1060
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,820
And your charm.

1061
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,500
And you put a spell on me.

1062
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:08,980
And if we should do the great and right tonight.

1063
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:10,420
I know.

1064
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,440
It'll do me no harm.

1065
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,280
And it harm none.

1066
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,220
Oh, Pagan Fest Barbie, you are the best.

1067
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,240
Good for me.

1068
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,340
By each god and goddess.

1069
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,360
You're triple blessed.

1070
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,540
Blessed by me.

1071
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,720
So you get your hair done.

1072
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,100
I'll get it done.

1073
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:30,680
Tattoo.

1074
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,060
Pagan Fest Barbie, I love you.

1075
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,080
Pagan Fest Barbie, I love you.

00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,260
