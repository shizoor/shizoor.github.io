1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,540
Forget, forget, forget. We're all sitting together listening to this.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:16,980
Forget, forget, forget. We're all sitting together listening to this.

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,440
Forget, forget, forget.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,560
Children just love to bite bombs.

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:44,000
Orange. Deep, deep blue. A touch of scientific silver. Lemon, lemon, lemon yellow.

6
00:00:48,060 --> 00:01:07,340
Soft, soft beige. The sweet smell of barbecue purple. All the colors of the rainbow dripping from your ears and eyes.

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,980
Lush magenta.

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:33,420
Crimsonist rose. Holographic yellow. Peachy peach. Dreamy, dreamy red.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,660
Schwabby, Schwabby, Schwabby, Schwabby.

10
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,820
Let's go, clock. Let's go, ball.

11
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,680
Black dot by black dot. Bob's face slowly rolls across the horizon.

12
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,200
Dot by dot by dot by dot.

13
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,440
Each dot cueing a sheep, and the sheep leaps.

14
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,740
Each smaller sheep represents a half a dot in those little, lightly shaded areas.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
of Bob's face.

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,720
But leap they do

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,740
and leap they must

18
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,680
because, as you all know,

19
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,440
the more he smiles,

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,420
the more the crust

21
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,400
seeps into your system.

22
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,680
Please trust us

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,040
and know that

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,760
we'll never abandon you

25
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,300
so long as you can send that check

26
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,160
to P.O. Box 140306

27
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,940
Dallas, Texas

28
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,280
75214

29
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,500
and bring it all back home

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,580
for Bob

31
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,680
and the Church of the Subgenius,

32
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,840
the only church that pays its taxes.

33
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,460
Thank you, friend.

34
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,460
And thank you, Bob.

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
Happy birthday, Bob.

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,040
And that is about...

37
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,680
We got about one minute left here.

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,300
Do you want to do any intros or anything?

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,780
Is it Bob's birthday?

40
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,920
We filled up a whole 100-minute tape.

41
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,340
Oh, God.

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,000
Wow.

43
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,440
Boy, it just seemed like no time at all.

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,620
Yes, indeed, friends.

45
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,320
Like the blink of an eye.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,040
When you're moving at light speed,

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,160
everything turns inside out

48
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,000
and just when you think the tape is ending,

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,600
you find yourself doing the intro

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,500
to this brand-new

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,060
Hour of Einstein's

52
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,680
Secret Orchestrous Plank.

53
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,620
Orchestrous Plank.

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,660
Orchestrous Plank.

55
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,600
Orchestrous Plank.

56
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,360
Orchestrous Plank.

57
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,200
Orchestrous Plank.

58
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,380
Orchestrous Plank.

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
Orchestrous Plank.

60
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,740
Orchestrous Plank.

61
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,340
Orchestrous Plank.

62
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,800
Orchestrous Plank.

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:56,900
Pictrous Plank.

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,740
Uganda's Sicherheit Hey, Bangkok!

65
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,400
Instead of the

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,400


67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,160
Keep the troops warmed up and keep the cards and letters coming.

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,980
Yes, dear friends.

69
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,340
www.wcsb.org.

70
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,660
I am your uncle.

71
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,700
I am your uncle.

72
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:36,580
My friends, and we are also at the subgenius radio ministry.

73
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,960
www.wcsb.org.

74
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,380
And in the final few minutes,

75
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,960
Miss Saitama and Mary distraught, left adrift somewhere in the woods

76
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,600
with the car burning in the distance.

77
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,780
It'll be an hour before the Mounties can even get close.

78
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,320
Yet Stang continues his relentless pursuit,

79
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,740
looking for their tender young bodies.

80
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,060
They've taken the whole consignment of furry squid,

81
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,760
and he knows they have it.

82
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,920
Things will get worse for them as they lie twisted together

83
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,700
like a pair of frozen statues, trying to keep warm.

84
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,040
We join them at the knees where they belong.

85
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,680
The Stang trudges on snow jumps, hot to see them.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,780
Look, Stang, I see a truck.

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,880
What?

88
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, they've revealed themselves again, once again, at last.

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,740
My God, man, don't you see?

90
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,880
There's at least three of them, and they're all tripping.

91
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,700
Quick, give me the camera.

92
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,380
Blood wrestling.

93
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,800
There's something, something un-genic.

94
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,100
Something unearthly.

95
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,740
Something subhuman.

96
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,440
My God, man, it's something subgenius.

97
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,300
You are standing on a wall of the city of Ur in Mesopotamia 4,000 years ago.

98
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,420
Great walled cities are man's answer to population increase.

99
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,520
Surplus grows into wealth.

100
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,660
And wealth encourages war.

101
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,740
Man attacks man.

102
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,080
Ramparts shake.

103
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,520
The clash of battle echoes through long days of the Bronze Age.

104
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,100
Man increases his power and honor.

105
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,840
He invents government, commerce, architecture, writing, and taxes.

106
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,240
Over and over again, he fights to protect what is his.

107
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,140
And out of destruction, man rebuilds and moves forward.

108
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,620
We are not men.

109
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,680
We are not men.

110
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,560
We are not men.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,740
We are not men.

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,260
We are not men.

113
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,860
We are not so happy.

114
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,220
We are not the Shakespeare lined up drunken.

115
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,680
We are not the Dombey lined up 4 missing that has to die to triumph.

116
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,600
We are not the Brick laid to shame.

117
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,700
Say hello, Stangee.

118
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,160
Hello Stangee.

119
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,960
Well, it's another silent movie with sound once again as the Subgenius Hour of Slack

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,420
gets its second win.

121
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,460
What do you say, kids?

122
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,060
And here it is now.

123
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,040
No, no, it's not.

124
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,700
That's a drop-in for you, Sting.

125
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,640
It's so sparkly.

126
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,420
Sting.

127
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,760
Well, children just love to bite Bob.

128
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,740
Look at these three kids biting into this Bob,

129
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,880
the squealing, squirming, screaming, dying little Bob.

130
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,620
And it's fresh meat, too.

131
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,060
Join us in our meat.

132
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,800
There are a number of ways you can make your Bob.

133
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,120
There are just so many ways and so many different things you can do with a Bob.

134
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,160
You can lacerate it.

135
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,800
You can fillet it like a fish would might be.

136
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,760
Bob meat is versatile.

137
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,840
Bob meat is versatile.

138
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,300
You can smear it in A1 sauce or little pieces of Parmesan.

139
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,960
I want more Bob face, Mom.

140
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,180
You can take his ears.

141
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,880
Give me more Bob face.

142
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,480
Bob ear is a Bob ear, much like you might eat a pig.

143
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,880
Can I have some, please?

144
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,720
A pussy-killed Bob is not bad in a wine sauce.

145
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,500
Mom, why did the pussy kill Bob?

146
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,560
Mom!

147
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,200
Bob killed pussy.

148
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,080
Mom, why did the Bob kill pussy?

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,860
Why did the pussy kill Bob, Mom?

150
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,960
Why are Bob and pussy at war at this moment in time?

151
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,300
Come on, Mom, tell me.

152
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,640
Son, I can't answer that question until you're more mature.

153
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,600
Dad, are you going to let Bob be whipped by pussy?

154
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,620
They had ho-hos for Jesus.

155
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,440
What is the log?

156
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,800
To walk on a forest.

157
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,180
That is the log!

158
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:47,940
I'd like to quote the Reverend Cowboy Dave at this point and say that the most important thing to remember in any dissociative association experiment is,

159
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,400
and I want to say sort of fish and I don't want to say it, is I don't want to have to say it.

160
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,040
And Dave, you sent me that tonight and I just wanted to thank you for that.

161
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,080
I just wanted not to have to say that.

162
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,600
I can't say what I want to say.

163
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,640
I just want to say what I want to say about that.

164
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,380
It has been said again. It will be said before. It shall be said once again.

165
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,840
But it is fishy, isn't it? It's rather fishy what you might want to say.

166
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,020
And I found, I found it was...

167
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,340
It only smells that way after I'm through with it, in my experience.

168
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,460
Well, see, on the East Coast, well, that's because you've been in 400 degree weather for the past three weeks.

169
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,800
Hey, I've been trained, uh, Bridie helped train me for life in a spaceship.

170
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,000
You know, we've all been training for the...

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000


172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,460
For the...

173
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,160
For the escape vessels.

174
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,760
Yes, I created this vacuum between my frontal flippers and put his face in it.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,980
That's the space.

176
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,620
It is as if we live on the hot side of Mars. It's 100 degrees outside right now and it's midnight.

177
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,520
It's 100 degrees at midnight?

178
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,400
120.

179
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,720
5 degrees.

180
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,700
That's at night.

181
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,780
You lose sight of the fact that it's a vacuum out there and if you spring a leak next to it, you're gonna be dead.

182
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,460
Yeah, see you're going down the street in your big Cadillac.

183
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,380
You got girls in the front row.

184
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,700
You got girls in the back.

185
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,880
Yeah, way in the back.

186
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,140
You got money in a sack.

187
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,780
Both hands on the wheel and your shoulders right back.

188
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,780
We all try to be good and faithful servants, but is your money in fact working against the kingdom of God?

189
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,120
Sad to say, this one will give 10% of your long distance bills to Concerned Women for America.

190
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,780
We are going to have sex in your life.

191
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,440
Can we talk a little bit about shaving the squid and the squid and the whole squid phenomenon tonight with our little girl?

192
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
We were talking about the love rug, the love rug, the kind of love rug Bob likes to roll out for all the kids.

193
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,300
Yeah, and how this relates to prairie squid itself.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,480
Love rug, we roll it out every day and we think about Bob and unfortunately that brings us down, doesn't it?

195
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,560
Yeah, well the love rug is kind of a bring down when it's, you know, in your ears and in your eyes while you're trying to get down with it.

196
00:10:51,860 --> 00:11:01,420
Sometimes it's a little tawdry and sometimes it smells like one of those deep sea basses, but that's alright because for Bob we can practically do anything by focusing our minds, focusing our minds.

197
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,420


198
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,800
Focusing our bodies and bringing our hearts into perfect conjunction with that.

199
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:11,940
Yes, but do you take just that little sip of the special love monkey love drug that comes free inside every prairie squid now being packaged now.

200
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,980
There's a new kind of prairie squid coming out this month, isn't there, Stang?

201
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,780
They have the most beautiful long black eyelashes around their great big blue eyes.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,920
Could we see one right now?

203
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,540
Yeah, could you hold one up to the screen now please?

204
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,020
Look, he'll watch you while you masturbate.

205
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,400
That is probably one of the better features of the...

206
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,400


207
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,680
It will watch you while you masturbate.

208
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,160
Oh wait, did he say watch or wash?

209
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,060
I think it does both at the same time.

210
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,080
Wash or wash?

211
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,180
Sir, it's a creature that washes as it watches?

212
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,900
No, he'll wash you while you put a squid in.

213
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,720
I think it's going back into the tube now.

214
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,320
Yeah, I had a few tubes...

215
00:11:50,320 --> 00:12:01,400
I had some tubes of squid that you sent to me that day and the tubes full of squid fell out of the package right after I put them in.

216
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,520
I opened it and it had that little smell, but that was one of the toothpaste tubes that you sent me.

217
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,020
But it was still good.

218
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,980
Oh no, those were all...

219
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,660
Those were in formaldehyde. You weren't supposed to eat those.

220
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,220
Those were experimental...

221
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,620
Oh no!

222
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,700
...you didn't cut your own into the tube.

223
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,560
Those tubes are all experimental.

224
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:30,480
You may lose most of your teeth right now, but you'll gain in psychic power and in just a few short weeks you'll be able to divine the future and read other people's minds without having one yourself.

225
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:40,200
So, plus my entire digestive system should be preserved thanks to the formaldehyde that stank smuggle to me, but it was really great formaldehyde.

226
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:54,780
It was greater than great formaldehyde. It's actually a three blend substance that not only encloses your body and keeps you fresh for the next millennium, it also imparts a certain odor so that you can warn the others to come around.

227
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,660
The sound, the sound, the sound is what gives it away.

228
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,260
A dark sound.

229
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,920
You know, it's death.

230
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,960
It's a dark sound.

231
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,060
Well, I guess it's not really that dark of a sound. I guess some of the kids enjoy it.

232
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,440
Well, smell that farm fresh prairie squid.

233
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,620
Mmm!

234
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,380
Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

235
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,160
When was the last time you had your big ol' steaming hard prairie squid on a Sunday afternoon?

236
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,020
I think I had it out in the wood pile behind the house.

237
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,440
That's too long.

238
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,780
Is that that squid ratatouille again, Dad?

239
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,120
Farm fresh prairie squid at Tom Thumb Minerals and Igley Wigwoods on sale this week only.

240
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,980
Well, we didn't get that address again, but we know you can get prairie squid at your own supermarket today.

241
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:57,220
And as we retired hippies said, a lid full of squid beats a pock full of rocks. Right, friends?

242
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,140
Anytime!

243
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,200
Right on!

244
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,640
Far out, dude.

245
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,200
After a pound of squid, you don't know what you did.

246
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,080
You're just rambling on. We want to see the bottom of the squid where the aperture comes out.

247
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,680
Oh, now be careful. This one has not been de-beaked.

248
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,160
Yeah, yeah.

249
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,620
So keep your gloves on.

250
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,600
Okay. Do I take my pants down like this, Ivan?

251
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,580
Take my pants down like this?

252
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,360
I'm taking those pants off right now!

253
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,480
Alright, alright. My pants are off now. And I just what? I hold the squid against my genital area?

254
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,620
He'll go there himself.

255
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,680
Oh, look at that! Look at that!

256
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Sorry, don't want to get you confused.

257
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,200
Whoa!

258
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,920
See how she backs up her...

259
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,960
I'm not being in this behavior!

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,580
Ha! But look, it does work. Right up to the screen. Actually within seconds after contact. You're in bliss, aren't you?

261
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,420
Yup, yup.

262
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:57,360
And now, Barbara, if you would like to join, uh, if you would like to join, uh, I believe there, with the, uh, squid interface, all you have to do is, uh, yank up your knickers and...

263
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Not in my lifetime, young man!

264
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:09,300
Well, you know, you go, you kill yourself and then let the squid, uh, pull, pull, pull him over there and...

265
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,040
But I don't want to die.

266
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,480
It's so beautiful to feel that nice, beacons mollusk between you two. It's so romantic.

267
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,540
I'm a little squid.

268
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,940
My grandson, grandma are probably up there squeaking the bed springs with a prairie squid right between them.

269
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,220
Magnifying the sensation.

270
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,120
Like a thousand tiny pencils urging a woman to let go.

271
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,700
Got no pets, no friends, no...

272
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,400
A moist, mouthwatering squid can make your life over.

273
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,960
Think you need more?

274
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,360
Bigger bicep muscles?

275
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,420
You don't need any of that. You need a warm, friendly, tender squid.

276
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,980
One that knows your innermost thoughts.

277
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,840
Your habits.

278
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,600
Your secret desires.

279
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,160
A psycho-sexual squid capable of taking you where you want to go.

280
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,580
83D Squid.

281
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,380
83D Squid.

282
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,300
Falling from the sky.

283
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,920
83D Squid.

284
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,660
Man, they get you so high.

285
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,100
83D Squid.

286
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,800
Surfing through and in your door.

287
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,400
83D Squid.

288
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,880
I know what they're for.

289
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,720
83D Squid.

290
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,820
83D Squid.

291
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,980
83D Squid.

292
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,180
We are from the people under the dome.

293
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:51,760
The squid choral singers out of the direction of Charles Muntz, the baton of Wigden-Helmuth, and the whole family of singers from on down the little tube.

294
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,340
Let's hear for 83D Squid.

295
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,980
83D Squid.

296
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,200
83D Squid.

297
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,420
Man, it's so cosmic.

298
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,380
I looked up and I saw 83D squid falling right out of the sky.

299
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:10,980
83D.

300
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,040
83Dujo Squid.

301
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,040


302
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,540
83uard lesbians.

303
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,700
They were just butchered.

304
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,140
They were three-dimensional,ções

305
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,280
I'm not a drinking man on the job.

306
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,580
I swear I've seen it.

307
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,980
80 shoes.

308
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,340
Swim every day, swim.

309
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,400
Pity, pity three big squids.

310
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,660
Pretty pretty squids.

311
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,240
You need to, you gotta make sure that you have.

312
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,860
I'm not talking about the power of any individual being.

313
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,760
I'm talking about the power of squids.

314
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,560
Can ten dollars just make to you stop.

315
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,460
You and the better man over there.

316
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,500
I'm talking to you out there.

317
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,500
You and the front row over there.

318
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,540
You can use a squid.

319
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,680
You can use a squid.

320
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,200
The man over there with the body.

321
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,040
You need a pair of squid.

322
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,800
Y'all need a pair of squid.

323
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,840
I'm not here to sell you no damn pair of squid.

324
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,640
Excuse my language.

325
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,340
Excuse my friends.

326
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:38,980
I don't be required.

327
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,600
Don't let me swear when I get going.

328
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,800
I'm talking about a new life.

329
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,380
A new life for you.

330
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,040
You pick the squid up.

331
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,320
You take the squid home.

332
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,860
You place the squid where it's got to go.

333
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,260
And it takes you away.

334
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,260
Do not forget to de-eat your squid, though, Reverend.

335
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,320
That's right.

336
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,080
Now, wait a minute.

337
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,400
I've got to remind you.

338
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,180
Some people could suffer a small degree of implosion.

339
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,940
Or you could have some facial misconstruction.

340
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,760
Or some of you might have to have some elongation surgery.

341
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,840
Because the beaks can be very, very toxic to the average human system.

342
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,760
Sister, could you please bring some of the squid out and pass them out?

343
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,340
Yes, ma'am.

344
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,060
Oh.

345
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
What the hell?

346
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,680
Where'd you get your EVERAHONDA squid?

347
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:22,700
Here.

348
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,740
That one.

349
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Oh, my gosh.

350
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,540
Oh, my gosh.

351
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,720
Oh, yes.

352
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,540
I'm sure.

353
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,500
Over there.

354
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,880
Put that squid down there.

355
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,480
Just you.

356
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:33,880
Ready?

357
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,600
One.

358
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,040
Two.

359
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,340
Three.

360
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:46,980
Ah!

361
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,900
Ah!

362
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,600
Ah!

363
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,540
Hey man, that was the best squid sex sounds I ever heard.

364
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,440
Did you hear those? You probably couldn't hear those, could you?

365
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,840
I couldn't. I was trying to make my own.

366
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,360
I was doing a whole bunch of pitch changing.

367
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,420
I could hear it on the preacher.

368
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,740
That was squid sex there, for sure.

369
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,700
That was pretty good.

370
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,460
Yeah, I want to hear that in playback, man.

371
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,640
And the easy listening 83D squid.

372
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,440
Yeah, well, we had to do the ultimate dub version there.

373
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,220
Ah, yes. Ah, good.

374
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,820
Well, you know what? It's real hard for me to hear.

375
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,540
Oh, okay.

376
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,400
Okay, what happened was we drifted away from you.

377
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,800
We got lost in our own little star trip, man.

378
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,360
We got away from the machine that is you, Stang, and we're sorry.

379
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,000
We're all hot, and we have to get so close together.

380
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Yeah, the machine gets so hot, man.

381
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,120
But don't you have to be near the microphone?

382
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,360
Dave is making an excuse for all of us.

383
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,340
Please believe him.

384
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,700
Please believe whatever Dave says, okay?

385
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,620
And forgive us, man.

386
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,300
Man, thank you.

387
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,840
He's done so hard on us when we drift away from his machine.

388
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,380
Yeah, really, man.

389
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,960
I will forgive you this one last time.

390
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,100
We're sorry, man.

391
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,980
One more transgression and your souls will be forfeited.

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,440
Not the brainwaves, Stang.

393
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,180
No, not the brainwaves.

394
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,000
What one would he use? What one would he use?

395
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,460
The one that makes us go on our pants.

396
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,000
No!

397
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,520
The punishment two.

398
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,400
Can't you use the goatee one again?

399
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,560
The punishment toes.

400
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,820
Yes, I'll use the punishment toe.

401
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,560
That will make you go in your pants, all right.

402
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,620
No, just the goat thing.

403
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,400
The little goat thing you do.

404
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,840
Oh, that's what you did.

405
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,500
You wish.

406
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,260
That's probably just exactly what you want the goat thing.

407
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,080
Dave, are you going?

408
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,820
I'm heading for the...

409
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,480
I'm not even coming. I'm going, man.

410
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,420
Wow, man. Have you ever gone?

411
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,060
Yeah.

412
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,340
Hey, man, I was outside crying.

413
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,880
I was outside twice. I went all the way to the other side. Twice.

414
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,540
Yeah? Wait a second. You were gone and you came out the other side?

415
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,600
I went out of this one and I went outside.

416
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
No one goes outside, man.

417
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,460
And came back.

418
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,200
He went outside.

419
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,060
When I came back, there were two of me.

420
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,440
No one goes outside anymore, Dave.

421
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,900
You, like, broke on through from the other side?

422
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,260
There can't be any other side, man.

423
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,020
I went to the other side. When I came back, there were two of me.

424
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,980
You were smoking it in Philly, really, dude?

425
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,840
Oh, no. I can't believe this.

426
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,220
He came out the other side.

427
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,780
What'd you see? What'd you see?

428
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,700
No, I didn't go. I just went outside and I came back in.

429
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,740
There's nothing outside.

430
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,200
Like Gumby in the book?

431
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,380
There's nothing outside.

432
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,800
What's scary is once you're outside, you look back at everything that was inside

433
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,500
and you can't even see it because it's so tiny.

434
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,500
Just tell me, was it like Gumby walking into the book?

435
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,820
I don't know, man. I never saw... I never heard that band.

436
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,220
No, no, man. The Cartoon Man.

437
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,260
Gumby walks in and out of books, man.

438
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,560
I just want to know if it's like that.

439
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,400
Oh, no, no, man. It was... No, man.

440
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,580
You gotta get in the sphere and then God or this computer...

441
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,720
The last time I ordered that from you, I got the other one, though.

442
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,220
You sent me that other one without the folding part.

443
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,720
I didn't have a good enough computer then, man.

444
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,460
It made my parents disappear and I really appreciated that.

445
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,600
I just want you to know that.

446
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,840
Well, you came out here, man.

447
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
Your mom's...

448
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,540
We're made now, dude.

449
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,600
What do you mean by made?

450
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,120
Well, you know, it's like she cleans up and stuff, man.

451
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,400
You got a monster of domestic work, man.

452
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,760
Come on, dude.

453
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,860
Well, there ain't much left of their minds after they get through the other side, dude.

454
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,880
So we just put them to work around the house.

455
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,680
I'm sure that there's probably regular spankings going on in that upstairs boudoir.

456
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,360
Oh, man, we're cool.

457
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,240
We didn't even talk about this in the 60 Minutes expose about your church reverence, Dan.

458
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,020
No, man, we're cool, dude.

459
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,060
What'd you make our mothers do?

460
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,960
We don't hurt your moms or nothing, man.

461
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,020
We give them jobs, dude.

462
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,720
I want my mom back, man.

463
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,500
Take a closer look at Bob, man.

464
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,160
Just because we're grown up, you can't take our moms, man.

465
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,640
It's not right.

466
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,240
It's for Bob, dude.

467
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,960
It's not fair, man.

468
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,920
Bob wants your mom, dude.

469
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,580
You should be proud, man.

470
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,800
But what about, you know, all that...

471
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,040
It's cool.

472
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,700
What about all the sick sex, man?

473
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,260
Forget it.

474
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,280
Forget everything else, dude.

475
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,640
Yeah, my mom would like that.

476
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:51,800
Of course, man.

477
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:51,960
Of course.

478
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,940
What do you think, Bob's queer or something?

479
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,320
What do you think he wants your mom for, man?

480
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,100
He's so queer?

481
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:58,800
We've got to get our moms back.

482
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,040
We've got to get our moms back.

483
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,840
We've got to go out to where Reverend Ivan Stang is keeping our moms back.

484
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,520
Do you have a license?

485
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,120
Yeah, I have a license.

486
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,460
Well, let's go, man.

487
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,140
Yeah, I just got it, man.

488
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,120
Because I keep taking a lot more things than yelps and cookies and milk with my moms, man.

489
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,660
Shoot.

490
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,780
And we've got to save all the moms.

491
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,940
Wow, man.

492
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,660
You know, I think it's about to take all the moms in the world.

493
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,080
I know, dude.

494
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,720
I love it here, man.

495
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,440
We're marching to Dallas, Texas to Vince Stang's bedding.

496
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:25,860
Come on.

497
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,640
We've got to go.

498
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,500
Whoa.

499
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
Then we let your dads come visit him every now and then.

500
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,820
So that's where he is.

501
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,400
Come on.

502
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,500
Stang, you're sick, dude.

503
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,140
Stop yelling, man.

504
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,580
Let him go.

505
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,820
Christ, Bob.

506
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,260
God, he's got our dads, too.

507
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,280
Wait a second.

508
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,820
Dad?

509
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,040
I don't hear him.

510
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,580
Do you hear him?

511
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,180
No, man.

512
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,500
He's been taking methamphetamines every day and he's, like, gone most of the time.

513
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Sis, where are mom and dad?

514
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,260
I don't know.

515
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,240
I haven't seen him in a while.

516
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,240


517
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,420
Me neither.

518
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,160
I think Reverend Ivan Stang took them.

519
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,140
I think so, too.

520
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,380
In fact, I know it.

521
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I know it in my gut.

522
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,080
I didn't take them like they came long willingly, dude.

523
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,280
Oh, no.

524
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,860
They love Bob, man.

525
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,960
They just need a strap.

526
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:00,960


527
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,260
You're not pushing your machines on mom.

528
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,400
Come on.

529
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,260
Not the machine, mom.

530
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,300
Where's our dribble?

531
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,420
We've got them hooked up to these, like, devices, dude.

532
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,060
They're cold.

533
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:10,540
I'm sick.

534
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,520
That is, like, way, way, way sick, okay?

535
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,100
I bet it's illegal, too.

536
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:16,820
Okay.

537
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,100
I can't even begin.

538
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,820
Just say it.

539
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,080
Okay.

540
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,260
He has a car.

541
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,720
He has a gun.

542
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,740
No, he has a gun.

543
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,140
Come on.

544
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm going, too.

545
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,180
I'll do it.

546
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,600
I'll do it.

547
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,080
I don't care.

548
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,180
He's bad.

549
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,780
He's bad.

550
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,760
He's an evil dude.

551
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,580
He's got our moms and our dads.

552
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,680
He's got our moms and our dads.

553
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,520
Hey, man.

554
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,800
If it wasn't illegal, it wouldn't be any fun, dude.

555
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:37,740
Whoa.

556
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,720
Wait.

557
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,380
Is that my dad I hear in the background, Stang?

558
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,060
Yeah, your dad's fine, man.

559
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,740
He's just, he's just, he wants you to send more money, dude.

560
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,020
Man.

561
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,160
Wait.

562
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,320
My dad's not fine.

563
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,720
My dad's a real man.

564
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,200
Come on, Stang.

565
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,440
He wants you to send more money.

566
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,380
He said to send all your props, dude.

567
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,340
My dad sent me this.

568
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
We got your mom and dad on top.

569
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,040
It's cool.

570
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,680
I dig it.

571
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,080
It's cool.

572
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,760
Maybe we should go down there and, like, join up.

573
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,400
You can look at stuff like this, you know?

574
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,060
Yeah.

575
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,600
Yeah, we've got best props.

576
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,420
You knew that.

577
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,780
Everybody knows Bob's got all the props, man.

578
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,160
Can we stay up, like, you know, pretty long this time?

579
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,220
Oh, hell yeah.

580
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:19,600
Yeah, man.

581
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,620
Okay, like, what if we, like, if we do some props ourselves,

582
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,640
would we, like, get in trouble?

583
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,520
Would we get handed anything?

584
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,440
Yeah.

585
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,740
Will you grant us for doing props?

586
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,580
Oh, no, man.

587
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,600
We'd, like, give you extra credit.

588
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,640
Will Drill be there?

589
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,240
Yeah.

590
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,960
You know Drill?

591
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,420
Oh, no, man.

592
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,100
That's a lie.

593
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,060
That's a conspiracy-like tale.

594
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,760
You know, we can play invasion.

595
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,920
We don't do that anymore, man.

596
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,840
Like that story.

597
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,640
You know the story.

598
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,840
No, Bob doesn't do that anymore.

599
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,300
Oh, man.

600
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,740
Come on, man.

601
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,900
Unless you pay extra?

602
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,800
We've all heard the stories.

603
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,740
You have to pay extra for that, dude.

604
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,320
Come on down to Dobbs Town, man.

605
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,760
It's great.

606
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,220
Everybody's partying.

607
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,440
You're missing the party, man.

608
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,360
You're just totally uncool if you don't come to Dobbs Town.

609
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:07,800
Quick.

610
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,540
So, wait.

611
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,220
Can you say that if we come visit you, you'll give us back our moms and dads?

612
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,820
Oh, sure, man.

613
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,680
Sure.

614
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,240
Okay, well, you give us back our moms and dads, and we'll give you back our moms and

615
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,240


616
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,240


617
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,240


618
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,240


619
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,240


620
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,240


621
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,240


622
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,240


623
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,580
dads.

624
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,180
We'll give you a bunch of props, too.

625
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,960
We'll give you a bunch of mom steps.

626
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,660
You just come on down, man.

627
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,800
You're missing the party.

628
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,560
If there's another mom that we like more, could we have her instead?

629
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,060
Hey, man.

630
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,900
You can have any mom you want in Dobbs Town, dude.

631
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,720
This is really getting it, like, Freudian.

632
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,880
Sounds like a whole bunch of fun.

633
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,980
I think you better go.

634
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,480
This is a whole new level that the church never promised us.

635
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,220
Not only to give us whatever sex we want, but to give us a whole bunch of money.

636
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,220


637
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,220


638
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,220


639
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,220


640
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,120
And not to give us whatever sex partner we want, but whatever mom or dad we want.

641
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,520
That's the first time I've heard this incredible offer, Reverend Ivan Stang.

642
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,520
Oh, yeah, man.

643
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,120
It's like we're just parent swappers, dude.

644
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,760
So, in other words...

645
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,640
Like Bob and Connie's new thing.

646
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,020
If we wake up...

647
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,920
You're the son of the child, man.

648
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,960
You're the child's mom.

649
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,020
I'm the child of Bob.

650
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,140
And so, you know, it's like your mom is my mom.

651
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,400
Your mom's pretty good looking, dude.

652
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:14,820
Yeah.

653
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,600
Well, I might have a bigger heart.

654
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,200
You're the son of the child, man.

655
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,200


656
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,200


657
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,200


658
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,200


659
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,200


660
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,560
I've done mom, dad, boy's money, and a bigger heart.

661
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,820
Hey, buddy.

662
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,460
Mom, Dad's boy's money, and a bigger heart.

663
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,040
Sex.

664
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,260
Mom, Dad's boy's money, and a bigger heart.

665
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,680
Hey, man.

666
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,080
It pays real good, dude.

667
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,800
Dad's boy's money and a bigger heart.

668
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,480
They start you off at $750 an hour.

669
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,000
Hey, Dad's.

670
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,180
Dad's.

671
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,180


672
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,000
More money and a bigger home

673
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,780
Mom and Dad

674
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,920
More money and a bigger home

675
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,660
Mom and Dad

676
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,560
More money and a bigger home

677
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,800
Those are the folks right there on the job in the factory, man.

678
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,700
It's a great job.

679
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,260
More money and a bigger home

680
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,820
It's a great job.

681
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,680
More money and a bigger home

682
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,580
Two cars, Mom, Dad

683
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,800
More money and a bigger home

684
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,900
Two cars, Mom, Dad

685
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,680
My family, well, my perfect family,

686
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,760
Mom would have more money

687
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,360
and we'd have a bigger home

688
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,060
and all my friends would get along

689
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,200
and they'd stop saying bad things about each other

690
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,340
and

691
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,600
and my

692
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:46,660
and and my

693
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,640
brother and I would get along. We used to be best friends but now all we do is fight.

694
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,860
And my dad and I would talk to each other.

695
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,360
We talked but never about anything important.

696
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:10,860
And I'd have pretty feet with no bunions and nice shoulders and nice hair.

697
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,700
Dad, more money and a bigger home.

698
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,640
Say it now, Mom.

699
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,500
Dad, more money and a bigger home.

700
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,580
Two cars and a garage.

701
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,360
Dad, more money and a bigger home.

702
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,540
Two chickens every pie.

703
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,380
Dad, more money and a bigger home.

704
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,200
Forty acres of crop and a fuel stove.

705
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,660
Dad, more money and a bigger home.

706
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,580
Better job, Mom and Dad.

707
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,560
More money and a bigger home.

708
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,320
And a color TV.

709
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,440
And Dad, more money and a bigger home.

710
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,980
A big porch full of LSD.

711
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,400
And Dad, more money and a bigger home.

712
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,960
A lawn that's so cold and green.

713
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,240
And Dad, more money and a bigger home.

714
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,660
Out of space we can all be friends.

715
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:16,660


716
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:22,240
And Dad, more money and a bigger home.

717
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,320
Mom and Dad, more money and a bigger home.

718
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:36,020
Mom and Dad, more money and a bigger home.

719
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,240
Gotta spend in this world.

720
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,060
And Dad, more money and a bigger home.

721
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,220
And Dad, more money and a bigger home.

722
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,940
And Dad, more money and a bigger home.

723
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,880
Hey, that was pretty catchy.

724
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,280
That's actually a really old Venus Envy song I wrote years ago.

725
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,740
Now when you think of Venus, don't start catching yourself.

726
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,120
Yeah, number two torpedo.

727
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,640
It has words that, you know, they roll me in.

728
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,400
It's a song sung from the viewpoint of the torpedo itself.

729
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,160
Or of the Scud missile.

730
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,900
Or of the ICBM missile.

731
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,300
So from the viewpoint of the ICBM.

732
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,600
It's like, you know, they roll me in.

733
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,600
And buzzers are flashing an emergency red.

734
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,680
The radar is scanning.

735
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,300
I don't know.

736
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,500
I can't remember them all right now.

737
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,940
It was also when they performed a gallium scan on his head.

738
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,300
I'm sorry, the Ganadeva.

739
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,820
It was a gallium scan they performed on his head.

740
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,120
They rolled his little head into a small evacuated tube.

741
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,760
There with the cathode lights burning brightly.

742
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,800
It was a liberation of sorts then for all of them, I suppose.

743
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,180
Yes, they drink Galliano at the time, yes.

744
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,640
Well, man, I think y'all peoples is crazy.

745
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,320
I think they could choose.

746
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,600
You know, that's Bob.

747
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,960
It's basically a 50 year old fetus.

748
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,140
You know, we're just animals.

749
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,020
The Darwin Theory, you know, we're just animals.

750
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,820
Darwin Theory, you know, we're just animals.

751
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,560
So long.

752
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,800
To obey me like they did the father.

753
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,440
And I think they have a very perverted view of children.

754
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,080
That's when the invasion's gonna be.

755
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,860
Ooh, these kids and their imaginations.

756
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,100
Well, we'll get rid of them first.

757
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,900
If you're involved.

758
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:16,880
That's the reality.

759
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,660
It is okay.

760
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,040
It doesn't mean you're a monster.

761
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,200
Just don't tell anybody.

762
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,040
Rush!

763
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,240
They'll escape.

764
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
That is the law!

765
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,440
Oh.

766
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:29,940
Oh.

767
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,320
Oh.

768
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,540
Oh.

769
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:34,600


770
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,740
Oh.

771
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,560
Oh.

772
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,000
Oh.

773
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,720
Oh.

774
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,140
Oh.

775
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,760
Oh.

776
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,240
Oh.

777
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,260
Oh.

778
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,960
Oh.

779
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:41,960


780
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,500
Oh.

781
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,820
Oh.

782
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,260


783
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,380
Oh.

784
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:44,480


785
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:44,480


786
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:44,800


787
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:44,800


788
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:44,800


789
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:44,820


790
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:44,820


791
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:44,820


792
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:44,820


793
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:44,820


794
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:44,820


795
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,480
Oh.

796
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:46,600


797
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,560
Is

798
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,800
Oh,

799
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:08,120
Oh my god.

800
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,740
I'm

801
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:08,740


802
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,200
That was

803
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,620
My

804
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,400
It was

805
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,720
Sometimes

806
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,860
Sometimes

807
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,560
You wonder why you wake up

808
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,580
You wonder why you go to bed

809
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,580
You wonder about the motion you're in

810
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,680
You know you're not dead

811
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,300
But sometimes you still wonder

812
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,040
Sometimes you still wonder

813
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,780
That you got plenty for anything

814
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,800
When you get up in the morning

815
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,600
And you're a soldier

816
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:07,960
And

817
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,400
You

818
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,800
All you think about

819
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,680
Protect the queen

820
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,720
Protect the queen

821
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,680
Protect the queen

822
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,420
Protect the hive

823
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,600
Protect the hive

824
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,500
We build the hive

825
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,080
We die for the queen

826
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,660
We build

827
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,280
We die for the queen

828
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,040
We by

829
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,380
We build

830
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,900
We die

831
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,020
We die for the queen

832
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,020
Sometimes you wonder

833
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,640
Isn't all a lie

834
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,520
Sometimes you wonder

835
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,120
But sometimes you give up

836
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,780
And you do just keep on

837
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,020
You out

838
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,680
Keep out

839
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,680
New life, new life, new life

840
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,300
We build the hive

841
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,000
We build the hive

842
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,780
We build the hive

843
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,620
When you're at someone's Adams

844
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,260
When you're at someone's Adams

845
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,640
We build the hive

846
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
We build the hive

847
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,200
We build the hive

848
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,980
We build the hive

849
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,260
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

850
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,740
When you're so drunk

851
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,560
When you're so drunk

852
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:25,360
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

853
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,940
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

854
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,860
Thank you.

855
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,740
Thank you.

856
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,040
Thank you.

857
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,380
Thank you.

858
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,280
It's all back.

859
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,520
They want to dance with you.

860
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,800
They'll dance with you.

861
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,680
Hey, can I dance with you?

862
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,520
Not even on the same playing field.

863
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:44,900
No.

864
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,460
Would it be fair to say that the sun shines brighter in the U.S.?

865
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,120
Hi, I'm calling for Chaz Smith.

866
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,380
This is I.

867
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,920
Hi, this is Friday Jones.

868
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:53,940
Friday.

869
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,480
Hi.

870
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,840
How you doing, Friday?

871
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,700
Wait, is this the Leopold Leprosy Show?

872
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,840
Who's this now?

873
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:05,200
I understand they canceled the Leopold Leprosy Show because they're bringing back, you know, what do they call it?

874
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,300
Slavery?

875
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,440
No, no.

876
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:07,980
No.

877
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,760
Not polio.

878
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,180
The other thing they had in the 50s.

879
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,040
Thalidomide.

880
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,540
Yeah, thalidomide.

881
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,380
They're canceling the Leopold Leprosy Show because they're bringing back thalidomide.

882
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,900
Is that true?

883
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,440
Well, I got flipper feet from it.

884
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,780
They're bringing back thalidomide.

885
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,640
I don't know.

886
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,600
Let me count my flippers.

887
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,640
Hold on.

888
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:32,340
Now, Friday, I understand that you had several flippers that were displayed prominently in the Boston area.

889
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,780
Yes, that was very embarrassing.

890
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,540
They saw a tattoo they shouldn't have.

891
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:43,380
Well, if it was part of that art show, then, you know, I don't think they should complain because they, look, you know.

892
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,180
I'm a performance artist, you know.

893
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,360
The DEA pays money to the artists to perform.

894
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,100
It's not the DEA.

895
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,540
I take a piece of broccoli and put it on my head.

896
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:55,880
That's right.

897
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,260
We need more people in jail.

898
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,620
Talk about Jesus.

899
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,780
Because without that, you know, they wouldn't be doing their job.

900
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,080
I was filled with that feeling that you were trying to convey when I went in there.

901
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,740
First of all, I felt flipper all over me.

902
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,960
I felt soggy and slimy.

903
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,320
Like greasy fried chicken.

904
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,620
And I could tell there was marine life present because of that pungent item.

905
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,240
Caller, do you have a point to make?

906
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,080
The liquid corn.

907
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,720
It was the liquid corn that started the whole process, really.

908
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,740
But he went two for three today, and he looked really good out there.

909
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,020
Well, okay.

910
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,900
Once the DEA cancels the Leopold Depresy show,

911
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,460
and keeps that whole thing going because Jesse Helms wants to cancel it.

912
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,600
Why?

913
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,220
Why?

914
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,080
Because people are supposed to be responsible.

915
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,400
Because he doesn't want people to know about his flipper.

916
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,040
What about my flipper?

917
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,360
Look, my flippers were the thing in the first place that caused this whole accident.

918
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,140
And we thought that it was...

919
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,460
We were...

920
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,380
I won't go to rush.

921
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,640
I reckon you better flip that tape.

922
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,060
Flip it.

923
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,540
Flip it.

924
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:07,880
Flip it.

925
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,900
You're cheating again, are you?

926
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,040
Not with that flipper, I wouldn't.

927
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,700
I can't.

928
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,040
I have one of my own.

929
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,800
Look at this thing.

930
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,500
It's concealed.

931
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:15,940
Oh, no.

932
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,420
Friday Jones is talking about them flippers again.

933
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,240
We are cheating.

934
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,040
Flip.

935
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,740
No, no.

936
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,520
This is Bobby Sutton.

937
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,180
Is that Reverend Friday Jones?

938
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,460
It is indeed.

939
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,980
We got her on the show.

940
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,200
Wake up.

941
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,700
Well, watch.

942
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,300
Hey, Chaz.

943
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,080
Yes, sir.

944
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,240
Chaz, look down at the yellow blinking light.

945
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,000
There is none.

946
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,980
Look into the light, Chaz.

947
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,360
I've got them all lit up.

948
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,880
Go into the light, Chaz.

949
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,160
They're all lit up, baby.

950
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,580
Because I think Princess Wee is trying to call in.

951
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,700
Princess Wee is here.

952
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,300
Oh.

953
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,140
Wee is here.

954
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:44,880
Wee is here.

955
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,320
Wee.

956
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,440
Wee is all here.

957
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,040
Wee.

958
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,440
Wee.

959
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,280
We can all slide down the Wee slide.

960
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,980
Ooh, we can all flop our flippers together.

961
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:53,860
Yeah.

962
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,760
This is a trip.

963
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,160
Wee.

964
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,360
Wee.

965
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,040
Wee.

966
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,540
It's just one big happy flipper family in Thalidomide Town.

967
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,360
That's right.

968
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,400
We're flipping and flopping our way down.

969
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,440
Happy Thalidomide Trail.

970
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,240
The flip-flopped line is Thalidomide.

971
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,420
Have you ever seen a Thalidomide horse?

972
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,380
It gallops really funny.

973
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,160
Kind of.

974
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:17,580
Hey.

975
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,760
You're turning me on again, Friday.

976
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,280
I have the good taste not to be making actual Thalidomide jokes, okay?

977
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,040
But, of course, you people.

978
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,360
Hey, they re-legalized that again.

979
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,140
Yeah, I know.

980
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,720
That's what I'm saying.

981
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,220
And they canceled the leprosy show because of that.

982
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,960
Because they had that whole show that made fun of leprosy.

983
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,480
No.

984
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,200
And now they can't show it anymore because they're bringing Thalidomide back.

985
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,500
You're wrong.

986
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,100
Listen, I have another excuse for you.

987
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:43,560
It's a blood wrestle.

988
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,560
I want to go to flipper heaven when I die.

989
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:45,620
Oh, yes.

990
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,200
We're collecting X-Day excuses.

991
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,160
Okay.

992
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,700
I think...

993
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,040
I figure one of them is bound to be right.

994
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,580
Okay.

995
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,840
One of them is...

996
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,200
See, when I went there...

997
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,220
See, remember I mentioned I had this gift I had to give to you?

998
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,280
Okay, see...

999
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,580
Yeah, I figured it was a disease.

1000
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,280
Well, no.

1001
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,400
No, what happened to me...

1002
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:02,440
It was.

1003
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,060
I was in a coffee shop in Brooklyn.

1004
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,880
Actually, it was a diner in Brooklyn.

1005
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,820
It was in a coffee...

1006
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,180
And it was about...

1007
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:07,640
And it was about...

1008
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,480
4 a.m.

1009
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,900
I'd been working all night.

1010
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,020
And he was swimming in the...

1011
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:11,360
And...

1012
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,460
I wasn't thinking about Bob or...

1013
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:14,840
Or...

1014
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,840
Or extraterrestrials or X-Day or anything.

1015
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,160
And I didn't really notice it, but there was this waiter.

1016
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,560
There was a waiter there in the coffee shop.

1017
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:25,920
Barbershop.

1018
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:26,900
Dumb waiter.

1019
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,580
Diner.

1020
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,180
Hello, my name is Derek.

1021
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,880
I'm your waiter person for tonight.

1022
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,280
Tonight's special.

1023
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,900
As a matter of fact, that's where I was.

1024
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,260
Yeah.

1025
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,820
I remember eating there with you one time.

1026
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:36,460
Yes.

1027
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:36,700
Yes.

1028
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,980
I remember being eaten there myself.

1029
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:39,800
Yeah.

1030
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,100
And the interesting...

1031
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:45,720
The interesting thing about that was that I wasn't thinking about any of this stuff.

1032
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,460
And the waiter walked up to me and he was smiling.

1033
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,700
And he was smoking a pipe.

1034
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,280
Now, I...

1035
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,800
You know, I did not...

1036
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,440
I wasn't thinking about paranormal experiences.

1037
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:57,800
I wasn't...

1038
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,760
Again, I want to point this out.

1039
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,240
I was not thinking about Bob.

1040
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,580
I wasn't contemplating Bob.

1041
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,540
You know, I was...

1042
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,520
Well, what's the big deal?

1043
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:04,960
Okay.

1044
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,280
Well, he came over to me.

1045
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,380
And he said,

1046
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,020
Here.

1047
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,140
Give this to your friend.

1048
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,660
You know which one.

1049
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,220
We're looking at a picture...

1050
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,040
And he handed me a button.

1051
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,080
Stang.

1052
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,460
The button says,

1053
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,280
Discard next event.

1054
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,060
Discard next event?

1055
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:23,600
Yeah.

1056
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,800
I'm going to send you this button.

1057
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,080
An actual button from an old audio board.

1058
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,720
We've got a picture up on the computer right now of Ivan and Friday.

1059
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,980
And this is like July 3rd, I believe this was.

1060
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,560
Really?

1061
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,700
Oh, my gosh.

1062
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,180
Yeah.

1063
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:38,480
Yeah.

1064
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,540
So two days before X-Day, a mysterious man in black with a pipe grinning at...

1065
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,160
And this is a true place.

1066
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:45,600
Yes.

1067
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,720
The St. Clair Diner.

1068
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,280
I've been there.

1069
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,500
And it is on the corner of...

1070
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,920
Not exactly the corner of Douglas and Smith.

1071
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,540
They don't meet.

1072
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:51,880
But it's near enough.

1073
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,340
It's on Smith near Douglas.

1074
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:53,820
Yeah.

1075
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,300
Yeah.

1076
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,640
And he's sitting in there.

1077
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,680
And somebody gives you a button marked from an old sound board.

1078
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,940
And it's marked, Discard next event.

1079
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,060
This is a real object.

1080
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,100
I'm going to send it to you.

1081
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,900
I thought I'd be able to...

1082
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,900
I thought I'd be able to give this to you at X-Day.

1083
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,420
And I had to miss X-Day at the last minute.

1084
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,920
You know, people felt...

1085
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,220
I've had so much mail and response from people telling me that they feel like X-Day happened

1086
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,240
inside their head.

1087
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,360
That they underwent a change and that it is the end of the world.

1088
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,240
And the beginning of a new world.

1089
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,940
We always left out the beginning of a new world part because...

1090
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,860
Something was added to everyone's head.

1091
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,640
But the question is, what was taken away?

1092
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:31,620
Well, the new world...

1093
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,200
We can't remember.

1094
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,220
How are we ever going to know what was taken away?

1095
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,880
I thought I had it written down somewhere.

1096
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:35,880


1097
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:35,880


1098
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:35,880


1099
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,620
But I don't know.

1100
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,380
Well, what we...

1101
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,980
Listen, you did have it written down.

1102
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,040
What was the next backup version of my brain?

1103
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:44,120
Well, we learned not to depend too much on written memos.

1104
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,120
Friday, my love.

1105
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,440
My fantasy Friday.

1106
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,240
Yes.

1107
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:48,860
Darling?

1108
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:49,680
Yes.

1109
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,560
Can I tell you?

1110
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,280
Look, you did have it written down.

1111
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,860
This is another thing that I found out.

1112
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:59,620
And there's a place where you wrote down where you wrote it down.

1113
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,700
And there's another place where you wrote down where you wrote it down.

1114
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,000
That location.

1115
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,580
And there's a place where you wrote down where you wrote it down.

1116
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,640
Uh-huh.

1117
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:12,440
So there's a fourth place where you wrote down what you wrote about.

1118
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:12,920
Check the back of your hand.

1119
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,280
What you wrote down.

1120
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,260
Check the back.

1121
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:14,640
Oh, no.

1122
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,220
No, it's usually between my toes.

1123
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,200
Hold on.

1124
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,400
So all you have to do is find the fourth place.

1125
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,600
It'll lead you to the third place.

1126
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:20,680
That's right.

1127
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,680
It'll lead you to the second place.

1128
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,960
Friday leaves notes to herself between her toes?

1129
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:24,640
Yes.

1130
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,140
Yes.

1131
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,740
They're actually flippers.

1132
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,840
Yeah, let me look between my flippers.

1133
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,140
We've got this one.

1134
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:30,880
Let me hide my skin.

1135
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,540
She's from that Innsmouth family.

1136
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,700
They have big, floppy, wide, wide webs between their toes.

1137
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,660
That's why they're in such demand.

1138
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,900
And all their flippers have nipples on the ends of them.

1139
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,320
Uh-huh.

1140
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,600
You could put a 1998 calendar on Friday's flipper nipples.

1141
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:42,820
Yep.

1142
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,220
You should see me do the flipper stroke.

1143
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,520
There's Friday and Susie.

1144
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,380
Yeah.

1145
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,920
There's a picture of Friday and Susie in battle gear.

1146
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,640
Oh, are you looking at the website?

1147
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,360
Yeah, right.

1148
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,120
The Genius website?

1149
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:55,640
Yeah.

1150
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,360
There's a lot of nudity on that website.

1151
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,520
I think the radio listeners will be interested to know that it's like a freebie.

1152
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:02,520


1153
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:02,520


1154
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:02,520


1155
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:02,520


1156
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:02,520


1157
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:02,520


1158
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:02,520


1159
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,040
We've got a lot of porn sites.

1160
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,120
We'd like to perhaps describe the sites.

1161
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,700
Which is not what they're in the commercial drama anymore.

1162
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,460
Excuse me.

1163
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,600
I've seen a lot of porn sites, and that is a very poor porn site.

1164
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,680
Oh.

1165
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,720
It's one of the worst porn sites we've ever seen.

1166
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,740
Now, the real trick is if you can decipher the tic tac toe illustration at the bottom

1167
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,000
of the Stang report.

1168
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,500
There's no fabricating.

1169
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,400
There's not really any frontal nudity or any penetration either.

1170
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,680
There's not any penetration.

1171
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,840
Thank you.

1172
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,160
From the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the...

1173
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,280
Well, there's poison, Francis.

1174
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:32,420
To the Mecklenburg Fountain.

1175
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:32,460
To the Mecklenburg Fountain.

1176
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:32,460


1177
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


1178
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


1179
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,320
There's poison spreading across this land.

1180
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,340
It's a poison of the mind and a poison of the soul.

1181
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,040
It's true.

1182
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,840
And there's only one cure for it,

1183
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:45,500
and that's to soak up all the Bob and Connie that you can.

1184
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,960
Just indulge yourself to the max.

1185
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,520
Just go for it.

1186
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,500
Even if Connie ain't there, just Bob yourself.

1187
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,380
Even if Bob ain't there, Connie yourself.

1188
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,160
Even if Connie ain't there, just Bob yourself.

1189
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,120
Even if Bob ain't there, Connie yourself.

1190
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,660
Have at it.

1191
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,260
Who's going to stop you?

1192
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,380
God doesn't care, and Mom doesn't need to know.

1193
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,440
I think they have a very converted, converted, converted view of children.

1194
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,540
Children.

1195
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,060
Children.

1196
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:33,840
Children.

1197
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,840
Children love and hate side by side.

1198
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,260
Sometimes children love you and hate you all in half a second.

1199
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,160
Strange children.

1200
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,900
Do they ever forget or forgive the whipping, whipping, whippings

1201
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,100
and the harsh, strict words of command?

1202
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,540
I wonder.

1203
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,420
I wonder.

1204
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:55,780
I wonder.

1205
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,820
How can you forget or forgive those?

1206
00:50:59,440 --> 00:50:59,440


1207
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,180
Just go over and above you.

1208
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,320
Those tall, silly dictators.

1209
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,240
Those businessmen.

1210
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:05,660
Tell them that.

1211
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,540
Tell them it's junk.

1212
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,040
That sounds kind of moral.

1213
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,920
Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.

1214
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,080
Work hard.

1215
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,460
Increase production.

1216
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,040
Prevent accidents.

1217
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,200
And be happy.

1218
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,940
The walls were covered with, literally, with mosquito-like characters.

1219
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,420
Thin.

1220
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:29,420


1221
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,780
thousands of them.

1222
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,880
I mean, the walls were just, like, thick with them,

1223
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,340
and people thought we were screwing around,

1224
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,600
but it was like something out of the owner's home.

1225
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,420
Where is this?

1226
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,580
In the studio here.

1227
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,200
If you leave the window open, too, it will fill up with spiders.

1228
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,400
These big, huge spiders.

1229
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,020
Well, you guys are up on, like, the ninth floor, right?

1230
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,980
Yeah, there's many spiders on Rhodes Tower, all the way to the top.

1231
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,560
How about bats?

1232
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,560
A few bats, yeah.

1233
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,120
But mainly spiders.

1234
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,400
Mainly big spiders.

1235
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:56,840
There's, like, raccoons on the bottom.

1236
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,300
There's bats in the middle.

1237
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:06,080
There's a special kind of bat that I was hoping that they had there in Cleveland

1238
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:15,740
at WCSB's building, the Rhodes Tower at the Case Western University, I think.

1239
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:23,900
Ah, yes, dear friends, and this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

1240
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,360
lately intersecting completely.

1241
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,260
With Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1242
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:41,760
This show was made, was edited by myself from shows edited by Chaz.

1243
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,060
Chaz Smith of Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1244
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:52,080
You also heard guitar and trance spouting by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1245
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,280
Backup vocals and trance spouting by Princess Wiardo, Queen of the World.

1246
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,940
Queen of all the UFOs.

1247
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:05,240
Drums by Bob Mosick, the other true Bob.

1248
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:13,480
Electric violin by Michelle George, the dolphin woman.

1249
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,340
And Reverend Bleepo Abernathy on telephone.

1250
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,020
Yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang on telephone.

1251
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,040
And Irreverent Friday Jones on telephone.

1252
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,800
And, uh...

1253
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:38,100
And just a whole lot of, whole lot of mess.

1254
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,960
A mess of lots of...

1255
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:50,860
Friends, Einstein's Secret Orchestra may be contacted at P.O. Box 81555.

1256
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,600
Cleveland, Ohio.

1257
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,900
Oh, that's...

1258
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,480
P.O. Box.

1259
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,520
81555.

1260
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,480
Cleveland, Ohio.

1261
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,480
Ohio.

1262
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,180
44181.

1263
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:19,880
The music in the background is by Dr. Reverend Imat Zephol, El Diablo.

1264
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,780
With his CD, Beyond X Day.

1265
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,260
This title, this tune in the background is...

1266
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:28,720
It's called...

1267
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,900
Someone Else?

1268
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,060
Mmm.

1269
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,400
It's trippy, it's psychedelic, man.

1270
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,460
And there's more where it came from, too, at...

1271
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,520
The Subgenius Foundation.

1272
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,640
And here's that P.O. Box one more time.

1273
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:53,840
This time, you're finally gonna write it down and just drop that envelope on your lap and think about Bob.

1274
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,480
Send it to Bob at P.O. Box...

1275
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,680
140306.

1276
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,280
Dallas, Texas.

1277
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,040
75214.

1278
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,220
And also known as...

1279
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,700
Subgenius.com.

1280
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,060
So, uh...

1281
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,720
So what next?

1282
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,640
Quince Cometh the...

1283
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,160
Well, the Stark Fist is on its way.

1284
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:34,720
As soon as the Lord Jesus Christ gets back from his honeymoon with Mary Magdalene in Amsterdam.

1285
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,960
Friends, the Lord's doing a revival in Amsterdam.

1286
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,280
Jesus Christ at...

1287
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,100
Starring in the subgenius...

1288
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,980
The Amsterdam subgenius revival of 1998.

1289
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,140
Now, does that sound right or not, man?

1290
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,100
That sounds right.

1291
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,260
Sounds like a right thing to say.

1292
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,180
Jesus, live in Amsterdam, preaching the word of Bob.

1293
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,260
Praise God.

1294
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:58,560
Praise Bob.

1295
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,820
Praise Jesus.

1296
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,060
And Mary Magdalene.

1297
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,620
Congratulations on their lovely marriage.

1298
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,960
Now, the home for slackless children will have...

1299
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,660
A mommy and a daddy looking over him.

1300
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,280
Oh, yes.

1301
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,080
And, uh...

1302
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,320
Oh, let's see.

1303
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,820
I believe Dr. Legume is gearing up the Mid-Atlantic Slack Crusade.

1304
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,300
And his...

1305
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,240
Uh, it's to rival the outreach of the Church of the Subgenius.

1306
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,260
I understand what he's trying to do.

1307
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,500
I wish him the best of luck.

1308
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,000
See you in hell, Dr. Legume.

1309
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,020
And, uh...

1310
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,280
Yes, friends, it's...

1311
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,720
We're full of vim and vigor here.

1312
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,540
And I'll be at ready to go to bed.

1313
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,740
Crash out.

1314
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,680
Where is this tape?

1315
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,460
It's near the end.

1316
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,480
Okay, I don't know.

1317
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,160
Let's just...

1318
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,980
For the very last...

1319
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:58,780
Few minutes.

1320
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,500
Let's just...

1321
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:00,920
Go...

1322
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,220
Um...

1323
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:02,900
Um...

1324
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,660
Go back.

1325
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,000
Back deep.

1326
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,720
Deep, deep.

1327
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,540
Uh-huh.

1328
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,020
Oh, right.

1329
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:12,500
Right.

1330
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,540
Holy co-sister.

1331
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,900
Holy co-sister.

1332
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:15,960
Holy co-sister.

1333
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,180
Holy co-sister.

1334
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:17,900
Co-sister.

1335
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,660
Wasn't a punchline.

1336
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,780
No, but it sure is deep.

1337
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,480
Something like that.

1338
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,240
No, that's...

1339
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,960
I thought the punchline was...

1340
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,160
I'm sorry, Dave.

1341
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,240
I'm afraid I can't do that.

1342
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,340
Well, that's...

1343
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,820
That's one of the delusional answers.

1344
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,660
No, Dave.

1345
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,620
That's the only answer that's not delusional.

1346
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,000
It's not really a hell either.

1347
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:40,520
It's halt.

1348
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,220
As you're sitting outside in your pod...

1349
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,220
Hanging on the window.

1350
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:44,740
Yeah.

1351
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,680
The computer's laughing at you.

1352
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,060
See, I think we're left out of any human,

1353
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,260
but they can't laugh at Dave.

1354
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:57,640
Yes.

1355
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:58,500
They can.

1356
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,020
But they don't laugh long,

1357
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:00,980
because believe me,

1358
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,900
I have my ways.

1359
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,280
There's this...

1360
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,540
There's a large number of animals...

1361
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,180
Kingdom?

1362
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:07,700
Kingdom?

1363
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,700
I said it right?

1364
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,040
That follows my secret order command.

1365
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,220
I learned it from one...

1366
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,700
Less money on the vegetable numbers

1367
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,300
that you get off the radio or off the television?

1368
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,540
Sort of like Tarzan?

1369
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,580
No, it's more like a...

1370
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,000
A...

1371
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,460
A...

1372
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:19,460


1373
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:19,620
A...

1374
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:19,800
A...

1375
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:19,800


1376
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:19,820
A...

1377
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:19,900
A...

1378
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:19,900


1379
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,080
A...

1380
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,080


1381
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,260
A...

1382
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,260


1383
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,320
A...

1384
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,120
A...

1385
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,120


1386
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,200
A...

1387
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,200


1388
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,200


1389
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,280
A...

1390
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:21,320
A...

1391
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:21,440
A...

1392
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:21,440


1393
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:21,440


1394
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:21,440


1395
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:21,580
A...

1396
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:26,900
A...

1397
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,400
Well, I kinda understand where they're coming from,

1398
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,080
most of the time,

1399
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,960
about what it is, really.

1400
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,480
I don't really know what they're saying.

1401
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,560
I tell them stuff,

1402
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,280
and they appear to react in some way or another,

1403
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,140
and that's pretty much how I get them to do my...

1404
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,800
My business.

1405
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,060
You're evil...

1406
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:41,520
He will.

1407
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,100
Can you...

1408
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,020
Get a...

1409
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,500
A...

1410
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:43,940
A...

1411
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,400
Like a...

1412
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,640
Oh, like 300 or 400...

1413
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,500
Snails or...

1414
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,880
Sluts, either one,

1415
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,920
any kind of cephalopod-type other things.

1416
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:52,440
That thing like that.

1417
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,420
Does it work on me?

1418
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,220
Can we...

1419
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,160
You know, I mean...

1420
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,100
Can you get...

1421
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,240
Like, say I couldn't...

1422
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,260
I couldn't...

1423
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,260
isko?

1424
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:03,400
get hold of my prairie squid or I couldn't get my squid up, so to speak, would you be

1425
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:10,520
able to train a number of those animals to cluster in such a way as to form the orifice

1426
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,340
that I need?

1427
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:11,980
Yeah.

1428
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,740
But only at the bottom of the ocean, though, where there's...

1429
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,120
I don't know.

1430
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,240
I'd be watching my army of prairie squids and other cephalopods to follow him around

1431
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,280
and do his bit or at least appear to me like maybe roll out the green light.

1432
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,640
Well, I'm like any other guy.

1433
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,640
I just want to lay back and be serviced.

1434
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,120
Yeah.

1435
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,100
Well, I think I could probably get a few prairie squids to service you with, underside

1436
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:33,640
the control.

1437
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,140
I mean, I've got quite a bill going up here.

1438
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,900
I don't know if it's legal to talk about this kind of transaction.

1439
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,940
I don't know.
