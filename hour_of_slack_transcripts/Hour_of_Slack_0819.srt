1
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,400
I don't get to be judged next to you.

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,200
And now you have all these anxieties, these burdens, right in front of you on these cushions.

3
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,040
And I am going to count to three.

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,860
And when I count to three, I would like you to visualize,

5
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,060
to see those plates filled with those anxieties and burdens being lifted up,

6
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,160
knowing that they are going to be lifted up

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,380
and that they are going to be taken care of by ourselves.

8
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,220
Cast off the straitjacket of hyper-normality.

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,060
All of you suffering slackless souls in the radio audience,

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,720
I want you to hear me now.

11
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,800
The conspiracy has tried to keep the healing powers of slack enhancement therapy away from you.

12
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,660
Oh, great goddess Aphrodite, sovereign ruler of love between man and woman, hear me.

13
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,160
Send your power into these two essences

14
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,700
and draw them into blissful conjunction.

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,380
So join.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
So join.

17
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,880
So join.

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,900
His tasks of discipline involving four, four individual events.

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,800
The rolling of the chin noggin up the hill.

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,980
The misplacering of the egg.

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,160
The consumption of the terrible pride.

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,080
And the sleepening.

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
That was it.

24
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,060
We found it.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,380
Come on.

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,020
The quieting agent.

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,560
Follow the yellow brick road, kids.

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,400
Are you ready to eat what's at Bob's table?

29
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,980
Well, he's ready to serve it to you, kid.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,400
He's got a big long fork to shove it right in.

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,460
So open up.

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,280
Bend over.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,540
Here comes Bob to dinner.

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,360
And what a sumptuous feast it is.

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,100
Planetary orgasms and millions and millions of cosmic drizzle

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,380
imported and imported.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
And exported throughout the lands.

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,800
There's more than any sumptuous munchkin could eat in a lifetime.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,580
What a grand new millennium it shall be.

40
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,820
But will Bob put on the tin man's hat and ram it up my bunghole?

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,620
He'll give you a brain, Chaz.

42
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,480
And he'll give Dave a unit.

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,060
A larger pair of breasts.

44
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,060
A larger unit.

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,500
And he'll give me a wallet.

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,500
A wallet.

47
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:54,760
A checkbook.

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,620
A bank account.

49
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,380
Full of money.

50
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,640
And he'll give Dave a tuner for his guitar.

51
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,780
I'd like a bag.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,000
A tumor.

53
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,100
I'd like a bag of scabs and a tumor for my guitar.

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,480
Dave needs a brain tuner, Santa.

55
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,780
And a guitar tumor.

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,960
Well, we don't have any of those this year since the problems we had with 9-1-1.

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,980
I had to go to the doctor and get my brain tuner fixed.

58
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,580
Well, I don't think I've done a very good job for you, my friend.

59
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,220
Because look at the oozing near the sutures coming out of your head right there.

60
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,500
Yeah.

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,100
Don't stare at those, Dave.

62
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,280
That's not the life.

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,580
Yeah, but look.

64
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,660
You can put it on either bass mode.

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
See the switch back here behind my ear?

66
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,600
I can put it on either bass mode or guitar mode or anything I want.

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,340
Or chromatic or diatonic or anything.

68
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,840
Does that change with the way you hear?

69
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,400
Or does that change?

70
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,960
It just tunes my brain.

71
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,780
You can tune in to anything you want.

72
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,920
It's got this cool world mode patch.

73
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,320
So you can tune in to like other, you know, world modes and stuff too.

74
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,700
You know, those little half-step things.

75
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,420
Oh, I got some old fuzzbox.

76
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,880
You can do that, you know.

77
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,320
Or Hawaiian kind of stuff.

78
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,560
All that real sweet harmony stuff.

79
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,260
Man, all my brain tuner has is tone and volume.

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,100
Oh, you got to go online.

81
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,480
You can buy those.

82
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,820
You just buy them online.

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,300
You've never had a male.

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,740
It comes like two, three days later.

85
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,420
You never self-tuned yourself without a Polynesian woman until you, you know.

86
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,880
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,700
You know what I'm saying.

88
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,440
Yeah, I know.

89
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,400
But I've always just bought the, you know, the Echos and stuff from the man in the alley.

90
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,000
I just got them.

91
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,940
I just got done playing the soundtrack to Wizard of Oz while staring at the album cover art to Dark Side of the Moon.

92
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,340
And I think I had an experience.

93
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,440
Well, it looks beneath your stool that you probably did have something like an experience.

94
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,520
At least it produced an actual visceral fluid that we could measure with these little gadgets here.

95
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Did little Dorothy and Sid Barrett do it?

96
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,640
That's a check the synchronicity meter.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,100
Actually, I thought, I tried that experiment.

98
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,260
And I thought anybody who sees a heavy synchronicity.

99
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,180
Element in this ain't seen nothing.

100
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,380
Yes, but they all jump off the truck and sing the songs at the same time that everything gets bleak.

101
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,220
No, they got it wrong on the internet.

102
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,060
They got it wrong.

103
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,840
You don't, you're not supposed to watch the movie and listen to Dark Side of the Moon.

104
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,700
You're supposed to listen to the soundtrack to the movie and look at the album cover of Dark Side of the Moon.

105
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,100
Oh, no, no.

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,220
It's the Dark Side of Dorothy you must listen to while pondering the whizzy whiz of whiz bang.

107
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,900
Archie's leaving something out of the instructions.

108
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,660
Like the only way that that is cosmic is if you quit doing drugs for like a month.

109
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,680
Stang, look here.

110
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,540
They're all subject to change.

111
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,740
Each one of these are all subject to change.

112
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,760
You know, huh?

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,320
I just said all these rules you were talking about are all subject to change.

114
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,620
Again?

115
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,080
On five minutes notice here.

116
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,540
It looks like effective tomorrow the radiation belt is going to be a lot wider.

117
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,000
And you're going to have to slim down if you know what I'm saying.

118
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,700
And the desert of waz.

119
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
I guess a new creation of some of the assumptions.

120
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,560
Other landers is going to be discluded tomorrow night.

121
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,460
So there you go.

122
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
Another brain spasm.

123
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,500
No more desert of waz.

124
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,700
No, no, no more synchronicity.

125
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,320
It's all gone.

126
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,180
You mean the dot com heaven will collapse?

127
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,940
Everything means just what it means.

128
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,580
There is no synchronicity or overlap of truth.

129
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,520
You mean they won't click on the banners?

130
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,940
Sorry.

131
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,840
The banners are all unfurled now.

132
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,260
And we're lowering them.

133
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,540
Yeah, you just open the doors.

134
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,240
Into the ground.

135
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,300
Look, the doors are open for you, Stang.

136
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,740
Why, so this is the internet.

137
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,000
Everything's flying, flying through it.

138
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,540
And beckoning drawers.

139
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,520
The pigs have wings.

140
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,920
And files are flying out.

141
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,400
They can fly too.

142
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,740
Oh, the internet is so fancy.

143
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,160
Some of it's plain.

144
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,380
And three dimensional and colorful.

145
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
And it's so, I didn't have.

146
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, this is just amazing.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,460
There's a little green man fondling a bear.

148
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,120
It's disgusting.

149
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,180
And what are these numbers running up in the corner?

150
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,260
Those are the Boolean numbers.

151
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,900
Grab one quick.

152
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,620
That's the bill.

153
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,160
Oh.

154
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,680
Good lord, man.

155
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,680
Those are the algebraic numbers.

156
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,580
And what are all these little windows opening up?

157
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,840
Oh, those are the commercials.

158
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,360
The ads, of course.

159
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,320
I forgot.

160
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,820
That's right.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,380
Availability is now at this station.

162
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,780
The internet was controlled by the conspiracy back in the past.

163
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,860
Before the future came.

164
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,500
I am I.

165
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,520
The great and powerful.

166
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,260
Ah.

167
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,560
Don't leave me here.

168
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,800
Sure one of you

169
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:40,480
tempo was

170
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:51,760
right.

171
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:51,860


172
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:51,860


173
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,140
headaches can go on again.

174
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,180
Huh.

175
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,540
Bob was a robot.

176
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
Well, it's still no different.

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,640
It still not look strange.

178
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,780
Bob was black.

179
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,100
One of a gang.

180
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,380
Hey, hey, not going to work.

181
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,020
Bob was a regular just...

182
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,700
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

183
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,140
There he is.

184
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,100
I made a bargain with the cult to give me certain data that you had.

185
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,920
In return, I promised to prove the essential truth of the creed.

186
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,460
There was no need to prove that.

187
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,040
That it stands proven by the book of Revelations.

188
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,400
I offered scientific backing for you believers.

189
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,280
You made of the darkness and the stars a natural phenomenon

190
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,580
and removed all its real significance.

191
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,480
That was blasphemy.

192
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,580
The facts exist.

193
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,820
Your facts are a fraud and a delusion.

194
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,500
How do you know?

195
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:36,980
I know.

196
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,820
I suppose you think in trying to warn the world against the menace of madness,

197
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,300
we are placing souls in jeopardy, huh?

198
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,920
Well, we haven't succeeded.

199
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,060
If that makes you feel better.

200
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,180
Your devilish instruments must be destroyed.

201
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,020
Let me handle this.

202
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,100
Let her go, Bob.

203
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,280
After all, they're only human cattle.

204
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,960
You know that yourself.

205
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,780
My boy Bob!

206
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,540
My boy Bob!

207
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,760
My boy, my boy, my boy Bob!

208
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,880
I thought bringing the crowds all right.

209
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,400
What the hell was that?

210
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,080
Who makes the rules?

211
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,120
Someone else.

212
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,580
Who makes the rules?

213
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,420
Someone else.

214
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,700
Great notch breakfast.

215
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,920
I didn't do it.

216
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,660
Can I still have my dog?

217
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,020
No.

218
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,340
Okay, I'll tell you what we're going to do.

219
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,280
We're going to cut you a 15 second at the beginning of the Super Bowl,

220
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,320
a 20 second afterwards.

221
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,480
We're going to cut you right in with the big BUD spots that we're pulling up.

222
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,900
Are we sending anyone for the new coverage of the Olympics?

223
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,500
Are we sending?

224
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,760
Yeah.

225
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,280
Are we sending?

226
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,940
See if I can get on any, you know.

227
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,080
I don't have any coverage.

228
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,820
I don't know if I can send coverage of the Olympics or anything.

229
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,480
We're going to Utah.

230
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,900
It seems like a place that subgeniuses would go.

231
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,500
It seems like something reverent.

232
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,340
They're called Mormons, Chaz.

233
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,460
That's where the subgeniuses went.

234
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,800
Well, they have that like sex with multiple things.

235
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,580
My great-great-uncle Joe Smith.

236
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,100
Yeah.

237
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Yeah, but look what happened to him.

238
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,300
The conspiracy clamped down, made him quit doing the multiple routine,

239
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,080
and now they're the pinkest religion in the country.

240
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,260
What about the spaz jump?

241
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,960
I heard Pastor Craig was still going for the spaz jump,

242
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,440
and also the inconsistency principle.

243
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,560
Those are no longer the Olympics.

244
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,080
The sodomy principle.

245
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh, he's still doing the sodomy principle.

246
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,580
I thought that was bad.

247
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
The neck-raping principle.

248
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,480
Whatever happened to sexual acts utilizing the back of the neck?

249
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,460
Good old-fashioned back neck raping.

250
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,280
Whatever happened to the ladies and men?

251
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,280


252
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,840
Men big enough to have rolls in the back of their neck

253
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:30,500
that might be useful to a desperate, subgenius bonobo man like Dave here.

254
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,640
The slender Spanish lady with the very, very long song in the legs.

255
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,020
They're so long that when they bang Goya, paint the picture.

256
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,300
Well, you have to use another hole for that, Dave.

257
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,040
And Goya, he make the neck look so long that when you turn them upside down,

258
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,820
you're upside down in the bottom of it.

259
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,460
This isn't...

260
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:48,980
The...

261
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,420
Past anymore.

262
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,480
This is now the future.

263
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,620
Your future.

264
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,380
Welcome.

265
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,120
Come on in.

266
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,560
Or out, as the case may be.

267
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:08,080
Depending on whether you started out inside the dome or outside the dome.

268
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,020
Whichever it was, it's flip now.

269
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,300
It's what Bob called the big flip flop.

270
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,580
Remember those LP records?

271
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,440
You had to flip them over in cassette tape.

272
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,180
You had to flip them.

273
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,380
You had to flip them over.

274
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,300
Well, there's a time stream.

275
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,120
It's not digital.

276
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,780
It's analog.

277
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,140
You have to flip it over.

278
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,600
That flip is coming, friends.

279
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,380
The time stream intersection.

280
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,320
It's like a big figure eight.

281
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,380
Time is like a big figure eight.

282
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,960
It loops back upon itself where the big bang is the same as the big smush down.

283
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,800
Going in reverse and backwards.

284
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,700
Well, they come together in the center.

285
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,940
And that's where we're heading.

286
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,900
Top speed.

287
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,580
The center.

288
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,140
Right now.

289
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,440
We're heading for the center.

290
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,160
Now, Dr. Stubbs or Skang or whatever your name is.

291
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,300
How do you explain the consistencies in the Mayan calendar vis-a-vis the 2012 apocalypse

292
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,220
and also the heliocentric realignment?

293
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,440
Well, it's amazing that until now no one's been able to get it to work.

294
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,860
And that proves that the normals were not stupid people.

295
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,740
Subgenius is full with acetylene torches,

296
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,440
bottled oxygen,

297
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,720
electric arcs from generators and so forth,

298
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,440
electric furnaces,

299
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,880
all kinds of elaborate texts.

300
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,280
But what?

301
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,920
What did these brilliant normals use?

302
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,200
Jet fuel.

303
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,040
That's all, friends.

304
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,800
And that's why we have to catch up.

305
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,720
We have to build our own ships.

306
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,840
And failing that, our own Amsterdams and, well, friends,

307
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,320
failing that, we have to make the nicest little shoeboxes we can learn to hide in.

308
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Between the walls.

309
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,000
Build your own spaceship.

310
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,480
My spaceship is equipped with this tiny, beautiful, blue mechanical dog

311
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,100
from the year 1927.

312
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,760
It's in a complete arrangement around everything else standing and sitting down.

313
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,020
Step one step inside and you'll notice not only the art deco changes,

314
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,380
but so do the rheumatoids in your head.

315
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,400
This little cardboard box here, well, it ain't much of a spaceship,

316
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,340
but it's better than nothing.

317
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,520
Hey, at least I'm not.

318
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,960
At least I own it.

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,680
At least it's mine.

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,760
These sheep back there on that cesspool are damn humans.

321
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,880
Yeah, that's right.

322
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,700
Look, look, look.

323
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,700
They're fake Tiffany.

324
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,120
They're fake mongering.

325
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,260
Vile little creatures.

326
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


327
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


328
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


329
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


330
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


331
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


332
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


333
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,960
They're by a pus-swell on the skin of that planet.

334
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,480
Yeah, them little pus-squells on the skin of that planet.

335
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,200
That's what they are.

336
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,180
Just like shit.

337
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,940
Yeah.

338
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,140
Is humanity then a cancer?

339
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,920
A carcinoma upon the skin of the earth?

340
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,320
Is civilization a terminal disease?

341
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,560
Is il papa a groovy dancer?

342
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,020
Or is it merely the inoculation against something far worse?

343
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,780
Is it actually then the key?

344
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,420
Or is it the lack of health?

345
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,920
Just a touch of civilization.

346
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,740
Or encroachment of some standardization throughout the land.

347
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,660
Just enough to keep the bit-civ away.

348
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,600
Yes, there's no broadcast delays in the spectrum of life.

349
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,520
When you get so civilized that you're...

350
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,720
The minds have all been disappeared.

351
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,540
You're like your...

352
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,080
Taken away.

353
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,620
PC.

354
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,620
I'm none of the baby.

355
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,080
That's how civilized you're gone.

356
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,260
You're faded off.

357
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,700
Faded.

358
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,520
Into logic.

359
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,300
Pure logic.

360
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,180
But what heart is there left, Brent?

361
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,500
Into the void.

362
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,960
That's what we worry about.

363
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,600
I told you to grab the Boolean numbers.

364
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:12,940
Yeah.

365
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,260
The preservation of heart and slack in this soulless, increasingly mechanistic...

366
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,240
Long may they be.

367
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,940
They drip off together.

368
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:24,500
You just transform into a truth table in some freshman college class down at the state university.

369
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,460
That's all you is.

370
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,820
Well, you can't believe in God anymore, so what else is there, friend?

371
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,700
It's all it's good for is sniffing them seeds after a rainy day.

372
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,120
There's still slack, ain't there?

373
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,360
Yes, plenty of it.

374
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,080
Smell that seed.

375
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,560
Ah, yes.

376
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,720
It's good to be in the education field.

377
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,340
That's right.

378
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,000
Deep, deep inside.

379
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,260
And then they open that 55-gallon drums of heads down at the dental school...

380
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,160
Oh, my God.

381
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,200
...and they're just right on top.

382
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,820
Look at the size of this guy.

383
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,360
That's the first one that they start practicing on.

384
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,720
Look at the cranial instep here.

385
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,300
Boy, oh, boy.

386
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,580
This guy's ready to go bowling.

387
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,580
They gave your head to the freshman.

388
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,600
They gave my body to the mortician school.

389
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,680
Oh, my God.

390
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,460
That's Grandpa Hobo's head.

391
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,720
And look at its arms.

392
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,120
They gave Chaz's body to the carnival to show off what can happen.

393
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,840
They gave my body to the Smithsonian Institution as an example of what never, never efforted.

394
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:15,940
I cut my head off.

395
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,140
And I stuck a bunch of pipe right in the middle of it.

396
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,140


397
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,140


398
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,140


399
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,720
I got a pipe right down my neck, and now I sit in a chair with my fingers going up and

400
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,540
down, up and down, up and down.

401
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,000
But we can still pipe this to you, friends.

402
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,940
We can pipe our thoughts to you, even though we're disembodied.

403
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,060
We can beat those thoughts down with little handles and backs.

404
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,420
We've been in a tank.

405
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,420


406
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,160
Sure, our bodies are in a tank or somewhere being experimented on.

407
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,720
Tiny little animals crying into your bodies, taking away your consciousness now.

408
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,320
But our souls are free, my friend.

409
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,780
You could be the same way.

410
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,180
Just lift off, baby.

411
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,640
Free as a dirge.

412
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,700
Inflate.

413
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,060
All you gotta do is chop your own head off.

414
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,060
Get on the old hobo train.

415
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,180
At just the right moment.

416
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,760
The moment of the time intersection.

417
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,460
Everything turns inside out.

418
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,720
You'll be the one that was first in line for brains that day instead of, well, you know.

419
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,380
You don't want to sell nothing at the crossroads.

420
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:09,140
You'll be the one that's first in line for looks on that day, rather than, well, what

421
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,620
happened.

422
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,160
I want to be the world's greatest opera singer.

423
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,520
You'll be first in line for looks.

424
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,620
And so I present this in a bag of staples.

425
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:16,960
Instead of where you ended up.

426
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,120
And so I present this in a bag of staples.

427
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,120


428
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,120


429
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:34,500
Unb aktivido con mifi traje.

430
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:34,500


431
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:34,700
fire a

432
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:34,760
pack of

433
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,260
couple hundred more yards and lay your eggs and croak.

434
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,580
At least this way you won't be leaving more miserable little losers to suffer like you did.

435
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,760
And be subject to the same mind control as the rest of them?

436
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,460
No, no way.

437
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,960
Let the strong and cruel.

438
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,460
A race like that would die in a moment.

439
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,820
The slightest flutter of wind would castrify and colossify it.

440
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,060
That's how we rose up from the chimpanzees.

441
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,820
We, the third order chimpanzees.

442
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,160
That's how we left that chimpanzee drive at 29.

443
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,700
We made it by being meaner than the other chimpanzees.

444
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,500
You know, friends, if you look at chimpanzees.

445
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,820
It took a long time of cowering, though, in the shadows of the hyenas and the lions and the tigers.

446
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,840
We were scared little monkeys for an awful long time.

447
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,780
We hid up in the trees.

448
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,300
They're big.

449
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,280
But then we came down from the tree and picked up a damn stick and beat the hell out of them.

450
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,500
Well, that's maybe what you did.

451
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,160
Our kind learned how to throw the weak to the saber-toothed tigers.

452
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,660
Oh, yeah.

453
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,140
Well, that's...

454
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,320
We just gang up on our own kind and throw the weirdos out to the...

455
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,440
Learn where they went out for drinks, learn their movements, their habits.

456
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,280
It did take a very long time of being...

457
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,020
We followed them around the mall.

458
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,080
We listened to their home phone and soon we mastered the jaguars.

459
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Of being a what?

460
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,160
Of watching.

461
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,660
We had to watch for a while from our little perches up in the tree.

462
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,320
Cowering and watching.

463
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,000
We had to watch how they did it.

464
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,860
Until one time one of us had an idea.

465
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,300
A sneaky idea.

466
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,200
Push the other one out of the tree.

467
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,100
And while that...

468
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,500
Leopard is busy.

469
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,280
Run away!

470
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,840
Run away!

471
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,380
Run away!

472
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:07,700
Run!

473
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,300
And friends...

474
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,500
And we woke up just in time for the jaguar night 2012.

475
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
That's how the subgeniuses were born.

476
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,800
That's why there are so many Smiths today.

477
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,340
For that first Smith pushed that foolish Jonesman out of that tree.

478
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,560
I think it was the white man's way of saying he was uncreative and bland.

479
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,640
Speak for yourself.

480
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,020
Speak for yourself, Bob.

481
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,760
Moments of terror.

482
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,920
And how we relish them.

483
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,580
Grotesque images torn out of our own dark, our own earliest nightmares.

484
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,820
Try as we may, we are never quite able to leave them behind.

485
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:03,160
We grow up with a certain hunger not only for the bright things in life, but for things

486
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,020
that are fearful.

487
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,460
And terrifying.

488
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:13,640
Trying to escape from the giant tread of Bob as he approaches with his acts of employment.

489
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,440
Oh, yee, mirror to the head.

490
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,740
Roadworthy down under the head.

491
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,060
Yea, yee, mirrored nigh, not of the head.

492
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,160
We get to the bottom, back to the top of the slide.

493
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,000
Stop and turn around.

494
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,000


495
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,000


496
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,400
Couple more rides, and you'll get to the bottom.

497
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,260
And I'll see you again.

498
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,460
Yea, yea, yea.

499
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,340
Do you, don't you want me to love you?

500
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,640
Thumb down that mouth of you.

501
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,840
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer.

502
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,160
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer.

503
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,120
Help me, help ya.

504
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
Help me, help ya.

505
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,440
Help me, help ya.

506
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,360
Help me, help ya.

507
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,880
Help me, help ya.

508
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,440
Thank you.

509
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,400
Thank you.

510
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,120
Thank you.

511
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,100
Thank you.

512
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,040
Thank you.

513
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,560
Uh, yes, dear friends.

514
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:02,860
Necrophile.

515
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,440
singing with the Necrotones.

516
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,340
And you can find out more about the Necrotones

517
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:18,340
at this website, www.lastbeatrecords.com.

518
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,200
That's www.lastbeatrecords.com.

519
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,500
Last Beat Records is one word.

520
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,040
Friends, this hour of Slack,

521
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,920
Slack 819,

522
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,540
is all half old and half all new,

523
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,480
being mostly last night's ESO Swamp Radio Show

524
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,780
from WCSB Cleveland,

525
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,700
with Professor Chaz, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

526
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,900
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

527
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,720
And this show is also half the old,

528
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,360
newly released Media Barrage 11,

529
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,340
Ancient Subgenius Tapes Resurrected for This Day.

530
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,880
Coming up, dear friends,

531
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,700
Dr. Leary lectures,

532
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,640
unreleased material from,

533
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,320
well, now it's released by Ace

534
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,920
at Rosencomet.com.

535
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,700
Also coming up, some music by St. Alio,

536
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,560
or Stalio,

537
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,540
and the ultimate rant

538
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,240
with Einstein Secret Orchestra

539
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,540
and myself at Starwood 2001,

540
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,780
and more, friends, but only if you pray,

541
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,300
it's Bob.

542
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,320
Dobbs.

543
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,300
It's all Dobbs stuff out here,

544
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,840
and if you want to talk to Dobbs,

545
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,540
that's all you're going to get to,

546
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,760
because, you know,

547
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,760
if you really have a problem, forget it.

548
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,620
And then you will get a ticket to Dobbstown,

549
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,140
and one of our special meditation chambers,

550
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,500
the little dog cages,

551
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,800
and you can get in and mail yourself to Dobbstown,

552
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,000
and the church will pay for it all,

553
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,580
and we will support you once you get there.

554
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,360
You'll be so happy.

555
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,320
See, here's what we'll be doing.

556
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,900
There are no dogs and no dog toys on the street.

557
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,480
In Dobbstown.

558
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,800
The showed sub-dini's.

559
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,640
There are no sheep.

560
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
Not the sick sub-dini's.

561
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,560
There are no hideous wolf-weathers.

562
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,500
They're hidden away from the congressional investigation.

563
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,140
And there's no collar any longer.

564
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,440
Lions and tigers and bears.

565
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,340
Oh my!

566
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,380
Lions and tigers and bears.

567
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,240
Oh my!

568
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,160
How about a round of applause for the person that represents the information era,

569
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,920
the man who taught us about relativity and multiple reality.

570
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,020
How about a round of applause for Albert Einstein, huh?

571
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,160
All right.

572
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,220
Thank you.

573
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:36,020
Anyway, I put the sperm on the board to kind of make fun of Charles Darwin

574
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,700
and the Darwinian theory of evolution, which is really well worth making fun of.

575
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,120
There's been a big scene about theories of evolution,

576
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,180
you know, the creationists versus Darwinians.

577
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,420
Any time that the press gives you a Super Bowl,

578
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,020
thing like that, you know, it's like,

579
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,400
it's like,

580
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,440
Cincinnati Bengals versus the San Francisco 49ers.

581
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,760
You know they're not telling the real truth.

582
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,200
The interesting thing about the Arkansas genetics trial,

583
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,840
I don't know if I follow this very carefully because it's like my, like my career.

584
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,760
But the most intelligent things that were said at that trial were not the civil liberties union proving that life

585
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,760
is a Darwinian plot of four billion years of male competition leading to bigger and better rape.

586
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,880
The most interesting thing said at that trial was by a man named,

587
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,660
Wickram Singh.

588
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,800
He's a Hindu geneticist, chemist.

589
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,840
Do any of you know him?

590
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,600
He wrote a book called Life Cloud with Hoyle, the astronomer.

591
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,800
And he came over and he was on the side of the creationists.

592
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,940
He said, well, I don't believe in this theory that, you know,

593
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,640
Jehovah made the world in four days, four thousand years ago.

594
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,760
But there is a creative intelligence that's designing evolution on this planet.

595
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,760
And it's not a blind chance.

596
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,320
He said to think that in four billion years you could create an incredibly intelligent species,

597
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,760
like ours, of Monday Night Football and Howard Cosell,

598
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,920
in four and a half billion years is impossible by chance.

599
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,180
He said that the Darwinian theory basically says that a tornado could fly through a junkyard

600
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,160
and assemble a 747.

601
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,880
That was a good headline.

602
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,440
But the creationists lost.

603
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,700
The reason they lost was because they were defending a theory of evolution

604
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,740
which is based upon the Judeo-Christian Bible.

605
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,880
I have a lot of fun. I go on radio programs, television programs.

606
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,160
And I say that the Bible is such a sick comic book

607
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,700
that I don't say any parent of a child would allow their children to read such a book.

608
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,140
In the first, second, third, fourth chapters of the Bible,

609
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,820
Jehovah, the God of the Bible, who is a bad-tempered, mean, macho, mafia, condominium owner,

610
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,540
he gets pissed off at some whim and he's mad at the whole human race.

611
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,520
And he snuffs the whole human race except for Noah, who is his resident manager or something.

612
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,520
So, I mean, people believe that.

613
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,720
Well, anyway, Jehovah, according to the Bible, said to Adam,

614
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:16,600
Well, it's the year 4000 B.R.

615
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,700
That's before Reagan.

616
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,020
And I'm going to send my only son, Ralph, down to blow the whole thing up

617
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,660
during the...

618
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,340
fourth budgetary planning session of the second Reagan administration.

619
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,220
But meanwhile, I've got this Garden of Eden.

620
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,440
And Adam is allowed to do whatever you want in it.

621
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,780
Eve 2.

622
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,720
He says there are...

623
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,220
two food and drug regulations.

624
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,080
There's this tree here. You're disallowed. It's a control substance.

625
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,440
You're forbidden by law to in any way ingest.

626
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,920
You know why? Because if you ingest this substance,

627
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,200
you will double your intelligence, see through good and evil, and become a god like me.

628
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,100
Do you want to become a god like me?

629
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,600
And Adam said, No, sir, I don't want to become a god like you.

630
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,400
And he said, There's another tree over here.

631
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,780
If you eat of this tree, this tree is the...

632
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,480
microgenetic immunology tree, which will give you immortality

633
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,980
and inoculation against death, and you'll live forever and be a god like me.

634
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,140
Do you want that? And Adam said, No.

635
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,680
And, of course, you're well aware of the fact that the Judeo-Christian Bible is very down on women.

636
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,140
They lay all the blame on Eve.

637
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,840
As soon as Jehovah jumped into his squad car,

638
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,580
and back to headquarters,

639
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,640
Eve went over to the intelligence-raising vegetable,

640
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,420
and she sniffed it, or ingested it,

641
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,260
and as a good friend to Adam, poor straight arrow Adam,

642
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,260
she got him to eat thereof,

643
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,280
and the first narcotics bust in history happens in the first page of Genesis.

644
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,640
Now,

645
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,160
I know you've all heard this before,

646
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,920
but I think it's one of my duties to repeat this story and repeat this story,

647
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,760
because the entire Christian religion is based upon original sin.

648
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,340
I was taught about original sin. You were taught about original sin.

649
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,340
What's this original sin?

650
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,760
The reason that the planet Earth is a terrible place.

651
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,900
The reason that there's so much suffering down here is because we all fucked up.

652
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,360
And what was the original fuck-up? What was the original sin?

653
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,620
Eating intelligently.

654
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,460
Legends raising fruit in the Garden of Eden.

655
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:29,100
No wonder, no wonder they raised so much trouble about dope.

656
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,940
When I was a Harvard, you know, researcher, this is going to be a snap.

657
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:41,000
There's simply no question that anyone who understands anything about how to use brain-activating drugs

658
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:47,500
and is operating with a clear mind with no desire to screw other people's minds up,

659
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,500
who's willing to put in time,

660
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,560
and patience, and sensitivity,

661
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,840
can help anyone wash their brains.

662
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,320
There's no longer any excuse for having a mind that you don't like,

663
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,220
or having a brain problem that you're dissatisfied with.

664
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,960
We know enough now, and we knew enough 20 years ago, how to wash brains.

665
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,080
We thought it was the most simple thing in the world.

666
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,680
Who wouldn't want to have this power?

667
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,560
Not only was it no big deal that we discovered it,

668
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,120
we looked back in the history books and found out that the first book of the Vedas,

669
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,360
the first Hindu texts, you know, about yoga,

670
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,160
self-development, individual development,

671
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,040
was based upon Soma, which was some sort of a brain-activating, brainwashing psychotropic.

672
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,840
So we're part of the longest tradition in history of people who stumbled on

673
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,220
and continually rediscover the fact that the human brain can be changed,

674
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,120
and the way to do it is to use the chemicals.

675
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,560
Now, listen, it is not my fault.

676
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,080
I had nothing to do with putting the opium receptors in the human nervous system.

677
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:56,160
The fact that you have a receptor in your brain and they're resistant for acid is not my problem.

678
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,860
Which is a crime.

679
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,380
Now I like French toast.

680
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,140
Get pow-pow power!

681
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,860
Now I like French toast.

682
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,240
Now I like French toast.

683
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,340
Wahoo! Wahoo!

684
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,480
And if I had it my way, I'd make them crunch.

685
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,240
Yeah!

686
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,620
And we're gonna give a hoot about Calog's Coco Crispies!

687
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,140
Now I like cinnamon rolls.

688
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,200
I can't give enough of that.

689
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,480
Now I like custard.

690
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,160
I've got to crunch on the grocery store!

691
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,620
Now I like coffee.

692
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,980
Now i like...

693
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,060
cornflakes and strawberries

694
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,460
now I like eggs

695
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,600
now I like milk

696
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,220
now I like alcohol

697
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,060
young man if you spill those new sugar

698
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,000
snacks you're fired

699
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,600
now I like green set

700
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,720
but if I had it my way

701
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,940
I'd make them crunch

702
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,560
that was delicious

703
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,920
I wonder what it was

704
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,540
I know what you're going to do, Aldrin.

705
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,400
You're going to get down here.

706
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,020
You're going to go down to that drum house.

707
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,900
Stand there and watch everybody.

708
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,460
Friend, you could just...

709
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,960
This could be the night.

710
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,640
This could be the night when you will go,

711
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,560
what the hell?

712
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,380
I don't care if I'm like a fool myself.

713
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,600
I don't care if my boss sees the news on Channel 10

714
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,800
and sees me dance around that bonfire

715
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,080
with a devil mask on.

716
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,820
I don't care if I have to have a pee test

717
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,580
when I get home.

718
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,220
Friend, you could just do that

719
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,760
and of course you could lose your job and really...

720
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,020
But you know Bob said,

721
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,980
repent, quit your job and slack off.

722
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,400
And that actually is not bad advice

723
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,840
because the absolute worst thing that ever happens is

724
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,060
you end up with a better paying job.

725
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,100
God damn it.

726
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,680
And friends, before I go any further

727
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,300
and say anything else that might distract

728
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,540
from the true message,

729
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
this is all that matters.

730
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,060
Not the word, Bob.

731
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,640
Not his intentions.

732
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,780
Not what you understand of Bob.

733
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,840
Just Bob.

734
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,200
And not the entirety of the personality of Bob Dobbs.

735
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,600
Just this face.

736
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,620
This face is all you really need.

737
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,200
Luckily, I haven't owned the trademark

738
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,640
on this particular image.

739
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,900
But friends, it's true.

740
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,220
Thank him.

741
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,620
Truly give it a chance.

742
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,500
You know, when you see a real subgenius like myself

743
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,220
or the subgeniuses who were here two weeks ago

744
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,920
waiting for the world to end the next day,

745
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,220
you think sometimes these people look like they're crazy.

746
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,740
Like they're maybe a little too into this.

747
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,120
Like, isn't it a joke?

748
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,140
Aren't they taking it like a little too far?

749
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,120
Isn't this like a one joke idea

750
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,260
that should have ended a long time ago?

751
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,880
Oh my God.

752
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,400
It's like Jonestown.

753
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,540
Well, not yet, friends.

754
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,760
We're still training him.

755
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,480
But when you doubt,

756
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,020
look at his face.

757
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,660
Just look at that face.

758
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,480
What is it?

759
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,240
It's a man.

760
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,700
A smiling man.

761
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,500
He happens to be smoking a pipe.

762
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,900
But mainly it's of other religions.

763
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,560
What do they have for symbols?

764
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,160
A death instrument.

765
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,600
An instrument of death.

766
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,080
Or some bizarre arcane symbol

767
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,260
that nobody can understand.

768
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,260
Our symbol is a smiling man.

769
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,160
A man with slack.

770
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,680
He happens to look like a man

771
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,040
who just sold you something.

772
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,220
Or has the grin, perhaps,

773
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,600
like the grin of a skull.

774
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,440
But yet at the same time, friends,

775
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,140
you know that he has slack.

776
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,880
And where did he get that slack?

777
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,180
He had to get it from somewhere.

778
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,420
That's your hint.

779
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,580
That's your proof that there is slack.

780
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,660
And you can have slack too.

781
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,500
I'm not going to tell you what it is.

782
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,100
Because, friends, it's different for every one of us.

783
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,020
And I can't tell you what it is for me

784
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,340
because you'd get embarrassed.

785
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,340
But, friends, I can tell you a real sad tale.

786
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,740
A tale of how I was born.

787
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,480
A tale of how I was raised.

788
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,100
How I became a subgenius.

789
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,920
As a happy ending, obviously.

790
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,880
But, and I'm sure a lot of people

791
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,420
can identify with this.

792
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,000
But, you know, what is the Church of the Subgenius, really?

793
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,020
It's a gathering of some weird-ass individuals.

794
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,320
People with a very quirky sense of humor.

795
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,580
A very developed sense of irony.

796
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,280
And a need for slack.

797
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,600
And a love of Bob.

798
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,720
An unquestioning love of Bob.

799
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,880
Now, you don't have to love Bob so much

800
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,840
that you become crazy.

801
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,440
Like a subgenius all the rest of your life.

802
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,160
You can do it just for tonight.

803
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,100
Just for tonight, my friend.

804
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,220
If you could be slack for one Saturday night,

805
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,920
you'd never want to be peak again.

806
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,340
But the peak man has held the slack man down.

807
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,940
The slack man and the slack woman

808
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,040
have been oppressed by the peak man.

809
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,500
And we must get our slackness back

810
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,440
by any means necessary.

811
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,500
Break Bob and hail Connie.

812
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,740
As long as it doesn't involve too much

813
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,080
work.

814
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,960
As long as we get our slack doing something.

815
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,960
You know, any of those things.

816
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,900
Oh, but friends,

817
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,060
there was a time when

818
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,740
I was a weird little kid.

819
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,900
I was a weird teenager.

820
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,000
But what made me weird was, uh,

821
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,920
it was more like what I was interested in

822
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,180
as opposed to what I wasn't interested in.

823
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,200
For some reason, growing up among those

824
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,820
rednecks in Fort Worth, Tennessee,

825
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,800
I didn't care about baseball.

826
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,120
I didn't care about cars as an eight year old kid.

827
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,220
I cared about two things.

828
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,320
Pretty little girls and big ugly monsters.

829
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,580
How many people here tonight are monster fans?

830
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,920
Raise your hand.

831
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,260
There's a lot of us started out as monster fans.

832
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,740
Because we sort of identified with the monster.

833
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,360
And how many of you here started falling in love

834
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,440
with people long before you were supposed to?

835
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,500
When you were too little to start getting crushes on people?

836
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,800
Not that many.

837
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,780
Well, see what I mean?

838
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,040
That is damn weird.

839
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,840
When you start wanting to, uh,

840
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,960
you know, um,

841
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,900
you know, get romantic with your fellow little kids.

842
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,940
And they think you're nuts.

843
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,680
Well, friends,

844
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,400
what about being a monster fan?

845
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,440
That's not a good way.

846
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,340
That's actually not a good way to get laid.

847
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,360
Especially when everybody else is only twelve years old, too.

848
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,120
And, uh,

849
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,960
but friends, there came a time

850
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,900
when my parents moved from Fort Worth to Dallas.

851
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,620
We moved from the little city to the big city.

852
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,540
And I thought, now's my chance.

853
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,500
These new kids in this new school,

854
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,720
they don't know that I don't care about football.

855
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,380
They don't know that I'm a, uh,

856
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,820
that I read science fiction books all the time.

857
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,740
They don't know that I, uh,

858
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,600
I'm a great sexual pervert

859
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,960
because I want to sleep with other little girls.

860
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,080
I was a little boy.

861
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,340
I don't want to sleep with other girls anymore.

862
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,340
I like to, you know,

863
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,780
I like to, you know,

864
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,060
I'm, I'm, you know what I'm saying.

865
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,400
You know what I'm saying.

866
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,080
It is hell being a weirdo in any culture.

867
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,140
It doesn't matter whether it's America,

868
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,660
Holland, or deep, darkest Africa.

869
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,840
It is hard to be a weirdo.

870
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,640
When I, when we moved to Dallas,

871
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,120
I thought, I'm gonna change.

872
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,060
I'm not gonna be a weirdo anymore.

873
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,480
I'm gonna be normal.

874
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,380
And friends, I did a terrible thing.

875
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,160
All through elementary school,

876
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,100
I had drawn comic books,

877
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,260
and little animated flippin' books.

878
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,380
And they were like horror comics and superhero comics.

879
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,380
They were full of violence and disappointment.

880
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,440
They were fun.

881
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,820
They were really cool.

882
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,320
But I wanted to be normal.

883
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,900
And when we moved to Dallas,

884
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,160
I threw my comic books away.

885
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,820
Not just Spider-Man number one.

886
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,220
Not just the first issue of Fantastic Four.

887
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,780
I threw away the ones I threw myself.

888
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,820
Friends, it didn't do any good.

889
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,040
It didn't do a damn bit of good.

890
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,680
I was still a weirdo.

891
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,340
I still didn't get laid until I was 19 or 20 years old.

892
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,840
And friends, give up.

893
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,420
Give up on ever trying to be normal.

894
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,820
When I gave up, then I got laid.

895
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,740
Then I started making money.

896
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,280
Then I got a good job.

897
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,260
Then I started working for myself.

898
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,880
Give up.

899
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,620
If the news is driving you crazy,

900
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,980
don't listen to the news.

901
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,600
If your friends are driving you crazy,

902
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,180
if your parents are driving you crazy,

903
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,360
move, man.

904
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,100
Move out.

905
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,300
Get away from it.

906
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,260
Change your scene.

907
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,180
It's scary at first,

908
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,320
but you'll find out everybody has to do it sooner or later.

909
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,260
Usually when they die.

910
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,220
You can do it before them.

911
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,300
And uh,

912
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,180
that's why I decided to run now,

913
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,800
because I'm out of fucking time.

914
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,120
Wait.

915
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,980
You got no jacket.

916
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,580
You fellas looking up at this.

917
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,120


918
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,040
by the way,

919
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,580
now the door's closed on all fours.

920
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:04,480
Out that door on all fours.

921
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,880
I know.

922
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,000


923
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,000


924
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,000


925
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:06,980
some Arizona favorites also go out the window first.

926
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:06,980


927
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:06,980


928
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:06,980


929
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:06,980


930
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:06,980


931
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:06,980


932
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,860
Yeah,

933
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:08,700
you karena colonizer?

934
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,360
Why GERMANY?

935
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,400
And because

936
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,400


937
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,400


938
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,400


939
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,400


940
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,400


941
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,000
The sun has yet to rise

942
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,400
I shake the wings and clear my head

943
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,180
Without my chocolate eyes

944
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,260
Round boots and round heels

945
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,240
Round all I see

946
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,320
Put the rest out on my middle fist

947
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,040
That's all I really need

948
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,440
I'm tired of being tired

949
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,220
Without my chocolate eyes

950
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,180
I shake the wings and clear my head

951
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,420

952
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,380

954

955
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,040
They'll never know, they'll never see

956
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,000
Before the hit, I'm gone

957
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,340
Stopping now

958
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,160
I'm in the dragon's dress

959
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,000
I sing the dragon's song

960
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,200
The rat and the fox think what I do

961
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,080
I do to keep them free

962
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,740
And no one knows my secret

963
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,240
No one knows I die for a reason

964
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,240
Now I'm in the fire

965
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,540
I'm in the fire

966
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,000

967
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,720
I'm in the What if you know

968
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,280

970
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:20,240

980

991
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,820
I think that was brilliant.

992
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,360
I think that was like, didn't Fred Sanford come up with that?

993
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,960
Before they killed him, that was the last, you don't think it was the IRS?

994
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,680
Who got Fred Sanford?

995
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,220
It was CID, an internal division.

996
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,700
Got him, and they put him on a skewer.

997
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,580
Right.

998
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,800
Remember that episode, Dave?

999
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,020
I thought you did the booking for that.

1000
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,760
It was when Hendrix was on that show.

1001
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,780
Oh, man, that episode will be in my can forever.

1002
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,020
I'm never going to release that thing, as much as I'd like to evacuate it

1003
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,720
and get it away from my body.

1004
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,100
But that was one of the biggest pieces of art.

1005
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,500
So how long before the show started?

1006
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,400
Before which show? Before the Hendrix Sanford show?

1007
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,560
I didn't take acid that time.

1008
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,400
It was just like a pure stroke of luck.

1009
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,260
It was not, you know, something I had to force.

1010
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,060
Oh.

1011
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,060
All right, well, carry on.

1012
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,640
Well, you know, I'm just responding to what you said.

1013
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,620
You know, what else should I do?

1014
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,840

1092
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:28,780
Heal the head bad!

1093
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,120
Bleeding head good!

1094
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,800
Hey, you smoking?

1095
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,180
No, but the pipe is!

1096
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,100
Experiment!

1097
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,120
Experiment!

1098
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,080


1099
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,080
Has gone wrong!

1100
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,500
Experiment!

1101
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:47,760


1102
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:49,140


1103
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,060
Has gone to hell!

1104
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,920
Experiment!

1105
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,640
Experiment!

1106
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:57,680


1107
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,220
Experiment!

1108
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,400


1109
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,620
Hey, you smoking?

1110
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:14,620


1111
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:14,620


1112
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:14,620


1113
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:14,620


1114
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:14,620


1115
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,760
They've infiltrated the highest levels of the government!

1116
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,640
They are the true satan!

1117
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,940
They are the true satan!

1118
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,400
Do you really believe they have your best intentions at heart?

1119
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,540
The revolution begins immediately.

1120
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,000
Immediately.

1121
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,300
Take me, your leader.

1122
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,540
It's all a joke.

1123
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,940
Because we came from the leader.

1124
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,220
You are my leader.

1125
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,060
You are my leader.

1126
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,000
You shall be.

1127
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,660
One of the snuffed.

1128
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,840
You shall be.

1129
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,420
One of the snuffed.

1130
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,660
You shall be.

1131
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,680
One of the snuffed.

1132
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,440
If you think you are.

1133
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,320
You shall be.

1134
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:06,260
But there was a way out of this mess.

1135
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,160
Fedcoms, the experiment.

1136
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,540
Friends, you can...

1137
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,580
Fedcoms has a great subgenius website

1138
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,620
at this address,

1139
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,340
digimind.tripod.com

1140
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,200
That's digimind,

1141
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,500
D-I-G-I-M-I-N-D

1142
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,700
dot tripod dot com.

1143
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,620
So friends,

1144
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,040
this is Bob's world.

1145
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,540
You can take your invisible devils of anti-slack

1146
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,740
and throw it out the window.

1147
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,020
Let's be careful with the poltergeists.

1148
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,080
Let's be friends with everything violent and strange.

1149
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,000
I just want to free the poltergeist,

1150
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,880
my inner poltergeist, man.

1151
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,900
Help me free my inner poltergeist,

1152
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,800
free Bob's.

1153
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,780
Isn't there something,

1154
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,940
some kind of news,

1155
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,680
something important we need to impart

1156
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,640
at the last minute,

1157
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,560
Dr. Smith?

1158
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,980
And a 13-year-old girl's sex orifice.

1159
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,040
Well, didn't something important happen

1160
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,980
that we need to tell...

1161
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,320
Everybody go look at www.

1162
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,100
dot subdenius dot com right now

1163
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,060
and look at all the pretty artwork.

1164
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,980
It's got great artwork.

1165
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,540
It'll be movies.

1166
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,860
I think that the X-Day came behind your back,

1167
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,580
sneak up on your sphincter muscle,

1168
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,960
give you a little kiss in the wallet,

1169
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,200
and that's it.

1170
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,680
Well, it is true that here we are now in 2002.

1171
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:34,460
Really?

1172
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,360
And, you know, 2001 is now history,

1173
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,340
in the history book.

1174
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,120
No, that was the future, man.

1175
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,740
Yes, I know how you feel.

1176
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,100
I remember when I was in sixth grade,

1177
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,340
what they said would be happening in 2001.

1178
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,240
And, you know, jetpacks.

1179
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,280
I've said this before.

1180
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,320
Space spaghetti.

1181
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,500
We got the Segway.

1182
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,600
Spaceships going to Jupiter.

1183
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,960
So it's not a jetpack.

1184
00:53:59,060 --> 00:53:59,980
We got the Segway.

1185
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,160
So it's not Hell 9000.

1186
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,340
We have a G4 Mac.

1187
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,960
But 2001 was supposed to be remembered

1188
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,600
for all this amazing technological wonders of humanity.

1189
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,400
But 2001, what will it now be forever remembered for?

1190
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,940
Cave-dwelling freak fanatics.

1191
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,300
I'm sorry, Lord.

1192
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:18,300


1193
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,400
Flying a damn plane into the damn building,

1194
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,500
killing all them people.

1195
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,780
Oop, building fall down.

1196
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,940
I'm sorry, humanity.

1197
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,820
I'm afraid I can't do that.

1198
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,340
And then get their country,

1199
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,320
hopefully those in other lands,

1200
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,480
as well as our own,

1201
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,580
will think twice before they do cowardly acts

1202
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:42,700
of terrorism upon our innocent subgeniuses

1203
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,020
and even our pet humans.

1204
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,060
Somehow, friends,

1205
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,540
Can I get a job on that space shuttle?

1206
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,540
I'm going to get out.

1207
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:48,720
Can I?

1208
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,880
Maybe I can get a job, like, at the North Pole or South Pole.

1209
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,700
That might be far enough away from them all.

1210
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,380
I've broken my water.

1211
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:55,400
No, Chaz.

1212
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,580
When the big fan hits it,

1213
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,440
there is no place safe.

1214
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,540
You can't hide from God.

1215
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,080
You cannot sleep and pretend he go away.

1216
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,100
As Jane or Hyperclete said,

1217
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,300
you cannot run from your own legs

1218
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,480
because they're what you're using.

1219
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,520
You cannot dance your way out of it this year.

1220
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,220
No, clock dance will help you.

1221
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,440
No, it's too late.

1222
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,120
You can't think about your own brain

1223
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,200
because that's what's doing the thinking.

1224
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,140
Besides, it's in a little case, you know,

1225
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,760
full of the very hard in there and so,

1226
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,620
why you can think of the same thing as thinking.

1227
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,840
And you know not the hour in which they shall come.

1228
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,380
I just feel like the beats, you know.

1229
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,060
I'm beat, man.

1230
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,740
I can't deal with the humans anymore.

1231
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,500
I'm beat, man.

1232
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,420
They're killing each other.

1233
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,560
They're doing all the ugly stuff, man.

1234
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,700
It's not spiritual for you.

1235
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,140
You can't deal with them, man.

1236
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,260
There's no love on this planet anymore.

1237
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,280
Just I want to kill you.

1238
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,520
I see why you are saying that life is not spiritual for you.

1239
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,180
I want to kill.

1240
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,740
I want to kill.

1241
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,000
Chaz, are you saying that Dr. Leary got it too complicated

1242
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,820
that he should have just left it in?

1243
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,700
Yeah, that's what he's saying.

1244
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,320
Drop out.

1245
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,980
That's what he's saying because...

1246
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,920
Forget tune in.

1247
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,020
Forget turn on.

1248
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,200
Just drop out.

1249
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,140
It's not spiritual enough for him.

1250
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:04,740
Look, man.

1251
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,860
He is a very spiritual man.

1252
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,820
Tune in to what?

1253
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,580
Look at Chaz, you know, like he's CNN.

1254
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,440
Look at the funny stuff he put on his hair, man.

1255
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,460
Don't tune in because all you're going to tune in to is the man.

1256
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:15,380
To what?

1257
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:17,820
Bathtub methamphetamines?

1258
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,460
To what?

1259
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:18,500


1260
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:18,500


1261
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:18,500


1262
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:18,500


1263
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:18,500


1264
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:18,500


1265
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,700
Some pubucker bruda.

1266
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,500
Some stupid...

1267
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:25,040
Just suck their concoctions.

1268
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:25,460
Just drop out.

1269
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,820
Just leave it behind.

1270
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,740
Just stand up and walk away from it all.

1271
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,940
Leave your house burning.

1272
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,380
Leave your shoes on someone else's feet

1273
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,360
and keep walking into the sunset.

1274
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,360
And now, Dr. Behringer,

1275
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,640
one final word

1276
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,920
about the consistent...

1277
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,380
In with the old...

1278
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,640
...finalizing word about the...

1279
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,500
Or are they all just deja vus?

1280
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:55,500
...the news?

1281
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,020
Sure, I...

1282
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,660
Yeah, I...

1283
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,960
I ate as much as I could

1284
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,200
and I got out there as quick as I could.

1285
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:01,860
Stay tight.

1286
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,240
I saw the taxi going by.

1287
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,180
I knew something was up.

1288
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,540
Everybody was speeding.

1289
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,560
Take the red pill.

1290
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,600
Take the blue pill.

1291
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,340
Will you have the red pill?

1292
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,820
Or the blue pill?

1293
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,540
I thought my eyes were going to shut the final time this time.

1294
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,360
I'll take both!

1295
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:17,680
No.

1296
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:17,680


1297
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,860
Please, sir.

1298
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,580
Or the blue pill?

1299
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,640
Can I have more of them cocktails?

1300
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:26,960
More?

1301
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,720
And you'll never know anything before.

1302
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,580
Take the red pill.

1303
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,300
More of them cocktails, bot!

1304
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,360
The red pill is much more fun.

1305
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,300
Sure, I knew all about it.

1306
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,780
But I wasn't gonna tell yet.

1307
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,660
Well, what if I did, like, two of the red pills...

1308
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:47,660


1309
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,380
And then...

1310
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,560
Well, what if I did a red pill, then a blue pill...

1311
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,880
You're back to the wheel, you're sacking the saddle.

1312
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,440
It's ZSO Radio.

1313
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,960
Five minutes later, it'll be the last day of your life.

1314
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:55,100
Last chance.

1315
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:55,780
Welcome to Cabo De River.

1316
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,320
I'm in the house.

1317
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:58,760
Thank you.

1318
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,060
Coyote's Fun City.

1319
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,400
Coyote's Fun City.

1320
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,020
Coyote's Fun City.

1321
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:14,440
Yo, yeah.

1322
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,740
You know what time it is.

1323
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,640
If you need more information, you can call me.

1324
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:17,780
I'm a doctor.

1325
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:17,780


1326
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:17,780


1327
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,740
But if you're talking about the Church of the Sub Genius,

1328
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,820
please write to this address I'm about to give.

1329
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,020
That's b-b-b-b-ball.

1330
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:33,640
That post office box, 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1331
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:43,160
Once again, that's box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1332
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,620
www.subgenius.com.

1333
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:47,620


1334
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:47,620


1335
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:47,620


1336
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:47,620


1337
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,860
Come and praise the...

1338
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,000
You cursed brat! Look what you've done!

1339
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,380
I'm melting! Melting!

1340
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,300
Oh, what a world! What a world!

1341
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:10,380
Who would have thought a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness?

1342
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,200
Ah! The boat! The boat!

1343
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,780
I'm going home!

1344
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:17,960
No!
