00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,600
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,900
3, 2, 1.

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,980
Rock, rock, 4 o'clock, 3, 2, 1, 2.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,580
Rock, rock, 8 o'clock, 7, 6, 5, 6.

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,260
Rock, gonna rock, rock, 12 o'clock, 7, 10, 9, 10, 9.

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,520
Take the clock around.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,600
Bob?

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,880
Are you late?

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,300
I'm sufficiently late.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,740
Well, no wonder you're late.

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,480
Why, this clock is exactly two days slow.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,980
1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3.

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,980
1, 3, 0, 1, 3.

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,980
1, 3, 0, 1, 3.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,240
Bob?

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,960
1, 3, 0, 1, 3.

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,260
Bob?

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,080
No!

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:01,860
Yes?

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:02,800
No!

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,260
Some scientists were experimenting with Bob.

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,280
E.B. Slash.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,040
War zombie.

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,520
Bob, give me my hand.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,100
No.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,980
Thank you, Bob.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,980
That was by Fernanda Nandily-Murrer.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,280
Before that, a piece by Artemia Salon.

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,440
Why not?

30
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,600
Authorization denied.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,460
I am the guardian of the river.

32
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,600
I am the bursar of Dogstown.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,640
Oh, he's a big slug.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
Yes, I'm Mr. Sheep.

35
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,340
Mr. Sheep.

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,540
There will be no subcutaneous violence here tonight.

37
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,660
In the halls of separation where all of the among us have met.

38
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,720
There are so many here.

39
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,960
I can see their faces gleaming in the dark as if they were wearing their own hats.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,280
And I can just see my fingers passing very, very lightly over these pages.

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,340
And I don't look good, Bob.

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,100
This show is in Braille tonight.

43
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,280
So we went up the hill to the church that the overman had built.

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,840
Under conditions of extreme physical hardship and sleep deprivation.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,960
Yes, it was an exquisite little building on the side of the cliff overlooking the overman.

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:50,960


47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:50,960


48
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,540
Only to be shot down by the slug.

49
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,520
And its deadly disintegrator beam.

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,760
Egg heads, egg heads, new egg heads came up with new kinds of devices.

51
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,760
So, we witnessed raising up of the egg heads.

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,500
Now please have your dream world arranged as you enter the show.

53
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,640
And casting your dream world.

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,440
And paying yourself.

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,500
themselves on fire trying to stop the show running your human sacrifices won't stop

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,680
the minor that's what the aztecs were doing they were trying to start it for real on the show oh

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,440
now okay maybe the song has died now i don't know can you hear the song behind the pop song

58
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,540
experience i can hear the song the polished am still hear it back there

59
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,800
theme with the ball can you still hear the song back there

60
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,140
or has the song died as a song was a song carried out of the bomb shelter

61
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,260
looking blue with an oxygen mask over its face and maybe one of its sons is dead

62
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,840
yes this could be you shuttling from universe to universe with a big happy sleepy goofy looking

63
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,900
grin on your face transcending the limits of the astral plane

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,240
and now

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,280

66
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,640
elementary

67
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,800
the secret amendments to your constitution make sure it don't stop the amendments made

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,440
while you were sleeping somewhere off slack lustered in your bed look at your insignificant

69
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,320

gg just swept it under the media rugs

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,300
all your friends would soon be dead

74
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,700
or sleeping soundly

75
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,460
looking comatose with their feet up in the air

76
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,600
la la la la

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,760

when i walked you home

81
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
the other night

82
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,120

91
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,920
shining in your eye

92
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,220
i wanted so much

93
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,120
to be your guide

94
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,000
but i was

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,060
too delightful

96
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,220

too delightful bob

100
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:42,900
bobby

101
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,740
will you ever change

102
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,100
will you ever grow up

103
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,040
and lose your playful name

104
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,240
you're missing lots of love

105
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,220
and lots of kissing too

106
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,840
from judy joyce and mary

107
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,640
and peggy sue

108
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,820
you know i was going with a girl's head on a plate but

109
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,620
he's trying to get a body for the head of his fiancee

110
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,860
so he has to frequent these sleazy strip keys clubs

111
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,260
then he brings these bimbos home

112
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,220
and he

113
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,360
will make them a special cocktail

114
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,360


115
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,380
we'll may distract the audience into believing that the song has stopped

116
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,280
but it isn't

117
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,740
in reality

118
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,580
in reality

119
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,700
it keeps on going

120
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,040
because

121
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,960
you know we tried to cripple it

122
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,460
nobody knows the words to it

123
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,780
never

124
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,160
my grandfather knew the words

125
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,060
but he's dead now

126
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,920
they say aliens dropped the song here

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,880
trying to get rid of it

128
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
they damaged the song

129
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,400
but

130
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,700
it just hid in a hole

131
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,460
until it healed

132
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,140
then it come back louder than ever

133
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,360
and hurt everybody's ears again

134
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,520
a single compact unit

135
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,820
when they pulled the plug on it

136
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,820
it just stumbled wrong

137
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,240
but never came back

138
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,240


139
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,240


140
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,240


141
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,760
it's not quite that bad

142
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,420
it just turned into sort of an acoustic song

143
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,540
so they gave up on that

144
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,900
but it still walks the earth

145
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,800
roaming the countryside

146
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,260
shambling about like some hideous zombie

147
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,560
never knowing where it'll go next

148
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,420
and there it goes

149
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:03,940
the show

150
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,220
shambling down main street yorktown

151
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,900
that's a bully shoot at it

152
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,880
with his lightning axe

153
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,860
because it refuses to die

154
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,220
maybe that's the song

155
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,220


156
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,740
that shows

157
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,200
that might be the show's theme song

158
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,760
that refuses to die

159
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,480
but it comes like the show

160
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,520
when the show moves

161
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,860
the wind blows

162
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,160
like the show

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,180
the song is an ancient animal

164
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,120
it extends back to the time of pangea

165
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,800
when all of the planets

166
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,520
and all of the earth's continents

167
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,620
were one giant single continent

168
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,100
a place of paradise and harmony

169
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,640
where all creatures live together

170
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,440
worshiping the song

171
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,600
because it still extended back that far

172
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,220
and it's still there

173
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,460
into the one world land

174
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,160
the dreamy paradise

175
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,160
true greatness of the continent of pangea

176
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,420
which was the prototype of mu

177
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,060
hey what's that knocking at the door

178
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,300
oh my god don't let it in

179
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,380
don't don't don't let it in

180
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,420
it's it's the song

181
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,700
oh my god it's roam the countryside

182
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,520
it's back now

183
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,300
tell your kids to stay away from it

184
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,940
don't worry about your neighborhood

185
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,580
property values go back up

186
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,660
after the song leaves

187
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,480
that's uh james jude

188
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,580
you hope you wish

189
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,740
but the song it just never stops

190
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,720
it just keeps going

191
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,180
sometimes the only lyrics to the song

192
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,620
were thousands of people in torment screaming

193
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,820
do they still have the kennedy car

194
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,360
i didn't see the kennedy car

195
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,420
in the past four or five times

196
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,500
they've got the hip hop

197
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,340
the kennedy car

198
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,100
even when the dj tries to pull it out of the mix

199
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,720
the song just keeps on going

200
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,760
they got their

201
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,020
motion activated sparking guards

202
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,060
hey overman

203
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,660
this guy misplaced the caller

204
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,500
uh-oh

205
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,580
they have the horizontal

206
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,460
i would i would speculate that the song kidnapped him

207
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,920
took it to another channel on your mixer there

208
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,760
try another channel

209
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,020
try the a channel

210
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,760
which generates up to 50 000 volts

211
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,140
is the song

212
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,340
is the caller there

213
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,500
caller are you there

214
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,280
fighting system

215
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,640
is the song with you

216
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,760
the legendary rock hard abs

217
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
in six minutes zero

218
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,120
maybe if you don't move the song will be

219
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,320
at least

220
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
a little bit

221
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,380
yes with the ultimate nutrition pack

222
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,920
you rub the oil

223
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,080
don't move don't move

224
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,100
you'll be just an empty house

225
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,880
where the song sucks the life out of you

226
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
the results will delight and uh

227
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,880
depress you

228
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,540
how can you kill a song that's already dead

229
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,640
that's the real question

230
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,880
it shambles on with an unholy life of its own

231
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,760
it's lived for centuries and it can't stop killing

232
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,320
strap yourselves in folks and

233
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,040
take a journey into the unknown

234
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,680
now friends

235
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,600
what's coming up

236
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,900
you may have seen ads for

237
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,360
uh

238
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,920
send in your song and we'll turn it into a record

239
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,340
our friend john truby saw that ad

240
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,020
and he wrote this song

241
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,940
and sent it in there

242
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,420
and they turned it into this record

243
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,360
i got high last night

244
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,500
on lsd

245
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,220
my mind was beautiful

246
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,280
and i was free

247
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,840
warts love my nipples

248
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,160
because they are pink

249
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,720
vomit on me baby

250
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,860
yeah yeah yeah

251
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,160
a blind man's penis is a wreck

252
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,660
because he is blind

253
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,900
it's a wreck

254
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,320
because he is blind

255
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,680
a blind man's penis

256
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
is a wreck because he's blind

257
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,340
it's a wreck

258
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,200
because he's blind

259
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,760
he's blind

260
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,320
he's blind

261
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,320
he's blind

262
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,160
he's blind

263
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,540
let's make love under the stars

264
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,820

265
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,120

266
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,880

268
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,440
yay yay yay

269
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,940
the zebra spilled his plastina on venus

270
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,420
and the gels and fingers whose electric harbors

271
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,200
and the gels and fingers whose electric harbors

272
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,620
ramona's titties

273
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,960
died in hell

274
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,420
and the nazis want to kill

275
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,940

276
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,760
a blind man's penis

277
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,140
is a wreck

278
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,380
because he's blind

279
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,540
a blind man's penis

280
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,880
is a wreck

281
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,160
because he's blind

282
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,220
it's a wreck

283
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,480
because he's blind

284
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,560
it's a wreck

285
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,780
because he's blind

286
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,940

00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,180
i told them

309
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,180


310
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,180


311
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,180


312
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,180


313
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,180


314
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,180


315
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,180


316
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,180


317
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,900
Go to the basement level.

318
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,040
Let them in.

319
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,480
Go to the basement.

320
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,320
The man's a little bitch.

321
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,360
Get down in there.

322
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,620
He's got his keys and his signs, man.

323
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,820
His stop sign.

324
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,900
Come on, Sting.

325
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,320
It's like a control thing, man.

326
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,280
And they've got this machine where they can tell if you're thinking or not.

327
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,420
It's called TV.

328
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,640
And if it's off, you're guilty, man.

329
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,220
Mom?

330
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,500
Dad?

331
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,580
Kids with drugs.

332
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,840
Every day.

333
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,440
So ask them.

334
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,300
What, where, when.

335
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,860
It's pestering.

336
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,340
Sponsored by the Office of Drug-Free America.

337
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,440
Now, a ranch has got 800 head of cattle.

338
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,000
Half the herd weighs 50 pounds.

339
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,360
The other half loses 20 pounds.

340
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,420
On the way to market, each one loses 50 pounds.

341
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,040
The other half loses 700 pounds.

342
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,500
Now listen.

343
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,440
How much does a herd weigh?

344
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,500
Bull.

345
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,560
I'm glad those two robbers hit my head on that road.

346
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,320
Each one weighs 20 pounds.

347
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,640
Bull.

348
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,000
Hmm?

349
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,560
I don't think too bad.

350
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,680
I came to help.

351
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,440
Half the herd weighs 50 pounds.

352
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,760
The herd weighs 700 pounds.

353
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,160
Ah!

354
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,400
For it never sleeps or lies idle.

355
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,580
Every filament.

356
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:37,820
Every filament.

357
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,940
It's always working.

358
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,200
It's never at conflict with itself over such human considerations as honor or love or pity.

359
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,480
From now on, you will answer the question.

360
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,140
From now on, you are to work in the uranium mine.

361
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,520
Monsters.

362
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,540
Monsters from the id.

363
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,920
Monsters from the id.

364
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:04,060
Oh, I can't wait for X-Day when the monsters from the id come to raging life

365
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,740
and your hormonal unconscious comes back.

366
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,800
And you will be relching and erupting up with living beings.

367
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,580
Your very fantasies of beautiful women, men, a monstrous aliens.

368
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,380
All will become real.

369
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Real to the pink next door.

370
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,400
Who will flee in terror, but he can never escape.

371
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,560
Because he's in your nightmare now.

372
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,020
He's in your nightmare.

373
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,040
He's alone in yours.

374
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,580
X-Day.

375
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,680
And you paid your dues.

376
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,340
And Bob will save you.

377
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,200
Now that's a name I've wanted in a long time.

378
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,000
The mechanics.

379
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
The mechanics to save any man.

380
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,200
They are Bob Dogs.

381
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,200
Yet to save his own precious bodily juices as they flow freely from his neck and his thigh muscles.

382
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,480
He is a man on a mission and I dare not say what kind of recalcified mission that might be.

383
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,800
He's an emissionary.

384
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,700
He is.

385
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,220
Don't be proud of his technological terror you can stop.

386
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,600
He is the spermatic royal.

387
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,620
He is the king of squids.

388
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,580
You and your aliens can never defeat us, Bob.

389
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,020
You and your squids.

390
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,920
You're jackass.

391
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,040
You're a prairie squid army.

392
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,800
You can never live forever.

393
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,040
He is.

394
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,600
I trust you know how to cure the subcutaneous eruptions.

395
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,380
Your mind is going to be going soon.

396
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,580
I hope you know at least where you are now, Dr. Stang.

397
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,140
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've been struck to.

398
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,460
Take the red, white and blue pill.

399
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Earthman.

400
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,980
I wonder if there are any other words you can use.

401
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,520
As long as we participate out here.

402
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,960
Until then, I wolf off with salutes to you tonight.

403
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:41,960


404
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:41,960

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,300

All Ant Skits.

408
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,740
I hope I'm right with you today, friends.

409
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:55,240
Stay Shinest, stay Chrono, stay Vennical, stay idolized.

410
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,900

411
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,160
Cut's Cut's Out.

412
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,720
Thanks.

413
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:58,720


414
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,160
Now it's pretty damn soon.

415
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,240
You're now prepared to St interact with us.

416
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,240

422
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,140
My name's John.

423
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,920
Here are a few limericks that I wrote.

424
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,260
There once was a girl named Donna

425
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,540
who liked to smoke that guano,

426
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,340
and now she's scooping marijuana.

427
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,320
There once was a guy named Dent.

428
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,520
Let me tell you a story about Bill.

429
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
There once was a guy named Blue.

430
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:33,940
Blue.

431
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,820
Sponsored by the Partnership for a Free America.

432
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,400
At 17, I knew too much to listen to the wise.

433
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,940
The world of hippies beckoned,

434
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,500
and I joined the rebels' cries that said,

435
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,720
tune in, turn on, drop out,

436
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,740
see how free you'll be.

437
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,140
Now I'm an abject slave

438
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,560
to what they said would set me free.

439
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,400
To my God,

440
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,540
my eager hopes and dreams

441
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,240
have wound up on the shelf,

442
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,060
and I'm no good to anyone,

443
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,140
least of all myself.

444
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,760
In this mad dream

445
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,380
to find myself in pot and LSD,

446
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,660
I'm shackled beyond hope

447
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,960
to what they said would set me free.

448
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,980
My life's become a living hell.

449
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,900
I beg and rob and steal.

450
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,680
Somehow, I can no longer tell

451
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,800
the fancy from the real.

452
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,840
I may have killed.

453
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,820
I just don't know.

454
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,080
A soul gone blind can't see.

455
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,240
A heartless, mindless slave

456
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,440
to what will never set me free.

457
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,600
I sometimes think I feel

458
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,680
my mother's warm and loving hand

459
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,800
come through a psychic hand.

460
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,360
I'm in psychedelic fog,

461
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,000
but like the rest,

462
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
it's sham.

463
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,120
I'm in a world of mescaline and pot and LSD,

464
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,960
and link by link,

465
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,440
it's forged a chain

466
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,500
that's made a slave of me.

467
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,320
The devil's strumming on my nerves

468
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,980
and fires within me rage.

469
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,040
My tortured mind, so gone,

470
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,780
is now a slave.

471
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,100
I can't recall for sure my age.

472
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,800
I think I'm 22.

473
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,880
I know I won't reach 23.

474
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,420
But hell can be no worse

475
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,040
than what is made a slave of me.

476
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,120
I'm bold, wild, and kind,

477
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,640
and look how strong I've grown.

478
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,580
You kidding me?

479
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:16,920
Oftentimes I think all the guardmaids

480
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:16,920


481
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,700
It's like I see myself as a clown

482
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,940
time�nun acum lau.

483
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,260
I hear a forklet,

484
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,080
fairly upright in stone.

485
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,060
I guess a yarn came from a habita.

486
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,680
I really grew up.

487
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:33,240
The Gar Min 아т آ hanbas.

488
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,280
I shouldn't have taken that other path.

489
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,420
Don't worry, my friend.

490
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,040
You didn't take the other half.

491
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,640
The other half is waiting for you here.

492
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,360
It took me!

493
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,980
In the bottom of the mine.

494
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,460
Look, look, look.

495
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,660
It's a shadow of your own face.

496
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,400
It's a reflection of your own mind.

497
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,020
Look, friend.

498
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,040
It's you.

499
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,800
You're staring blankly, mutely into the dark horizon

500
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,560
and see nothing but that slacked-on, slacked-on face.

501
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,620
Look, look, look.

502
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,780
That face.

503
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,060
That face.

504
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,780
I've seen it before.

505
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,580
I think I...

506
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,260
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

507
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,400
Never mind.

508
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,660
My mind is not my mind.

509
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,240
I'm aboard, kiddo.

510
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,560
The slack-piper-booper-piper-eeper-eeper-leeper-wraps

511
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,400
along its way.

512
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,560
Cosmos found.

513
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,740
Points unknown.

514
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,760
All aboard.

515
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,340
Never mind.

516
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,420
My mind is no longer my friend.

517
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,620
I'm repeating, we're not in Kansas anymore.

518
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,680
Mind having things taken and placed where you can't find them.

519
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,100
I'm repeating, we're not in Kansas ever.

520
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,560
Hey, man.

521
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,700
Hey, man.

522
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,940
Do you think people are going to think...

523
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,840
Do you think people are going to think...

524
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,000
Do you think people are going to think I'm...

525
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,700
I'm repeating, we're not in Kansas anymore.

526
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:21,780
Spill!

527
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,820
You feel persecuted.

528
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,340
Left alone.

529
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,340
I'm repeating, we're not in Kansas anymore.

530
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
Something's not right.

531
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,120
Are you unwound?

532
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,500
If you want a fabulous eight-hour day, change to this machine.

533
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,700
You will see the way as void.

534
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,660
This is not the true void.

535
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,960
You can know that which does not exist.

536
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,060
That is the void.

537
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,520
It is not included in man's knowledge.

538
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,260
The inscription on the wooden post reads,

539
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,460
In the void, sharp and strong, it can be used to cut, sack, and stick priests.

540
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,120
This is not the true void.

541
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,180
Of course, the void is nothingness.

542
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,480
A long-armed monkey holding a rope in his left hand to bind evil

543
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,220
and a sword in his right hand to bind evil.

544
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,220


545
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,220


546
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,880
A long-armed monkey holding a rope in his right hand to bind evil.

547
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,880
He sits in flames, reaching out for a reflection of the moon on water.

548
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,540
There is the true void.

549
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,000
In this, dreaming in heaven, is where there is nothing.

550
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,980
That is the void.

551
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,700
Must be the void.

552
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,720
The Void by Reverend Cobblestone.

553
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,100
And before that, Buck Ritchie did The Slave.

554
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,120
There is a place that I often...

555
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,600
I remember one time...

556
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,880
I remember one time...

557
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,580
Oh yeah? In your dreams?

558
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,940
Yes.

559
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,300
No, I am a floating spirit without entrails.

560
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,920
Without a need for ingestion or digestion.

561
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,140
It depends.

562
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,000
You go to bed looking at a book with pictures of insects

563
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,900
and you can have insects in your dream.

564
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,240
And you can direct what you do by...

565
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,120
That is true.

566
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,040
...just before you go to bed.

567
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,160
That is true.

568
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,480
That's probably why I always dream about...

569
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,300
have dreams about women.

570
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,700
Yes, if you go to sleep looking at voluptuous imagery,

571
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,340
then that will percolate through your dream.

572
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,160
Yo-yo-ho, that makes a lot of sense now.

573
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,680
Cause and effect, so to speak.

574
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,600
Could be, could be.

575
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,440
Yep, ah, well, of course...

576
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,380
Now, do you believe that you can change your dream by your diet?

577
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,780
Much to regret in our pasts,

578
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,680
unless we are condemned to relive certain incidents over and over.

579
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,380
But...

580
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,840
That's what we have crop for.

581
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,680
Yo-yo...

582
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,520
Yes.

583
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,120
Yo-yo-ho.

584
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Well, that's another superstition.

585
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,780
Some people believe that frock suppresses dreams, but it does not.

586
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,820
It simply makes you sleep more soundly, so you don't tend to wake up and remember your dreams.

587
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,180
But you have them all the same.

588
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,320
If you don't have them, you start losing your mental health very quickly.

589
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Yeah, you still get your rims, is what you mean, right?

590
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,160
You still get the by-product which the brain wants, and that's the rapid eye movements.

591
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,060
You get the flushing...

592
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,800
...out of the repressed psychic substratum.

593
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,060
Sort of like...

594
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,960
...the cleansing of the mental...

595
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:15,780
It's sort of like driving your mom's Dodge Dart, 63 Dodge Dart, backwards around in a circle in the parking lot to wind the miles off of it.

596
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,360
But your brain has to do that every night.

597
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,160
It does that when your eyeballs are blinking.

598
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,480
Rapidly blinking.

599
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,660
They sound like this.

600
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,500
...and tossed its...

601
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,280
You don't know they sound like that, because you can't...

602
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,400
...see them, because you're asleep.

603
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,800
You're sleeping.

604
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,840
So you don't know you're actually doing that.

605
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,240
People are watching you do it. They're sitting there laughing. They're holding their guns and they're laughing.

606
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,260
They're going, ha ha ha.

607
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,400
You are such an idiot. Look at that idiot.

608
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,460
They're looking at you and they're taunting you. They're making fun of you.

609
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,240
And they know that you're laying there and you can't hear them because you're sleeping.

610
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,560
You don't know what's going on.

611
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,820
You should ask the protection of Saint Pedro of Bethlehem.

612
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,220
Then before you wake up, they leave.

613
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,280
Really? And then Saint Pedro would listen?

614
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,240
And they take pictures of you all doing that.

615
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,340
He might just do that.

616
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,660
So that later on...

617
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,140
He's listening right now, right?

618
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,040
...they can show you those pictures and play you those tapes.

619
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,820
He always listens.

620
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,820
And you can then feel stupid.

621
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,280
He sits in his chair and sees all of them.

622
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,600
Stupid.

623
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,240
Listen to...

624
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,640
The choice is yours. Obey me and live, or disobey and die.

625
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,100
I'm...

626
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,140
Face front.

627
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,260
I don't want to wake up.

628
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,120
Everybody face to the screen.

629
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I don't want to wake up.

630
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,480
Everybody knee to the road.

631
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:21,900
I don't want to wake up.

632
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,360
And tip that chest out. Get those shoulders up in the air.

633
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Look directly at the face of his beatitude.

634
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,540
I can't.

635
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,760
Look at him.

636
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:29,840
I can't.

637
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,300
I can't.

638
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:31,840
I can't.

639
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,120
I can't.

640
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,120


641
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,980
Obey, obey, obey, obey...

642
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,620
I cannot gaze upon him.

643
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,320
Obey...

644
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
I will be blinded.

645
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,800
He is too...

646
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,240
Blinded.

647
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,140
He is too beautiful to gaze upon.

648
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,100
Never mind the brilliance, for in the light is where the signals and signs come into the

649
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,580
inner ear of your vapid brain.

650
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,920
I feel shame before him.

651
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,580
Yes, you do.

652
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,000
You've been a bad man, haven't you?

653
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,500
I was afraid of him.

654
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,920
You were afraid.

655
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,140
I saw him.

656
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,240
You detested him.

657
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,580
The man with the pipe.

658
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,040
Yes.

659
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,320
you can't be serious.

660
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,640
I am serious.

661
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:03,920
True.

662
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,180
And don't call me Shirley.

663
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,540
It happened, though.

664
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:06,860
Yes.

665
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,480
But it is true.

666
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,760
Yes, you were envious of him.

667
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,100
You must believe me.

668
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,300
You looked at his nozzle.

669
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,000
You said,

670
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,000
if only the Lord

671
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,960
had provided me

672
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,380
with a Winchester like this,

673
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,060
I could fly

674
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,260
with the duck vehicles.

675
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,320
I could live.

676
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,200
Kathy!

677
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:20,860
Escape!

678
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,420
No escape for you, my friend.

679
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,620
You're stuck here.

680
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,520
I'm staying.

681
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,960
Unplug me, then.

682
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,380
I'm staying.

683
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,620
Unplugging!

684
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,140
Quiet, man.

685
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,380
I'm trying to get the plugs out.

686
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:31,920
Drugs, Danny?

687
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,440
Why are you doing this to me?

688
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,420
Bring around the fizz water.

689
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,220
Come on.

690
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,000
We got to get him out of here.

691
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,460
Look at that stuff

692
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,420
coming out of his ears.

693
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,180
He's shocked.

694
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,400
I think they really got him

695
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,880
this time.

696
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,160
Oh, man.

697
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,380
They put Stalag in charge

698
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,160
of the Abusas prison camp

699
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,260
and look at him now.

700
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,620
My God!

701
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,840
Why hast thou forsaken me?

702
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,560
They were the political

703
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,580
and religious prisoners

704
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,740
of America in 2005.

705
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,240
Oh, man.

706
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,820
This is sick.

707
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,640
Oh, man.

708
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,640
Look at all the welts on his neck.

709
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,760
Somebody's been sucking his ear.

710
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,220
I think.

711
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,160
Authorization denied.

712
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,460
Right on.

713
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,560
This keister's wonderful.

714
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,980
I know.

715
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,580
This is a big thing.

716
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,660
Authorization denied.

717
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,780
Everyone.

718
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,080
Authorization denied.

719
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,600
Different freedom.

720
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,040
Authorization denied.

721
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


722
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


723
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,260
Authorization denied.

724
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,760
Authorization denied.

725
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,040
Authorization denied.

726
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,260
Authorization denied.

727
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,280
Demons.

728
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,500
Authorization denied.

729
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,240
Yeah, demons.

730
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,180
Man, I just can't get it up.

731
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,640
This is a big thing.

732
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,440
This just ain't doing it for me.

733
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,580
I am a good man.

734
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,020
I'm a good man.

735
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,360
I'm a good man.

736
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,720
I mean, it hurts,

737
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,720
but not enough to come.

738
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,320
You know what I mean?

739
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,360
Well, try one of these.

740
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,360
Check it out.

741
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,780
Look at the little spindle.

742
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,760
The red, white, and blue pills?

743
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,640
Well, these are more than

744
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,480
red, white, and blue pills.

745
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,280
These actually make

746
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,980
the whole thing go.

747
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,960
You know what I'm saying?

748
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,160
Oh, it's like a little

749
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,500
tiny world inside that pill.

750
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,900
Yeah, don't stare too hard.

751
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,720
You might get sucked right in there.

752
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,760
Just rub it very gently

753
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,800
on your lower parts.

754
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,260
Oh, yeah.

755
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,280
Not those parts.

756
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,880
Hey, and more

757
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,620
of them kind pills, Dave?

758
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,300
Yeah, I've got a whole bag here.

759
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,440
Oh, man, those pills feel good

760
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,680
all over my body.

761
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,160
I've never had pills

762
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,860
you could wear.

763
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,760
The pills that worked

764
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,660
on the outside

765
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,180
instead of the inside.

766
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,000
Remember that old weird

767
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,600
Cody song?

768
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,040
Whoa.

769
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,400
Yeah.

770
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,120
Your molecules

771
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,060
are starting to evaporate.

772
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,600
The inside is bigger

773
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,720
than the outside.

774
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,460
It's expanding.

775
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,640
It's out of focus.

776
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,600
It's rising up.

777
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,420
I know, I know.

778
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,060
It's inflating.

779
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,680
Can you adjust

780
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,020
the horizontal or something?

781
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,800
Let me try this little knob

782
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,040
over here.

783
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,880
Sure, chair.

784
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,500
One soul per breath.

785
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,200
It seems to be

786
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,940
I don't know.

787
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,680
Grab the knob down there.

788
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,420
You want a fabulous

789
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,280
eight-hour day

790
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,460
changed to this machine.

791
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,680
Hey, quiet.

792
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,760
How many still?

793
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,540
Thanks for the iron lung, Bob.

794
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,600
Totally destroyed.

795
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,480
Oh, man, now he's

796
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,340
growing an iron lung

797
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
out of the side of his neck.

798
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,260
Huh?

799
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,720
Don't pass out on me yet.

800
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

801
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,880
Not yet.

802
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,600
Not yet.

803
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,900
Don't pass out on me yet,

804
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,900
you rock noinker.

805
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,480
You rock noinker.

806
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,260
You have a

807
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,540
There is infinite power

808
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,220
in the red, white, and blue pill.

809
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,260
You are invincible

810
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,580
once you take

811
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,920
the red, white, and blue pill.

812
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,920
You can only see

813
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,640
fields of green

814
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,440
Call in the strike.

815
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,060
and the waves.

816
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,560
The balloon has gone up.

817
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,420
Hit the playground.

818
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:22,920
You can only see

819
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,780
F6 and 14.

820
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,840
You are clear

821
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,760
to hit the playground.

822
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,080
You can only see

823
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,240
an M14.

824
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:29,840
One or

825
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,220
16.

826
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,880
After the playground,

827
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,700
you know the numbers.

828
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,440
Move on towards Disneyland.

829
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,320
It is time to provide

830
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,580
drugs for the citizens.

831
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,660
Drugs for citizens

832
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,680
are more important

833
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,140
than community responsibility.

834
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,760
Citizens need drugs,

835
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,140
not just in profit.

836
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,580
It is time

837
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,980
to stand up on the table

838
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,640
and most of all

839
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,820
stand on the disabled,

840
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,900
low-income children

841
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,960
for the proposition

842
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,560
the basic right

843
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,180
to disrupt

844
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,400
unacceptable reality.

845
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,420

bob

881
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:45,200
i'm not resisting arrest sir but you are resisting your bowels aren't you

882
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,820
you argue with your body don't you stay and you continue to believe that you do a radio show

883
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,220
rather than a radio show does you it won't let go inside

884
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,160
you

885
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,220
uh

886
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,660

it

888
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,440
it

889
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:58,660
it

890
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,960
pulls

891
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,380
it

892
00:31:59,380 --> 00:31:59,720
pulls

893
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,820
and then it tightens it up

894
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,560
and then

895
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,000
and then

896
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:04,980
and then

897
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,520
and then

898
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,840
i think it's gonna let go right

899
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,560
when i

900
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,340
when i can't

901
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,760
just right in front of everybody

902
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,960
i never know when it's just gonna go

903
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,940
yeah that's right

904
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,660
you never know

905
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,920
uh

906
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,540
freak it out man

907
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,640
i shouldn't have took that other half

908
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,800
crime doesn't pay

909
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,600
mom was right

910
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,060
um

911
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,140
um

912
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,140


913
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,320
I thought I was going to be cool.

914
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,840
Stop cutting back, sir.

915
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,360
Will you have your miracle this year, children?

916
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,420
Will this be the year you have your miracle?

917
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,340
Stang, Chaz, don't you guys think sometimes that X Day is redundant?

918
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,200
What?

919
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,940
I'm talking about X Day.

920
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,080
Well, even if X Day is the 4th of July redundant.

921
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,120
I'm talking about the party at Tranquility Base, goddammit.

922
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,740
But I mean, you know, just all this waiting that never happened.

923
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,320
I mean, why?

924
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,380
Maybe they'll come to our houses.

925
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,560
Oh, maybe this, maybe that.

926
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,260
Dave, maybe they'll be here tomorrow.

927
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,360
Maybe you don't know what time it is.

928
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,740
Maybe you don't know what day it is.

929
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,920
Maybe you don't know what year, what century it is.

930
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,380
I have no argument with that.

931
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,860
I don't know any of those times.

932
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,540
But are you ready?

933
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,240
That's the question.

934
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,040
Have you drilled?

935
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,880
Have you prepared?

936
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,560
Are you ready for the end times?

937
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,800
Are you ready to be ruptured?

938
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,080
Are you ready to meet Bob?

939
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,540
Are you ready to be meted by Connie?

940
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,100
I've already met Bob, and I did not like the experience one bit.

941
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,720
He was drunk.

942
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,340
He was loud.

943
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,960
He tried to tickle me in front of a huge number of people.

944
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,240
He vomited on his shoes.

945
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,900
He had to be escorted by two large bald guys,

946
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,140
balder and larger than me, out of the area.

947
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,640
He never stopped smiling for a second, though.

948
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,160
Yeah, you call that a smile?

949
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,180
With all that torn flesh hanging?

950
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:47,980
Happiness.

951
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,520
He looked ecstatic the whole time.

952
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,420
Satori, indeed.

953
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,060
Slack.

954
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,300
The nth slack.

955
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,160
The extreme slack.

956
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,520
Slack.

957
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,060
Square.

958
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,440
Sure.

959
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,180
It's not just the smile.

960
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,140
It's the placidness in that face.

961
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,080
The expression in his eyes.

962
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,480
It's just the cool calm.

963
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
He is definitely in moon punch every hour of the day.

964
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,960
I know he's under 24 hours.

965
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
It's sighted lust.

966
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,400
It's the grin of infinitely sighted, infinite lust.

967
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,620
The first thing I...

968
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,180
Infinitely being sighted.

969
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,080
Before his desire has had a chance to barely form.

970
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,720
It is instantly sighted.

971
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,580
By fate.

972
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,240
The subgenius performs memory editing.

973
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,260
He buries his arm deep in the archives of the score,

974
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,720
gropes for the proper file and its specific remembrances,

975
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,800
and retrieves it to scan at leisure.

976
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,200
And he knows that this file, and his archive,

977
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,380
are but one drawer in the greater archive of all creation.

978
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,060
For everything is but a pattern, an intersection in the code.

979
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,280
Everything exists at once, it just shifts position continuously.

980
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,720
Every distinct object we see or hear, is a pattern.

981
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,800
Every round us is but an opening into the files.

982
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,420
Don't worry, if you missed something, it's all in the can.

983
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,600
It will all be aired again, in some better world.

984
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,620
And the angelic host which must soon descend will bring an index to all the shifting patterns of the code,

985
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,120
providing us with a guide to the anti-laws.

986
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,520
But we have been warned of the tampering.

987
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,440
Once one has gone swimming in the fourth dimension,

988
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,080
this dry land bound pace seems excruciatingly ordered.

989
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,620
It's a shame that life on this plane is so chronological.

990
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,200
Many are the subgenii who have gone waiting in the turbulent surf of time, never to return.

991
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,420
It's hard to get back in step once you've changed the setting on your astral wristwatch.

992
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,200
Nyaa-oy-nay-ba-bay!

993
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,440
The

994
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,520
The

995
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,600
The

996
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,500
The

997
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,520
The

998
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,840
The

999
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:45,840


1000
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,480
the

1001
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:53,740
The

1002
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,620
There are three possible pros and cons of the life mountain.

1003
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,460
1. Gibson Orbit Beapi

1004
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:04,860
2. Like CAD

1005
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,020
3. Resentment

1006
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,400
3. Accommodation

1007
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,420
I'm a sweet among

1008
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,340
Don't you have any

1009
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,460
Kind of thing

1010
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,000
More things on me

1011
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,600
That's sweet

1012
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,560
Oh my

1013
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,060
You and me

1014
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,740
Baby

1015
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,800
You and me

1016
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,640
Don't you have any

1017
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,100
Kind of thing

1018
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,980
That's sweet

1019
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,860
Oh my

1020
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,800
Don't you have any

1021
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,500
Kind of thing

1022
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,780
Oh my

1023
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,400
Don't you have any

1024
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,600
Kind of thing

1025
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,540
Baby

1026
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,260
You and me

1027
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,120
Baby

1028
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,340
You and me

1029
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:45,340


1030
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,540
You and me

1031
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,100
Baby

1032
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,320
You and me

1033
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,300
Baby

1034
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,420
You and me

1035
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,860
Don't you have any

1036
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:58,860


1037
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,260
More things on me

1038
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,320
Don't you have any

1039
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,140
Kind of thing

1040
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,860
I'm a little girl

1041
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,900
I'm a little girl

1042
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,220
I'm a little girl

1043
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,760
I'm a little girl

1044
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,800
I'm a little girl

1045
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
I'm a little girl

1046
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:38,060
There were lovely songs in this country once, look at them now, just empty husks, that were

1047
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,380
once decent tunes, and the song sucked away their life force.

1048
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,080
The song that refused to die, sapped every bit of energy from all of the most popular

1049
00:39:50,080 --> 00:40:03,160
pop songs of the time, demented in its unknowable, unthinking quest to pervade everything within

1050
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,140
its reach.

1051
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,120
Centuries in the making, maybe someday a way to stop this song will be invented.

1052
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,440
Uh oh, here it goes again, looks like it's getting riled up, getting angry, oh!

1053
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,560
Oh!

1054
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,560
Must have said something wrong, now it's gonna kill me, I know it's gonna kill me, it's creeping

1055
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,260
over here real slow, it's right next to me, but it won't, it won't kill me because it

1056
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:35,260
wants me to suffer longer, why kill me now when it can keep me suffering for years and

1057
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,000
years to come?

1058
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:42,280
Just a quivering mass of flesh with only my nerve cells working, and yet the song kept

1059
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,980
me alive for centuries for only to torture me, cause it never could stop, just kept getting

1060
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,680
uglier, more pitiful.

1061
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,000
More pathetic.

1062
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,980
And sick.

1063
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,540
Because sickness was its life, cause it couldn't die.

1064
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,620
Whole religions were formed to try to stop the song, but you know what happened?

1065
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,060
Just kept going.

1066
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,240
Didn't have a brain, not even a face, the song with no face, it sorta had a hindbrain

1067
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,140
that kept it going.

1068
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,920
Kinda like a vestigial brain, sorta like what the stegosaurus had in its tail.

1069
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,040
Just a little bit of a brain.

1070
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1071
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1072
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1073
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1074
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1075
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1076
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1077
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1078
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1079
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1080
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1081
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1082
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,040


1083
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,060
Yeah.

1084
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,500
Just a little mass of nerve, nerves that sorta clustered together to resemble, maybe it

1085
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,820
was just an action center.

1086
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,160
Didn't have to have any higher thinking.

1087
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,640
See what I mean?

1088
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:39,180
And once they catch you that way, they can bleed you and suckle from your teeth like

1089
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,940
vampires.

1090
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,480
Your blood is no longer your own, no, it's going to be someone else's blood, very, very

1091
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,080
soon.

1092
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,060
Hey, um, my horn, it's not gonna work with my corn, but it's actually gonna be a good

1093
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,820
sword, y'know?

1094
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,860
Hmmm, get out of here a bit 가!

1095
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,860
Could you forgive me if I do, King?

1096
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,660
I'm not giving it a shot.

1097
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:05,980
Come on.

1098
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,480
I'm your master.

1099
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:19,760
You is about to Quant снack my snout vous, will you.

1100
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,140
Galleons of Gilegons...

1101
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,660
...givens of us to get to your front yard.

1102
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,660
...gaggles of Gilegons...

1103
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,580
What did I...?

1104
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,360
...gillions...

1105
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,380
...gigalls of Gilegons...

1106
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,140
...gillions and gazillions of Gilegons...

1107
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,900
Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!

1108
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,960
Get, get, get, get, get, get back!

1109
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,220
Hello!

1110
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:12,580
Anyway friends, it's, these are troubled times we live in and although the church is a subgenius, well, let me put it this way.

1111
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,700
If the church goes down, well, civilization goes up.

1112
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:27,200
In flames! In flames, my friend! And when the world goes up in flames, the subgenies have the weenies!

1113
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,700
We will be the ones barbecuing!

1114
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Ah, yes! Friends, we, you know the news, you turn on the news today and it's pure surrealism.

1115
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,280
Did I really see jiggly pixels?

1116
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:52,000
The fish of Geraldo Rivera in the desert with these thousand troopers pointing guns at twenty skinny little Afghani guys.

1117
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,900
Who are all, one of whom is standing there going, when the Taliban finds out about this, they're going to kick your ass!

1118
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,760
It's all relative, friends.

1119
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,460
You know, those guys weren't getting CNN, but maybe they know more because of that.

1120
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,000
We have to get used to the idea that at any moment,

1121
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,020
anything can happen.

1122
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,200
Both the imaginable and the unimaginable.

1123
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,860
Sometimes the impossible, but more often, the unlikely.

1124
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:28,440
I wish Rod Serling was here to say that instead of Mr. Sister who wrote it.

1125
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,600
Sometimes you're the screwy and sometimes you're the screwer.

1126
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,160
More often we're the screwy and the way I read it, we're one screw short of World War III!

1127
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,260
Which I grew up looking forward to.

1128
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,180
Because I like atomic monsters.

1129
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,200
You know, oh, once again, the worst it could be was Planet of the Apes.

1130
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,260
That's pretty cool.

1131
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,220
And the best, Road Warrior.

1132
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:52,760
Whoa!

1133
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,540
Blood for oil there.

1134
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,720
Ooh la la.

1135
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:06,260
But friends, you know, it's scary because the craziest train engineer in the world is at the helm.

1136
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,460
Not Dennis Murphy.

1137
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,360
No.

1138
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,140
But Casey Jones.

1139
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,240
The craziest train engineer in the world.

1140
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:20,920
Is at the helm of Spaceship America as it careens out of control with that drunken, coat-tuck madman at the wheel.

1141
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,880
And what is America's final destination, friends?

1142
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,800
The moon!

1143
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,040
The future!

1144
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,760
And Hooterville!

1145
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,460
Especially Hooterville.

1146
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,560
Oh, man.

1147
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,720
It's so depressing sometimes.

1148
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:41,740
And I mean, I get depressed at watching the normal folks go through their routines.

1149
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:46,000
But you know, the do-gooders can be just as bad as the evil-doers.

1150
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,220
At times.

1151
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,160
And they mean well.

1152
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,920
But if you happen to be evil, and you're a do-gooder, think about it.

1153
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,720
You don't even know you're evil.

1154
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,980
For instance, anti-smoking.

1155
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Anti-smoking bullshit eats up a lot more slack than secondhand smoke.

1156
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,980
I have no doubt about that.

1157
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,360
And I swear the smug do-gooder will be the death of us all!

1158
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,080
For our own goods, of course.

1159
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:18,260
You know, they're fairly easy to spot, the smug do-gooder, because they oftentimes practice

1160
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,040
what we would call flamboyant humility.

1161
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,260
Or conspicuous humbleness.

1162
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,880
Sort of a grandiose self-effacement.

1163
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,520
Like Buddhists, who never cease to remind you of how egoless they are.

1164
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,100
You know who I'm talking about!

1165
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,220
They just want you to notice how egoless they are.

1166
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,200
That's all.

1167
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,520
Listen to me when I tell you, go beyond ego.

1168
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,620
You don't know who you're dealing with, man.

1169
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,040
Listen to me.

1170
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,540
Go beyond ego.

1171
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,720
Because I know.

1172
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:02,860
It's easy to be a social Darwinist, survival of the richest, if you're that kind that puts

1173
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,320
the evil in evolution.

1174
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,200
And I like to think of, you know, somebody said, you sub-geniuses are just a bunch of

1175
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,180
elitists.

1176
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,300
Well, yeah.

1177
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,340
Duh.

1178
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,520
For one thing, we won't let any geniuses in.

1179
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,000
But it's, like, you know, it's not that we look down on the cow manures.

1180
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,160
We just don't believe in their shit!

1181
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:31,200
Bob noticed how some people believe this and some people believe that.

1182
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,500
You know, oh, I believe the world was created yesterday.

1183
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,080
No, no, no.

1184
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,640
I believe the world, the world happened by accident.

1185
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,400
7 billion years ago.

1186
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,140
Well, Bob said, believe me out of it!

1187
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,240
You believe what?

1188
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,020
Just relax in the safety of your own delusions, friends.

1189
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,700
Just keep them out of my delusions.

1190
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,560
We'll stick with the contradictions that make good sense.

1191
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,860
Thank you very much.

1192
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,820
You know, I think you mistook me for Mr. Give-A-Shit.

1193
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,240
When I don't have my head stuck in a black hole, I always listen to the hour of slack.

1194
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,820
Because it makes me laugh and I like to laugh.

1195
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,140
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1196
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,360
Oh, you mustn't forget the nice letter.

1197
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,260
Oh, my, my.

1198
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,560
Uh-oh.

1199
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,140
That's right, laddie.

1200
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:26,300
It's an important physical document which you must keep with you at all times.

1201
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,400
Especially now that the...

1202
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,980
Dear Paul and Gary, you stink.

1203
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,660
The show was a fake.

1204
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,080
How can you guys laugh at my show behind your backs and still get away with it?

1205
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,020
What was the show to you?

1206
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:46,520
Some sort of sub-clown parade to impress your sick, groupie, fringe friends like Nina Hogan and Mark Motherbrow?

1207
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,500
I put my artistic life on the line and I get the subgenius Ed Sullivan show.

1208
00:48:53,340 --> 00:49:00,960
I work like a little devil trying to balance the forces of good and evil in three cities and get the drum set set up and tuned each time.

1209
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,540
The foam head adjusted, the radios and explosives in place.

1210
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,080
The zombies checked out and nuked.

1211
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,000
The stage managers go get them.

1212
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,960
The speeches written.

1213
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,860
And the line to tie Cleave in through the board done.

1214
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:19,340
You guys just sit on your smiles waiting for someone to help you tear the veins off the sound man's amps.

1215
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:26,100
Between Gary's asking where the food is and Paul, your bitching about not wanting to clean where the banners are.

1216
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,060
I was just about up to my sub-glen and too much is always butter for not enough.

1217
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,720
Gary, you sad mop of a man.

1218
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,780
Where do you get off thinking a child's towel is the way to go on stage?

1219
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:45,360
With a band that now sounds like bus breaks, you want me to play drums to what?

1220
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:53,360
Hurting dolphins may be funny to you, but it simply gives little Jerry Jeff callers everywhere the wrong and the long idea.

1221
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,920
If you'd taken your mom up on that hair deal, we could have had a decent light, man.

1222
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,900
And some better church air, but no, you said it's Bob's will and walked away.

1223
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,080
Nice lights, Gabo fam.

1224
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,460
Paul, you sniveling art snot.

1225
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:17,480
To make it all your show, you've moved the damn thing to LA and I had to blow it up on the freeway before we could go on.

1226
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,760
You probably think putting the sponge head in the middle instead of me on the drums was pretty funny.

1227
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:37,060
Intent as you were in wrecking my show, I tell you, everyone, oral contract, that I will wear my space suit and you scamper out to your friend to borrow his gorilla suit and say,

1228
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,740
Space helmet.

1229
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,860
If this is the new church, the new take what you want from whoever you want.

1230
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,780
Well, you lowerites can sit on it and extragrameditate.

1231
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:56,340
I'm gonna go back to the legitimate religion where the sneakers become suckers the old fashioned way.

1232
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,260
We burn them, not each other.

1233
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,760
Smith, that lost little fool.

1234
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,140
He couldn't find Philo's show hole with both pipes.

1235
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,040
And he expects everyone to do the same.

1236
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,560
They'd be excited about his limp dishrag of an act.

1237
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,180
My buddy, D Meyer, poop of all, etc.

1238
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,940
Worked up some of the best lines and runs in the mouth history of the church.

1239
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,620
And you steal them all the time.

1240
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,180
All of you, every line.

1241
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:31,280
Then put him on last so you may deliver his best lines first badly driving away all the people who know what we mean and leaving precious little for the audience.

1242
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,540
For him to swing and swig and swoon to.

1243
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And for me?

1244
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,020
When I shot Bob there were 200 tops left.

1245
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,820
I could have shot all the audience too.

1246
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,440
There were so few left.

1247
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,200
I had enough bullets left in my gun.

1248
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,180
I may have.

1249
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,160
I was so mad.

1250
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,460
Why save the best for last?

1251
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,340
Those people want to see Bob shot.

1252
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:58,040
And you, school marmalade of a man, Smith, act for two years like it was you I shot.

1253
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:05,980
I hand you the biggest publicity ploy since Janer's device and you complain the curse and cry to Paul, your sleep genius S.F. Lowe.

1254
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:05,980


1255
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,060
And you complain to him, you're so lucky, about how it's just a blank.

1256
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,200
And oh, he just does the best.

1257
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,980
Really, well, you just coming up if you think you have been.

1258
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,980
Where did you dig up those Arkansaniacs?

1259
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,340
Funnier than a gravel mixer, yes, and noise that matches one.

1260
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:31,300
But next time, get someone who knows how to dress and won't sit in the middle of Broadway to eat his dinner.

1261
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,560
Box and knives.

1262
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,460
Feuding.

1263
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,020
Cemetery.

1264
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:38,640
Graves.

1265
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,500
No trespassing.

1266
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,360
Stolen pig.

1267
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,280
Escalated.

1268
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:41,840
People died.

1269
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,060
Killed and hurt.

1270
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,720
Fight argument.

1271
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,480
Hilliard Hall.

1272
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,420
Fight rumble.

1273
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,200
Gang fight.

1274
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:46,880
Tattoos.

1275
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,380
Fraternity.

1276
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:47,920
Feud.

1277
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:48,720
Uh, feud.

1278
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,560
Don't forget, folks, the song that wouldn't die.

1279
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,680
It's still in your brains.

1280
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,340
You may not be able to hear it now, but it'll be with you always.

1281
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,720
Following you through life.

1282
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:05,960
And you.

1283
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,680
In cover versions by Liberace and Herb Alpert and Ioanna Brass.

1284
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,200
Together.

1285
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,760
It's the most horrible thing you can ever imagine.

1286
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,160
With Tina Turner singing background vocals.

1287
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,380
And Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazelwood.

1288
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,280
And Yoko Ono.

1289
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,980
And a cameo appearance by Mel Gibson as the World War II soldier returning to his daughter.

1290
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,220
Melanie and Claudine Loces.

1291
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,840
With Bob sharpening knives.

1292
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,080
And the ghetto boys.

1293
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:47,940
The letter was written by puzzling evidence in copying David Depp's The Amazing Pope of New York's First Letter, critiquing the first show of the first century, of the first millennia, of the first group of subgeniuses that ever were.

1294
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:52,260
That is the show's way.

1295
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:59,580
We're just moving the body of the show out of the way here because in two minutes I've got to hide this thing under the sound board.

1296
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,800
Yeah, we've got to get it under the board.

1297
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,360
Roll it in there.

1298
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,260
I just want to fight.

1299
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,400
I left them showing the other way.

1300
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:05,680
I know what you mean.

1301
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,240
I know exactly what you mean.

1302
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:19,400
An elite padre, a random rogue group of renegade subgeniuses are responsible for this outrage that we of the church utterly deny and shame.

1303
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,660
Can't think clearly.

1304
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:21,860
And separate our lives.

1305
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,840
My friends, a little bit of KPFA in Berkeley.

1306
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,120
Puzzling evidence.

1307
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,140
Dr. Howell.

1308
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,660
And Dr. Philodrumon.

1309
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,900
And they're all for it.

1310
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:45,340
Well, we're about ready to wash down the worm, as they like to say in Cozumel, where I like to hang my britches every Tuesday and some of the kids like to hang out with me, too.

1311
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,620
I've got a good joke for you.

1312
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,060
One of my friends, one of my little friends told me.

1313
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:55,480
There was this little boy and kind of like a 40-year-old man.

1314
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,160
They didn't really know each other.

1315
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,480
They're walking off towards the woods hand in hand.

1316
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:05,180
And the little boy squeezed the older man's hand and said, I'm afraid.

1317
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,260
I'm afraid to go in the woods.

1318
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,860
And the man said, you're afraid.

1319
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,320
Think of how I'm going to feel coming out alone.

1320
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,080
And, you know, that's what I think is wrong with today's people.

1321
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:17,960
So true.

1322
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:18,560
So true.

1323
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,680
They just they don't understand that when their time is nigh, they might as well plop one in the eye.

1324
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,360
They might as well forget the whole routine.

1325
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,240
Give it up.

1326
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:28,620
Give it up.

1327
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,460
Give it up.

1328
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:38,200
And buy one of these beautiful, beautiful synchronized goat shirts, ghost shirts from the ghost dancers out there in the Lakota lands.

1329
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,000
Where the wind blows free and the bison blow.

1330
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,960
Now that's the name I've wanted in a long time.

1331
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,900
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1332
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,540
Oh, I didn't remember J.R. in the mines.

1333
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,680
I ain't give anything for another bowl of J.R. Bob Dobbs maple syrup.

1334
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,920
Oh, I remember him.

1335
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,120
The only maple syrup drained straight from the cow's throat.

1336
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,220
His fingers were as black as the ground.

1337
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,220
The coal from all the coal he dug.

1338
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,860
He'd circumcised the rectums of those.

1339
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,900
He worked so hard, you know, that...

1340
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,420
When he would mutilate a cow to get a good syrup oil.

1341
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,880
I remember.

1342
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,180
I remember.

1343
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,980
Stick Bob by any other name would smell his feet.

1344
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,580
Dismembering a cow with Bob.

1345
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,240
Now that was a fine Sunday.

1346
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,780
Better than singing and going to the mines.

1347
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,040
The old fashioned way.

1348
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,740
Old fashioned.

1349
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,220
That's the way to do it.

1350
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,260
And yet there's no other way than the way that happened yesterday.

1351
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,740
Day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day.

1352
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,780
Oh, yesterday.

1353
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,560
It's no time for an old man.

1354
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:32,940
No more.

1355
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:38,020
When I was a young baggie, we used to take three and five year olds.

1356
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,480
We'd pull their hair out as long as it would go.

1357
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:41,860
Really?

1358
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,080
And drop them down into the shaft to see if they'd make a splattering sound.

1359
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,960
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1360
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,580
Those were the days.

1361
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,000
Before the damn English owner came here.

1362
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,100
Wouldn't let us start a union.

1363
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,160
Those were the days when I was but a young scrotum.

1364
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,940
They want all the sheep they want.

1365
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,960
Just a little curly hair.

1366
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,220
Short hair, ma'am.

1367
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,840
A little one-eyed fella.

1368
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:08,080
Always standing up for his own rights and lefts.

1369
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,000
Always eager to please the hight.

1370
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:11,640
Oh, he was.

1371
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,280
I like Jonah and the whale.

1372
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,220
You're a good boy, he's right.

1373
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:19,040
You're a good boy, he's right.

1374
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,820
Till next week.

1375
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,280
Keep your hat on tight.

1376
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,200
You're back to the winter.

1377
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,660
Sack in the saddle.

1378
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,140
Give that sack to Princess Mary.

1379
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,440
You know that's where it belongs.

1380
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,660
She's a mysterious girl.

1381
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,400
Order!

1382
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,360
Order!

1383
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,320
This is my rifle!

1384
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,720
There are many like it, but this one is mine!

1385
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,780
This is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1386
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:58,120
And you can get more information about the Church of the Subgenius from www.subgeniusradio.com.

1387
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,520
You can get more information...

1388
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:12,400
Here's an address for ESO, Swamp Radio, and Chaz's band, which change its names a lot.

1389
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,100
It's Einstein's Secret Outlaws lately.

1390
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:28,100
At Post Office Box 81555 Cleveland, Ohio 44118.

1391
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:28,100


1392
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:28,100


1393
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,860
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

1394
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,580
That's not right.

1395
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,100
That's 44181.

1396
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,860
I could do all that again and do another take, but I'm not going to, friends, because this

1397
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,000
is the Hour of Slack.

1398
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:42,920
Praise Bob.

1399
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,900
And praise Hell-Pope Huey, who did that music.

1400
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,300
And, friends, if you've got some kind of tapes or CDs you want to play on that you think

1401
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:57,520
is suitable, is suitably bobbed and slacked up and conspiracy bashing and ear bone ripping,

1402
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,940
and to play on this August radio show, then you can send that to me, Reverend Ivan Stang,

1403
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:21,460
at this address, Stang at Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1404
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:24,760
44118.

1405
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,500
That's Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights.

1406
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:27,500


1407
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,300
Praise Bob.

1408
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:29,980
Praise Bob.

1409
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,320
And praise Hell-Pope Huey, the background.

1410
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:41,620
By the way, friends, that song earlier, Dazed and Confused, I believe that was by Bomb Water.

1411
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,680
Keep it slack.

1412
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,780
We're chubby.

1413
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,160
Bob, give me my hand.

1414
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:46,740
No.

1415
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,620
Thank you, Bob.

1416
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:55,400
The following is a rebuttal to KRUD Editorial denouncing the legalization of marijuana.

1417
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,500
Speaking for the legalization of marijuana.

1418
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:02,240
The legalization of marijuana is Ashley Roach-Clip, President of United Heads for Hemp.

1419
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,340
Mr. Roach-Clip.

1420
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:04,500
Yeah.

1421
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,280
Am I facing the right way, man?

1422
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,340
Just look at the red light.

1423
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:08,840
Oh, yeah.

1424
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,160
All right.

1425
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:10,220
Yeah.

1426
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,360
I just want to say, man, that a lot of...

1427
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,140
Just a second, Mr. Roach-Clip.

1428
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,640
Let's try it again, okay?

1429
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,340
All right.

1430
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,200
We'll just take it from this top end and just relax.

1431
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:22,780
Yeah.

1432
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,280
I know what I was going to say.

1433
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:24,700
Okay.

1434
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,380
We'll just take it from Mr. Roach-Clip.

1435
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:26,660
Okay?

1436
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:26,860
Ready?

1437
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,480
When I cue you.

1438
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,480


1439
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,480


1440
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,480


1441
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,480


1442
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,480


1443
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,740
Sure.

1444
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,280
Mr. Roach-Clip.

1445
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:30,460
Yeah?

1446
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:31,880
No.

1447
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,200
You're supposed to...

1448
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:33,900
Oh, yeah.

1449
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:34,380
Yeah.

1450
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:34,680
Right.

1451
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:34,920
Okay.

1452
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,460
Let's try it again.

1453
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:35,920
Okay.

1454
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:36,080
No.

1455
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:36,820
I know where I'm at.

1456
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,140
All right.

1457
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:37,740
On three.

1458
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,740
Just face the camera with the red light on it.

1459
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,060
Yeah.

1460
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:40,740
There you go.

1461
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:41,640
You're in focus.

1462
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:42,700
Okay.

1463
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,340
Mr. Roach-Clip.

1464
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,900
A lot of cats put down grass, man.

1465
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:53,480
Because they say things about it makes you lose your memory, you know, man.

1466
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,300
Well, I just want to say that...

1467
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:56,360
I don't know.

1468
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:57,460
I don't know.

1469
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:57,460


1470
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,080
I forgot where I was, man.

1471
01:00:59,220 --> 01:00:59,660
Just a minute.

1472
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,120
Okay.

1473
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:00,540
Cut.

1474
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:01,020
Freddy.

1475
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,560
Freddy, stop.

1476
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,240
All right.

1477
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,720
Let's just take it once more.

1478
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,040
Okay?

1479
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,180
Just a minute.

1480
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,080
Let me think of where...

1481
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:07,580
Oh, yeah.

1482
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,320
I know what I was going to say.

1483
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:08,640
All right.

1484
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:08,740
Okay.

1485
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,040
Here we go.

1486
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:09,400
Okay.

1487
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,680
We'll take it from Mr. Roach-Clip again.

1488
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:10,880
Okay?

1489
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,320
I'm ready.

1490
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:11,900
Here we go.

1491
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,500
Mr. Roach-Clip.

1492
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:14,260
Yeah?

1493
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,980
Mr. Roach-Clip.

1494
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,360
You're supposed to do the speech.

1495
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:18,860
Oh, right.

1496
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,280
Right.

1497
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:19,800
Right, man.

1498
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,320
I got it.

1499
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,200
All right.

1500
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:30,280


1501
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:30,280


1502
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:35,760
You're off now.

1503
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,080
Okay.

1504
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,540
Thanks, man.

1505
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:39,840
Thanks very much.

1506
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:39,980
We'll get going.

1507
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:39,980


1508
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:40,000
All right.

1509
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,060
Bye-bye.

1510
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:40,060


1511
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:40,100
Bye-bye.

1512
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,420
Thank you, man.

1513
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,160
Good luck.

1514
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:41,380
All right.

1515
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:41,440
Take care, buddy.

1516
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:41,440


1517
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:41,480
Bye-bye.

1518
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,480


1519
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,480


1520
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,480


1521
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,480


1522
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,480


1523
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,480


1524
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,480


1525
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:43,980
Goodbye, everybody.

1526
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,320
Bye-bye.

1527
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,180
Goodbye, everybody.

1528
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:46,160
