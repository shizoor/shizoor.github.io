1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:16,580
And now, once again, that hour has rolled around for the Ask Dr. Hal show, live on radio.

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:31,320
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight the rain comes down and the elements insist on being uncivil,

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:40,420
but we shall soldier on, or whatever it is that we do, here on RadioValencia.fm.

4
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,800
And, oh, my friends, and oh, my foes,

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,200
we have an incredible assortment of guests tonight.

6
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:58,280
It shall be a show that shall long live in our annals.

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,380
Just like a tapeworm.

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,280
So settle back, relax, and enjoy our feature presentation.

9
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,580
I hear the thing creeping up on us in the background.

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,580
As always, twas ever thus.

11
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,260
Oh, yeah, I guess.

12
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,100
Turned on is such an evocative phrase.

13
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,320
And so now we have video as well as audio documentation.

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,620
Folks, these tapes or whatever form of recording they may ultimately assume...

15
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,180
Holograms.

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,560
...might produce...

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:45,660
Holograms.

18
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:45,780
...might produce...

19
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,160
...might prove to be the most valuable documents of our time.

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,340
Perhaps projected on clouds in the future of the dwindling days of the human race.

21
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,900
One can never tell.

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,700
Dobbs prophesied that the moon would be used as a gigantic drive-in movie screen, so to speak.

23
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,720
They might do that to disguise all their evil doing up there.

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,700
Because now we've got George W. Bush with his eye on the moon.

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,060
And he knows why he wants to be there and build a super-militarized moon base at the pole of the moon.

26
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,080
Of course, the pole is a good place to do it because you avoid the greatest extremes of temperature.

27
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:35,940
But critics have pointed out it's going to cost a vast fortune to keep these guys supplied with the necessities of life.

28
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,020
Why do they need to be on the moon anyway?

29
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,960
Didn't we go there?

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,500
But there is a reason.

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,260
The golfing, for one thing.

32
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,840
Oh, yes.

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,400
The astronauts who went already.

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,540
They hit a famous line drive on the lunar regolith.

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:59,720
But what Mr. Bush and his friends are actually angling for is essentially the gas or oil of the future.

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:09,620
Because the petro-products from biological development on the planet Earth will ultimately run dry, as everyone has known for some time.

37
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,680
But it turns out that the moon contains a strange and non-existent...

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,220
It's a novel new source of power.

39
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,000
You can read all about it if you just type in a search to Helium-3.

40
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,660
Helium-3, only found on the moon.

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,540
A perfect source of clean nuclear reaction.

42
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,200
And a source of infinite energy.

43
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:40,760
An ironic aspect of that is that another chemical or mineral that can only be found on the moon is Kaverite.

44
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,880
Well...

45
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,160
And you need Kaverite to get to the moon.

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,740
No, they don't have Kaverite.

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,860
I'm sorry to correct you.

48
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,220
They were unable to create Kaverite on the moon out of lunar elements.

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,540
And one reason...

50
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,400
Oh, I didn't know they tried.

51
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,340
They tried.

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,420
They tried to create Kaverite both in the movie and in the book.

53
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,780
On the book it was suggested...

54
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:12,540
Well, friends, this is a historic speech that was taking place some time ago in the annals of subgenius history, as I said.

55
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,140
I thought that was us just now.

56
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,000
No, that was us long time ago.

57
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,960
But the interesting thing is we are here now.

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,040
I can't tell the recordings from reality anymore, Dr. L.

59
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,340
Well, settle back.

60
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,160
I can't because I wasn't on that other one.

61
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,080
Yeah, but that's because it was at an X day that you didn't deign to attend.

62
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:41,460
Let me introduce for our friends who are listening the variegated persons here in our studio.

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,660
Who you calling variegated?

64
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:51,720
Now, now, we'll figure out about the gates and all of that in a bit of time.

65
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:01,440
But right now, leading the dance, Dr. Reverend Ivan Stang, the sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius,

66
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,120
who you were just hearing in an archival recording, is actually here present.

67
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:12,880
And with him, his co-conspirator in crime, Dr. Philo Drummond.

68
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,320
He is actually here with us in our studio.

69
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,120
That's him performing the salute.

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,920
In addition, we may expect Zero Boy to be with us at some time tonight.

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,180
And sitting in our studio are two auditors who are here to keep the rest of us honest.

72
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:41,600
Leslie Sternberg Alexander, cartoonist, late of New York City, and visitor from Pomona, California, Olympia.

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,500
Here to make sure that this show is indeed a memorable one.

74
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,860
As it ought to be, we have all the advantages and none of the disadvantages.

75
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,160
Eh, Stang?

76
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,380
That's right, Dr. Howell.

77
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,860
And, uh, actually isn't it?

78
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,780
Well, what about Pomona from Olympia, Washington?

79
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,300
Wasn't she gonna be here too?

80
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,560
Yeah, well, I think Olympia, Washington, and Pomona are there already.

81
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,500
Pomona is this sleepy little stop on the railroad line.

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:11,580
Pomona is this sleepy little stop on the railroad line.

83
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,800
My train is often passed through there.

84
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,620
And I've looked out the window and wondered what it was like.

85
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,740
A girl I was in love with in college used to live there.

86
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,040
But I've never gotten off that train.

87
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,200
This sounds like something we're gonna do a waltz to or something here, Dr. Howell.

88
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,360
Well, it's a tango, actually, to speak rather narrowly.

89
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:41,560
But we need not stay with that particular form, particularly as the night grows long and heavy and our feet are heavy.

90
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,680
Turn into the clumsy clodhoppers they often are.

91
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,380
But I have a remedy for that, too.

92
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,660
Our clumsy clodhopping feet.

93
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,040
Behind Leslie, there is a pocket in that blue garment.

94
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,720
And in that pocket, there is that which will make us all happy.

95
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,460
But, you know, I have a feeling I have to retrieve it myself.

96
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,420
And we're not gonna be clodhopping as much, right?

97
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,260
Well, we are clods, but we will hop from statement to statement.

98
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,540
We're gonna be clipping and popping.

99
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,140
We're not gonna be clodhopping our peas.

100
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,960
We could.

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,920
Something that makes me happy is lappy.

102
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,800
Well, we'll do that.

103
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm not gonna talk without popping my peas.

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,540
You misunderstand what I mean.

105
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,020
How about a...

106
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,940
Like lappy dancing?

107
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,460
Does anyone have an incendiary device?

108
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,360
Does Philo, in fact, have an incendiary...

109
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
I can make fire by rubbing two sticks together.

110
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,640
Very good.

111
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,620
Yes, he is able.

112
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,960
I rub two joint sticks together.

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,920
The greatest achievement of man.

114
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:41,940
Make a match.

115
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,120
Two frop sticks rubbed together will create fire.

116
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:45,780
To create energy.

117
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,760
Energy from the environment.

118
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,820
The energy of fire.

119
00:07:51,160 --> 00:08:00,220
Oh, how wonderful it is as we consider that man's other adventure and invention is time.

120
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,160
Time hath endless rarities and shows of all varieties,

121
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,220
which revealeth old things in heaven.

122
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,300
And empty packages to all and everyone else there, Dr. Howe.

123
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,140
They're empty?

124
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,980
But run is not empty.

125
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,080
Something escaped its enclosure, I see there.

126
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,780
Well, don't be concerned about these beasts roaming around.

127
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,160
Sip it up.

128
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,160


129
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,380
Well, look, you've just got to take things as they are and take the bitter with the sweet.

130
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,520
During our winter trip last year, subgenius church co-subfounders

131
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:43,340
Dr. Philodrummon and I, Reverend Stang, appeared with other guests twice on Dr. Howe's

132
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,300
two-hour show on Radio Valencia in San Francisco.

133
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,300
The first one and three live puzzling evidence shows are strewn about among other hours of slack

134
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,780
along with the collages and songs and vacation reports and plenty more of all that will come

135
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,900
when we get some time control back.

136
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:10,160
However, the second Dr. Howe show, just rediscovered, had not been chopped up and categorized

137
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,260
and best of all, with only a few edits, was hour of slack ready.

138
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,300
About halfway into the show, a creature known as Zero Boy arrived.

139
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,680
Apparently, he's an experienced improv comedian well known to Dr. Howe,

140
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,020
and since he was not known to me, he blew my mind.

141
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,980
And I suspect he will yours too.

142
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,860
Now is everyone all comfortable in here with the drugs and alcohol and sound effects and...

143
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,700
I could use some more alcohol.

144
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,780
Now we can relax, have fun.

145
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,880
I have the rules, that list of rules that we use for the puzzling evidence show.

146
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,460
Well, let's have it.

147
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,260
But this is the station where we break all the rules, isn't it?

148
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,220
This station...

149
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,680
This station...

150
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,480
But we have to know what they are to break.

151
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,860
Those are universal rules.

152
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,340
Those particular...

153
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh, we're not talking about YSCB, are we?

154
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,400
No, we're not talking about yogurt this time.

155
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,600
But we are talking about the greater freedom that we have here at Radio Valencia.

156
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,640
YBSC.

157
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,800
So that implies the question being asked, YBSC.

158
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,100
Well, I thought that had something to do with yogurt.

159
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,860
No.

160
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,200
YSBSC treats or something?

161
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,840
It means yelling Bob Slattery.

162
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,320
YBSC, YPFC.

163
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,840
Yelling Bob Slack Conspiracy.

164
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,380
What more do you need to know?

165
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,460
That's my job.

166
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:34,900
Nothing.

167
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,140
One needs to know nothing.

168
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,380
YPFC, Yelling Bob Slack Conspiracy.

169
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,200
Aren't those four really really kind of boil the Church of the Subgenius down to its constituent

170
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,060
elements?

171
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,880
Well, that's what we're going to have to do.

172
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:47,960
Its essence.

173
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,480
We're going to have to try the try works.

174
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,760
Yelling Bob Slack Conspiracy.

175
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,920
Sure.

176
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,560
Everybody likes to do that.

177
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,140
Whispering Bob Slack Conspiracy.

178
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,660
It doesn't work.

179
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,880
It doesn't do any good at all.

180
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,180


181
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,080
Whispering under the dwarf maples.

182
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
Well, what we're going to have to do is...

183
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,600
Morite temporum volumptuous.

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,880
You mean voluntas?

185
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,100
No, volumptuous.

186
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:10,940
Yeah, that's...

187
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:17,420
It's a rarely, a very rare, rarely used Latin word.

188
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,140
All right, well, let me get this down.

189
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,100
I'll have to transcribe it, but fortunately I learned touch typing.

190
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,520
Well, here's a nib. Here's a new nib for you to transcribe with.

191
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,140
I'll use the typewriter.

192
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,240
You can use this new nib if you'd like.

193
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,440
Those nibs are for a special occasion.

194
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,160
I'll just... I'm, you know, I have 40 words a minute, so...

195
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,980
So we went from the syncopated clock to the syncopated typewriter now.

196
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,740
You called it, buddy. That's the way we do it out here.

197
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,740
We shift forward. We keep them on their toes.

198
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,940
But that fire that you had, is that going to be available?

199
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,120
Because pretty soon we're going to...

200
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,640
We're going to need it again, the way things are going.

201
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,720
The fire...

202
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,380
The fire is in your loins, doctor.

203
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,180
The fire... Well, that, of course, won't... is true, but it won't light us up, as it were.

204
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,860
Lighten up, dude.

205
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Where's the fire?

206
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,460
In your eyes, Lieutenant Cratchit.

207
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,260
Yeah, right.

208
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,360
I think that's what he was looking for.

209
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,300
It's pink, I can't help but observe.

210
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,160
You're standing on my...

211
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,280
Hey, hey, hey, put it back.

212
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,180
Put it on my neck.

213
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,600
Uh-uh.

214
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:25,840
Uh-uh.

215
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,620
That's not the lighter.

216
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,060
That's, uh, Philo's, uh, you know.

217
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,160
Oh, I see.

218
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,380
Finger.

219
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,300
But why does fire come out of the end?

220
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,400
Oh, well, I guess he has one of those...

221
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,140
Why ask why?

222
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,880
He's an overman.

223
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,800
He's got the Venusian, uh, epizootis.

224
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,120
You've got to get tested for that.

225
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,840
So, why isn't...

226
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,060
Is there a phone number that listeners can call?

227
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,020
Yes, it's...

228
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,480
Oh, so that means we can't get callers on the line anymore, right?

229
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,820
Uh, to tell the truth, Dr. Drummond, I don't know.

230
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,480
Dr. Drummond, the last time they tried to call, we weren't able to hook them up because

231
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,840
this station periodically suffers from, uh, problems of that nature.

232
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,200
But we could try...

233
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,780
It's like phone-ephasia.

234
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,960
It might well be.

235
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,860
Phone-ephasia.

236
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,940
Let's, uh, let's give it a test, shall we?

237
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,700
No, callers is one of the rules.

238
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,560
Let's try it.

239
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,660
No, they should be able to call.

240
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,680
There's supposed to be callers on these shows.

241
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,120
They, well, you know, we can't always do...

242
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,680
Oh, there's a question, uh, or an observation.

243
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,420
But I'm going to...

244
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,800
Let's throw it open in case anyone out there wants to call.

245
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,420
Because we have here a turbo-philosophorum.

246
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,100
A crowd of philosophers and great subgenius sages.

247
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,720
We have cartoonists.

248
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,980
We have people who ought to be able to answer questions.

249
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,840
And, of course, I'm one of them, so...

250
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,140
We have cartoonists.

251
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,400
Yeah, cartoonists know everything.

252
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,700
You know, to draw something, you have to know...

253
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,540
I mean, can you draw a water faucet the way it actually looks

254
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,160
with the handle and the bolts and so on?

255
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,940
You have to have a huge register of stuff in your head.

256
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,800
So true, so true.

257
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,060
Cartoonists are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind.

258
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,740
I can draw a spigot.

259
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,540
Yes, old spigot, old sport.

260
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,900
I have every belief that you can.

261
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,200
That was just a randomly chosen example.

262
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,580
And, of course, we cartoonists do have what Leslie Sternberg Alexander called a morgue.

263
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,980
A large collection of pictures which we use.

264
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,320
Or at least that's what we used to.

265
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,780
Before the Internet to see what things looked like.

266
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,320
But you see, Dr. Howell, I'm not really a graphic artist.

267
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,920
I'm more of a word artist.

268
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,240
That's true.

269
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,600
I like to draw pretty word pictures in the mind.

270
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,100
He's a philo-sopher.

271
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,740
Well, let's see if all these people out there can help us out with that project.

272
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,060
I'm a high school philo-sopher.

273
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,140
So here we go, philo.

274
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,260
This is what you wanted.

275
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,440
Call us, folks, at...

276
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,100
Area code.

277
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,580
No valve for reason.

278
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,360
Neon.

279
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,040
Valve.

280
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,600
Nevis.

281
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,260
Yeah.

282
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:54,980
Valve.

283
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,560
Now, we're all...

284
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,340
That's...

285
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,820
No valve for reason.

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,520
Neon.

287
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,260
Valve.

288
00:14:59,640 --> 00:14:59,960
Nevis.

289
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,580
Yeah.

290
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,860
In the 415 area code.

291
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,980
We can't guarantee that we'll be able to take your call.

292
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,920
But who knows?

293
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,840
We might be able to.

294
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,160
For Hour of Slack listeners, that number is...

295
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,400
We can put that in later.

296
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,760
Can't we?

297
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,920
That's the way all the numbers sound on the Hour of Slack.

298
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,360
Dr. Howell, I only take callers from your stations.

299
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,400
Oh, that is sad.

300
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:40,440
But because they go from my station to numerous other stations, I hide the actual phone numbers that you give out.

301
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:47,400
Because otherwise, little old ladies in Atlanta and Cleveland and so forth will be called up by Copy Bob.

302
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,920
That would be a terrible thing.

303
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,000
Copy Bob's all right these days.

304
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,760
He's actually kind of mellowed out.

305
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,760
He has.

306
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,120
He's calmed down a lot.

307
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,880
What about Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

308
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,640
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's really mellowed out, too.

309
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,140
He's calmed down a lot.

310
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,800
He's the only person who is allowed to call the Hour of Slack.

311
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,020
He's really calmed down a lot.

312
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,040
It's easy to put the Bob head in a copier and copy it.

313
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,740
Copy Bob heads in a copier?

314
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,360
You have to get it even closer to him.

315
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,360
I fear we've gone...

316
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,460
You could put the Bob head in a photocopier.

317
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,560
Yeah, we put the Bob head in the photocopier and we do...

318
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
We put the lime in the coconut.

319
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,500
We do a funny thing.

320
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,160
We mix it all together.

321
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,560
We move it all around.

322
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,520
The Bob head, it looks all distorted and weird and everything.

323
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,660
Put the Bob head on a condom.

324
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,080
We've done that, too, actually.

325
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,440
And a Connie, also.

326
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,360
Isn't that correct, Reverend Stey?

327
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:45,900
Those have been removed from my catalog because the manufacturers won't answer my questions about royalties.

328
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

329
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,060
Well, I don't mean to give misleading information.

330
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,860
So that particular company is not to be trusted.

331
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,480
For legal purposes, I won't say their name.

332
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,000
Hmm.

333
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,720
Okay.

334
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,020
If it knocks any publicity.

335
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,300
I've been observing this subject, Dr. Howell, for several years on and off now.

336
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:18,120
He tends to doodle and fiddle with a pen on the paper tape.

337
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,460
So frequently that I...

338
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,960
Something is happening in the motorcade.

339
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,140
It's hard to imagine any number of...

340
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,480
...shaffers being enough for Dr. Howell.

341
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Too much is always better than not enough, Bob famously said.

342
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,640
We teach in the church.

343
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,580
You know, Bob wasn't always firing on all cylinders.

344
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,980
It sounds good.

345
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,000
It sounds good.

346
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,100
But actually...

347
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,500
That's what counts in this cult business.

348
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,680
Yes, it does.

349
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,140
But theologically...

350
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,420
Something sounds fishy to me.

351
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,320
It is questionable.

352
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,620
I agree with you.

353
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,280
It smells fishy and sounds funny.

354
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,260
I agree with you.

355
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,280
It's like Coney Island whitefish from the other conversation.

356
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,740
Exactly.

357
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,880
Coney Island whitefish...

358
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,280
It doesn't pass the field test.

359
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:07,460
Well, the problem is, you see, that it is the nature of evil to take a good thing and to distort it in size until it becomes an evil thing.

360
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,720
And that would be what too much is always better than not enough might lead to.

361
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,640
This is flipping me out.

362
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:13,940
I know.

363
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,060
It's a terrible thing.

364
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,700
A terrible thing.

365
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,140
This is static.

366
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,760
I can't tell where it is.

367
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,240
On the other hand...

368
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,760
Are your headphones?

369
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,840
We are able to discuss...

370
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:23,980
We are able to discuss it.

371
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,280
Because we are originators here.

372
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:36,560
So if we need to alter our basic precepts or modify them in some way, we are the only ones qualified to do it.

373
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,660
Where was...

374
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,320
I wrote down the most wise thing.

375
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,520
What's this ticky-ticky thing?

376
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,380
My new fictional Shorterpersev said something on the show I saw tonight.

377
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,140
My hero, my new hero under Bob...

378
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,660
Oh, here it is.

379
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,740
Is...

380
00:18:52,740 --> 00:19:00,840
The great historical figure Al Swearengen, made popular by that old TV show called Deadwood.

381
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,920
Yes, I remember that old show.

382
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,980
Which I only just started seeing this week.

383
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,000
It's pretty good, isn't it?

384
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,180
Yeah, I've really been enjoying it.

385
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,880
But today, in today's episode, Al made the statement,

386
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,620
Announcing your plans is a good way to make God laugh.

387
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,100
Yeah, it's true.

388
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,000
So we can plan all we want.

389
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,120
I think you always tempt at your plans when you jinx them, potentially, if you talk too much about them.

390
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,200
Keep it close to the vest.

391
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,920
Announcing your plans is a good way to make Bob steal them.

392
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,740
Stank.

393
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,500
Well, there you go.

394
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,640
You see, the main point is, be discreet.

395
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,840
Keep it close to the vest.

396
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,460
Don't blab it to the whole world.

397
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,920
Because then everyone has to see how well you did.

398
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,020
And that's an added source of stress.

399
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,660
If you think about it, Bob already said this in a slightly different way when he said that

400
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,720
if you want to be thought of as a true...

401
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,540
truly original person, you have to be careful about who you plagiarize.

402
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,100
Right. Imitate the right people.

403
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,560
Right.

404
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,840
Plagiarize.

405
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,920
Conspiracy wants to take over.

406
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,180
Don't let another's work evade your eyes.

407
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,920
So don't shade your eyes.

408
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,040
Plagiarize.

409
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,780
Plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize.

410
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,760
Only be sure to call it research.

411
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:20,240
Now from the Rewardian point of view, achieving a goal is not nearly as important as conceiving it

412
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,820
and studying it.

413
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,700
And then patting yourself on the back of your head, saying,

414
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,960
look ahead of time and telling all your friends how great it is, what you're about to do.

415
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,740
And for the Rewardian that's enough.

416
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,280
You don't have to actually do the thing that you've announced.

417
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,840
You don't have to fulfill the plan.

418
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,460
That's—

419
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,400
You know you can.

420
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,020
You've already conceived of it...

421
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,940
...G. Gordon Gordon spoke of this.

422
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,360
He was Bob's rather ineffectual bodyguard

423
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,860
I've actually expounded on this from time to time.

424
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,560
In my private practice and in public.

425
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,060
As G. Gordon Gordon put it, you form the idea in your head.

426
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,020
You make a perfect picture.

427
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,160
You know exactly what you're going to do.

428
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,100
And then...

429
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,760
Paint a perfect word picture.

430
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,980
You blow it off.

431
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,980
You blow it all off.

432
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,100
Forget about it.

433
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,860
I've had my slack from it.

434
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,020
I don't need to do it.

435
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,080
I already know I can.

436
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,300
But not everyone is in that enviable catbird seat, Ivan.

437
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,000
Not everybody can be so serene.

438
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,160
The catbird seat.

439
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,360
No, one out of ten, generally, ends up an emergentile.

440
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,120
The opposite of the rewardian.

441
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,280
Those who only gain slack from ongoing emergencies.

442
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,080
And handling them.

443
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,940
Control freaks.

444
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,520
OCD crazy people.

445
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,360
OCD?

446
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,180
Those who actually run the church of the subgenius the next day and so forth.

447
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,440
It's opposite ends of a spectrum.

448
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,980
And actually it's a more...

449
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,220
More of a...

450
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,520
Of a...

451
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,400
A parabola.

452
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,500
Desperation is a great...

453
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,260
And it can swing.

454
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:04,160
Someone can be an emergentile and actually, by the end of their life, become a rewardian and vice versa.

455
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,280
You don't have to be one your entire life.

456
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,980
That's true.

457
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,740
But it's rare that people change.

458
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,700
It is rare.

459
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,400
Only under heavy acubating and reprogramming.

460
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,320
Under acubating, reprogramming, and extreme age application.

461
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,520
Truly, this...

462
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:21,980
A lot of people...

463
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:21,980


464
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,320
Makes me sad.

465
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,500
Makes a huge difference.

466
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,980
I thought it would be easier.

467
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,640
The more years, the greater the difference.

468
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,360
Somehow I thought it would get easier as we went along.

469
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,660
But instead, only another thicket of thorns and complications.

470
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,140
A tangle.

471
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,160
A mare's nest.

472
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,500
We will never be able to extricate ourselves.

473
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,420
But it's a different briar patch, Briar Hal.

474
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,860
Just don't throw me in there.

475
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,820
Yeah, that's what they all say.

476
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,840
Don't throw me in that briar...

477
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,100
Oh, Jesus.

478
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,340
Don't throw me in...

479
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,560
Oh, go ahead and throw me in Christian hell.

480
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,400
Please, please.

481
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,080
Anything but subgenius hell.

482
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,400
Throw me in that Christian hell, won't you please?

483
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,560
It'd be so nice compared to subgenius...

484
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,940
His name does not appear in the Book of Life.

485
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,660
Cast him into subgenius hell.

486
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,540
Praise God!

487
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,220
Oh, how sad.

488
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,100
Indeed.

489
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,540
Well, you know...

490
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,400
No, because the subgenius hell is better than the Christian heaven,

491
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,820
as has been said 800 times.

492
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,320
800 million times.

493
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,960
But maybe not this decade.

494
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,620
Let us enjoy life.

495
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,360
And here in the before life, we can do that.

496
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,340
Before we have to go through that straight and narrow gate

497
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,540
made of adamantium before the beginning of the universe.

498
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,520
You know that one, right?

499
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,780
Straight is the gate and narrow is the path that leadeth unto heaven.

500
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,740
Wide is the gate.

501
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,600
And...

502
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,060
Short is the path that leadeth unto this truth.

503
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,140
And short and fat are the adherents of God.

504
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,800
Bald is the head.

505
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,460
And warty is the nose.

506
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,420
And smelly...

507
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,200
A path to knowledge.

508
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,020
Smelly is the pants.

509
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,800
Or we could say, many are called and few...

510
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,240
But few are chosen.

511
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,420
Yes, exactly.

512
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,220
Just as the salmon waste so many eggs in the stream during spawning,

513
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,260
only a few will become little fishies,

514
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,740
which in turn will be snapped up by eager predators.

515
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,000
Of the fluid medium.

516
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,600
Until finally, you only have one or two to reach your table

517
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,440
for a delicious dish.

518
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,820
Because you know I am a member of PETA,

519
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,540
People Eating Them Animals.

520
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,720
I thought it was people eating tasty animals.

521
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,960
Well, of course, one wants to eat the tasty ones,

522
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,420
but there are gluttons for punishment.

523
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,440
I, um...

524
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,900
I managed to...

525
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,180
Speaking of gluttons for punishment,

526
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,080
I managed to get a sperm cell to an egg twice.

527
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,520
In your evil experiments?

528
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,520
Oh, I see.

529
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,080
And one of the results then reproduced again.

530
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,720
So there are multiple little stanging things out there now.

531
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,540
That's grandfather.

532
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,780
Yeah, I'm a grandpa.

533
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,780
He's your own grandpa.

534
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,500
People make fun of me because...

535
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,080
Not I.

536
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,700
Of a thing...

537
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,980
I shall eternally envy you.

538
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,800
That I don't have.

539
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,520
I have no progeny.

540
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,060
And I can say, oh, you're so wrong.

541
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,960
No grandchildren.

542
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,840
Or even not-so-grandchildren.

543
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,660
I've got seven of them things, if you count those little boys.

544
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,420
Well, you've done your duty by the species.

545
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,180
You've done your duty by the species,

546
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,900
and there's no error on it.

547
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,380
It's Bob said, make more little yetis.

548
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,400
And you know what that means, kids.

549
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,220
Yetis right once again.

550
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,620
You've got to...

551
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,720
There's only one way to have more little yetis,

552
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,580
and that's to reproduce.

553
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,180
There's only one way to reproduce,

554
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,120
and I think we know what that is.

555
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,580
That is...

556
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,720
Multiplication and long division.

557
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,820
There you go.

558
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,600
And...

559
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,300
Addition.

560
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,040
Distraction and uglification.

561
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,140
You know, I've been staying...

562
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,020
And fission.

563
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,500
Fission, yes, that's my way.

564
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,180
Budding.

565
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,560
Budding into other people's business.

566
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,580
I'm trying to remember the name for animal fuels that reproduce.

567
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,200
They can all be females.

568
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,600
And...

569
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,420
Parthenogenesis.

570
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,160
Yeah, parth... that's it.

571
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,240
Parthenogenesis.

572
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,760
I...

573
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,560
Parthenogenesis.

574
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,400
Parthenogenesis.

575
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,760
That one scares me.

576
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,920
It does, because it makes the male sex completely irrelevant.

577
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,980
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,360
At one point I mentioned...

579
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,740
But there are parth...

580
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,500
The examples of parthenogenesis, that it does occur between males.

581
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,940
No, it doesn't.

582
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,120
Philo's just trying to give us some help,

583
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,020
but I'm not as kindly as he is.

584
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,420
I'll find that example. I remember it.

585
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,160
He's trying to...

586
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,620
But so what?

587
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,840
The male cannot give birth to the offspring.

588
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,200
Whatever they do...

589
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,160
No, in this case, the male can,

590
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,780
and they switch back and forth

591
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,180
and display hermaphroditic properties when necessary.

592
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,900
That's how them dinosaurs got off of Jurassic Park.

593
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,680
Um...

594
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,180
The problem is that in the condition of parthenogenesis,

595
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,480
no male offspring can be created.

596
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,660
The only offspring are females.

597
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,900
You knew that, right?

598
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,220
Right.

599
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,380
But...

600
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,600
What about when an amoeba spawns?

601
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:18,920
What about when a female splits?

602
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,640
Which one is the female and which one is the male then?

603
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,120
They don't have sex, exactly.

604
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,000
Amoebas are immortal, Philo.

605
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,160
They never die.

606
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,840
One little-known fact about amoebas, though,

607
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,140
is that there are many kinds of amoebas.

608
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,160
Even Tommy Amoeba...

609
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,780
Tommy Amoeba.

610
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,520
I just...

611
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,200
He thought that the Proteus amoeba was...

612
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,320
You know, the classic one that you think of,

613
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,940
is the only kind of amoeba.

614
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,200
But no, there are shelled amoebas,

615
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,700
there are brain-eating amoebas...

616
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,600
You know, just a week ago...

617
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,220
A week ago, I was standing right next to Tommy Amoeba,

618
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,680
the lowest form of life.

619
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,360
Praise Tommy Amoeba.

620
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,880
Because he was down there in Santa Ana...

621
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,620
Hail the Amoeba.

622
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,040
...for the opening of the Cacophony Society movie,

623
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,120
Into the Zone.

624
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,240
And I had to sit in that movie theater

625
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,520
and look at the screen as, 40 feet high,

626
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,700
my oozing fatness bulged forth from the screen.

627
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,120
And it wasn't even in 3D, but it sure looked as if it did.

628
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,840
My God, it's awful.

629
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,180
They used to see themselves on TV.

630
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,420
But in a movie, it's even worse.

631
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,760
It's huge, huge.

632
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:29,900
And it's truly said that the camera adds weight to you.

633
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,880
But in my case, that was already a done deal.

634
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,200
But that was back in a time when you were

635
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,840
carrying a little more weight than you do now, Dr. Howe.

636
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,980
It is true, but the movie will outlive me.

637
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,360
And so that's the way I'll look in eternity, don't you see?

638
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,820
That music is hurting my ears.

639
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,840
I'm terribly sorry, Ivan.

640
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,340
But let's see if we can get...

641
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,300
Just a little too...

642
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,580
I'm very sensitive, you know.

643
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,300
Let's try a different one.

644
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,640
It sounds pretty new-agey, man.

645
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,480
How about this, old fella?

646
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,660
Yes, we can't have a sage be dissatisfied

647
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,640
with the musical content of our program,

648
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,660
and so we're ready at any time...

649
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,940
Oh, the music was fine.

650
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,760
I just couldn't hear you over it because of that good enough...

651
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,320
Oh, I could have trained to switch.

652
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:17,800
That's fine.

653
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,780
That's the thing that lives in my ear.

654
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,920
You got any Cthulhu music in there?

655
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,360
How about...

656
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,240
That pipe in my ear...

657
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,040
What music, Fyler?

658
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,640
Some Cthulhu music in there?

659
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,520
I was playing that.

660
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,500
Now we've got U.B. Blake.

661
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,140
Well, I'll be.

662
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,300
You be that?

663
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,060
U.B. Blake?

664
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,040
I wouldn't be Blake if I had...

665
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,640
Yes, I'll be Bob Dob on that one.

666
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,380
Gentlemen, this is probably music that Dobbs himself

667
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,640
listened to on his sales route,

668
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,720
because it is historically the all-American music.

669
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,800
And so that Indian music that you are listening to,

670
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,320
I whisked away,

671
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,580
and now we're listening to the raw stock of America.

672
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,000
You know, pre-Tin Pan Alley,

673
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,980
but absolutely red, white, and blue.

674
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,400
Yes, sir, gentlemen, that's what you're listening to,

675
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,760
all because Ivan Stang demanded it.

676
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,380
I insist upon only the music...

677
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,040
Ivan Stang!

678
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,980
My ears may go only where Bob's ears have already trod.

679
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,140
Ivan Stang!

680
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,840
I can only listen to music that Bob has already heard.

681
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,920
Ears may come...

682
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,960
I bet it's how dedicated you are.

683
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,420
And the ears may go...

684
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Ivan Stang!

685
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,360
But Ivan Stang goes on forever.

686
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,920
And I have to hear everything he ever heard,

687
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,460
and that's really getting to you.

688
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,100
He had terrible taste.

689
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,080
Ivan Stang!

690
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,340
Stang relics...

691
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,480
And he's still listening to crap, too.

692
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,040
Pogo sticks?

693
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,740
Does Stang ever exercise on a pogo stick,

694
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,780
I believe is the question.

695
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,840
What about that?

696
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,100
Do we all want to see you bouncing up and down?

697
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,020
No, I exercise on...

698
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,920
I did that on a Wii.

699
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,920
Ah, that's much better.

700
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,980
W-I-I, the Wii game.

701
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,900
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant...

702
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,300
Oh, well.

703
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,440
Well, you could...

704
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,740
Either way, but we did get one of those.

705
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,360
We did?

706
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,800
Yes, we got a Wii.

707
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,540
Well, when you gotta go, you gotta go.

708
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,520
You can virtually pogo on a Wii.

709
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,600
The game, not the princess.

710
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,120
Go-go and pogo.

711
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,700
Or you could go on the princess, too.

712
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Go on the...

713
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,280
Oh, dear.

714
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,240
Ivan, Ivan.

715
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,580
Oh, my God.

716
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,640
My dear fellow, here, let me...

717
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,660
Oh, my God, that plague has come back.

718
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,420
The plague.

719
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,380
I was on the way out here three months ago.

720
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,060
I started coughing, and I coughed for three weeks.

721
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,140
It's not the cough that carries you off.

722
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,620
It's the coffin that they carry you off in.

723
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,080
Every subgenius I've met got the cough.

724
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,180
I have it, since you insist on mentioning it.

725
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,320
Yes, I was coughing.

726
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,240
I was coughing up sputum earlier, my dear fellow.

727
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,560
Yeah, you got it.

728
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,840
I got it, and I got it bad.

729
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,760
It's been around here before I got here, though.

730
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,760
And furthermore, I have a theory about it.

731
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,720
A theory that would freeze your young blood.

732
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,780
Freeze it in your soul.

733
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,840
Make your two eyes start from their spheres, and each particular hair to stand on end.

734
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,000
That Bob music is too loud.

735
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,460
Oh, there, all right, I'll turn that down, too.

736
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,040
It's just way too loud.

737
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,900
You know, you just don't like anything we got here.

738
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,400
No, no, it's just too loud.

739
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,740
We got chocolate, we got vanilla, we got strawberry.

740
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,800
It's too loud in the mix.

741
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,820
How do I get it across?

742
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,380
Here, here's one you're sure to enjoy.

743
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:17,900
How can I explain?

744
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,120
It's the volume, it's not the content.

745
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,740
I can't even hear the content.

746
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,800
I don't know what's going on.

747
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,500
No, thank you.

748
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,200
No dogs allowed in the studio.

749
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,220
So, they call you Zero Boy, right?

750
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,000
They sure do.

751
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,020
Oh, not me, him.

752
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,560
Yeah.

753
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,140
Yes.

754
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,160
Because we have Zero Boy here in the studio with us right now.

755
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,320
Zero, you are...

756
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:43,980
You're listening.

757
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,120
Shall I turn the music down?

758
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,840
Maybe I should.

759
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:58,340
Let's let that earlier age recede into the endless confusion of parties of history, into

760
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,920
a labyrinth of banners, shields, and meaningless escutcheons.

761
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,280
Because who needs music when you have Zero Boy?

762
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,340
Now, didn't I hear of a guy named Zero Man?

763
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,560
Isn't there a Zero Man?

764
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,800
Don't interrupt him when he's in the middle of one of his episodes.

765
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,360
His fumes.

766
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,780
Who's gonna talk some gang abi?

767
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,920
Not today.

768
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,480
What the hell just happened?

769
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,420
Who good.

770
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,940
It used to be like the—

771
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:42,900
I'm dead, I'm dead.

772
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,580
Agent 44, you report.

773
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,540
Yes, after speaking with the doctor, what's the name?

774
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,520
Here's the paper.

775
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,400
Dr. Robbins, we got a report.

776
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,020
Here, let me just play the tape.

777
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,140
Dr. Robbins, can you please confirm your data?

778
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,380
Well, you know, I don't have it all available.

779
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,540
I'm at the mercy of cyber attacks.

780
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:23,480
When you say cyber attacks, sir, do you mean attacks on computer-animated organisms?

781
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,000
They are some sort of virtual ants, yes, I believe.

782
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:35,460
Well, sir, I'd like to know then, how many of these creatures are living amongst humans?

783
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,600
A little gravy here for the colonel.

784
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,660
Well, I don't really know, but they are a problem.

785
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,360
You know, these are...

786
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,080
Argentine army ants.

787
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,840
They have vast colonies, larger than states, and they vote, too.

788
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,320
But we're going to do what we can to purify this once great land of ours,

789
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,980
so arthropods will only be a gleam in some fictioneer's eye.

790
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,220
There down below.

791
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,500
Doctor, you see that?

792
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,320
Yes, can you hit them from here?

793
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,200
I think so. Hold on, we're going to load.

794
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,740
Oh, boy, this is great, folks.

795
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:19,140
Munition type, sir, we were told by the commander to give you any options that you need on munition.

796
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,040
I want you to use your best judgment, lads, and just have at them.

797
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,500
How about a mix of some thermonuke and a little bit of gas?

798
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,520
Throw in a little Bordeaux mixture, and I'm your man.

799
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,940
All right, load her up.

800
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,960
Meanwhile, down below.

801
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,100
Oh.

802
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,380
Oh.

803
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,520
Oh.

804
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,400
Oh.

805
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,020
Oh.

806
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,440
Oh.

807
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,280
Oh.

808
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


809
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


810
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


811
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


812
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


813
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


814
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


815
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


816
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


817
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


818
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


819
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


820
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


821
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,280


822
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,300
Oh.

823
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,040
No!

824
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,740
No!

825
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,480
Look at all those ants!

826
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,920
Disgusting.

827
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,520
Revolting.

828
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Look at that helicopter.

829
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,980
It's here to rescue us.

830
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,720
Hell, a cop there.

831
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,080
Fire.

832
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,100
Oh, that's terrible.

833
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,660
That's excessive overreaction.

834
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,140
Oh, that was...

835
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,400
Oh, my God.

836
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,560
You like that?

837
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,760
Actually, I'm still trying to process that last bit of information.

838
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:24,860
You know, here at the Pleasure Dome, we offer all types of pleasure for gentlemen like you.

839
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,940
And what would be the price range you're talking about?

840
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,420
Well, we've processed your credit card.

841
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,120
It seems like you can afford anything, doctor.

842
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,900
Okay, all right.

843
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,300
Now, see, I don't even have a credit card.

844
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,200
Your sources of information are wrong.

845
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,980
I wish your people would stop calling me.

846
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,460
You know, I sleep during the day.

847
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,780
So, how many of these calls have you gotten, Mr. Robbins?

848
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,100
Well, not any tonight.

849
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,840
I have a feeling we're at the virtue of busted telephonic equipment.

850
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,720
All right, if you can just give us once again your telephone number, please.

851
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,480
That's E-I-R-O-R-E-E-R-O.

852
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,620
It was R-E-R-O.

853
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,580
R-E-R-O.

854
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,020
Okay.

855
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,560
Why do you need the address?

856
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,760
You just need a number.

857
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,300
You don't want...

858
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,560
Well, hold on one second, sir.

859
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:18,900
I'm sorry.

860
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,800
I'm going to transfer you over to Billy.

861
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:21,960
Oh, good.

862
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,020
Yes, you got Billy.

863
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,560
What's up?

864
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
What happened, Dan?

865
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,200
Well, you would tell me.

866
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,700
I mean, they put you on...

867
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,740
All right.

868
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,100
First things first.

869
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,040
Give me your telephone number, please.

870
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,680
That's 9-6-5-6-5-9-9.

871
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,520
All right.

872
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,900
And date of birth, please.

873
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,880
Let me see.

874
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,220
The birthplace was Lebanon, Indiana.

875
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Last four digits of your cell security number.

876
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,340
2-9-4-7.

877
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,100
And your date of birth, please.

878
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
That was...

879
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,640
Last four digits of your cell security number.

880
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,840
2-9-4-7.

881
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,500
Your date of birth.

882
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:00,920
Please.

883
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,040
4-9-

884
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,740
Last four digits of your cell security number.

885
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,400
2-9-4-7.

886
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:05,900
Date of birth, please.

887
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,840
4-7.

888
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,440
Last four digits of your cell security number.

889
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,180
2-9-4-6.

890
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,620
Yes.

891
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,320
I first met him.

892
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,820
I was sent by the police to go to the bar.

893
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,840
And I was told to look for him.

894
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,560
It was really obvious what he looked like.

895
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,140
And he sidled up to me.

896
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,380
We ordered some drinks.

897
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,140
And then he took me home.

898
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,520
And for a specific amount of money.

899
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,320
How much was you offered?

900
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,120
How many times, my boy?

901
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,940
Well, 18 times.

902
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,800
But it was then that I found out that he was a Klingon.

903
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,260
I was a little surprised.

904
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,260
Was it the Klingon bath oil beads that gave him away?

905
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,520
Yeah, actually it was.

906
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,640
I thought it was a joke until I saw them.

907
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,400
And then at that point...

908
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,680
That's when I found out that he had been overruled by...

909
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,520
By Cylons.

910
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,980
Well, he could turn himself in at the Kardashian Embassy in Los Angeles.

911
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,780
Welcome to the Kardashian Embassy.

912
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,500
How can I help you, Mr. Robbins?

913
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,920
Well, I'm just a fan.

914
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,220
I'm actually from San Francisco.

915
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,040
You've probably heard of it.

916
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,620
But I just...

917
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,400
So are you here for...

918
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,040
I just like to be where they hang out.

919
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,540
And look at your setup.

920
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,620
Your layout.

921
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,380
It's beautiful.

922
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,120
You know, I really feel I am in the city.

923
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,680
I'm going to give you...

924
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:30,680


925
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,360
I'm going to give you 14.2 Drekons to get the hell out of my office.

926
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,140
Boop.

927
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,080
All right.

928
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:43,740
So the first thing I'd like to bring up is that when we install the chip,

929
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,240
what will happen is we'll be able to monitor any and all medical functions occurring in your body.

930
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,640
And the chip in itself will store...

931
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,900
That seems slightly...

932
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,260
All of your medical records.

933
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,280
No, no, no.

934
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,380
No.

935
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
That's so last century.

936
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,040
All right.

937
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,300
So as I was saying...

938
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,320
So how do they do it now?

939
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,880
Well, they inject it.

940
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,260
But now they have chip mods.

941
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,640
And so now you can get them larger.

942
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,340
Simon, Theodore, and Alvin.

943
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,000
Yes.

944
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,160
Chip mods.

945
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,540
That's obscene.

946
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,500
But heard.

947
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,480
Well...

948
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,900
I'm going to hurl.

949
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,300
Hey, Hal.

950
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,280
What?

951
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,240
What time is it?

952
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,680
I don't know.

953
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,460
But there's some sort of huge...

954
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,740
It's bigger than a freaking crocodile.

955
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,160
Maybe you can see it's got weird long nose.

956
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,580
It's got a lot of teeth.

957
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,080
And it just...

958
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,120
Swallowed that...

959
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,120
That other creature that was following us for days.

960
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,380
Again...

961
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,960
What the hell is that thing, man?

962
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,960
Well, they call it a...

963
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,440
Sarcosuchus.

964
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,920
What the...

965
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,880
I'll tell you.

966
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,300
Psychosuchus out there.

967
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,900
Scares the hell out of me.

968
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,740
Sarco as in...

969
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,760
Of death and the dead.

970
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,800
In other words, a carrion eating gigantic crocodile.

971
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,280
Anything ending in sucus is a crocodile.

972
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,280
Wow.

973
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,480
It's amazing that you know that.

974
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,100
So at least...

975
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,400
At least you know when it eats you, you'll know what you're being eaten by.

976
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:41,400
The foul, cruel crocodile god, Seabek, who pulls you under when you're attempting to make your pilgrimage in the skyboat across the sky.

977
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,460
I think it was really cool.

978
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,860
And there's a bad hippopotamus in there, too.

979
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,100
That Mr. Desson, rest his soul, and he tasted wonderful.

980
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,780
That he was smart enough to take that shotgun and those 200 rounds.

981
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,240
But those were incredible special effects.

982
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,120
And I don't care who knows that I say so.

983
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,580
And I'll buy the next 100 rounds myself.

984
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,780
But would somebody hand me some liquor?

985
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,920
I know it's in here.

986
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,460
I want a bottle of booze in my hand.

987
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,780
I can't fuck it unless I'm pouring the rot shots down my yap.

988
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,080
It's a...

989
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:24,880
I prefer the light to the dark.

990
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,300
I know I have no taste.

991
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,260
I'm...

992
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:27,480
What?

993
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,620
Oh, there you go.

994
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,260
Bush Bavarian beer.

995
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,060
Oh, what a horrible thing to drink.

996
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,460
Yeah, I said Bush Bavarian beer.

997
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,060
Bush!

998
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,240
When you drink it, your breath will stink.

999
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,540
Bush!

1000
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,120
That's a little bit better.

1001
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,520
My word, what peculiar tasting stuff this is.

1002
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,920
In fact, it is not beer at all, but hard cider.

1003
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:57,980
Very.

1004
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,920
Very.

1005
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:58,920


1006
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,120
You vomit.

1007
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,660
You vomit.

1008
00:42:59,660 --> 00:42:59,660


1009
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,860
I'm an old sugar-challenged fellow.

1010
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,700
Well, you heard Zero Boy.

1011
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,260
Did you hear that?

1012
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:05,920
It's 1103.

1013
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,020
All you yokels.

1014
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:08,960
That's what we...

1015
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,600
That was amazing.

1016
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,940
He's going to be...

1017
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,320
I looked over to the side.

1018
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,800
I thought I was hearing a mechanical tape.

1019
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:24,640
And he will be performing tomorrow at the Ask Dr. Hal show at Veracocha, 998 Valencia Street.

1020
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,800
And there's that syncopated clock again.

1021
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,860
Yes, the ticking, the talking.

1022
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,640
The time of the show.

1023
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:36,000
It struck 24 when he entered at the door with a beautiful, blooming bride.

1024
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,820
But it stopped short, never to go again.

1025
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,740
When the old man died, wasn't it?

1026
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,900
When the old man died, right.

1027
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:51,380
How sad that someone had to die just to make that clock stop beating and ticking and pounding and pounding.

1028
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:51,920
It did stop.

1029
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,320
It stopped.

1030
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,780
Killing and killing.

1031
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,440
Well, um.

1032
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,300
Causing pain.

1033
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,940
Pain.

1034
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,560
Pain without gain.

1035
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,440
You, sir.

1036
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,440
You, sir.

1037
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:03,900
Yes.

1038
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,180
I was wondering, sir.

1039
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,560
Why, yes.

1040
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,920
The meaning of life.

1041
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,520
What is the meaning of life, really?

1042
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:22,560
Consider the noosphere, the realm of things known, and the physical universe itself as we understand it on our plane

1043
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,680
and together with a number of possible shifting universes.

1044
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,500
This is a characteristic of it.

1045
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,840
With the productions of energy come an organization of matter, a complexity.

1046
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:43,920
What is the end of this complexity except an organized intelligence, such as we already know that we ourselves possess?

1047
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:51,920
If the universe, then, may be viewed as an oblong, something like a peanut in shape, a peanut with a shell on, that is,

1048
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,660
the entire purpose is for it to extend a pseudonym.

1049
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:08,480
The end of the universe is a self-knowledge, and this is the ultimate knowledge of everything.

1050
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,600
You can give a dollar to Miss Phelps.

1051
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,320
At least that's what the humans say.

1052
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,340
Well, you have the alien philosophy at hand, at your elbow?

1053
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,920
Not readily dispensable here.

1054
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,980
I however do.

1055
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,600
Wait one moment.

1056
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,500
Just as fish.

1057
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,700
Believe God is a giant fish, you know, these aliens have their own...

1058
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,940
What about the fish? That's what about... you can't speak for the fish.

1059
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,100
I can speak for the aliens from their own tongue.

1060
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,320
I can and will speak for the fish, but first let's hear from those critters from far from here.

1061
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:48,220
Lark Torsh, brought forth by the Star of Krall, was then leader.

1062
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:54,880
Therefore give up all thy rights, because Lark Torsh, in the fourteenth dimension...

1063
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,160
Henceforward.

1064
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,380
Well, we read that...

1065
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,480
That's a good point. He makes a very, very good point there.

1066
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:10,060
Motion was tabled by the chair and sent to the floor for review, but the bench, well, it was terrible.

1067
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,520
Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.

1068
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:19,320
Well, let's relax, because we're among friends here and have some more of this delicious tropical brew.

1069
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,600
Darmok with arms held high.

1070
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:29,780
What happened to Reverend Stang? Did we drive him out of our paradise with the flaming sword?

1071
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:36,300
The terrible whirling sword and the cherubim set before the... oh!

1072
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:48,260
And they say their pleasant goodbyes and fade off into the sunset.

1073
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:51,900
Farewell.

1074
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,580
Farewell.

1075
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:52,580


1076
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:52,860
Farewell.

1077
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,500
The train.

1078
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,420
Come again.

1079
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,860
The train car. Something like one.

1080
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,660
But this I tell you, he's our wedding guest.

1081
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,900
Alien transport, vessel obviously, disguised to look like a three-car.

1082
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,460
He prayeth best, who loveth best, both man and bird and beast.

1083
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,040
Ah, birds and the beasts.

1084
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:21,520
He prayeth best, who loveth best, all creatures, great and small. For the dear god who loveth us, he made and loveth all.

1085
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,540
Now drink your coconut juice.

1086
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,000
In fact, I'm going to have some.

1087
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:31,940
That's fresh.

1088
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,780
Incredible.

1089
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,340
Is there any truth that coconut juice is good for you?

1090
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,860
That's what everyone believes around here.

1091
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,800
I am dying for her.

1092
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,200
My heart is...

1093
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,140
There's certainly something appealing about it.

1094
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,200
I'll take it in a cup.

1095
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,240
Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.

1096
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,000
Very bold, very bold, it will be better.

1097
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,180
Uh, is that a challenge to the people of Earth?

1098
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,840
It certainly is.

1099
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,760
Those ETs don't know when they're well off, which is when in their own bailiwick.

1100
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:28,560
Humans are destructive creatures. They mess with us at their peril.

1101
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,000
Timba is arms wide.

1102
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,360
I'll tell you who will prevail in the struggle between eight aliens.

1103
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,900
Whoever's basic planetary setup has more energy in it.

1104
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,980
The more energetic beings will prevail.

1105
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,940
Well, I was wondering...

1106
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,020
It's a simple matter of mechanical energy, not anything more.

1107
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,760
What kind of mechanical energy are we talking about?

1108
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,280
We're talking about the kind of energy that is kinetic.

1109
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,320
We're talking about a static energy.

1110
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:11,600
Ultimately, when talking about any planetary system, it's the star that is responsible.

1111
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:17,460
And as you know, not all are created equal.

1112
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,120
You mean stars? You mean stars, Dr. Howe?

1113
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,420
Yes, like our star. Our star that you can see from afar. Yes, indeed.

1114
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,940
I'm sorry, I must have been doing that. Excuse me.

1115
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,080
Our star, the sun, the center of the heating system.

1116
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,600
You know, without old...

1117
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,760
Without old Sol, none of this would be possible.

1118
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:52,380
And though not willing in particular to subscribe to the heresy of the monotheistic pharaoh Akhenaten,

1119
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,640
I still think the sun is a pretty important thing.

1120
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,340
Well, all our energy that we're able to put out, we get from it.

1121
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:10,560
If you come from a system with a star that is weaker, you will be proportionately weaker, atomically, structurally, in every way.

1122
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,400
Unable to put out the amount of energy that old fat Earth people can.

1123
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,240
It wears me out just thinking about it, Dr. Howe.

1124
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:27,600
But that's because we know that as we are superior to those other planets in our forms of energy...

1125
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,920
I'm feeling like Reverend Stang.

1126
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:34,500
There are others who are vastly above us in such a regard.

1127
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,820
He's got old gimpy leg coming in here, knocking the microphones around.

1128
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,520
Oh, it's all special effects, ladies and gentlemen.

1129
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,880
I've often...

1130
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,780
It's all programmed to sound that way. It came on the tape.

1131
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,680
Well, um, if you say so, sure, certainly.

1132
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,280
Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.

1133
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,700
Yeah, but they're really...

1134
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,680
Darmok with arms open wide.

1135
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,360
Well, I'm quite chuffed that Cormac left me all these, uh,

1136
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,700
great CDs of, uh, archaic music and so on, like the kind I play on the show.

1137
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,420
I admit it.

1138
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,580
Uh, you know, I, uh, am not following in the footsteps of Robo DJ here.

1139
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,320
You can hear that all the time on the show.

1140
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,260
But now I play these peculiar ditties.

1141
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,160
What are you following in the footsteps of?

1142
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:33,420
In the footsteps of giants, because, uh, I slipped off the shoulders of the giant.

1143
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,460
No, I...

1144
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,340
I have a statement.

1145
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,580
Giant steps. Now, I remember that sound.

1146
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,640
I have a statement.

1147
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,780
I left my seven-league boots at home. And now, Reverend Stang.

1148
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,220
I have excremated, uh, uh, excremeditated on this.

1149
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,960
Did you pyroflagellate?

1150
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,240
When you were at your devotion.

1151
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,260
Did you pyroflagellate in there?

1152
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,820
What's excremate? What does that mean?

1153
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,340
I think that's a...

1154
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,600
What does excremate mean?

1155
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,960
That's an obvious flagellation.

1156
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,320
Anyway, anyway, the point is, I was...

1157
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,420
That's a bastardization.

1158
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,640
...possi...

1159
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,160
...michelatilatation.

1160
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,320
I was, uh, excremeditated.

1161
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,980
Bastardized word, if I ever...

1162
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,620
Now, now, boys.

1163
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,440
...with this wonderful magazine, Prehistoric Times.

1164
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,240
Yes, everyone should subscribe to the Prehistoric Times.

1165
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,340
I'm going to do that.

1166
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,080
I thought I might extract some radio out of...

1167
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,860
Oh, you'll love it. You'll absolutely love it.

1168
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:26,940
But, uh, but what I was going to say, the main result of my profound and thoughtful extra meditation was to...

1169
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,260
Yes?

1170
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:27,600
Bastard!

1171
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,840
What I just heard you two guys do just blew my mind.

1172
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,180
Oh, look at Philo dance to that, uh, we don't need it.

1173
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,400
...Bulgarian music. That's...

1174
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,320
That's...

1175
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,120
...a little light on his feet.

1176
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:44,220
It really brings out the, the, kind of like the, the European racial heritage in me, this music.

1177
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,740
And me too, Philo.

1178
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,400
Finding myself...

1179
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,460
I have some, uh, connection to those, uh, Mediterranean countries.

1180
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,120
...strange convulsion to dance.

1181
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:51,620
...to dance.

1182
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,440
Actually, the first time I heard Irish, uh...

1183
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:55,520
I feel the age to dance.

1184
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,620
...through my mother's side of family.

1185
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,320
...folk music, I, I was riveted.

1186
00:52:59,260 --> 00:52:59,980
I feel the age to dance.

1187
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,100
Oh my God, I've heard this before.

1188
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,340
No, no, no. But let's, on the other hand, keep it intense.

1189
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,020
Let us dance.

1190
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,920
Let us dance in that chair.

1191
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:08,920


1192
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,180
And that time I heard the end of folk music, I thought, I've heard this before.

1193
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:17,960
There goes Philo with the vine leaves in his hair, throwing his head back, uh...

1194
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,360
Whoa!

1195
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:22,000
...my God, what a lusty vigor he has for life.

1196
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,380
He learned that dance from the priestesses in Atlantis.

1197
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,500
And man can they cut a rug.

1198
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,540
Ah, yes.

1199
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,900
Ah, Philo, spinning and twirling.

1200
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,500
It is incredible, is it not?

1201
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,300
One lock's blowing in the wind from his mustache.

1202
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:35,540
Ah, yes.

1203
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,120
Mustache.

1204
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1205
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,180
Such exuberance.

1206
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,640
I learned this in Willing Dermish class.

1207
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:41,780
...the women of Dermish class.

1208
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,420
Oh, yes.

1209
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:44,820
Ah.

1210
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,380
Oh, I'm getting a little sweaty here.

1211
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,980
I'm gonna slow down a bit.

1212
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,080


1213
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,360
No, you're drumming.

1214
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,120
No, the sweat is flying off of me like rainwater.

1215
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,860
Now sit over there.

1216
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,580
Thank you.

1217
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,920
I'm completely soaked now.

1218
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,620
Well, here, uh, let's, uh, dry you off.

1219
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,560
Give a towel, Dr. Howell.

1220
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,180
Don't put on any Irish folk music or I'll be dead.

1221
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,280
Well, and...

1222
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,860
I'll be jigging around licking your little leprechaun.

1223
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,240
Oh, well, that was another...

1224
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,600
Tis like a drop of dew.

1225
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,700
No more lucky charms.

1226
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,480
No more Irish, no more lucky charms.

1227
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,020
It is just Irish laughter.

1228
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,080
Yeah, no more lucky charms.

1229
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,680
My lucky charms up the wazoo.

1230
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,660
They're magically delicious.

1231
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:20,940
But...

1232
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,240
They're always after me, lucky eyes.

1233
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,040
We can't still talk about monsters, right?

1234
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,760
Green intestines.

1235
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,580
Can we resend...

1236
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,260
Yellow livers.

1237
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,080
Can we resend that rule about the lucky charms?

1238
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:28,540
Pink hearts.

1239
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,100
Oh, what the fuck?

1240
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:31,520
Is this for tonight?

1241
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,080
What the...

1242
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:32,880
What the...

1243
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,920
Can we do it just for tonight?

1244
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,260
Five minutes.

1245
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,260
For five minutes, okay.

1246
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:35,260


1247
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:35,260


1248
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:35,260


1249
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,420
We're gonna resend the lucky charms rule for the next five minutes.

1250
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,780
Well, I suppose we can do that.

1251
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:46,360
I don't know why it's so wonderful to riff on that stupid commercial.

1252
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,080
Ah, yes.

1253
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,740
Pink clovers.

1254
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,360
Yes, we were just there.

1255
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:50,380


1256
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,480
Just there, a moment ago.

1257
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,300
Pink hearts.

1258
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,060
Flaming meteors.

1259
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,880
Okay, yes.

1260
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:56,500
Flaming...

1261
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,320
Get your hands off my lucky charms.

1262
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,480
Flaming asteroids.

1263
00:54:59,720 --> 00:54:59,720


1264
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,360
Dwarf stars.

1265
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,240
Get your stinking paws off my lucky charms.

1266
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:05,240


1267
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,400
Black holes.

1268
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:07,660
Nebunas.

1269
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,120
Proto-sun fields.

1270
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,820
Black holes.

1271
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,340
Green boogers.

1272
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,100
Red suns.

1273
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,140
Yellow suns.

1274
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,040
Blue suns.

1275
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,180
Kryptonian suns.

1276
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:20,240
Negative space.

1277
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,180
Oh, my God.

1278
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,020
Dark anti-matter galaxies.

1279
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,380
They could put you on a...

1280
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,460
Quit playing with that door, would you?

1281
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,800
Crawling forms of things unknown.

1282
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,180
Why do they always call me?

1283
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,540
Does no one...

1284
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,560
When you're on the show.

1285
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,100
They call you when you're on a show.

1286
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:33,360
Oh, it's the princess, please.

1287
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,240
Well, better talk to the princess.

1288
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,240


1289
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,240


1290
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,240


1291
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,240


1292
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,240


1293
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,460
Talk to her.

1294
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,040
Tell her we're all right.

1295
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,260
Princess Wee is on the other line.

1296
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,040
We're okay, folks.

1297
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:38,520
We're okay.

1298
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,420
I'm on the show.

1299
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,960
He's on the show, ladies and gentlemen.

1300
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,820
Well, uh...

1301
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,500
Um, the problem is you can't call into the show.

1302
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,180
No one can call into the show.

1303
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:49,300
You can try.

1304
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,180
The doors are locked.

1305
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:50,680
You can try.

1306
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,140
You can try.

1307
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,600
Or you could try, I suppose.

1308
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:53,640
What's that number?

1309
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,300
Well, let me give it to you.

1310
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,800
If you're ready, that's...

1311
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:58,480
No.

1312
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,280
We are...

1313
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,460
We are...

1314
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:01,600
We are...

1315
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,680
We are...

1316
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:02,680


1317
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,000
We are...

1318
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,180
We are...

1319
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,840
415 Area Code.

1320
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,640
Yes, call any time, day or night, if the spirit so moves you.

1321
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:16,680
There will always be a pastor here to receive your heart unto J.R.

1322
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,480
Bob Dobbs and his merciful mallet of miracles.

1323
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,820
Sir, can you bring on a miracle for me right now to shine in my dusty corner of life?

1324
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,760
Well, I'm not really in the best shape here, but I can try.

1325
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,760
I really hope you can help me out.

1326
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,940
Let me just rev up and work up a little...

1327
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,840
He needs a miracle.

1328
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,040
A miracle.

1329
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,840
Okay, how about levitation?

1330
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,560
You like that one?

1331
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,240
I see...

1332
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,380
No, as Leviticus said, no.

1333
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,600
Well, I...

1334
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,320
I need a miracle.

1335
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,500
I'm getting a call here.

1336
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:44,960
I need a miracle.

1337
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:44,960


1338
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,200
A miracle?

1339
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,940
What else you got?

1340
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:47,860
Water.

1341
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,440
Into wine.

1342
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,320
How about that?

1343
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:49,700
Nah.

1344
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,240
You can get wine cheap.

1345
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,880
Two bucks, Chuck.

1346
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,560
Let's see.

1347
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,160
And you can't paint it.

1348
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,640
It's really hard.

1349
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,340
You've got a fig tree I could wither or...

1350
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,380
Oh, no.

1351
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,800
How about straightening out this withered arm?

1352
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:04,820


1353
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:04,820


1354
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:04,820


1355
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:04,820


1356
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:04,820


1357
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:04,820


1358
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,080
This feller over here.

1359
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:06,420
Very good.

1360
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,280
Bring him up here.

1361
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:07,940
Okay, Pop.

1362
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:08,520
So...

1363
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,000
What's your name, old-timer?

1364
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,420
Now, how'd you get this withered arm?

1365
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,640
Fell into an international harvester?

1366
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,360
I'm trying to straighten it out for you here.

1367
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,600
Or was it the Grim Reaper?

1368
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,340
Yeah.

1369
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,080
All right.

1370
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,500
Lay it down there.

1371
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,800
I think it's in pain right now.

1372
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,620
Lay it right down there on the slab.

1373
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,080
Why don't you beat it with that hammer like you did last time?

1374
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,780
This is the hammer of righteousness.

1375
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,280
Now, just hold really still.

1376
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:34,740
This is the leg.

1377
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:34,820
The leg.

1378
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:34,820


1379
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:34,820


1380
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:34,820


1381
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:34,820


1382
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:34,820


1383
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:34,820


1384
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:34,820


1385
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:34,820


1386
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:34,820


1387
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,020
You're the leg out of mallets.

1388
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,780
And now.

1389
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,060
Look, see?

1390
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,420
Ye made whole again.

1391
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,060
Ye that were sundered, ye made whole again.

1392
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,940
I think a couple more times and you about got it, Dr. Howell.

1393
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:54,560
And notice the molecular feeling that happens every time.

1394
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:55,500
Yes, it's been...

1395
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,520
Miraculous harming.

1396
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:01,240
It's been softened down to just tenderized and ready for cooking.

1397
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,240
What you done for me, you made me better and whole again.

1398
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,800
Thank you so much.

1399
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:04,800


1400
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:04,800


1401
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:04,800


1402
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:04,800


1403
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:04,800


1404
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:04,800


1405
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:04,800


1406
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,740
Yes, now he's holy holy.

1407
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,000
Oh my gosh.

1408
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:13,600
I've never seen anything like that display of manly prowess that Dr. Howell demonstrated there.

1409
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,560
Well, thank you. Thank you, Larry.

1410
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,240
I think that young man, that old man, mercilessly, but he saved him.

1411
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:23,540
Saved him from his introspective demise.

1412
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,300
Saved him from the angels of his worst nature.

1413
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,920
The demons of his own mind.

1414
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,340
The demons that you see may be real.

1415
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:42,300
1-800-65-65-65 to get your special Dr. Howell Cures a Miracle.

1416
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:48,340
To get yours, listen to our broadcast later on.

1417
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:58,580
You are listening, in theory, to the hour slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1418
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:04,400
Although, unusually enough, this entire episode was part of a two-hour Ask Dr. Howell show

1419
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:04,780
on radio.

1420
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,120
Radio Valencia in early 2012.

1421
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,300
With special guests and their gusts.

1422
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,660
Dr. Philo Drummond.

1423
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,500
The man-machine called Zero Boy.

1424
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,580
And cartoonist Leslie Sternberg Alexander.

1425
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,960
For more about Dr. Howell, see AskDrHowell.com.

1426
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,880
The doctor being just a D-R.

1427
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,220
And for everything about the Church of the Subgenius.

1428
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,200
And I do mean everything.

1429
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,900
Archives. All of it.

1430
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,360
And our books that seem to be swiftly going out of print.

1431
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,640
You can see Subgenius.com.

1432
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,020
Praise Bob.

1433
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,240
And let there be slack.

1434
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,820
Oh, by the way, this music in the background is by Boron Nuzzle.

1435
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,360
Recorded live last X-Day 14.

1436
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,620
Praise Bob.

1437
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,820
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1438
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,660
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going.

1439
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,780
For another couple of weeks.

1440
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:10,180
And not just this show, but Subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1441
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,720
But if you truly love Bob.

1442
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,280
And want some of that slack back to rebound to you.

1443
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,200
You should go to Subgenius.com front page.

1444
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,700
Or especially the radio page.

1445
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,700
Or the catalog store pages.

1446
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,100
And help out financially as best you can.

1447
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:32,460
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty.

1448
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,760
And we don't want any subgeniuses to make a living.

1449
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,080
And we don't want to see your own situations worse.

1450
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,040
But some of you still have jobs.

1451
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,400
Even five bucks makes a big difference.

1452
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,960
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1453
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,320
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1454
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:57,160
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1455
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:02,620
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1456
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,680
P.O. Box.

1457
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:15,080
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1458
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:20,300
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
