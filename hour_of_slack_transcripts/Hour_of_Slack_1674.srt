1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,160
The

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,160


3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,160


4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,160


5
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,160


6
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,780
Yeah?

7
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,780
The numbers all go to

8
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,420
11, right across the board.

9
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,780
11, 11, 11...

10
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,660
Amps go up to 10.

11
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,140
Exactly.

12
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,820
You see, most blokes are gonna be playing at 10,

13
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,260
you're on 10 on your guitar,

14
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,660
where can you go from there?

15
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,400
Where?

16
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,540
The Self-Genius Power of Swagging!

17
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,240
Don't worry dear,

18
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,700
it's no worse than some happening.

19
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,240
Aye, but not much worse.

20
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,280
If only we could get inside that special car.

21
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,140
Come!

22
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,100
Come.

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,080
I will show you wonders you have never seen before.

24
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,360
Gee!

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,400
11.

26
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,520
I don't know whether I'm awake or dreaming,

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,060
my mind just won't accept.

28
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,500
But Albert,

29
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,520
what are you doing?

30
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:56,960
What's about Albert?

31
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,040
Uh, yes dear friends,

32
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,800
this is gonna be another one of those hours of slack

33
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,700
where I play somebody else's show.

34
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,840
This is the second hour of Time for the Show,

35
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,880
season one, episode 17.

36
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,380
It's a continuation of the one I ran last week,

37
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,320
because when I would normally be putting this show together,

38
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,160
I'm actually going to be in Portugal,

39
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,060
in the town of Porto,

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,860
to film

41
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,080
the old subgenius master, G. Gordon Gordon.

42
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,540
Master assassin, actually,

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:33,980
technically,

44
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,280
for that documentary movie.

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,340
And earlier today, in fact,

46
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,740
I met with the director in Temple, Texas,

47
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:48,920
and handed over six boxes of unthinkably valuable old subgenius videos

48
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,700
that no one has looked at in 30 years.

49
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,220
But it's the originals.

50
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,840
They'll actually be safer there than they will be.

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,580
They'll be in the Dobbs' shed over the summer.

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,960
We have to go back to Cleveland at the end of the month

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,100
and finish fixing up the house and get rid of it.

54
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,620
We have to sell the slacker mansion.

55
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,020
Anyway, while I was out on the road,

56
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,300
I stopped in Waco and visited the Waco Mammoth National Monument,

57
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,500
which is an ongoing dig with 65,000 year old mammoth bones,

58
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,780
sitting right there in the ground in front of you,

59
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,080
where you can see them being dug out.

60
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,740
There's probably hundreds more down there.

61
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,020
They've already extracted 24 of them.

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,760
They're extremely delicate.

63
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,740
They're not fossil bones.

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,100
They're actual bones.

65
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:48,060
And they've built this entire building around the dig that's climate controlled.

66
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,320
And it's an astounding sight if you're a fossil nerd.

67
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,480
Oh, it's so great.

68
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,760
Anyway, friends, for this week, it's another canned show,

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,280
but it's a great canned show.

70
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,240
Our hosts, Fid, Argus, and Pease,

71
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:15,760
continue with the horrible story about Fid's ill-fated date with the NASA lawyer.

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,400
Actually, it wasn't a date.

73
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,860
I don't know what you'd call it.

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,180
So, take it away.

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,860
Time for the show!

76
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,620
Oh, show.

77
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,740
It's always time for you, and it's never time for me.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
But that's what it is.

79
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,160
It's just reality, and we're going to have to deal with it.

80
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,440
It's time for the show.

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,020
It's an actual show.

82
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,340
And since it's hour two, and we're pretending to be professionals,

83
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,980
we're going to reset the show.

84
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,100
This is a two-hour podcast where every show,

85
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,400
we attempt to come up with the content for the next show.

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
And that's exactly...

87
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,360
And we've been failing on that.

88
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,120
We haven't been doing that.

89
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,220
No, this show's been super productive,

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,460
because we got this whole NASA lawyer Fid Chooley thing going.

91
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,080
I mean, there's got to be some comedy going on.

92
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,840
Did you not check your mimeograph?

93
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,900
My who?

94
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,320
Never mind.

95
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,180
What are we doing now?

96
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,180
You have to explain the joke.

97
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,400
It's always funnier when you explain the joke.

98
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,980
I was asking Pease if he had not gotten his mimeograph.

99
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,600
I did not get it.

100
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,720
So, there.

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,900
There's the joke.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,040
He didn't get it.

103
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,780
The joke being that I'm sending a mimeograph.

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,960
That's a good one, Argus.

105
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,280
That's funny.

106
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,140
It's a...

107
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,800
I'm done.

108
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,560
Well, this week's Penn Jillette.

109
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,220
We have two Penn Jillettes this week.

110
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,020
We have one of them right here in the studio.

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,180
Oh, we tricked him.

112
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,760
Do we?

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,260
We got him.

114
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,900
Although he can't hear, he is here but not here.

115
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,460
He's in our spirits.

116
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,020
Where is Reverend Couch Sloth?

117
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,820
Yeah, Couch Sloth, if you want to come on the show, just jump in the Hypercom and we'll

118
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,320
bring you in.

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,580
I didn't see him in the Cone of Silence.

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,040
Yeah, he's not there yet.

121
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,620
Nobody can just walk in to the Cone of Silence, Pease.

122
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,620
Reverend Avey did that one time.

123
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,140
Well, he had keys.

124
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,480
Well, we took them away though, right?

125
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,780
They are gone, yes.

126
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,880
He'll probably get them back soon.

127
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:22,880


128
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:22,880


129
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,100
He'll probably get them back someday.

130
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,900
If he wants them back, he could have them back.

131
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,140
He could have them back.

132
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,160
He's been punished enough.

133
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,960
So speaking of punishments, it's time for the Blind Eye.

134
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,700
Pease, you want to tell everybody how the Blind Eye works?

135
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,940
So the Blind Eye is a pretty simple concept.

136
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,140
We're not advocating or calling to action a terrorist organization.

137
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,160
But what we're saying is we're going to name some names.

138
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,860
And if something bad was to happen to those people between shows, then we would say, I'm

139
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:52,860


140
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,000
out.

141
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,980
We're turning a blind eye.

142
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,860
We're not helping you.

143
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,420
We don't care what those people did.

144
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,300
We're fine with it.

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,300
Now, if that person, if it happens after the next show, then no, it's back on.

146
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,020
That was bullshit.

147
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,040
You shouldn't have done that.

148
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,940
That's wrong of you.

149
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,940
Now, it's important you understand we're not targeting people.

150
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,520
I am.

151
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,740
We're saying if.

152
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,100
I'm targeting people.

153
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,840
If.

154
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
I know a lawyer.

155
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,600
From NASA.

156
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,760
From NASA.

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,520
She got mad at me when I told her I tried to sue the movie once.

158
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,080
How do you even buy that story?

159
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,940
If somebody came up to me and I was a drummer and said, oh, hi, by the way, my name's Sally.

160
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,860
I'm a lawyer from NASA.

161
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,640
I'll be like, oh, my name's Mary and I'm the queen of England.

162
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,940
Hi, my name's Pease.

163
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm a legally ordained minister in the church of the subgenius.

164
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,620
Well, same thing.

165
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,420
That's the truthful thing.

166
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm saying I don't believe this lady's a lawyer.

167
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,180
Which one is more outlandish?

168
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,860
Which, which, well.

169
00:06:50,900 --> 00:07:00,680
That drunko, the super thought showed up to the bar and she happens to have tie-ins that might actually be able to get us off this planet legally.

170
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,100
Remind the viewers what THOT, T-H-O-T stands for.

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,240
Oh, I have to do that?

172
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,740
I have to spell that?

173
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,060
Yeah, you legally have.

174
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,760
It's a live radio.

175
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,980
We did such a great segue into it.

176
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,660
Yeah, he was setting it up quite well, Fid.

177
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,320
I'm sorry, I didn't know we were on the Explain Every Joke show.

178
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,080
Yeah, Fid.

179
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,440
It's always funnier when somebody doesn't get the joke and then you have to explain it to them.

180
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,820
When you're scrolling Marquee tells me that I have to explain every joke, you know, you send me a mimeograph.

181
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,780
Or a spyrograph.

182
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Do you have a scrolling Marquee in front of you, Argus, or is it just Fid that has it?

183
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,000
We've got them all over the room.

184
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,000
They're just constantly scrolling with information, data, statistics.

185
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,600
That's where I got my blind eye today.

186
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,340
So really, there's no excuse.

187
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,460
There's no excuse not to look at the Marquee.

188
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,100
You can't miss them.

189
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,700
Right, so again, Fid.

190
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,580
We have a 40-foot screen in here that has the Discord chat.

191
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,020
Fid, can you step up this week, please?

192
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,480
I can't, but guess who can?

193
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,660
Reverend Couchsloth! I've just brought him into the cone of silence.

194
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,100
Hooray!

195
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,320
What up, Couchsloth?

196
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,860
Hey!

197
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,160
My G, Couchsloth.

198
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,440
So our guest has joined us.

199
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,700
How are your chakras, my G?

200
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,240
How would you like to greet our guest this week?

201
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, let Pease greet the guest, because Pease is really the most professional of us.

202
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,700
Obviously. He's the one getting all the offers to go and plug other people's shows.

203
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,740
Well, you can tell I'm not a professional, because when you asked Pease if he wanted to introduce the guest,

204
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,280
I just jumped right in and just reiterated what you said.

205
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,160
That is the most unprofessional thing that could possibly happen.

206
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,160
But Reverend Pease is about to make up for my, um...

207
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,360
So far.

208
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
My rady of sins.

209
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,580
Reverend Pease, get Couchsloth in here.

210
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,840
So, Dr. Reverend Pope Couchsloth, welcome to the show.

211
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,840
Well, thank you, Pease. It's nice to be back. It's been many, many weeks at this point.

212
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,620
Now, you were on the West Coast, right?

213
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
Yeah, that's right. I was bouncing around California.

214
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,140
Drinking?

215
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,580
Drinking them Zimas, throwing Skittles in them, blending with the news.

216
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,100
Found some beautiful, beautiful congealed little cubes of Frop.

217
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,720
Ate them all up.

218
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:30,500
Actually, I got to drop by what was going to be one of the last Ask Dr. Howell performances of the year.

219
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,820
Oh, yeah. I wish I could go catch one.

220
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,200
Did you get to see it? I heard it wasn't just of the year. I heard this is the last one.

221
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,540
I heard they're closing that place to Chez Polo.

222
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,140
Yeah, that's what Chicken John does.

223
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,140


224
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:50,720
I was saying. So, yeah, I was set the second to last one. It was the 420 performance, which was beautiful.

225
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,640
The Frop was being flung about the audience and Howell himself was in rare form.

226
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,240
So, let me ask you a little bit about that show, okay?

227
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,620
Because we've all seen Howell perform at X Day. A couple of us have seen him at Burning Man.

228
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,060
But this is really where you saw him. That's his home turf.

229
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,840
That's where he's developed his show over the decades.

230
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,140
That's where he's developed his show over the decades.

231
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,340
And this venue is really home base for him.

232
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:24,640
Was there a different vibe? Were you like, was he more majestic? More Howell-esque?

233
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,260
Well, I mean, you know, I've only ever seen him perform at Chez Polo.

234
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,640
I didn't even see him at the old Odeon where he used to perform.

235
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,280
But, yeah, I've been kind of going to the shows when I could since about 2009.

236
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,640
And, you know, it's always been at Chez Polo since then.

237
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,140
But, I mean, I will say his, you know, he's a great performer.

238
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,420
He had great gravitas at this last show.

239
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:53,660
And I happen to know that two or three questions from people that I knew got rolled into one massive omnibus question.

240
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,620
Well, they didn't pay enough. That's why.

241
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,840
Yeah, that's correct. That's how Howell moves it along.

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,760
Now, did you get a question of yours answered? And how much did it cost if said question was answered?

243
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,300
Well, I always try to bait him into his bardic irruptation.

244
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,140
So, I'm a healthy tipper at Ask Dr. Howell.

245
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:19,200
My question for Howell that ended up getting rolled in against other things was,

246
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,980
Should I worry when the skull head is in front of me or is it worse because it's always waiting where my eyes don't go?

247
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,240
Oh.

248
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,420
I'm sure he had an eloquent and verbose response to such a query.

249
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,440
See, I can't do it. You know what? I try to do Howell. I try to phrase it.

250
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,960
Nobody can do what Howell does.

251
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,380
Now, please. You shouldn't be so hard on yourself.

252
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,220
Yeah, there's only one of him.

253
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,040
That's Dr. Fox's Dr. Howell.

254
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,140
He's certainly a treasure.

255
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,580
But he not only tried to answer that, but simultaneously answered the question,

256
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,120
What did Stephen Hawking take with him to his cremation rocket?

257
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,980
Can we get another shot of Dr. Fox's Dr. Howell?

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,240
I think Dr. Fox has a pretty good Dr. Howell. You guys tell me.

259
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,400
I don't think it's that important.

260
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:19,700
I just think that we all need to slow down, take a breath, and draw girls with big titties.

261
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,300
Nailed it.

262
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,000
Alright, now that was Dr. Howell.

263
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,300
Now, Dr. Fox, do your impression of him.

264
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,460
Now, it's Dr. Howell. I know everything.

265
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,320
So, Couch Sloth, what are you doing in my neck of the woods?

266
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,800
What are you doing up there in the San Francisco Bay Area?

267
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,140
Just a rock's throw from Nevada.

268
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,200
Yeah, I kinda go wandering back there about every six weeks.

269
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,920
Really?

270
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,780
You know, I moved out east, but I still have a bunch of connections back there.

271
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,180
So about every six weeks I go back.

272
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,100
So did you go for espionage or pleasure?

273
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,720
Oh, you know, espionage is always pleasure, my friend.

274
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Oh, well answered. Well answered, sir.

275
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,900
I'm sorry, let's listen in while Finn and Argus have a private conversation while we talk.

276
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,380
I'm not having a conversation.

277
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,380
That's not what I'm talking about.

278
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:11,380


279
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,120
I'm talking about Dr. Fox having a conversation with an allegedly imaginary guest.

280
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,120
I don't know who you're talking to, Dr. Fox.

281
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,460
I'm just talking to Arthur Martin.

282
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,480
I think you should tell the viewers who you're talking to.

283
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,920
Or at least...

284
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,880
I'm talking to Chief of Hypercube Maintenance and Repair.

285
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,580
Oh, it's Oster Six is on the line then.

286
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,540
No, no, actually, it's my dad. He showed up.

287
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,460
He's actually over here at the Hypercube today.

288
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,740
Oh, put him on the radio. I'd love to hear it.

289
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:42,960


290
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,480
No. He wouldn't do it?

291
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,560
He doesn't want to talk to you.

292
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,480
You know, it was a couple of months ago I asked him.

293
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,060
He's holding out for scale wages.

294
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,400
You ever hear the show? He's like, yeah, I've listened to it.

295
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,700
I heard you on it.

296
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,440
I think I heard Fid.

297
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,720
And I go, oh yeah, what did you think of Pease?

298
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,700
And he goes, who's that?

299
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,340
Yeah, I know. You told this story.

300
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,840
You tell it every week now. It's good.

301
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,920
It's a good story.

302
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,160
It's good because it's true.

303
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,300
Well, tell your father I said hello.

304
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Pease says hello.

305
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,000
He's nodding yes.

306
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,160
You've got to nod out of the window.

307
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,500
He's got to be good.

308
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,100
We've only got two sets of the cans here.

309
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,960
So he's actually in here.

310
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,440
He only hears me and Fid

311
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,760
on our side of the conversation.

312
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,840
The last ten minutes has just been you

313
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,740
and the other guy on the computer

314
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,800
that he can't hear.

315
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,700
So now I heard it's a law in San Francisco.

316
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,440
It's sit down and sit down.

317
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,560
The first drink you order has to be

318
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:41,940
a Zima.

319
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,340
I mean, I was always under the impression

320
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,880
the first thing you drank had to be

321
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,620
Fernet Branca with a Pabst Blue Ribbon

322
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:51,960
backside.

323
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,460
Yeah, that's a Dr. Howell

324
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,020
tradition.

325
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,260
You ask a sacred question

326
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,480
and you receive the

327
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,020
sacred elixir of the Fernet

328
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,740
Branca. But you know, old homophobic

329
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,380
Pease

330
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,380
just wants to make sure that

331
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,820
everybody's getting in their

332
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,020
crisp, delicious

333
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,240
Zima.

334
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,680
Because they're a sponsor of the show.

335
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,200
As Pease always said, Zima is

336
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,480
super. So what does homophobia have to do

337
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,520
with Zima in this case?

338
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,960
I'm hoping he's going to explain it too.

339
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,300
...who the gays are?

340
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,880
I have a cure for it though.

341
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,360
Wait, wait, wait. Is Zima like turning

342
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,440
the people gay? Like that

343
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,620
water in that lake is turning the frogs gay?

344
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,940
Zima turns the frogs gay. There's an old adage

345
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,980
which is gayer to drink a Zima

346
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,840
or actually be gay. Pease,

347
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,420
Pease, my G.

348
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,820
Please, for once,

349
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,980
more gay.

350
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,540
Not what makes it gayer,

351
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,420
more gay.

352
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Please. We're professionals.

353
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
Which am I supposed to say?

354
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Gayer or more gay?

355
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,280
Do you have a stick to reach through the internet

356
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,620
with? Leave Pease alone.

357
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,420
He's a handsome boy.

358
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,020
Are you going to jump on this train now?

359
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,360
I'm jumping on the Dr. Fox

360
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,460
So what if I drink my Zima

361
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,320
on a dodgeball quad court?

362
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,420
Okay, so that's bad right off the bat

363
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,560
because that means you're cruising.

364
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,680
What you need to do to send a signal

365
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,300
especially when you're on that coast

366
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,140
is take any color

367
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,440
but yellow Skittle.

368
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,180
If you take any color but yellow Skittle

369
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,560
and put it in your Zima,

370
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,280
all the gays know

371
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
that you are not the gay.

372
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,080
Oh, so it's

373
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,680
like reverse hanky-coding.

374
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,680
Correct.

375
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,040
But now if you put a yellow

376
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,520
Skittle in your Zima,

377
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,920
that means you're looking for a bear.

378
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,820
And those are uncomfortable situations.

379
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,180
Oh, this explains

380
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,800
so much. Doesn't it though?

381
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,380
It's like this time that I went by Mr. S. Leather

382
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,900
to get some club wear and they

383
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,240
had these beautiful vinyl pants

384
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,300
with red stripes on them that I thought were badass.

385
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,360
You wear those to the wrong

386
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,260
club, my friend, and people start

387
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,320
sharpening the knives and licking them. Yeah, because

388
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,220
Crips don't want to see those red colors

389
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,940
at their parties.

390
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,220
No, keep going, Peace. You're doing great.

391
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,280
I think Fox is explaining to his dad

392
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,240
No, he can hear us

393
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,000
side-chattering and he's getting

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,060
things need to be done at the house. You guys!

395
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,240
I love doing the show and

396
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,800
I want my interviews

397
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,200
to be immaculate and when

398
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,700
you guys have side-chatter

399
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,400
off the mic when I'm trying

400
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,340
to interview the great

401
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,020
and diligent and wonderful...

402
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,580
Reverend Couch Sloth. Reverend Couch Sloth.

403
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,760
And you guys are having your side

404
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,960
banter. You know, it's ruining my

405
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,120
thing and I'm Pease and I'm a

406
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,180
sensitive boy. And I'm a handsome

407
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,840
boy, but I am sensitive. That's good.

408
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,180
I don't feel that way at all. I'm

409
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,360
just glad to be here actually. I know you don't feel like you're handsome

410
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,240
and neither does anybody else, but

411
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,640
I'm here to tell you that you are.

412
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,180
But my incel

413
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,300
friends say no. I'm only of

414
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,200
average look. Of course they would.

415
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,300
Of course they would. They can't admit it.

416
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,240
I'm only of average look and it's obvious from looking at you. They would never

417
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,800
admit it because then they'd

418
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,760
be involuntary.

419
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,780
It is. That's what

420
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,660
incel mean.

421
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,400
They don't want to be celibate.

422
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,380
They would like to be banging carrots too.

423
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,080
I like the idea of intel though.

424
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,760
I'm involuntarily

425
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,220
intelligent.

426
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,500
Well, that's not what that lawyer said.

427
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
I didn't ask to know

428
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
more than everybody

429
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,260
ever. What was with this NASA lawyer?

430
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,760
I didn't ask to be the smartest

431
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,020
person in the world. I'm involuntarily intelligent.

432
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,460
I'm involuntarily intelligent.

433
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:43,840
You know,

434
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,280
they hit him in the hall and they dance

435
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,340
around it, but they really don't describe any

436
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,480
outrageous crazy eyed behavior

437
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
that most men would identify

438
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,200
with, I need to get the fuck out.

439
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,340
But he hasn't really

440
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,160
Nothing like a Pokemon Go Uber

441
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
can't fix. No, I did identify with that.

442
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,380
She gave me ox tails. I gotta draw

443
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,880
the line at that. No, I

444
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,160
identified with that, but my balls disagree.

445
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,500
He's a smegmitarian.

446
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,340
You know,

447
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,340
I have two balls and one brain.

448
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,300
My balls outvote my brain.

449
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,160
Is this the first time

450
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,760
Is that how stank out where he is today?

451
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,700
He broke even.

452
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,200
He broke even.

453
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,400
Yeah, it's time for the show on Freethink

454
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,080
Radio. This is the show with the inside

455
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,180
jokes that we try to

456
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,220
promote. We try to promote the show generally

457
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,340
and all we do is joke about

458
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,200
the Church of the Subgenius and a bunch of

459
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,920
stuff that you've never heard of.

460
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,080
Yeah, you've never heard of it. Thank you all the

461
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
people. But I didn't say anything

462
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,300
about the church one time.

463
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,220
Oh yeah, you only said something about Stang.

464
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,940
I did. Nothing about the church.

465
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,600
Well, he's a major celebrity.

466
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,800
He's a major celebrity. Oh yeah, he's a

467
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,200
He is a major celebrity. I do. I have

468
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,060
a celebrity trading card. Handsome smiling Doug.

469
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,160
I got a pack of celebrity

470
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,040
trading cards the other day and

471
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,360
to my surprise, there was an insert

472
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,040
of the Reverend Ivan Stang.

473
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,640
I got all the stats on the back.

474
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,200
That's his rookie card? I was about to say.

475
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,680
Hey, let's go over those stats, man.

476
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,220
Do you know that the church is selling

477
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,340
Bob condoms now? Fleece groups, average

478
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,280
and Stang puts a hole in each

479
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
one personally before he mails them out. Post office

480
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,500
general relationships.

481
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,820
Oh, look at that. It's right over there.

482
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,060
In the rookie years.

483
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,360
He's an elite. This is great.

484
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,140
But yeah, it says here that he took

485
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,820
20 walks and one ball.

486
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:30,860
So.

487
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,280
Yeah, Reverend Ivan Stang is the

488
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,380
only person in the church

489
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,100
of Major League Baseball to ever

490
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,720
get more than one

491
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,340
run off of one walk.

492
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,200
That will never be

493
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,140
matched again. Nobody will ever be

494
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,260
able to get two runs off of one

495
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,220
walk. It's amazing.

496
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,100
Wait a second. I'd like to

497
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,700
run off.

498
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,200
Wouldn't we all right about now? I'm trying

499
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,360
to. I'm, the cigarettes

500
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,140
in the airlock are calling my name

501
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,180
and I gotta sit here and I gotta wait for you guys

502
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,980
to run out of steam so I can start a song.

503
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,560
Reverend Couch Sloth, we missed you, man.

504
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,260
Yeah, welcome back to the show,

505
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,480
dude. You're funny. Did you hear about

506
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,980
Fid?

507
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,120
What about Fid?

508
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,020
Yes, he did.

509
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,240
We don't have to go through this. He was in the chat.

510
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,140
We don't have to go through this for the sake of the viewers.

511
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,220
We haven't even gotten to the blind eyes. I tell them, hey, don't

512
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,180
tell everybody about all that drinking we were doing

513
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,240
after hours. But no, please,

514
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,340
nobody, please ask me

515
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,900
any more about my adventure

516
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,960
with the fetid NASA lawyer.

517
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,220
Well,

518
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,620
I mean, I guess she's got

519
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,880
some law knowledge on her

520
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,900
because that encyclopedia was thick.

521
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,820
And what does thick

522
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,260
stand for, Dr. Fox?

523
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,440
Uh, terribly

524
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,680
handsome, incognito,

525
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,480
uh, courageously

526
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,800
capturing. That's Pease

527
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,780
right there. Right there. Pease, you're thick.

528
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,960
You are

529
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,600
a thick, handsome boy.

530
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,460
You're a thick boy

531
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,580
and you're a handsome boy. B-O-I.

532
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,700
Who would win?

533
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,600
Ten Pease or one thick boy?

534
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,820
I don't want to

535
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,980
do this show anymore. We're not!

536
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,400
We're not doing the show!

537
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,740
We do the show! Half an hour ago, we

538
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,860
started doing a show. We're not talking about doing the blind eye

539
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,480
segment. This isn't a show!

540
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,600
All this is is a two hour production

541
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,240
meeting. Alright, so Pease,

542
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,140
did you have a blind eye?

543
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,420
And this will give our guest

544
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,240
Reverend

545
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,700
Dr. The Sloth of

546
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,800
the couch, uh, will uh,

547
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,760
will get a few minutes. Maybe he wants to jump in

548
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,540
with us. But no pressure, bro!

549
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,960
You know, Pease does have a

550
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,840
blind eye. I'm already with my blind eye. We're gonna tease it.

551
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,640
We're gonna tease the blind eye. We're gonna tease it.

552
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,600
My blind eye. We're gonna tease it again.

553
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,820
We teased it 25 minutes ago.

554
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,180
Dude, it's live radio!

555
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,780
Literally 30 minutes ago. It's live radio!

556
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,980
It's nothing but teases. We never actually

557
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,840
get to the content. I mean, what do you

558
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,960
think this is? Some kind of

559
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,360
respectable publication. Maybe this is one of the night blind eye is actually a

560
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,360
organization.

561
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,560
And I'm gonna blind eye NASA's

562
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,380
legal department.

563
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,220
Hey, check it out!

564
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,720
The arrow and the spinner. I

565
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,380
called it.

566
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,560
I don't feel that

567
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,300
breaking Fid Chuli's heart

568
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,600
is something that a legal team

569
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,720
should be involved in. Especially

570
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,160
when it's the National

571
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,740
Aeronautics Security

572
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,920
Association

573
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,560
of Space.

574
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Was

575
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,020
something hard at work?

576
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,140
At least something was hard at work I hope.

577
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,920
I think the point was that something

578
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,900
wasn't hard at work.

579
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,680
And Oxtails!

580
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,680
I'm blind eyeing Octails and vodka.

581
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,460
Now, Fid what's your blind eye?

582
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,920
Wait. Now, hold on.

583
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,600
You don't get to just

584
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,720
say your blind eye.

585
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,940
Why are you blind

586
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,880
eyeing the NASA

587
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,620
legal department.

588
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,620
I feel like the NASA legal department

589
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,920
read my friend

590
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,380
Fid truly on.

591
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,820
I think that they

592
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,780
tried to tempt him with space. I think they tried to lead

593
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,060
on him. I don't know if he's into that, though.

594
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,580
Like, hey, I've got, you like

595
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,800
space cults? I've got a spaceship.

596
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,920
Want to come over to my house and see it?

597
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,660
You know, poor Fid.

598
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,460
He's much like a child.

599
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,440
He doesn't know that it's not a real pleasure

600
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,840
saucer. How did you know the line she used?

601
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,340
It's just

602
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,840
I told you.

603
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,780
This whole thing was a setup.

604
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,280
It would be the saucer below

605
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,660
a pleasure saucer. A contentment

606
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,500
saucer? A contentment saucer.

607
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,520
Yeah, he goes over there

608
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,340
into the false premise that he's going to be

609
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,120
introduced to a pleasure saucer

610
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,700
and all he gets is a contentment saucer.

611
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,480
And on top of that,

612
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,740
she made my other good friend, Argus Q. Fox

613
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
Dr. Esquire worry

614
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,700
about his buddy Fid truly all

615
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,500
day Sunday.

616
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,480
Peas, you're so sweet when you're

617
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,420
insincere.

618
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,680
It's a gift.

619
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,620
What about the oxtails? You're trying to go for a twofer.

620
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,900
Why are you blind-eyeing oxtails?

621
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,620
If ISIS was to attack

622
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,580
all of their national food

623
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,460
supply, which is oxtail. I don't feel she

624
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,440
prepared them correctly.

625
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,800
Nuke the oxen!

626
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,140
Nuke the oxen!

627
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,340
Here's what I think happened.

628
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,580
I think she served Fid

629
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,440
the oxtails in vodka and the

630
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,700
oxtails had been put so much

631
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,060
spice on them to mask

632
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,800
the intoxicant that

633
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,860
she put in the oxtails. And you'd

634
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,760
never seen a more surprised lawyer

635
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,860
when Fid truly ate that and down

636
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,940
that vodka and then beat

637
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,360
her ass at Pokemon Go

638
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,860
because she thought he'd been passed out, tied up

639
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,720
in the cellar already. And they were walking around

640
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,940
those chemicals had no effect

641
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,800
on Fid truly. Him being a

642
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,880
drummer, of course, she was not aware that

643
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,980
drummers are immune to

644
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,360
hypnotics.

645
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,640
These were heavily seasoned

646
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,660
oxtails, you say.

647
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,480
Yeah, to mask the

648
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,020
hypnotics that she put in it.

649
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,180
She moved the shit out of those oxtails.

650
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
It could be more sinister than that, though.

651
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,180
It could have been

652
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,340
British oxtail

653
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,240
and the spices were to cover up

654
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,400
the mad cow disease.

655
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,320
But here's the thing.

656
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,200
The joke's on her.

657
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,640
They're not mad.

658
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,940
They're just upset.

659
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
That's right. Reverend Couch Sloth

660
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,080
You and your labels.

661
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,440
Reverend Couch Sloth knows about

662
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,260
oxtail and mad cow disease.

663
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,540
What's the deal with that?

664
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,320
Yeah, anything that's not talking about this.

665
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,320
Absolutely.

666
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,640
Fid, I heard you just got the world changed in your bicycle.

667
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,500
How'd that go?

668
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,060
Say what?

669
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,800
I was trying to help segue out of that

670
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,620
uncomfortable NASA

671
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,400
lawyer conversation.

672
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,640
I don't need your help segueing out of an uncomfortable conversation

673
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,060
because I have a lot of money.

674
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,060


675
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,060


676
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,060


677
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,060


678
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,060


679
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,260
I have a radio station

680
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,360
right in front of me.

681
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,320
Yeah, we have songs to do that for him.

682
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,700
Yeah, we can just play a song.

683
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,040
And so this week's

684
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,060
obligatory get fid

685
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,040
out of saying incriminating things

686
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,400
song is by Frank Zappa

687
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,200
and Captain Beefheart and it's called

688
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,580
200 Years Old.

689
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,960
And somebody contact

690
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,260
my lawyer, please.

691
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,040
I'm being held against my will.

692
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,320
That's pretty funny.

693
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,720
Smoke them if you got them.

694
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
We'll be back.

695
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,140
Time for the show. Freethink Radio.

696
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,600
Help. Help.

697
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,800
Please send help.

I was sitting in a breakfast room in Allentown, Pennsylvania

721
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,720
six o'clock in the morning.

722
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,040
I got up too early.

723
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,260
I got up too early.

724
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,120
It was a terrible mistake.

725
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,880
Sitting there face to face

726
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,780
with a 75-cent glass of orange

727
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,540
that was about as big as my finger

728
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,360
and a bowl of

729
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,040
horribly foreshortened corn asleep.

730
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,860
And I said to myself, this is the life.

731
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,820
As far as you get close, you try to grow a mustache.

732
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,600
guitar solo

733
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,900
guitar solo

734
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,040
guitar solo

735
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,040
guitar solo

736
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,480
guitar solo

737
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,440
guitar solo

738
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,180
guitar solo

739
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,180


740
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,500
The music's too loud.

741
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,300
It's too loud.

742
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,560
Too loud.

743
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,940
Dr. Fox is a big boy.

744
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,320
I can't walk away for a minute.

745
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,480
Did you put the music up to Mask Fid's crying about the subject matter?

746
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,440
I guess so.

747
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,440
Well, I was going to cry a little bit.

748
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,800
My blind eye was on Airbnb.

749
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,880
Airbnb?

750
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,380
You don't like Airbnb?

751
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,040
Well, yeah, because when I'm looking,

752
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,000
looking for a vacation, what I really want

753
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
to do is stay in somebody's mother-in-law

754
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,620
suite and be told not to drink.

755
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,040
And that's where it was

756
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,980
coming off for me, was not as much

757
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,700
Airbnb, but people that

758
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,880
utilize it. And people

759
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,080
that say, hey, why don't

760
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,980
you come live in my basement? It's only

761
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,440
$200 a night.

762
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,760
By the way, no smoking.

763
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,940
Or drinking.

764
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,680
Which, can you even

765
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,980
tell a tenant?

766
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,140
Maybe if you ask nicely.

767
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,800
Well, because you might be

768
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,940
doing better than me on Airbnb, dude.

769
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,960
You know, it's funny, they find you

770
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,880
in Las Vegas if they catch you Airbnb.

771
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,940
They find you, peas? Really?

772
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'd never imagine.

773
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,500
Reverend Couch Sloth, our

774
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,600
beautiful, beautiful, precious,

775
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,700
precious guest.

776
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,740
And Patreon

777
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,740
supporter, by the way.

778
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,760
What

779
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,960
was your experience?

780
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,660
What was your experience with Airbnb?

781
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:29,860
I

782
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,840
Airbnb'd in San Francisco one time

783
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,600
when I couldn't get a hotel room.

784
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,040
You have to there, don't you?

785
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,940
There are no houses that are not

786
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,780
B&Bs there. Yeah, I mean,

787
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,920
it's how everyone makes rent, is by renting

788
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,700
out to everyone else. That's a great economic

789
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,660
plan, isn't it?

790
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,580
I'm not

791
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,860
homeless. I'm just sleeping in this box by the

792
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,460
river because I've got my Airbnb

793
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,800
making money. Well, in the interest

794
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,940
of full disclosure, our show,

795
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,120
is sponsored by Airbnb's

796
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,040
biggest competitor, which

797
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,900
is Magnavox.

798
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,800
Yeah, Magnavox and

799
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,080
Adderall PM are both

800
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,780
Airbnb's biggest

801
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,340
competitor.

802
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,200
So that being said,

803
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,640
continue,

804
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,880
Reverend Couch Sloth. Yeah, well,

805
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,860
so the mother-in-law suite

806
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,680
that I was advertised was actually

807
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,060
a plywood shed.

808
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,860
And whenever I turned

809
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,960
on the space heater to try out the air, I was like, oh, I'm going to get a new one.

810
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


811
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


812
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


813
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


814
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


815
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


816
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


817
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


818
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


819
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


820
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


821
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:26,960


822
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,760
And then when I tried to warm it up, it would blow

823
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,520
out the lights in the shed

824
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,000
and half the house. Nice.

825
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,920
They must have thought that was cool

826
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,860
every time you did it. Oh, yeah.

827
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
They thought it was great, especially

828
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,800
because it was blowing out the half of the house

829
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,740
that the primary tenant

830
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,300
was in.

831
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,800
So what happens to that circumstance? Do you like

832
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,720
say, hey, this is not worth $200.

833
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,520
I'm only going to pay you $175.

834
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,860
Well, I mean, this is

835
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,860
America. I just found a way to pass the

836
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
buck to somebody else. Well, did you

837
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,560
run out like a corner of the shed for

838
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,200
$300?

839
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,620
Rustic, no

840
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,900
electricity. That was actually

841
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,800
I mean, it was actually

842
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,240
I was actually working

843
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,260
out there at the time, so

844
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,640
I just tolerated it

845
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,320
knowing that I didn't have to pay for it.

846
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,480
It sounds like your employee

847
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,760
was taking for a ride, though, trying to provide

848
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,520
you a comfortable place for you to

849
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,480
repass after your hard work

850
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,100
during the day, and you have to go back to a

851
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,680
plywood shed.

852
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,620
I think there should be

853
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,160
if only one of us

854
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,260
if only one of us

855
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,480
knew a lawyer

856
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,000
that could perhaps take on this

857
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,880
case. I think

858
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,420
you might know a lawyer

859
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,380
that had some

860
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,500
some practice

861
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,960
in space law

862
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,060
because ours is space

863
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,860
international maritime space

864
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,040
or maybe if they could just like make it up

865
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,560
to me with a really good oxtail.

866
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
Damn couch sloth is on the show

867
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,800
bashing FID.

868
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,320
That's why I like him, man.

869
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,680
He comes into the show saucy.

870
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,480
He doesn't care.

871
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,600
He's like, oh, you want to have me on your show?

872
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,900
I'm going to say what I'm going to say.

873
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,480
By the way, couch sloth, we love

874
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,920
you and appreciate you.

875
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,160
You are you are among

876
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,720
our treasured, treasured

877
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,060
fans.

878
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,640
Well, I greatly appreciate

879
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,020
it, and I do.

880
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,060
I do.

881
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,740
I do love this show.

882
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,580
I'm sorry when my wanderings take me away

883
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,960
from it week on week, but

884
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,520
it is good to be back, even if I've only got

885
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,500
about three sentences worth of inside jokes

886
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,400
to play with. Right.

887
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,660
That's OK. We've only got two.

888
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,540
Yeah, we have like

889
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,580
what praise Bob and then

890
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,680
I don't know. Fuck them if they

891
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,720
can't take a joke. Other than that, we don't

892
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,440
know anything. That's why

893
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,700
this what you are listening to

894
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,440
right now, right now, time

895
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,500
for the show, which you're listening

896
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:55,880
to.

897
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,840
On Freethink Radio.

898
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,980
That's where it's being streamed. Isn't

899
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,920
a show. It's just a two hour

900
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,000
production meeting where we come

901
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,060
come up with the

902
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,800
content for the next

903
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,660
episode. And that's what we mentioned.

904
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,780
It's fine. Have you mentioned your new show?

905
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,420
That's going to be Wednesdays at 10.

906
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,480
The law and you with

907
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,820
Julie.

908
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,360
Fucking bees.

909
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,660
Oh, shit.

910
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,880
Damn. I've got

911
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,840
nothing tonight. You know, usually I

912
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,440
feel like I can. Yeah.

913
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Well, I guess when we can get it, we

914
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,380
have to take it. You know,

915
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,780
that works is people are going to call

916
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,680
up with their legal problems and

917
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,520
they're going to tell the legal problems to

918
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,940
fit. It's going to go off the air

919
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,380
for a minute and consult

920
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,640
off the air at 5

921
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,360
a.m. And he'll come back

922
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,640
the following night to answer your legal

923
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,740
questions. He didn't even

924
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,600
tell you the part that

925
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,880
I guess we couldn't get that far. But, you know,

926
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,580
we left the bar at five.

927
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,680
The morning he did not

928
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,500
make it back to Hypercube until

929
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,700
nearly 11 p.m.

930
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,760
The next was the same

931
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,740
day. So he was gone

932
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,620
for what is that? Five to

933
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,200
11. That's it felt like

934
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,780
how did you keep yourself

935
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,720
from calling the police? Finally, the

936
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,500
missing person. Dude, I

937
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,660
have a phone, man. Nobody

938
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,000
has landlines.

939
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,840
I didn't have my cell phone.

940
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:25,220
I need to carry an old

941
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,440
one.

942
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,600
I can ask her. We're

943
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,940
all day. An emergency.

944
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,760
I do.

945
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,720
I do. But look,

946
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,760
if you were in this situation that I was in,

947
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,680
you wouldn't have been able to do any better, man.

948
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,720
Like I did the best I was able

949
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,440
to do better. I was able to

950
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
pass it on to you.

951
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,420
Not you. I was talking. I

952
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,580
escaped. He's wouldn't have been able to

953
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,660
look that man. Is

954
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,600
this really what the show is? We

955
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,560
haven't even done the blind eyes. We haven't even

956
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,680
done the voicemails. We haven't

957
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,720
even done the viewer mail.

958
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,520
It's almost time for the end of the show.

959
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,440
Yeah. Who's your blind eye,

960
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:01,680
Finn?

961
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,820
You know what?

962
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,620
I've been holding off

963
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,560
on making peas my

964
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,640
blind eye. I said

965
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,040
to myself.

966
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,500
I have to confirm that we've gotten

967
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,580
on to him for using the same blind

968
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
eye, especially when it

969
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,620
was me the second time.

970
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,540
So is it, you know,

971
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,500
if you're going to listen, if you're going to live on that

972
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,560
professional level, if you're going to

973
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,500
tiptoe to the edge, if

974
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,580
you were going to take your sphincter

975
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,800
and scrape it along the walls

976
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,180
of the Grand Canyon,

977
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
Fid Chuli, I have to say that you

978
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,820
can only condemn

979
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,720
peas with

980
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,520
a blind eye once

981
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
per year.

982
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,660
Oh, now

983
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,160
you're bound to me.

984
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,600
Now there's a limit on how many times

985
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,500
we can condemn.

986
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:54,960
Now you can.

987
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,140
You can condemn him as much as you want,

988
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,240
but I'm going to tell you every time you

989
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,600
do it, it's going to diminish.

990
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,380
It's going to diminish.

991
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,460
You're just going to continue it week after week?

992
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,600
How come this starts now?

993
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,020
Peas has been blind eyeing you

994
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,940
for like week after week.

995
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,080
We did season zero, the practice

996
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,240
season, and season one, the one where we

997
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,800
fuck everything up every week

998
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,300
and miss all the shows.

999
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,000
This is bullshit.

1000
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,060
Season two is starting.

1001
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,780
You stay out of this, peas.

1002
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,440
This is between.

1003
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,600
Between me and Dr. Fox.

1004
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,060
He's my friend, but right now he's really testing

1005
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,840
our friendship.

1006
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,840
So is like season two's theme going to be all

1007
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,300
sophomore jokes all the time?

1008
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,200
Maybe he's exploring the legal

1009
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,700
boundaries of your...

1010
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,900
Couch Sloth, let me...

1011
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,960
You are an independent arbiter

1012
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,180
of this situation.

1013
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,040
Reverend Couch Sloth, I need to confer with you.

1014
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,700
I'm just looking forward to Peas' apology text later.

1015
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,860
Sorry, sorry.

1016
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,900
I was picking on Fid their whole show.

1017
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,440
No, no, no.

1018
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,160
Because you know he wants...

1019
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,780
He wants to apologize for doing bad on the show.

1020
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,400
So we'll go, no, Peas, you were good.

1021
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,880
I'm sorry I didn't get to you sooner.

1022
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,360
It's okay.

1023
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,640
I accept your apology.

1024
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,620
You don't have to apologize.

1025
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,100
Is he gonna...

1026
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,080
Are you expecting your Peas bad show apology

1027
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,640
after this episode, Fid?

1028
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,300
Once again.

1029
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,780
Are you expecting it?

1030
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,740
Once again.

1031
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,540
Again.

1032
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,200
Well, if you're gonna let me talk...

1033
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,780
I'll think about it.

1034
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,540
If you're gonna let me talk...

1035
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:24,760
Oh, I know.

1036
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,420
I distracted you.

1037
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,840
I distracted you with my side chatter.

1038
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,840
I don't want to distract you with my side chatter.

1039
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,440
Banter.

1040
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,480
Banter.

1041
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,540
My headphones are unplugged.

1042
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,280
All right, there they go.

1043
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,600
No, hey.

1044
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,520
If you're gonna let me talk, you know,

1045
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,480
just let's be fair about...

1046
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,840
Reverend Couch Sloth is not only

1047
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,700
a great supporter of the show.

1048
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,320
He's also my personal psychologist.

1049
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,540
So I'm just gonna ask that you and Peas

1050
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,800
that Dr. Fox and Reverend Peas

1051
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,540
just let me get a moment

1052
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,580
with my personal psychologist,

1053
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,280
Reverend Couch Sloth,

1054
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,620
and in the interest of...

1055
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,100
Okay, you're on the clock.

1056
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,460
In the interest of patient doctor confidentiality,

1057
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I'm gonna ask that not only do Dr. Fox

1058
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,200
and Reverend Peas put their fingers in their ears,

1059
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,660
but that the rest of the audience

1060
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,180
just turn the radio down

1061
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,320
until we're done talking.

1062
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,480
You'll know when we're done.

1063
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,800
Then just turn it back up.

1064
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,260
But, um...

1065
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,640
I don't sense it.

1066
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,180
Uh, Reverend Couch Sloth,

1067
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,640
doctor, I'm just, um...

1068
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,960
I don't know what to do with you.

1069
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:30,800
I mean, you've been here.

1070
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,880
Cease and desist.

1071
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,120
What do you think?

1072
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,020
Couch Sloth?

1073
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,120
Dr. Couch Sloth?

1074
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,580
Are you there?

1075
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:37,900
Yes.

1076
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,580
Yes.

1077
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,000
Yes.

1078
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,680
Are you asking psychologists

1079
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,000
how you're doing?

1080
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,220
Hey!

1081
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,160
This is my private therapy time.

1082
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,380
Okay, here go my fingers.

1083
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,200
There we go.

1084
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:47,800
Don't...

1085
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,840
It'll work better.

1086
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,420
Sacred...

1087
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,720
Put your fingers in your ears.

1088
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,420
Sacred time.

1089
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,260
Peas!

1090
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,820
Come on, man.

1091
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,660
This is...

1092
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,020
This is therapy.

1093
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,640
This is psychotherapy.

1094
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,140
If you guys keep talking,

1095
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,120
I'm not gonna be able

1096
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,640
to write it off on my taxes.

1097
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,360
Dun-dun.

1098
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,480
Reverend...

1099
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,420
Dun-dun-dun-dun.

1100
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,660
Reverend Dr. Psychologist Couch Sloth.

1101
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,680
You can do, uh,

1102
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,380
background music

1103
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,340
if you want to, Peas.

1104
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,120
That's pretty good, yeah.

1105
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,680
No, we should do

1106
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,520
the People's Court music.

1107
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,120
Do you have the

1108
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,820
People's Court music?

1109
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,480
Yeah.

1110
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,980
That's the bit we haven't...

1111
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,200
I have it right here

1112
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,980
in my ass.

1113
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,500
Hold on.

1114
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,500
Let me just put it up

1115
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,100
to the microphone

1116
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,520
and tell you what I really

1117
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,020
think about you, Peas.

1118
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

1119
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,460
I'm sorry.

1120
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,340
That was so mean.

1121
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:25,780
In the People's Court,

1122
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,940
today is presiding judge

1123
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,920
Fid Chuli

1124
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,220
in the case

1125
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,520
of the NASA lawyer.

1126
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,380
Today's plaintiff,

1127
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,480
Fid Chuli,

1128
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,280
claims that the NASA lawyer

1129
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,720
did not receive his consent

1130
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,000
to orbit Uranus.

1131
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,060
The defendant,

1132
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,040
the NASA lawyer...

1133
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,940
I was penetrated,

1134
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,420
your honor!

1135
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,840
Who's the defendant, Peas?

1136
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,160
I'm the defendant.

1137
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,680
The defendant is

1138
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,560
NASA's lead...

1139
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,120
I'm the victim here.

1140
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,720
Come on.

1141
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:56,940
Sasha...

1142
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,400
Justice must prevail.

1143
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,480
Hey.

1144
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,440
Oh, wait.

1145
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,740
Oh, so now the defendant

1146
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,140
doesn't get an intro?

1147
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,000
Wow.

1148
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,600
So much for innocent

1149
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,600
until proven guilty.

1150
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:11,760
Wow.

1151
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,600
Sasha Bang says

1152
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,260
Fid Chuli provided

1153
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,260
inadequate servicing

1154
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,860
and then ate all her

1155
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,780
oxtails and vodka.

1156
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,700
She says she doesn't

1157
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,580
owe him a thing.

1158
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,620
She says she doesn't owe him

1159
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:25,620


1160
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:25,620


1161
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:25,620


1162
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:25,620


1163
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:25,620


1164
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:25,620


1165
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:25,620


1166
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,560
No, too late.

1167
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,240
Too late.

1168
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:27,840
Oi!

1169
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,580
Dun-dun.

1170
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,380
Can you, can you please...

1171
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:32,860
Today, though,

1172
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,720
resolve the differences

1173
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,080
in Chuli's court.

1174
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


1175
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,480
to put a handcuff

1176
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,340
on my dick?

1177
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,800
I feel like around my wrist

1178
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,660
would have been sufficient.

1179
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,100
I mean, where am I gonna run?

1180
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,500
There's TV cameras everywhere.

1181
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,700
There's people on...

1182
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,080
There's scrolling...

1183
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,440
All right, Judge Peas.

1184
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,340
Uh, I've presented

1185
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,680
my argument.

1186
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,600
The prosecution

1187
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,580
is presenting

1188
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,220
their own verdict.

1189
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,000
What's your ruling?

1190
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,600
Well, Fid,

1191
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,840
they don't allow me

1192
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,420
to put people

1193
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,160
on the chain gangs

1194
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,240
in a small claims case

1195
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,840
like this.

1196
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:04,840
But,

1197
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,780
I'm gonna make an exception.

1198
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,860
We're gonna have you

1199
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,180
go to drill boot camp

1200
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,060
with Sergeant Slaughter here

1201
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,060
and you're gonna learn

1202
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:13,600
how to treat

1203
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,660
NASA lawyer ladies

1204
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,360
like ladies

1205
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,740
and not your playthings

1206
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,060
and you're gonna learn...

1207
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,940
Are you listening, Fid?

1208
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,120
Because you're not gonna learn

1209
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,160
if you're not listening, Fid.

1210
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:23,560
Wait, what?

1211
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,460
You're gonna learn

1212
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,160
not to make your friends,

1213
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,120
Argus and Aster,

1214
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,100
worry about you

1215
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,320
from 5 o'clock

1216
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:29,900
in the morning

1217
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,900
after 2 p.m.

1218
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,300
after 11 p.m. at night.

1219
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,020
Aster 6 was not worried

1220
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,060
for one minute.

1221
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,700
Aster 6 was the one

1222
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,280
telling me,

1223
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,200
it's fine.

1224
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,060
It's fine.

1225
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,800
Thank you.

1226
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,500
Shout out to, um...

1227
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,480
Shout out to Aster 6

1228
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,900
for telling Dr. Fox

1229
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,940
that even though

1230
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,460
I was lost in the woods,

1231
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,240
as Reverend Peas knows

1232
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,540
how I tend to be,

1233
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:53,540


1234
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,840
I tend to get, quote,

1235
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,120
lost in the woods, unquote,

1236
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,820
uh, I will be okay.

1237
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,300
But Dr. Fox,

1238
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,880
Dr. Fox is a,

1239
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,160
he's, he's a,

1240
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,900
he's a nice,

1241
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,720
he's a good friend.

1242
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,060
He worries.

1243
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,920
He's a good friend.

1244
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,140
Watch it there.

1245
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,820
I almost called him

1246
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,620
a nice guy.

1247
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,500
I almost did.

1248
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,200
He would not have

1249
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:14,940
taken kindly to that.

1250
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,980
Argus and I were camping

1251
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,240
and we all had some popcorn.

1252
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,360
The three of us

1253
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,300
had popcorn.

1254
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,840
And Fid wandered off

1255
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,480
into the woods.

1256
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,520
And Argus,

1257
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,840
Argus got super concerned

1258
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,600
and I was like,

1259
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,900
Argus, Fitzgerald,

1260
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,240
man, it's just the woods.

1261
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:28,860
He'll be fine.

1262
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,000
Argus would not stop worrying.

1263
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,020
And so I knew

1264
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,620
the pain that you put

1265
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,620
our friend through

1266
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,820
for those,

1267
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,820
not even 12 hours, dude.

1268
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,200
Oh, no.

1269
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,020
What is this?

1270
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,140
Argus is saying

1271
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,400
the darndest things.

1272
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,060
18 hours.

1273
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,580
And I bet you Argus

1274
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,100
was wandering up and down

1275
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,940
those pathways

1276
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,900
where you guys do

1277
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,840
your videos and stuff.

1278
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:50,800
Fid,

1279
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,280
corn dog lady,

1280
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,420
have you seen Fid?

1281
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,160
No, please.

1282
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,160
Hey, guy that smacks

1283
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,800
Fid in the face,

1284
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,240
have you seen Fid?

1285
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,460
Here's two guys.

1286
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,200
Have you seen Fid?

1287
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,200
Oh, so I asked her finally

1288
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,120
at like six o'clock

1289
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,840
that night and said,

1290
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,400
Argus, we have to go

1291
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,000
to your dad's

1292
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,520
and have dinner.

1293
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,280
Maybe Fid will be there.

1294
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,240
He knows we're all

1295
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,400
going to meet at Fox's

1296
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,600
father's house for dinner.

1297
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,180
And yet when you got there,

1298
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,800
he still wasn't there.

1299
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,240
You put Argus

1300
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,200
through hell, dude.

1301
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,400
And you and I are tight.

1302
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,020
We're friends.

1303
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,680
But I got to say,

1304
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,940
no, that was uncool.

1305
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:22,840
You're right.

1306
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,400
No, I'm not.

1307
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,820
No, and I,

1308
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,600
I especially like the part

1309
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,880
where he went.

1310
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,660
It's not cool now.

1311
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,320
It's hilarious

1312
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,720
while you're all there.

1313
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,200
I especially like the part

1314
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,780
where Fox went back

1315
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,680
to ask the guy

1316
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,640
who punched me

1317
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,080
in the face on tape

1318
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:37,980
where I,

1319
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,280
if he had seen me lately,

1320
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,720
which if you don't know,

1321
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,980
if you, the viewer,

1322
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,620
don't know what I'm referring to,

1323
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,820
there's video of me

1324
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,060
getting punched in the face.

1325
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,120
We've talked about it

1326
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,020
on previous shows,

1327
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:49,540
so we're not going

1328
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,180
to get into it,

1329
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,640
but you can see the video.

1330
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,020
It is me getting

1331
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:53,380
punched in the face

1332
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,060
by a person

1333
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,120
that I provoked

1334
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:56,920
in Orlando.

1335
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,060
You can see it.

1336
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,520
The proof does live

1337
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,440
in this pudding.

1338
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,260
Uh, yeah,

1339
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:01,680
whatever.

1340
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,420
timefortheshow.punch.fid

1341
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,460
slash face

1342
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,600
and, uh,

1343
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:07,860
.htm.

1344
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,620
Yeah.

1345
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,880
Just do that

1346
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,620
three times.

1347
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,320
But Dr. Cosmack said

1348
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,480
you have to type that

1349
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,320
URL in three times.

1350
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,880
You can't just type it in once.

1351
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,720
You have to type that

1352
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,340
in three times.

1353
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,300
See, that's another

1354
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,140
inside joke

1355
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,300
that none of the viewers

1356
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,200
are going to get.

1357
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,220
But,

1358
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:23,380
you know,

1359
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:23,960
it's okay

1360
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,260
because this isn't

1361
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,100
really a show.

1362
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,520
This is the end

1363
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,300
of what some people

1364
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,600
might call a show,

1365
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,660
but what is actually

1366
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,340
a live two-hour

1367
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,160
production meeting

1368
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,280
where we attempt

1369
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,220
on every episode

1370
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,760
to come up with

1371
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,180
all of the content

1372
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,380
for the next episode.

1373
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,300
And then, of course,

1374
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,160
on the next episode

1375
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,260
we do the same thing.

1376
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,820
And I think we've done

1377
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,220
a pretty good job

1378
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,480
of that so far.

1379
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,380
We're just wrapping it up.

1380
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,220
At this point,

1381
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,000
we're just holding

1382
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,800
the lighter

1383
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,240
onto the plastic skin

1384
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,760
that is wrapping

1385
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,140
the joke up

1386
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,780
for shipping.

1387
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,920
And we're just holding

1388
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,080
the lighter on the ends

1389
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,040
to singe them off

1390
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,280
and protect

1391
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,080
this perfectly crafted joke

1392
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,120
that you, the viewer,

1393
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,160
were fortunate enough

1394
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,780
to be with us

1395
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,940
while we manufactured it.

1396
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,880
You got to see

1397
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,560
how the hot dog was made.

1398
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,100
The plastic side.

1399
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,640
As the lawsuit

1400
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,900
was developed

1401
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,200
and the evidence gathered

1402
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,800
for Fid's impending

1403
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,420
judicial nightmare,

1404
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,140
you were there.

1405
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,160
You will be able to tell

1406
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:34,720
your grandchildren.

1407
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:34,720


1408
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,600
a defenseless woman,

1409
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,320
you were there.

1410
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,760
Grandpa!

1411
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,000
You might be called

1412
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,380
to this on the bite marks

1413
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,460
of an oxtail.

1414
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,620
Tell me again

1415
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,880
about the time,

1416
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,200
Grandpa,

1417
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,520
when you were there

1418
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,560
for that one episode

1419
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,140
of Time for the Show.

1420
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,680
And Argus Fox

1421
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,460
was worried

1422
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,700
and he looked for you

1423
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,200
with the corndog lady

1424
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,740
and that homeless man

1425
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,600
that punched you.

1426
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,380
Did they?

1427
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,480
Tell that story,

1428
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,520
Grandpa Fid.

1429
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,700
Did they?

1430
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:06,700
Did they?

1431
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:06,940
Pease.

1432
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,220
Did they?

1433
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,280
No, don't tell that story,

1434
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:09,840
Grandpa Fid.

1435
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,460
Tell that one about

1436
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,280
that NASA Laura.

1437
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,720
You're really not going

1438
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,040
to let me off the hook,

1439
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,760
Pease.

1440
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,540
He's got you

1441
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,300
by the really thing.

1442
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,660
You've got one big more minute.

1443
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,260
I've got six more minutes.

1444
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:22,660
I'm not going to,

1445
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,500
I'm never going to bring up

1446
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,840
anything, you know.

1447
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,420
That makes good radio.

1448
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,180
Yeah, yeah.

1449
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,460
I'm not saying anything

1450
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,880
on the radio ever again.

1451
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,420
Well, what do we do?

1452
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,280
I mean, look,

1453
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,120
here it is.

1454
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,280
It's time for the show.

1455
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,680
We've got five minutes

1456
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,780
left in the show.

1457
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,860
And what have we done?

1458
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,880
Other than...

1459
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,900
Let's do it NASA style.

1460
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,200
We have T minus five minutes

1461
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,400
this show.

1462
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,820
God damn it.

1463
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,640
You know,

1464
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,440
if you weren't so funny,

1465
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,800
you would be a asshole.

1466
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,300
I don't know.

1467
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:52,640
I don't know.

1468
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:52,640


1469
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:52,640


1470
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:52,640


1471
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,440
You know that, Pease.

1472
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,300
But, but,

1473
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,460
you're funny

1474
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,660
and you're handsome.

1475
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,940
I'm sorry.

1476
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,200
And so those two things

1477
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,620
totally preclude you

1478
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,320
from me.

1479
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:03,840
I'm sorry.

1480
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,220
I can't stay mad

1481
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,560
at your handsome face

1482
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,580
and your funny brain.

1483
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,320
I just can't.

1484
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,240
I just can't.

1485
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,140
No.

1486
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:13,620
Wow.

1487
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,540
I think we've had

1488
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,660
a real breakthrough here.

1489
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,600
Reverend Cosworth.

1490
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,720
I realize that

1491
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,780
my therapeutic protocols

1492
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,040
are sometimes experimental,

1493
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,240
but, you know,

1494
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,020
they seem to be really

1495
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,020
having an effect here.

1496
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,700
For those who are just tuning in,

1497
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,620
Reverend Cashloth

1498
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,060
is my therapist.

1499
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:27,820
So,

1500
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,200
what's your evaluation, doctor?

1501
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,640
Dr. Reverend...

1502
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,600
Dr. Reverend Cashloth,

1503
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,860
what is your...

1504
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,840
Well, I would say that,

1505
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,280
you know,

1506
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,720
you're suffering from

1507
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,820
an interesting

1508
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,300
by proxy fixation

1509
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:45,700
in that

1510
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,640
Pease continues to be fixated

1511
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,720
on discussing

1512
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,700
the lawyer lady.

1513
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,660
Right.

1514
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,260
But that's actually

1515
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,000
your prediction.

1516
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,300
That's the projection

1517
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,580
of your fascination with her.

1518
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,400
Oh, I love that word.

1519
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:55,940
On to Pease,

1520
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,800
which he then expresses back to you.

1521
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,180
And I reflect it back

1522
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,200
outward to the world.

1523
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,180
So, obviously,

1524
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,440
the doctor's quite

1525
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:04,540
correct.

1526
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,000
And the only logical conclusion

1527
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,440
is you've got to go back

1528
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,660
for adventure number two.

1529
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,720
Well, hold on.

1530
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,280
I want to hear the rest

1531
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,140
of Dr. Reverend Cashloth's evaluation.

1532
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:18,980
Oh, no.

1533
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,200
That's just cycle Bible.

1534
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,640
Well, I, you know,

1535
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,000
I do recommend, you know,

1536
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,020
exposure therapy.

1537
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,740
Exposure therapy.

1538
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,000
Pease, please.

1539
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,640
This is my personal

1540
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,360
therapy session

1541
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,520
with my doctor.

1542
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,360
I think he's giving you

1543
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:32,880
good advice.

1544
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,660
Do you mind?

1545
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,080
I know, but I, you know,

1546
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,800
this is important.

1547
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,980
I do feel that we're going

1548
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,780
to have to proceed,

1549
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,120
you know, next session

1550
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,220
as our time together

1551
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,280
this evening has run out.

1552
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,980
But, of course,

1553
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,080
I will be sending you a bill.

1554
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,700
And as usual,

1555
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,760
I do accept payments

1556
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,760
only in Bitcoin.

1557
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:50,340
Out of time!

1558
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,800
Yeah.

1559
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,100
I love running out of time

1560
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,620
at the therapist.

1561
00:52:59,020 --> 00:52:59,600
You know,

1562
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,840
you know what's amazing

1563
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,460
is how they never seem

1564
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,980
to ever glance at a clock,

1565
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,180
but they always know

1566
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,980
when it's 42 minutes

1567
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,720
into the hour session

1568
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,720
because 42...

1569
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,500
They have a special

1570
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,880
psychologist butt plug

1571
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,080
that vibrates at 42 minutes.

1572
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,200
So that's how they know.

1573
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:18,880
Don't be fooled.

1574
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,160
Well, Reverend Pease,

1575
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,120
you were a psych tech.

1576
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,540
Don't give away.

1577
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,840
Don't give away my secrets, Pease.

1578
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,120
Yeah, come on.

1579
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,500
It's live radio, dude.

1580
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,820
Come on, man.

1581
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,280
Every week with you, Pease.

1582
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,540
Every week.

1583
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:30,800
I don't know.

1584
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,600
I don't know what's the matter with you.

1585
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,740
And yet you're so good.

1586
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,460
I'm sorry I did a bad show, guys.

1587
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,940
You're so good and you're so...

1588
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,160
You're so bad.

1589
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,320
I'm sorry I didn't do

1590
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,320
a very good show tonight.

1591
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,900
You're so good, man.

1592
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,340
You're so...

1593
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,700
Well, you know,

1594
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,080
we used to have a tradition here

1595
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,580
on time for the show

1596
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,180
that I'm going to bring back right now.

1597
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:51,620
I'm sorry.

1598
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:51,620


1599
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:51,620


1600
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,660
Because it is 1158 Eastern Daylight Time.

1601
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:55,800
It's done.

1602
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,480
The show ends at midnight

1603
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,280
and we used to do a thing

1604
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,460
where Pease would have

1605
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,420
an obligatory apology

1606
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,440
that he would make

1607
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,460
that we would use to end the show.

1608
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,220
So, Reverend Sick Pease Sick.

1609
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,240
I'm sorry.

1610
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,140
We're going to end the show

1611
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,180
and before we get to your apology,

1612
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,220
Reverend Pease,

1613
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,400
before we get to that,

1614
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,440
I just want to say

1615
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,560
that I'm Fid Chuli

1616
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,540
and the engineer next to me

1617
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,320
that you've been hearing

1618
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,380
from time to time

1619
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,480
is Argus Q. Fox

1620
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,540
and we're broadcasting

1621
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,320
from Hypercube Laboratories

1622
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,780
in the former Spanish Empire.

1623
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,840
You're Reverend Pease.

1624
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,020
Reverend Couchloth,

1625
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,560
my personal therapist,

1626
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,760
was kind enough to join us.

1627
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,340
Thank you, Reverend Couchloth.

1628
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,220
Is there anything you want to plug?

1629
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,620
Well, we're going to end the show

1630
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,700
and we're wrapping it up, buddy.

1631
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,320
Anything you want to get out there?

1632
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,760
Anything you want to plug up?

1633
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,480
Anything I want to plug?

1634
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,660
No, just my 42-minute cycling butt plug there.

1635
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,600
I think that'll do.

1636
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,280
All right.

1637
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,000
Well, your check is in the mail.

1638
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:05,520
In the mail.

1639
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,080
Now, I accept Dogecoin.

1640
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,900
Dogecoin is the future.

1641
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,200
Wow.

1642
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,480
I'm going to have to make

1643
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,040
some conversions really quickly.

1644
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,040
Yeah, how many Dobscoins

1645
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,700
go into a Dogecoin now?

1646
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,920
One billion.

1647
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,600
I'm a Dobscoin millionaire.

1648
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:21,860
I'm a millionaire.

1649
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,260
How many you got?

1650
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,440
You got a million of them?

1651
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,360
I've got over a million.

1652
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,460
I've got almost two million Dobscoins.

1653
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:27,920
Yeah.

1654
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:28,840
All right.

1655
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,620
I don't know how many I've got.

1656
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,560
I don't have any of that.

1657
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,540
Not as many as me, probably.

1658
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,120
Pease, we're up against the clock here.

1659
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:34,760
Send me your Dobscoins.

1660
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,120
I want them.

1661
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,820
So, Pease, you got your apology chambered or what?

1662
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,600
Okay, so for all the aforementioned people,

1663
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,680
this is time for the show.

1664
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,180
You're listening to freethinkradio.com.

1665
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,540
That's what you're hearing this on,

1666
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,520
even if it's a podcast.

1667
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,580
And to close the show,

1668
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:57,440
here is Reverend Pease with his apology.

1669
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,100
So, everybody, I'm super sorry.

1670
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,260
Wait, hold on, Reverend Pease.

1671
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,500
I have to tie my shoe.

1672
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,500
Hold on.

1673
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,180
Hold on.

1674
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,680
I'm sorry that we spent a lot of time talking about it.

1675
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,840
And then when we went in segues into the patches

1676
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,960
for DocFox and the right angles,

1677
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,280
I probably should have been more fluid and verbose then.

1678
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,440
And then we talked a lot about FIDS,

1679
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:30,420
and I'm sorry that I went on so long about that.

1680
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:35,080
And I'm sorry that so many things on the show

1681
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,380
were awesome and funny,

1682
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,520
and that FID didn't see the humor in it,

1683
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,960
but still, it was probably the best show we ever did.

1684
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,200
I'm sorry to the homeless guy who Argus bothered yesterday

1685
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,580
when he asked where FID was.

1686
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,080
The guy said, you get out of here or I'll punch you too.

1687
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,420
Corn dog, you know, I'm not gonna punch you.

1688
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:51,420


1689
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:51,420


1690
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:51,420


1691
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,700
The lady didn't know where FID was,

1692
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,560
but she did seem more receptive to seeing FID again

1693
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,300
than the other guy.

1694
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,700
And of course, I'm sorry that the show's drawn to a close

1695
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,240
because except for Monday nights,

1696
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,200
the only thing you have to look to is Tuesday nights at 10

1697
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,600
when you have Share a Slice,

1698
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,580
and Thursday nights at 10 when you have

1699
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,900
Anti-Social Engineering,

1700
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,820
all here on freethinkradio.com,

1701
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,760
your entertainment vortex.

1702
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,920
See you guys next week.

1703
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,060
Man, that was such a good close piece.

1704
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,060
Such a good close that I'm gonna start saying stuff

1705
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,780
and ruin it for you, you know?

1706
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,840
Like, because there's no fun kicking down a sandcastle

1707
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,940
that's poorly built.

1708
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,060
The fun is kicking down a sandcastle

1709
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,860
that's really well-crafted.

1710
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,780
And Reverend Pease, goddammit,

1711
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:47,000
you were just a sparkling, sparkling fucking comet of radio.

1712
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,900
You know that, my boy?

1713
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,180
I'm shining on like a diamond.

1714
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,880
We're already over time,

1715
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,220
and I just can't stop.

1716
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:54,680
Over time?

1717
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah, we're done.

1718
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,100
Yeah, we're cutting into the other thing,

1719
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,880
but it's the playlist.

1720
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:00,620
Well, it...

1721
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,400
What do you have to say?

1722
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,780
Keep listening.

1723
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,600
This is it.

1724
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,000
We're done.

1725
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,700
Keep listening to Freethink Radio

1726
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,880
for the old-time radio show.

1727
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,300
If you like old-time radio broadcasts,

1728
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,020
stay tuned,

1729
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,600
because we're going out right now.

1730
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,860
The name of the show is Time for the Show.

1731
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,640
We'll see you next Monday at 10.

1732
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,440
Love you, bye.

1733
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:21,800
Bye.

1734
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,800
I like show.

1735
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,040
So, you don't want to do the show anymore?

1736
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,840
You all sad?

1737
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,280
No more show?

1738
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,520
If Pease get to you...

1739
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,440
Are you talking to me?

1740
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,260
I'm talking to you!

1741
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,000
Oh, no, I thought...

1742
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,660
We were just trying to hit the midnight.

1743
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,220
Did Pease get to you?

1744
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,380
Are you all angry?

1745
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,540
Pease, why'd you piss him off?

1746
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,500
I didn't piss him off, did I?

1747
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,300
I'm sorry, dude.

1748
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,820
Pease, that was not cool, man!

1749
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,880
That was not cool!

1750
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,580
What the hell was that?

1751
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:08,200
You know what?

1752
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,080
Never again!

1753
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,680
Never again!

1754
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,340
Oh, this is so funny.

1755
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,900
I just can't imagine what somebody could do

1756
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,320
to turn Fit off, though.

1757
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:20,920
Oh, this is...

1758
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,740
This is too crazy for me.

1759
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,560
I gotta get out of here.

1760
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,200
Why?

1761
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,140
I think...

1762
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,940
I thought it was a good show.

1763
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,920
No, because Fit has a high talk.

1764
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,560
I thought it was a great show.

1765
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:32,900
I think it was the best show ever.

1766
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,840
I thought it was a good one.

1767
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,920
It's always the best show ever.

1768
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,520
We were able to stretch Blind Eye out for 30 minutes.

1769
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,380
Which we never actually did.

1770
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,400
I didn't do mine.

1771
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,520
Fit never did one.

1772
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,240
Who did one?

1773
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,080
Pease and Fox?

1774
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,120
Yeah, I got through mine,

1775
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,120
and Count Sloth expanded on it pretty well.

1776
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:50,680
They talk...

1777
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,760
I wouldn't grab a cigarette.

1778
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,620
I was listening on the intercoms.

1779
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,080
Wait, Count Sloth, are you still there?

1780
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,440
No.

1781
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,360
Okay, never mind, then.

1782
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:58,940
He's out of here.

1783
00:59:59,060 --> 00:59:59,500
Never mind.

1784
00:59:59,560 --> 00:59:59,900
He left.

1785
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,960
Great, we can talk shit about him now.

1786
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,360
I hate that guy.

1787
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,100
Oh, you're there?

1788
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:04,560
Oh.

1789
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,040
He's still here.

1790
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,040
Never mind about that thing.

1791
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,520
I just...

1792
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,100
I was...

1793
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,140
I was kidding.

1794
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:10,920
I was...

1795
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,460
Well, I guess we'll have to

1796
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,280
get our legal work done somewhere else.

1797
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,320
Yeah.

1798
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,100
I suppose so.

1799
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,500
Thanks for making things.

1800
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,600
It's harder for us, Fit.

1801
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,400
Oh, hey, Count Sloth.

1802
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,460
Thanks for coming on the show.

1803
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,560
You're great.

1804
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:27,880
Yeah, thanks, dude.

1805
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:28,740
You're great.

1806
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,220
Yeah, thanks a bunch.

1807
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,860
Yeah, I'm still kind of, like,

1808
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:32,640
new to the whole thing,

1809
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,180
but I appreciate the chance to get out there

1810
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,900
and, you know, try to get it a little weird.

1811
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,020
Shoot, we've had...

1812
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,480
We've had people jump on,

1813
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,980
and it's been like...

1814
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,940
They wanted to come on and, like,

1815
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,180
do internet radio,

1816
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,920
and some of them, they freeze up.

1817
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,700
They don't know what to do,

1818
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,100
so you're able to jump in,

1819
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,720
and you got the funny joke-a-ha times.

1820
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,360
And you're on the Patreon?

1821
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,800
Yeah, yeah, and I didn't know.

1822
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,960
I actually didn't know

1823
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,420
I would get an autographed portrait of Muhammad

1824
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,700
for $9.11, so...

1825
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,920
You sure the hell still can?

1826
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,960
I'm going to lock that up soon.

1827
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:11,360
I'm going to move it up to $19.11.

1828
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,000
Well, that's how...

1829
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,140
In Europe, they put the day first,

1830
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,720
and then the month,

1831
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,720
so that's 11-9.

1832
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,180
Extra show, right.

1833
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,900
But, yeah, a couple of our Patreons

1834
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:30,480
have already got their autographed self-portrait

1835
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,140
of the Prophet Muhammad,

1836
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,720
because Muhammad's the only one

1837
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,080
who's allowed to draw Muhammad.

1838
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:40,700
So, Dr. Fox will draw you...

1839
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,800
Actually, he already has

1840
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,640
an autographed self-portrait

1841
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,500
of the Prophet Muhammad.

1842
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:52,600
So, Dr. Fox,

1843
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:52,600


1844
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:52,600


1845
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:52,600


1846
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,120
The last...

1847
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,080
Is this part of the show cost extra?

1848
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,300
Which part?

1849
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:56,740
I don't know.

1850
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:57,860
You'd have to ask Drugs.

1851
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:58,440
He's listening.

1852
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,880
We're not on the show.

1853
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,740
The show's over.

1854
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,580
The show's still going on.

1855
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,220
It's beautiful.

1856
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,680
I don't think so.

1857
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,080
I'm pretty sure this is connected.

1858
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,040
Is it?

1859
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:09,560
I don't know.

1860
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,180
Drew just said,

1861
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,280
I haven't gotten my drawing.

1862
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,240
Hmm.

1863
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,180
Well, yeah, he hasn't gotten his drawing yet.

1864
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:14,520
It's out.

1865
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,820
I don't know.

1866
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,980
You'd have to ask Drugs.

1867
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,580
He's listening.

1868
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,000
We're not on the show.

1869
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,500
The show...

1870
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:20,660
The show...

1871
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,700
Yeah, nobody...

1872
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,720
The show's still going on.

1873
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,700
It's pretty beautiful.

1874
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,820
He hasn't gotten his, but...

1875
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,140
Is it?

1876
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,760
He's gonna get his,

1877
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,420
and you're gonna...

1878
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:29,780
I don't know.

1879
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,440
Drew just said,

1880
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,380
I haven't gotten my...

1881
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,840
I'm gonna get mine.

1882
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,280
Yes.

1883
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,580
No, we're not broadcasting.

1884
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,120
No, wait.

1885
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,080
I don't know.

1886
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,900
The show's over, everybody.

1887
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,000
I don't know what...

1888
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,680
It's fine.

1889
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:44,500
Well, everybody just relax, please.

1890
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,840
Everybody relax.

1891
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,680
We need to stay calm here, okay?

1892
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,480
If things...

1893
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,440
The show's still on,

1894
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,720
then it's not gonna be good for any of us, okay?

1895
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,840
So I need everybody to just relax.

1896
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,200
I can assure you that.

1897
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,080
Are there life vests?

1898
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,300
I clicked, you know,

1899
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,260
I clicked record when we started the show.

1900
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,340
I'm pretty sure I turned it off at the end.

1901
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,360
The music's done.

1902
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,960
No, it's still...

1903
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,620
We're still on the show, dude.

1904
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,120
Okay?

1905
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,080
We're heading towards the iceberg.

1906
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,180
Stop clinging to your beliefs

1907
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,740
that there's some kind of show out there.

1908
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,900
You're just being desperate.

1909
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,400
Forget it.

1910
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:20,420
Forget it.

1911
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:20,420


1912
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:20,420


1913
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:20,580
Okay?

1914
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:21,860
For the...

1915
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:24,420
If anybody of you think we're still broadcasting

1916
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,800
or still recording,

1917
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,060
you're just being desperate.

1918
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,920
You're clinging to some belief

1919
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,060
that somebody out there

1920
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,840
is still listening to.

1921
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,100
And guess what?

1922
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,880
Nobody's listening.

1923
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,500
That's what you need to come to terms with.

1924
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,060
Actually...

1925
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:39,520
Okay?

1926
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,140
Nobody's listening.

1927
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,180
Actually, I'm getting a DM

1928
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,840
from NASA's legal department right now.

1929
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,460
It's only a two-hour show.

1930
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,600
Oh, my God.

1931
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,020
They are pissed at FID.

1932
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,600
The whole legal department?

1933
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:55,520
That's Salvation and Infotation

1934
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,620
at www.subgenius.com

1935
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,000
Or, got that pencil ready?

1936
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,340
P.O. Box 807

1937
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,860
Glen Rose, Texas

1938
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:08,460
76043

1939
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,940
Dear It's Time for the Show,

1940
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,420
as a legal representative,

1941
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,400
NASA's legal team...

1942
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:22,620
Yeah.

1943
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:23,520
Whatever.

1944
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,340
Legal...

1945
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,220
I think that P's and Argus

1946
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,340
have done a wonderful job

1947
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,100
explaining and keeping

1948
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,760
the maintenance of the show going.

1949
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,140
Whereas, we now order and demand

1950
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:37,120
that FID truly refrain

1951
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,800
from mentioning any aspect

1952
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,260
or team member

1953
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,580
of the NASA legal department.

1954
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,440
P's and Argus may mention it

1955
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,620
as much as they like.

1956
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:49,540
But...

1957
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:49,900
But...

1958
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,360
FID may not.

1959
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,720
Oh, shit.

1960
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,040
Whoa.

1961
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,860
Stein, NASA's lawyer.

1962
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,980
That made me laugh.

1963
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,020
I get two.

1964
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,880
That's how the whole world

1965
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,780
is just lined up.

1966
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,620
They're waiting for FID, Julie,

1967
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,960
to have just a moment to occur.

1968
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,140
And they want...

1969
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,540
What they really, really want

1970
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,480
is to just get that one thing

1971
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:15,960
that they're...

1972
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,240
Yeah.

1973
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,160
Like when he peed in the microphone.

1974
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,740
You stop that.

1975
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,620
And that was great.

1976
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,020
That was good.

1977
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,400
But he got punched in the face.

1978
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:24,800
Oh.

1979
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:25,760
He got...

1980
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,400
I was there

1981
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,040
when he got punched in the face.

1982
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,080
I was filming it.

1983
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:29,540
I feel like...

1984
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,260
We could make you feel like

1985
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,040
you were there.

1986
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,080
I've got a...

1987
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,460
I was looking at some of this crazy,

1988
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,400
like,

1989
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,440
free plug-ins

1990
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,000
to run After Effects

1991
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,460
and you can make videos

1992
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,160
360 degrees.

1993
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,460
So stuff that you can put on

1994
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,500
and watch through like an Android...

1995
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:49,900
Android...

1996
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,600
Cardboard

1997
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,140
or an iPhone...

1998
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:52,980
whatever.

1999
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,380
And I'm gonna see if I can make

2000
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,520
like a 360 version

2001
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,720
of FID getting punched

2002
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,720
and I'll do a surround sound mix

2003
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,260
of the slapping in his face.

2004
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,200
Slap.

2005
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,000
I only wanted a piece of the corndog.

2006
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,760
Did I deserve these diamonds?

2007
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,640
Yeah, the blood was coming from...

2008
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,480
I can't remember if it was

2009
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,780
on the outside of his nose

2010
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:12,680
or from the inside.

2011
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,560
He had like a...

2012
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,200
a scrape,

2013
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,500
but I think he got that

2014
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:15,800
when he...

2015
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,440
No, it was from my nose.

2016
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,660
From your nose?

2017
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:18,240
Yeah.

2018
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,540
And I'll do a surround sound.

2019
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,940
What did that dirty hippie thing

2020
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:21,980
giving you that flyer

2021
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,240
was gonna do?

2022
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:23,940
What?

2023
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,240
At the id,

2024
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,080
it's like,

2025
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:27,920
I'm bleeding you guys

2026
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,660
like you're bleeding dude

2027
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,600
and then he gives them a...

2028
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,380
Yeah, he had an advertiser

2029
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,780
for like free parking

2030
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,700
at City Walk.

2031
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,560
Here's a really hard

2032
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,620
piece of paper

2033
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,480
to wipe your blood up with.

2034
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,060
Here's a piece of feeder paper

2035
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,140
from my pocket.

2036
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,220
It's like somebody

2037
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,020
giving you cardboard

2038
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,620
to staunch your wound with.

2039
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,140
Oh no,

2040
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,140
I wish like somebody

2041
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,980
with a tampon

2042
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:50,580
had run up.

2043
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,660
It's not a...

2044
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,820
It's pretty absorbent, dude.

2045
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,600
Bite off the...

2046
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,780
It just goes back once.

2047
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:56,680
It's not a time.

2048
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:56,980
But no,

2049
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,120
I think I set the video

2050
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,020
back to private.

2051
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,240
I gotta blur

2052
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,400
the guy's face out,

2053
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:01,900
you know.

2054
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:02,540
Why?

2055
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,020
You assaulted somebody.

2056
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,260
He assaulted somebody.

2057
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,120
Let him sue you.

2058
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:07,840
Well, we're gonna try

2059
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,460
and make money

2060
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,600
off of Fid getting his...

2061
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,000
his nose broken.

2062
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:12,760
So, um...

2063
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:13,560
Uh,

2064
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,640
because I don't have

2065
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,960
the guy's consent

2066
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,620
to be in the video...

2067
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:18,860
Fid has...

2068
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:19,120
Fid has...

2069
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,080
Fid did have the guy's

2070
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,140
consent to get punched.

2071
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,620
I say when you punch

2072
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:23,860
somebody in a public place

2073
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,260
and he gets posted

2074
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:25,680
on the internet,

2075
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,300
you don't gotta blur

2076
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,300
the person's face out.

2077
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,500
They committed assault.

2078
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,540
They deserved it.

2079
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,900
If I'm gonna monetize

2080
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,060
the video I do.

2081
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:34,160
Have you consulted

2082
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:34,660
with Josh?

2083
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,640
Have you consulted

2084
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,600
with Tosh Dono?

2085
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,820
All of the religions

2086
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,520
apocalyptic

2087
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,260
have happened.

2088
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,240
Different people.

2089
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,400
And the leading

2090
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,200
conclusion I can get

2091
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,660
is just blur the face.

2092
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,260
You guys don't know.

2093
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:47,820
That's it.

2094
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,580
That's all we gotta do.

2095
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,060
We just go up

2096
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:49,820
He's running in the face.

2097
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:50,480
He's stupid.

2098
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,760
I mean, if you want to leave the face in the face, you can, but you have to charge him.

2099
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,140
Did Fitt's friend from NASA on the legal department give you that advice?

2100
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:57,980
Like, hey, will you sign a consent letter?

2101
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:58,260
No, no, no.

2102
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:58,840
Charge him.

2103
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,340
Charge him with the assault, and then it becomes evidence.

2104
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,780
Then it's evidence, and then you can use it for nothing.

2105
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,440
I don't know.

2106
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,500
I don't know.

2107
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,300
Every religion.

2108
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:07,460
I don't know.

2109
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,580
Ask Fitt's girlfriend.

2110
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,500
All of their apocalypse.

2111
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,360
Fitt, are you guys going to go snuggle again?

2112
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,420
Same time.

2113
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:15,740
Okay.

2114
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,440
I got to go.

2115
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,440
I got to snuggle date.

2116
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,360
You want to hear this?

2117
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:21,320
They were all right.

2118
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:24,240
The apocalypse happened, everybody.

2119
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:29,800
Every religion's apocalypse has already happened.

2120
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:30,700
I would.

2121
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:34,840
And it happened over two decades ago.

2122
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:35,700
Fine.

2123
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:40,520
You're all waiting for when the world is going to end.

2124
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,280
The world's already ended.

2125
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,780
We've been living after the end time.

2126
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,280
We've been living for a long time now.

2127
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,000
And she's like, tell me I'm pretty.

2128
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,980
And he goes, you're pretty.

2129
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,880
And then she looks at me and she goes, do you think we figured it out?

2130
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,040
And I'm like, I'm not going to answer that.

2131
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,460
Do you think that we're crazy?

2132
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,580
And Fitt's like, you don't know what we figured out.

2133
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,240
Do you think that she hung out with Fitt?

2134
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,640
But you're not going to laugh at us.

2135
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,020
When we're together.

2136
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:19,120
When we're together.

2137
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:22,020
When we're the only ones that can help you.

2138
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:25,080
Do you think that she spent all that time with Fitt just to spite you?

2139
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,320
You're not going to laugh at us.

2140
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:31,260
When we're the only ones in the lifeboat.

2141
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,840
I pointed to the ring on my phone.

2142
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:38,780
To be able to get you out of the thing that you laughed at us.

2143
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,020
That was saying the whole time was true.

2144
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,860
Their nest of sin.

2145
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,000
Go ahead.

2146
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:49,120
Go ahead.

2147
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:51,100
Say who you are now.

2148
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,160
And you can remember.

2149
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,700
And we can remember.

2150
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,440
Where's my phone?

2151
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,120
Where's my phone?

2152
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:58,980
Hold on, peas.

2153
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:04,080
I'm going to get the dirt.

2154
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:06,980
Where's Dr. Fox's phone?

2155
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:07,800
Guess what?

2156
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,680
You've got bigger problems to worry about, everybody.

2157
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:17,220
We've got bigger problems to worry about, everybody.

2158
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,920
You know what's happened in the last 20 years?

2159
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,720
The same thing that's happened in the 20 years previous to it.

2160
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,920
Did he get his phone?

2161
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,660
Because we've got dirt with Fitt.

2162
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,040
Why do you think everything today is a reboot?

2163
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:35,900
He's searching it right now.

2164
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:38,100
We're still on the radio, which is kind of off.

2165
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:39,600
I think that's going to be gone.

2166
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:46,000
Why do you think everything today is a reboot?

2167
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,400
Did they just cut me off?

2168
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,200
Of something.

2169
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:55,060
From days past, the world has ended.

2170
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:02,000
All of the world's religions were correct.

2171
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,380
He's so smooth.

2172
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,660
Look at the moves, Fitt.

2173
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,980
The subgenius to Christianity.

2174
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:11,080
You are making it happen.

2175
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:13,320
To Hinduism.

2176
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,020
All.

2177
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,000
Yeah, I see it.

2178
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,220
He is making it happen.

2179
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,540
All of the world's religions ever invented.

2180
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,260
Don't show anybody.

2181
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:32,660
Their concurrence of the apocalypse converged on the same date.

2182
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,160
Did you get to sit on those, Fitt?

2183
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:40,920
The apocalypse of all of the world's religions converged on the same date.

2184
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,120
You are on the air, dude.

2185
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:42,920
Just so you know.

2186
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,020
This whole 20 minutes has been on the air.

2187
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,540
No, my mic's not working.

2188
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:46,640
Hello?

2189
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,380
That date.

2190
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,220
That date was predicted correctly.

2191
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:51,760
The date was predicted correctly.

2192
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:53,780
That date was.

2193
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,500
Oh, it's turned off.

2194
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:58,860
All of the world's religions went to hell.

2195
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,180
You know, I'm gonna call bullshit.

2196
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:04,520
I don't see a video game or TV anywhere around those sex toys.

2197
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,740
The date of the apocalypse was only predicted correctly.

2198
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,500
A video game?

2199
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,340
Yeah.

2200
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,380
Which sex toys do you use?

2201
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:09,820
Were they?

2202
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,080
Well, I can't discuss it now.

2203
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,920
You said be quiet.

2204
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,700
That religion was the church of the subgenius.

2205
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:15,340
No, I said don't show anybody.

2206
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:16,080
Don't show it.

2207
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,080
Oh, then I won't show anybody.

2208
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,200
There we go.

2209
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,100
Oh, right there in the back.

2210
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:18,200
Only the subgenius.

2211
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:18,200


2212
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:18,200


2213
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:18,200


2214
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:24,440
The church of the subgenius predicted the correct date of the apocalypse.

2215
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,420
Do you see the big silver one?

2216
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:35,140
The only thing the big silver one was incorrect about was that the conspiracy was wrong about

2217
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,640
the calendar.

2218
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,140
The wedge.

2219
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:38,180
The wedge.

2220
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:43,220
So even though they were mad that the date of the apocalypse was 25th 1998.

2221
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,300
Oh, she's got one of those love pillows that you hear about on Howard Stern.

2222
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,180
Is that the one?

2223
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,120
The one that you turn the knob and it like vibrates?

2224
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:57,880
No, it's got like a wedge shape and you put it up the hips or something and it supposedly

2225
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:02,840
positions the squishy part to where you can get right at that G spot.

2226
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,400
Oh, are you guys talking about sex wedge?

2227
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,000
Yeah, there you go.

2228
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,960
Is there a commercial for sex wedge?

2229
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,560
Hold on.

2230
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,460
There is now.

2231
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,680
They got the factory for those like up the road from my place.

2232
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,760
Do you like to bang lawyers from NASA like-

2233
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:18,140
The apocalypse.

2234
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:23,400
Of every world religion did in fact occur.

2235
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,040
Do you like oxtails and vodka?

2236
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:27,440
1998.

2237
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,520
Do you like oxtails and vodka and Pokemon?

2238
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,920
Hypercube laboratories.

2239
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:38,480
You need to read Finchley's new book on how to score lawyer chicks from NASA to hear

2240
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:38,480


2241
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:48,180
That, July 5th 1998, was in fact the convergence of the apocalypse of the world.

2242
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:55,500
There is a picture of every world religion ever invented or conceived or possibly conceived.

2243
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,140
So did she really like your drama?

2244
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:06,600
And then we are now living in the post-apocalyptic world side of every major religion.

2245
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,500
Is he crying?

2246
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:15,220
This means that since every world religion apocalypse has occurred-

2247
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:18,000
I would say she's a real live sexy girl but this picture-

2248
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,160
There is a picture of every world religion.

2249
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,780
Doesn't really tell me if she's actually alive.

2250
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,340
The wedge is another great contributor shape.

2251
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:27,580
One of the things that it's most known for is oral sex.

2252
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,680
Cunnilingus in particular.

2253
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,680
It is a serving platter for the genitals.

2254
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:39,960
Another great use for it is actually elevating the woman's hips so that you can hit different angles and deeper penetration.

2255
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,580
With a shallower penetration you can actually get the G-spot.

2256
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,720
And a deeper penetration-

2257
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,920
My cat's fighting a very large vinyl cow.

2258
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:54,500
You can use it to lay over for anal and analingus.

2259
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:59,700
Another great feature of the wedge is the ability to improve your endurance.

2260
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:04,180
You can actually stay on this in positions for longer periods of time.

2261
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:10,960
With something like the wedge you're perfectly supported, very comfortable and you can stay in that for a long time.

2262
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:14,940
You can use it in conjunction with any of the other Liberator products.

2263
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,540
Specifically the ramp.

2264
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,800
The ramp with the wedge.

2265
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,980
The wedge is a very good combination.

2266
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,500
Be really inspired to try new things and have lots of fun together.

2267
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:33,160
If you have money for a game leading people to think that X-Day hadn't happened yet, wouldn't you continue to do it?

2268
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,340
Well it has.

2269
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:37,100
When it comes to the penis, the size and shape matter.

2270
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:46,240
There are so many different sizes and shapes and techniques and preferences that it's really hard to say.

2271
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,880
It's absolutely a good and a bad of every shape and size.

2272
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,100
And here are a couple of the most important ones.

2273
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:59,880
The most important one is by time control.

2274
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,960
We have to get back to that date.

2275
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:05,460
That happened a while ago.

2276
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,860
We're living in the aftermath.

2277
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:10,560
That's right.

2278
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:16,600
Everybody's still waiting for the ship to hit the fan.

2279
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,120
And you know where all these people live?

2280
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:24,680
You know where everybody who's waiting for the ship to hit the fan lives?

2281
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:31,280
They live in shit fan hitville.

2282
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,260
Because it's happened.

2283
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,080
It's spread all over the place.

2284
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,600
Just piles and piles.

2285
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,040
Spreadship.

2286
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:43,020
And there's those that'll tell you, no just look around.

2287
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,520
I do have the gas station.

2288
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:46,180
And the...

2289
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,200
I buy a bag of chips.

2290
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:51,640
Or I can go and get my hair cut.

2291
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,300
You know.

2292
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,060
I can go down to the bar and buy some drinks.

2293
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:58,340
Yeah, society's totally intact.

2294
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,520
Just look at this.

2295
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,560
I pay taxes.

2296
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,040
You know.

2297
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:07,520
I write things down on paper and put it in the mailbox.

2298
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,660
And I get things back in the mailbox.

2299
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,780
Things written down on paper back to me.

2300
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,400
You know.

2301
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,600
I go to the store and I buy something.

2302
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:22,760
And I get a piece of paper with like a lot of numbers on it.

2303
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,740
And like a date and a time.

2304
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,140
And it's the date and the time that I did it.

2305
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,920
And so there's that.

2306
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,940
And then I have these like...

2307
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:32,640
I have like a...

2308
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,680
I have a piece...

2309
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,780
I have this like plastic thing in my pocket.

2310
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,140
And it's got my face on it.

2311
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,740
And it's got all kinds of assignments.

2312
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:45,140
They're really special to me.

2313
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:50,280
And even like computer code on the back of it.

2314
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,120
That a computer can read.

2315
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,280
And that's special to me too.

2316
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,040
And they can do that.

2317
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,040
And they know who I am.

2318
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,200
Right?

2319
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,180
So it's intact.

2320
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,000
Everything's working.

2321
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,200
It's gotta work.

2322
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:08,180
I...

2323
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,360
The light turns red.

2324
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,720
I stop and go.

2325
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,020
And so does everybody else.

2326
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:18,380
And as we're stopping and the light's green.

2327
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,800
And all the people are going on the other side.

2328
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,300
So it can't just be me.

2329
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:22,840
Right?

2330
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,260
I can't...

2331
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,240
I'm not crazy.

2332
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,700
I mean look it.

2333
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,320
Everybody else is doing it.

2334
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:29,880
Look at that.

2335
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:30,540
They're...

2336
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,620
I see the lights.

2337
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,620
And they see the lights.

2338
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,320
And we both...

2339
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,160
And we get home safe.

2340
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:41,180
Oh.

2341
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,360
We're...

2342
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,840
We're guaranteed the safety.

2343
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:48,820
From...

2344
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:49,080
That...

2345
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,440
That obedience.

2346
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,080
Oh.

2347
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,680
The sweet, sweet milk of obedience.

2348
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,860
I'm so safe.

2349
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,040
I have my property.

2350
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:06,680
That's mine.

2351
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,520
And uh...

2352
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,880
And I respect other people's property.

2353
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,800
That's theirs.

2354
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,420
I respect their property.

2355
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,320
I respect their property.

2356
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,560
This is...

2357
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,020
This is...

2358
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,820
In the...

2359
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:21,260
In the...

2360
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:22,260
They're going...

2361
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,260
Those red and...

2362
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,100
Those red lights are gonna come back.

2363
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:28,080
They're gonna come back a lot.

2364
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,420
My toaster...

2365
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:32,220
My toaster's gotta work by the minute.

2366
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,560
My microwave's only got red light on it.

2367
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,640
And I put...

2368
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,080
Metal in it.

2369
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,040
Don't...

2370
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,380
I gave my...

2371
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,660
I gave my cat braces.

2372
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,320
Because his...

2373
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,960
Because his teeth weren't quite straight.

2374
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,980
And I put him in the microwave and the red light came on.

2375
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,600
That's when they took me somewhere.

2376
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,860
Somewhere bad.

2377
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:02,140
The following reports of weather temperature and wind were made at 11 AM.

2378
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,420
They made me...

2379
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:04,920
DFW Airport.

2380
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,680
Listen to...

2381
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,220
Mostly sunny.

2382
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,520
Test patterns.

2383
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,020
91.

2384
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:08,820
2.68.

2385
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:12,360
They made me listen to emergency broadcast test patterns.

2386
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,380
With south at eight.

2387
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,400
Pressure 30.04.

2388
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,860
They were trying to work out...

2389
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,320
Fort Worth region.

2390
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,220
Sunny.

2391
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,360
I have my implant.

2392
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,600
South at five.

2393
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,700
They were trying to find the resonant frequency.

2394
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:24,720
Mostly sunny.

2395
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:25,600
91.

2396
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,120
South at six.

2397
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:28,960
They found it.

2398
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:29,780
Mostly sunny.

2399
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:30,720
89.

2400
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:31,860
It's over.

2401
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,000
There's nothing I can do for you now.

2402
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,120
Mostly sunny.

2403
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:36,120


2404
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,580
Southwest at six.

2405
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:38,800
There's nothing I can do for you now.

2406
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:38,800


2407
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:38,800


2408
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:38,800


2409
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:38,800


2410
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:38,800


2411
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:38,800


2412
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:40,980
89.

2413
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:42,740
South at six.

2414
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,340
You better enjoy yourself.

2415
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,080
South at seven.

2416
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,840
What are you doing?

2417
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,420
You're listening to me?

2418
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,360
Alright.

2419
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,740
I got a front row seat.

2420
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,580
I believe.

2421
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,740
Come on.

2422
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:54,420
Mostly sunny.

2423
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:54,580
89.

2424
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,380
South at five.

2425
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:57,680
Waco.

2426
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,560
Sunny.

2427
01:20:58,900 --> 01:20:59,540
87.

2428
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,300
Variable at three.

2429
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,440
Tower.

2430
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:03,380
Sunny.

2431
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:04,380
87.

2432
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:06,260
Variable at five.

2433
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,560
Once again at 11 AM.

2434
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:08,780
Mostly sunny.

2435
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:08,780


2436
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:08,780


2437
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:08,780


2438
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:08,780


2439
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:08,780


2440
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:08,780


2441
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:18,160
That's right, put that tie on. It's a necktie. It's supposed to keep your shirt around your neck.

2442
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:25,060
But you never had trouble keeping your shirt around your neck, did you?

2443
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:30,300
It always just kind of stayed around there whether you had a tie on.

2444
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:37,220
Huh. So why the necktie?

2445
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,500
Make sure you get it nice and tight.

2446
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,420
Nice and tight.

2447
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:46,640
The heck? Here, let me show you how to do it.

2448
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:55,060
I want to show you how to do it and then you can do it that way for the rest of your life.

2449
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,980
It's the way I was shown how to do it.

2450
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:06,260
That's how you know it's the right way.

2451
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,540
You can just take it easy.

2452
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:19,540


2453
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:19,540


2454
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:23,260
Don't feel too bad if you don't get it right.

2455
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,000
Don't feel too bad.

2456
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:31,300
Just feel a little bit bad.

2457
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,480
That's all it takes.

2458
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,640
Just a little bit.

2459
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:38,700
That's all it takes.

2460
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:38,720
That's all it takes.

2461
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:38,740
That's all it takes.

2462
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,700
That's all it takes.

2463
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,120
That's all it takes.

2464
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:44,120


2465
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:44,420
Strong next.

2466
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:45,440
Right.

2467
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:49,660
You got something you got.

2468
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:49,900
Oh my God.

2469
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:50,680
Sorry.

2470
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:56,740
Don't wanna talk about it.

2471
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
So why I had to do it myself?

2472
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,000


2473
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,140
And why did you do this?

2474
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:02,200
Oh, it was your little time- vários of precepts.

2475
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,140
Okay.

2476
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,420
For me...

2477
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:04,420


2478
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,240
The program is different.

2479
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,660
You were doing better than the gyula, but you just keep it nice and tight until you say so.

2480
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,500
Do I have your attention yet?

2481
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:24,340
Because it's not the people that are trying to get your attention that you need to worry about.

2482
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:29,720
No, I mean, they might be full of shit.

2483
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,180
And most of them are.

2484
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,760
But they're not the ones that you need to worry about.

2485
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,700
It's the people that aren't trying to get your attention.

2486
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,340
Why is that true?

2487
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:54,320
Because it sounds kind of cool.

2488
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:55,580
You know?

2489
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,760
That's pretty much it.

2490
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,800
I mean, go ahead.

2491
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:02,080
Try.

2492
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:02,500
Try it out.

2493
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:10,540
Right now, I want you to put on headphones so I can talk to you.

2494
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:18,900
And I want you to put on headphones and I want you to walk outside.

2495
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:31,460
And I want you to do what I just told you to do, which is actively, actively avoid anybody who is not trying to get your attention.

2496
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:37,000
And I want you to do that aggressively and vigorously.

2497
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:57,880
I want you to vigorously and abstrusively and obstinately and slapmacklify avoid anybody who is not trying to get your attention as hard as you can, viewer.

2498
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,060
I'm going to stay with you while you do it.

2499
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,120
We're going to do it live.

2500
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:05,300
Because, I don't know, I think we're, we might be live.

2501
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,240
Yeah, I guess we're live.

2502
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,120
All right.

2503
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,600
Breathing radio.

2504
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,740
I'm with you.

2505
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,540
I feel you.

2506
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:16,100
Yes.

2507
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,340
This is a very big moment for you, viewer.

2508
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:26,380
This is a turning point in your evolution, viewer.

2509
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,460
This is the turning point.

2510
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:36,100
This is the fulcrum of your evolution.

2511
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,840
This is the fulcrum of your evolution.

2512
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:44,060
Now run.

2513
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:48,220
The direction you're currently facing, just run.

2514
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:52,260
As fast as you can.

2515
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,320
And clap.

2516
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:57,540
Run and clap.

2517
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,160
And sing.

2518
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:05,280
The national anthem of Bangladesh.

2519
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:10,580
And you better clap to the beat and sing that nerf word.

2520
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,620
Oh, yeah.

2521
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:17,860
Come on.

2522
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:18,440
Come on.

2523
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,960
Come on.

2524
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:24,600
Come on.

2525
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:24,880


2526
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:25,500


2527
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:26,800
Come on.

2528
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,400
Come on.

2529
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,600
Come on.

2530
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,440
Come on.

2531
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:30,440


2532
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:30,440


2533
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:30,440


2534
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,200
Oh, my God.

2535
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,980
Come on.

2536
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,460
Is it the question that please ask?

2537
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,720
Oh, my god.

2538
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:55,080
To put some music into that and I was already thinking about what I wanted.

2539
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,780
I didn't see the Keshi, you're gonna go and yep.

2540
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,860
So I need something like as you can see.

2541
01:26:58,860 --> 01:26:58,920
Can I ask you a question now?

2542
01:26:59,040 --> 01:26:59,160
Just then.

2543
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,440
What she would say and when and if she asked, could you please do the same thing?

2544
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:00,440


2545
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:00,440


2546
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:00,440


2547
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:00,440


2548
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:00,440


2549
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:00,440


2550
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,420
Oh, look at you.

2551
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,520
You just came back.

2552
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,580
You're all cut up.

2553
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,300
I got lots of band-aids.

2554
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,060
You know what they are?

2555
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:16,880
All I have is the children's band-aids that has the Tiny Toons characters on them.

2556
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,800
Hold on for a second while I go get them.

2557
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:26,260
Clip-clop, clip-clop, footsteps, footsteps, footsteps, footsteps, footsteps.

2558
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:28,260
Door opening.

2559
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,380
Rustling, rustling.

2560
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:31,980
Door closing.

2561
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:37,580
Footsteps getting closer, footsteps getting closer, footsteps getting closer, footsteps getting closer.

2562
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:44,580
Oh, here's the box of Looney Tunes band-aids that I just told you about a couple seconds ago.

2563
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,180
Oh, look at that.

2564
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,040
There aren't any of them in there.

2565
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,760
That must have been my son.

2566
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:57,240
You know, he likes to use the band-aids because they have his favorite characters on them.

2567
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,960
And even though he doesn't have cuts, he just likes to stick them on.

2568
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:01,960
Okay?

2569
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:05,420
So that's why I can't treat your wounds.

2570
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,020
And that's why you're going to die on my doorstep.

2571
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:11,760
Because my son likes Tiny Toons adventures.

2572
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:19,100
You can blame the people that made that show for your death right now in your dying breaths.

2573
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:23,560
I'll shut up if you want to say it because I know you don't have that much longer to go.

2574
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,500
I'm going to hold the microphone up to your face.

2575
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:40,900
And allow you to proclaim your dying breaths of hating my son and the creators of Tiny Toons adventures concurrently for that show being good.

2576
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:43,000
Here you go, your dying breaths, sir.

2577
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,880
Here you go.

2578
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,180
Here you go.

2579
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,160
Here you go.

2580
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,060
Here you go.

2581
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:01,900
Continuing the flight.

2582
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,560
Did you know

2583
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,420
that all of the clay

2584
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:03,320
that was made to animate Gumby

2585
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:08,140
was made from actual Gumby's?

2586
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,080
Eww!

2587
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:23,020
That's why I present to you

2588
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:25,520
my line of vegan Gumby's.

2589
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:33,620
Yes.

2590
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,300
The only people

2591
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,060
that we use

2592
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:43,320
to make our Gumby's

2593
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,560
for Benjamin Franklin.

2594
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,540
That's right.

2595
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:46,820
It's a limited edition.

2596
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:49,740
All of the clay

2597
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:53,280
that we use to make our Gumby characters

2598
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,540
was made from Benjamin Franklin's

2599
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:55,900
remains.

2600
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,000
Shh!

2601
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:58,240
Don't tell anybody.

2602
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:02,620
I'm not saying

2603
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:03,940
you shouldn't smoke it,

2604
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:04,740
but...

2605
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:06,340
Yeah.

2606
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,220
You're a grown-ass man.

2607
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:17,940
I'm a grown-ass man.

2608
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,920
I'm a grown-ass man.

2609
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:20,060
I'm a grown-ass man.

2610
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,740
I'm a grown-ass man.

2611
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:24,000
I'm a grown-ass man.

2612
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,020
I'm a grown-ass man.

2613
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:29,520
I'm a grown-ass man.

2614
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:29,520


2615
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:29,720
All right!

2616
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,820
I'm gonna blow you out of the river!

2617
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:36,520
This boy in class.

2618
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,920
Meat and eggs help the body grow

2619
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,220
and make it strong.

2620
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,680
Meat is good for you.

2621
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,300
And there's many kinds.

2622
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:47,640
There's beef.

2623
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:49,960
There's pork and ham.

2624
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:52,020
There's lamb.

2625
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:54,600
Fish is good.

2626
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,740
And so is chicken and other poultry.

2627
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,620
An egg a day is good for you, too.

2628
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:06,700
Boiled, fried, scrambled, poached, or any way.

2629
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:13,480
Meats and eggs are high in protein, which helps build red blood and strong muscles.

2630
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:20,180
The fourth finger, pointing the way to health, represents vegetables.

2631
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:26,780
And here Ralph thinks of several children in this class, for there are many kinds of vegetables.

2632
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,460
Potatoes, for instance, are an energy food.

2633
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:36,880
And baked potatoes, eaten with their skins in butter or margarine, have lots of vitamins and minerals, too.

2634
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:44,740
When it comes to green and yellow vegetables, Ralph thinks of Wendy, the prettiest girl in the class.

2635
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,600
And there are so many different kinds.

2636
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,160
Green vegetables.

2637
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:55,700
Vegetables like string beans, asparagus, and broccoli.

2638
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,680
There are salad vegetables like lettuce.

2639
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,600
Many others like celery, radishes, and carrots.

2640
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:06,620
Carrots are good, too.

2641
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:11,520
And so is squash and other yellow vegetables like rutabaga.

2642
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,680
Cauliflower and cabbage are good, too.

2643
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:19,020
Yes, there are hundreds of wonderful vegetables.

2644
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:25,840
The important thing is that all kinds of vegetables are good for you, whether they're raw or cooked.

2645
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:28,180
They're important for good health.

2646
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,440
Lots of energy and health.

2647
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,600
Clear skin and bright eyes.

2648
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,900
Shining, gleaming hair.

2649
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:41,760
And above all, for that wonderful sense of feeling.

2650
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:47,180
The last finger represents fruit.

2651
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,260
And there are two kinds.

2652
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:56,260
Some are especially rich in vitamin C and help ward off some of the diseases that keep you there.

2653
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,900
They help cuts and bruises heal faster, too.

2654
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:10,060
Foods with lots of vitamin C in them include orange juice, grapefruit, strawberries, melons, and of course, whole oranges.

2655
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,180
Certainly rich in different things.

2656
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:16,840
Certain vegetables like tomatoes and raw cabbage are also rich in vitamin C.

2657
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,160
You should have a vitamin C food every day.

2658
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,160


2659
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:26,620
every day. The body isn't stored in the body very long. Finally, they're the fruits we eat for

2660
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:34,100
dessert. Wonderful fruits like apples, bananas, peaches, pears, plums, grapes, and many others.

2661
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:40,960
Nuts make a good dessert too. They're rich in energy, proteins, vitamins, and minerals.

2662
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:47,940
And now, as Ralph thinks about it, he realizes that each of the children he admires depend on

2663
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:53,860
all the food. And not on just one food. George is strong, Wendy is pretty,

2664
01:34:54,760 --> 01:35:01,800
Linda has a bright smile, and Kenneth has lots of pets. Not because of any one food that they eat,

2665
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:09,480
but because they eat some of all kinds of food. For it takes five fingers to point the way to

2666
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,080
healthful eating habits.

2667
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,580
Ralph goes over to his mom.

2668
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:30,780
Every day, he eats bread and butter, milk and cheese, meat and eggs, vegetables, fruits, and a vitamin C food.

2669
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:42,860
Thinking about all this food has made him hungry. He has a candy bar around as usual, but now Ralph has a better idea of why he shouldn't

2670
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:45,940
let candy and sweets substitute for other foods.

2671
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,920
Sweets don't have any flavor.

2672
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:53,060
the proteins, the vitamins, or the minerals, the bodybuilding qualities of other foods.

2673
01:35:53,600 --> 01:36:00,020
And so, for the next few months, Ralph really worked at learning to eat all kinds of foods.

2674
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,640
Ralph, would you like some tea?

2675
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,060
Yeah, yeah. Well, okay.

2676
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,260
Well, what happened to you?

2677
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,780
He'd sample everything that was served to him.

2678
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:15,920
And even if it didn't happen to be a food that he preferred, he'd eat some of it anyway.

2679
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:20,260
Yeah, yeah.

2680
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:35,400
Night, he'd go over the five food groups and see how he had done that day.

2681
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:45,580
After a month or two of this, Ralph suddenly realized that a slow change had taken place without his noticing it.

2682
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:47,920
He found that eating it became...

2683
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:48,540
Become fun.

2684
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:53,840
What's more, his health was better, and he had more pets.

2685
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:57,580
He had more fun than he used to, and more friends.

2686
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:58,800
Everything still works.

2687
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:04,980
And all because he had learned to eat by counting his foods on his feed.

2688
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:06,280
Everything still works.

2689
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,720
Everything still works.

2690
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:19,920
Everything still works.

2691
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,800
Everything still works.

2692
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:27,180
Everything still works.

2693
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,320
Everything still works.

2694
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:31,320


2695
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:31,700
Everything is okay.

2696
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,120
Everything still works.

2697
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:40,700
Everything still works.

2698
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:43,020
Everything still works...

2699
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:44,420
Everything still works.

2700
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:45,900
Everything still works.

2701
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:46,340
Everything still works.

2702
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:47,000
Everything still works.

2703
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:47,640
Everything's still okay!

2704
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:59,220
I can go outside right now and choose one business or choose the other.

2705
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:01,720
Everything's okay.

2706
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:08,080
My money's just as good at one place as it is somewhere else.

2707
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:14,280
That must mean that the system is intact.

2708
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:19,500
Why, there's even public services.

2709
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:32,040
There's a fire department, police department, hospitals and schools and I mean all kinds

2710
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:38,100
of things and even parks and fun things, you know?

2711
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:43,420
And there's a justice system.

2712
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:43,720
Yeah.

2713
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:50,740
It's just that, you know, gives them what's coming to them and makes sure that people

2714
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:55,100
mind their reverend P's and reverend Q's.

2715
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:02,940
So the system, it must be intact, right?

2716
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,580
Everything, it has to be intact.

2717
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:06,420
I mean, look at that.

2718
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:07,280
It's all working.

2719
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:09,460
There's an economy.

2720
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:12,380
There's nations.

2721
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:13,700
There's...

2722
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,500
There's international relations between all these nations that are all doing things their

2723
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:23,960
all own way and it...

2724
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:27,400
So it must be working, right?

2725
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,320
This couldn't be.

2726
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,460
This couldn't...

2727
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:32,840
This is the world.

2728
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:33,600
This is...

2729
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,320
We're at the peak.

2730
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,880
This is the best things I've ever been, right?

2731
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:41,580
It has to be, right?

2732
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,700
Well, if it has to be...

2733
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:49,580
If it has to be, everybody, if it must be, if it has to be, if there's no other way to

2734
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:52,980
explain it, then it obviously isn't.

2735
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:54,780
It's obviously a cell.

2736
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:01,380
Because nothing that is real is obvious.

2737
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:11,960
The only things that are real, that are that too good to be true?

2738
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,680
What's that old saying?

2739
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,900
About things that are too good to be true?

2740
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:17,500
Well, there's someone here to tell you.

2741
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:17,960
That's right.

2742
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:18,980
Are you an inspiration?

2743
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:23,420
And what's the thing about all the discoveries that have always been made?

2744
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:29,480
All of the things that have left humankind forward.

2745
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:36,680
All of the things that have propelled our knowledge throughout the ages.

2746
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:38,800
They weren't things that were obvious.

2747
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,660
They were things that had to be discovered.

2748
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,240
Would you follow me, please?

2749
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:49,820
And through rigorous observation and experimentation, we came up with some truths.

2750
01:40:52,500 --> 01:41:02,280
This obvious lie that society is intact, isn't it getting old for you?

2751
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:05,120
Isn't it day after day?

2752
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:10,520
Isn't there something about you that just is kind of getting tired of it?

2753
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,220
We don't have it.

2754
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:17,640
Because I got tired of it a long time ago.

2755
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:25,480
And I know there's a lot of you out there that are pretty tired of it.

2756
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,920
And you're not exactly just tired of it.

2757
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,600
You kind of want it to go away.

2758
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,740
You know what I mean?

2759
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:40,440
And you kind of wish somebody would, you know, do something about it.

2760
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,200
But you're not.

2761
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,200


2762
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,200


2763
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,200


2764
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,200


2765
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,200


2766
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,200


2767
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,200


2768
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,080
You're not going to get to the point where somebody else would.

2769
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:44,500
I think I've known that for a long time.

2770
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:44,500


2771
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,240
I want to know what happened to the planet.

2772
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:45,240


2773
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:45,380
I want to know what happened to the planet.

2774
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:45,380


2775
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:52,380
Well, then you, the viewer, and I are kindred spirits.

2776
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:02,980
Because we, here at Hypercube Laboratories, have been looking into this issue for a little

2777
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:03,360
while.

2778
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:11,180
We've been doing a little bit of checking, double-checking, and poking around.

2779
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:11,180


2780
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:12,320
around this and that

2781
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,240
and

2782
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:16,920
at this point

2783
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,200
it's undeniable that what I've

2784
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,240
been trying to tell you

2785
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:22,300
this whole time is true.

2786
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:25,140
This is the post-apocalyptic

2787
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,180
world. All of the

2788
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,860
world's religions

2789
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:30,740
were right.

2790
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:32,920
The only religion

2791
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:35,080
that was right about the date was the church

2792
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,060
of the subgenius.

2793
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:38,560
It just so happened to be

2794
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,700
July 5th

2795
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:42,800
1998. That's when

2796
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,920
it happened. Yeah, I know

2797
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,320
a lot of you that are listening are subgeniuses

2798
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,120
and you paid your money for that saucer

2799
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:49,940
ride. Guess what?

2800
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:50,560
Oh!

2801
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:54,860
Ouch! Didn't get

2802
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:56,240
the saucer ride. Wow!

2803
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,720
Imagine that!

2804
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,160
You bought a

2805
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,000
spaceship ride

2806
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,300
from a salesman

2807
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:06,680
for $30

2808
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,720
and you

2809
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:09,720
got ripped off?

2810
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:11,020
Wow!

2811
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,280
I'm shocked!

2812
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,580
I'm shocked

2813
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:18,640
that the salesman that sold you

2814
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,700
the $30 ride

2815
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:22,380
the $30 spaceship ride

2816
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:23,960
ripped you off.

2817
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:24,680
Man!

2818
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,660
I don't blame you for not seeing

2819
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:30,140
that one coming a mile away.

2820
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,440
But guess what? You did pay for it

2821
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:34,760
and guess what? That was a legal

2822
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,340
contract and guess what?

2823
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,340
Even though

2824
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:40,540
apocalypse has come.

2825
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:42,140
And gone. And uh

2826
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:44,640
we can get into about

2827
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,640
the post-apocalyptic times

2828
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:48,220
that we're living in later.

2829
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:49,940
But even though that has

2830
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:51,020
all happened

2831
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,120
there's still a way out.

2832
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:55,560
That's a binding contract.

2833
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,400
If you

2834
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,480
could like, let's just say

2835
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,180
what if you could go

2836
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:04,360
back in time to the

2837
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:04,820
apocalypse?

2838
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:08,180
Because you did miss it. But you did

2839
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:09,200
pay for it.

2840
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:11,100
And that payment's

2841
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,960
still on record. If you could go back

2842
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,160
in time and uh

2843
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:16,600
to July 5th, 1998

2844
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,880
redeem that ticket

2845
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:21,060
you could get on that saucer. What if I told

2846
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:22,020
you that um

2847
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:25,200
maybe I knew a way to get you back

2848
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:25,460
there.

2849
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:28,740
I don't know.

2850
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:31,100
Something you'd be interested

2851
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:31,480
in?

2852
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:41,940
Hey!

2853
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:44,380
Get out of here! No!

2854
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:45,260
Stop!
