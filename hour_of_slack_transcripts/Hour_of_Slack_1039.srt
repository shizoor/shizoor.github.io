1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
There's no doubt about it. If you live within a few miles of Bob, you'll die.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:11,980
You'll die unless you have the self-genius power of Swag.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:25,640
Friends, there's been a crisis, such a crisis, that we had to depend on help from WREK in Atlanta with the Lymph Node Institute

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:34,280
and from Radio Synesthesia with WCSB in Cleveland, because, well, you'll see.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,160
Yetis and simpletons, we have a lot of fun here at the Institute.

6
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,980
But unfortunately, the fish has hit the fan.

7
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:55,460
Tonight on Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, we deal with a subject that we usually,

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,820
if for no better reason than the fact that we don't wear anything under our lab coats.

9
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:11,420
The subject is children. Not sex, but the unfortunate byproduct of sex.

10
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,120
You see, we've spouted a lot of ish here at the Funhouse, a lot of lies and garbage.

11
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:25,380
But tonight, I'm telling you the truth when I say that it has finally come to pass

12
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,280
that the pink man has come for our Yeti children.

13
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,560
You think this is hyperbole? You think this is China taking over the world?

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,860
You think this is Kerry winning the election? It is not.

15
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,060
This is an actual court case.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:49,440
A great matriarch of the church, Reverend Mary Magdalene, has had her child taken from her

17
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,360
by a real, honest-to-God court as part of a custody case.

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,360


19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,360


20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,360


21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,680
In the state of New York.

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,700
That alone is not enough to upset me.

23
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,340
I've met enough of you subs to know that most of you should only reproduce by recruitment

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,220
or through radio waves like the Institute does.

25
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,000
However, that does not mean that the ones who can and do reproduce should be stopped

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,320
from doing so.

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,280
Now, most of the subs that I do know have no business making children.

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,780
Buying children or being anywhere around children.

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,620
But this one has chosen to grow her own and from all reports has grown it exceptionally

30
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,220
well.

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,260
Hell, if most of you had a kid, I would steal it and give it to the state to save it.

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,460
However, this case is different.

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,960
Her child has been seized for no greater crime than her membership in the Church of the Subgenius

34
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,260
and her participation in X-Day Drone.

35
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,000
Think about it.

36
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:04,040
If they can use her church membership to take away her child, well, then what can they do

37
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,480
to you?

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,680
What can they do to our hobos at the Institute?

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,960
If they can take her own homegrown child away from her, then what can they do to the hobos

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,720
which are literally the bread and butter of this Institute?

41
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,560
I ask you.

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,400
So tonight, we'll be talking about children and childhood.

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm going to be talking about the world.

44
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,240


45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,580
You'll hear some old favorites and some new favorites.

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,720
And Bill Burroughs' son.

47
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,980
Yak, yak, yak.

48
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,920
And while you're listening, why don't you head to your favorite web browser and type

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,580
in rbevilacqua.blogspot.com.

50
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,180
That's rbevilacqua.blogspot.com.

51
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,220


52
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,220


53
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,220


54
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:03,420
That's rbevil, as in devil with a b, aqua with a c, blogspot.com.

55
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:12,420
Or, if like our Institute associates, your computer can only go to one website, try subgenius.com

56
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:20,160
slash updates slash maghelp.html.

57
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,060
Subgenius.com slash updates slash maghelp.html.

58
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,060


59
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,180
Subgenius.com slash updates slash maghelp.html.

60
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:44,300
On behalf of Dr. Timothy Leary, in association with the legions of illuminated social rejects,

61
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,580
and as an influential administrator and creator of useful chaos in these so-called United

62
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,200
States, I stand as a messenger of strangeness this evening.

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,840
In order to impress upon, or at least to instruct the honorable musicians, as to the

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,640
methods and motives of a truly bizarre reality, the weird revolution.

65
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,380
Thomas Jefferson, co-founder and president of this normally corrupt nation, said,

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,880
If God is truly just, I tremble for the fate of my country.

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,940
Secondly, there are some dynamics at play which I must familiarize you with.

68
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,180
I am a man of the law.

69
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,180


70
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,180


71
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,180


72
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,180


73
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,180


74
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,180


75
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,440
And I'm just afraid you don't realize it yet.

76
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,900
The so-called weirdos in this country stand as completely freaked out by the normal man,

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,300
as the normal man is completely freaked out by the Weird Mash's reaction to him.

78
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,840
Which came first you may ask, chicken or an egg you may ask?

79
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,800
Well, the chicken of course!

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,080
And it's time to Wednesday morning at seven o'clock.

81
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,180
The lockdown has been further eased.

82
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,800
White employee toward the roof, the handgear's off, the ataque is not expertise .

83
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:53,800


84
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,540
Ele Méカンタ, insure systems, Mach G disgusted.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,160
Supreme supporter of this...

86
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,160


87
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,180
We made the news this week.

88
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,840
The Church of the Subgenius did.

89
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,080
Not the TV news, and it might not get that far,

90
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,080
but there was a child custody case involving subgeniuses

91
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,500
that suddenly, starting on, I mean, really,

92
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,760
just three or four days ago, it hit the Internet news

93
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,080
and was suddenly, well, I made a lot of money last week, actually.

94
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,180
Our website traffic doubled,

95
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,080
and all these things like boingboing and wired.com

96
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
and disinfo.com,

97
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,980
a whole bunch of those kind of fairly large news,

98
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,780
anti-authoritarian news sort of outlets started carrying this story,

99
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,020
and I'm going to tell you this sad story as quickly as I can.

100
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,200
Some of you here may know Steve Bevilacqua.

101
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,260
He used to help out at Starwood,

102
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,380
and he was my business partner on Subgenius after a while.

103
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,300
Well, on February 3rd,

104
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,840
of this year, this Judge Punch is his name,

105
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,580
took this child away from Rachel Bevilacqua.

106
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,920
She's also known as Reverend Magdalene in Church of the Subgenius,

107
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,360
and her husband Steve is known as Jesus.

108
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,840
And when they got married, she already had this child, Cole.

109
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:50,320
The child was the son of a previous boyfriend named Jeff,

110
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,380
and there's been a custody case.

111
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,540
There's been a custody thing going on for 10 years now.

112
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
The little boy's 10 years old.

113
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,460
Up until just recently, the mom and the dad were trying to get off.

114
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,080
The mom moved to Texas with Jesus to help run Subgenius.

115
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,260
I know that sounds a little funny.

116
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,600
And so at their expense, they had to send the child back to New York

117
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,840
or take him to New York to see the dad several times a year.

118
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,760
It was really expensive.

119
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,560
In fact, that's why he's not working for Subgenius anymore.

120
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,480
We don't pay enough.

121
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,920
Anyway, suddenly that whole situation changed earlier this month.

122
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,200
This Judge Punch called an emergency hearing,

123
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:37,580
and Jeff, the father, entered into evidence 16 exhibits taken from the Internet,

124
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,440
12 of which are photographs of the Subgenius event X-Day.

125
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,260
Cole, the child, had never attended X-Day and is not in any of the pictures.

126
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,800
Rachel, the mom, is depicted in many of these photos,

127
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,540
often wearing a skimpy collar,

128
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,660
and a black costume while participating in X-Day and DeVival events.

129
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,540
The judge, a very strict Catholic,

130
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:06,960
became outraged at the photos of the X-Day parody of Mel Gibson's movie The Passion of Christ,

131
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,280
especially the photo where Jesus, Steve Bevilacqua,

132
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,820
is wearing clown makeup and carrying a crucifix with a pool noodle dollar sign on it

133
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,340
while being beaten by a crowd.

134
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,480
The judge, a very strict Catholic,

135
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,380
was also very proud of Subgeni,

136
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,120
including a topless woman with a dildo.

137
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,860
And dildos were close.

138
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,100
His Honor also strongly disapproved of the photos of her in a bondage dress

139
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,940
and a paper mache goat's head.

140
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,920
Seen here in evidence,

141
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,980
this goat head was worn by the mother

142
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,180
in photographs seen on the Internet.

143
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,060
A goat head.

144
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,320
The judge repeatedly answered,

145
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,860
why a goat?

146
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,700
What's so significant about a goat's head?

147
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,640
When Rachel replied,

148
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,820
I just thought the word goat was funny,

149
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,060
the judge lost his temper completely

150
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,560
and began to shout abuse at Rachel,

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,460
calling her a pervert, mentally ill, lying, and a participant in sex orgies.

152
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,200
I wish.

153
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,280
The judge ordered that Rachel is to have absolutely no contact with her son,

154
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,600
not even in writing,

155
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,840
because he felt the pictures of X Day performance

156
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,740
were enough to suspect,

157
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,480
quote,

158
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,220
severe mental illness.

159
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,020
And the mom has not been able to have any contact with the kids since February 3rd.

160
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,680
This case has the potential to set a precedent that could affect all moms who have ever attended X Day,

161
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,340
among other things.

162
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,560
The stuff we do at X Day is tame.

163
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,960
Anyway.

164
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,160
You know, and if they can do that,

165
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,680
then nobody's children are safe.

166
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,940
And there's a mom's for Bob.

167
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,600
Judge Punch.

168
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,620
He should be dating Judge Judy.

169
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,640
He can take out some of his frustrations with her.

170
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,660
So, uh, Magdalene, how you doing?

171
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,400
Uh, well, uh, pretty good, I guess.

172
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,000
Tell us your story.

173
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,560
Okay, uh, well, basically, I sent my son for his Christmas break,

174
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,160
um, with his father in New York State.

175
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,100
Uh, I sent him away on December 18th,

176
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,460
and since then I've seen him once for one overnight visit,

177
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,440
because the, um, the judge actually called me a pervert in open court

178
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,000
after seeing, uh, some pictures of X Day

179
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,020
and the Detroit revival

180
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,800
and Modemax's explanation of the church from his Wikipedia entry.

181
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,560
And, um, yeah, they, um, the judge just sort of, um, flipped out.

182
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,140
Was there, uh, any particular legal, uh, argument behind, uh, taking away the truth?

183
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,140
Did they say that, uh, that you had endangered the child somehow?

184
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,660
He said that any child who stumbled across pictures of his mother

185
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,760
at an event like this on the internet, uh, would be scarred for life

186
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,400
because the pictures were so disturbing.

187
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,400
Kind of makes you wonder what the judge's mother has been up to.

188
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,640
Well, um...

189
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,240
You know, how is he so sure about this, you know?

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,040
Yeah, he's, he's really Catholic,

191
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,120
and some of the pictures that really bother him, uh,

192
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,000
So he thinks his mom was a virgin then?

193
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,100
I, well, he saw the pictures of, of my husband Jesus, uh, in clown makeup,

194
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,780
and he's, he's being crucified on a, on a crucifix that has a giant dollar sign on it

195
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,600
while wearing this clown makeup, and, and he's being beaten with a dildo.

196
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,660
And, and this was all a very high-level artistic parody

197
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,360
of Mel Gibson's crass and, and obvious attempt to make money off of people's deep religious feelings.

198
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,020
You know, the passion of the Christ.

199
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,380
You know, the story of how we satirized that is all on the web.

200
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,300
It's perfectly legitimate art.

201
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,520
But the judge felt that a child seeing that, um,

202
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,420
and knowing that his parents had participated in something like that,

203
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,820
um, that it would be damaging to a child.

204
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,560
So the, uh, wow, um, who has the child now?

205
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,040
Um, my ex.

206
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,860
Your ex?

207
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,620
Yeah.

208
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,960
The father of the child?

209
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,480
Yeah, his name's Jeff.

210
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,040
Hmm.

211
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,080
How does, uh, how does he feel about all this?

212
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,120
Um, he, he's the one that brought it up.

213
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,480
He's the one that, uh, surprised everyone by popping these pictures out in the middle of court.

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,520
Hmm.

215
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:28,980
Yeah.

216
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,720
Sounds like, uh, sounds like quite a dispute.

217
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,520
So I assume that the, uh, you probably don't want to comment too much on the facts of the case

218
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,720
other than what you have stated...

219
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,700
Right.

220
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,380
...uh, so far because it is a pending, I assume that this is pending in court, correct?

221
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,760
Right, yes.

222
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,300
Well, um...

223
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,060
I just, um, basically wanted to raise awareness about it because it is very expensive.

224
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,840
Hmm.

225
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,080
And I don't know how, if I can ask for money on your show or not, but I do.

226
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,140
Well, I don't know if you can ask for money either, but, uh, I can ask you if there is an address to which one might send support if one were interested.

227
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,900
Yeah, um, you can PayPal money to magdaleneatsubgenius.com.

228
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,820
Spelled, uh, just like in the Bible.

229
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,380
Uh, M-A-G.

230
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,340
Mm-hmm.

231
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,840
D-A-L-E-N.

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,500
Mm-hmm.

233
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,660
At subgenius.com and there is no O in the word subgenius.

234
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,940
But I'm sure all of your listeners know.

235
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,860
You know, uh, most of my listeners are, uh, kind of brain damaged actually, so I don't think they would know.

236
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,640
But, uh, thank you for clearing that up.

237
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:39,000
So that's, uh, that's one way that somebody could, uh, send support, uh, to help Magdalene and Jesus get the baby back.

238
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:39,900
Yeah.

239
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,860
And, um...

240
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Well, um, just, um...

241
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,840
Just tell people to check out the website.

242
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,260
What?

243
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,260
Uh, what is the, uh, the specific address for the page with your, uh, story on it?

244
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,480
Uh, well, actually there, there is a page.

245
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,080
Um, I don't remember the address right now, but the story is on the alt-flag.

246
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,560
Okay.

247
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,380
So if people go to Google Group and Google, um, the group alt-dot-flag...

248
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:05,820
Uh-huh.

249
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,780
The story is up there.

250
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,480
Uh, is there a link to it from the main page of the sub-site?

251
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,340
There probably could be pretty soon, but there isn't one right now.

252
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:13,340


253
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,020
Okay.

254
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,000
So, uh, more information would be available at, uh, subgenius.com then.

255
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,060
Yes.

256
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,260
Wow.

257
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,420
That's, uh, quite a world we live in.

258
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:23,940
Yeah.

259
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,260
Let me tell ya.

260
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,020
Uh, yeah.

261
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:34,880
Uh, yeah, actually, I mean, personally, I think this kind of raises some questions about, you know, what kind of society, uh, you know, we want to have.

262
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:43,320
Uh, if, uh, I mean, basically children are taken away from their parents because of their exercise of, uh, you know, freedom.

263
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,320


264
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,200
Freedom of religion.

265
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:51,640
Uh, I mean, that's just a few, uh, steps away from, you know, taking children away for any reason.

266
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,260
Uh, you know, pretty soon the government will say that you have to, uh...

267
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,820
Yeah, um, and some people...

268
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,060
Well, here in Ohio, there's an interesting law that's been, uh, brought up in the state legislature.

269
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,460
I don't know if it's, uh, I don't know if it's been brought to the floor yet, but it does have several co-sponsors.

270
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,000
It would, uh, make it, uh, a crime.

271
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,300
It would make it illegal for, uh, the state to place a child, or for any child to place a child.

272
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,300


273
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,300


274
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,700
Uh, and, uh, it would make it illegal for a child to live in a home with anyone who is gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered.

275
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,500
Oh my God.

276
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:29,300
So that means, that means if you have a, a gay teenager as your child, in the closet even, uh, you know, and you also have a young child...

277
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,300
Yeah.

278
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,080
Then you're a criminal.

279
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,320
Whoa.

280
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,340
Even if you, I mean, basically that's the, uh, nature of the law.

281
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,360
God.

282
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,100
And, uh, I haven't heard too much about, uh...

283
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,400
Do you want to stay on the line and talk to some other people here, or, uh, would you just like to...

284
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,300
Um, I think...

285
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:50,200
I just wanted to say that I did, um, someone told me the, um, link for the, uh, actual page on SubSight...

286
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,440
Okay.

287
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,240
...that you can check out.

288
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,160
It's http, uh...

289
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,620

290
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,280
Yeah, colon slash slash.

Uh, html.

308
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:16,920

Mag help.

310
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,020
Yeah.

...dot html.

312
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,460
Yeah.

313
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,900
That's, uh, that's, uh, very useful information, and, uh, you know, I do wish the best of luck to you...

314
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,620
Oh, thanks.

315
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,640
...and your quest to, uh, you know, to reclaim...

316
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,500
Yeah, thank you so much.

317
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,180
...what is rightfully yours.

318
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,060
Yeah, thank you.

319
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,780
...and, uh, and I hope that, uh, hope that we'll, like, get to see you again at X Day this year.

320
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,140
Yeah, I hope so too.

321
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,300
And, um, yeah, here I am wishing all the best to you and, uh, and, uh, I hope that, uh,

322
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,880
and to your husband.

323
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,820
Yeah.

324
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,460
And, um, I don't know what else to say.

325
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,380
Okay, well, bye.

326
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,460
All right, keep it surreal.

327
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:59,360
It is easy to stay wrapped up in one's own little world, isn't it?

328
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,740
It's easy to say she should have kept her knees together, isn't it?

329
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:13,280
But if every Yeti woman who did the Wyrm with some pink retard was disqualified from the

330
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,560
gene pool, we would have died out 15,000 years ago.

331
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:27,980
What you are forgetting, dear listener, is that your mother is a zizh-swilling slut.

332
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,960
That's right.

333
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:37,180
Your mother is a load-absorbing baby machine, and that is the only reason you are here now.

334
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,260
If you have issues, if this situation makes you unaccountably agitated, then perhaps you're

335
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,440
not the only one who needs to be worked out.

336
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,240
Perhaps it is your mother issues which you need to work out.

337
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:56,240
For information on working out your mother issues, visit rbevilacqua, r-b-e-v-i-l-a-c-q-u-a

338

dot blogspot dot com.

339
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,760
Oh, yeah, there, uh, also might be a couple pictures of her bare butt.

340
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,540
And now, more about your mother.

341
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:31,560
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.

342
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,920
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.

343
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,240
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.

344
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:50,960
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.

345
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:06,460
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.

346
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,820
Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone.

347
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,640
The weird masses don't want to be normalized.

348
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,960
Weirdos want to be abnormal.

349
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,600
The freaks can't be formally normalized, nor can we be normally formalized.

350
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,040
What we want is complete weirdification.

351
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,660
Basically, we don't want weirdness from the normal man.

352
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,200
We don't want to be freaked out by the normal man.

353
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,580
We want to out-freak the normal man.

354
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:27,120
I think everybody out there who's ever been to an X-Day or considered going to an X-Day should keep this story in mind.

355
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,720
Because you never know when people are going to try and say that you're wrong, that you're sick, that you're a danger to a child.

356
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,600
Because of your hobbies.

357
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
When you don't advocate harming.

358
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,600
Yes.

359
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,680
It had nothing to do with a child. It was a clown.

360
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,920
Most kids hate clowns.

361
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,700
They figured it was funny, and they don't know what the rest of the crap in the picture is.

362
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,860
They don't understand that it's called innocence.

363
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,260
Keep those things.

364
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,640
Everybody's got some souvenirs.

365
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,320
A lot of people have souvenirs of days when they were a little more wild and crazy that they deliberately keep away from their children.

366
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,140
My dad had a big collection of dirty comic books from the 70s.

367
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,720
He kept them away from me until I was old enough to understand them.

368
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,680
That's how you do it.

369
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,580
Everybody does stuff that they don't want their kids to know about.

370
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,220
Always.

371
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
It's just a matter of whether there were pictures taken or not.

372
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,120
It's no different from keeping the booze away from your child's reach, you know?

373
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,080
I mean, how do you think it's going to be for, like, Jenna?

374
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,100
I mean, if Jenna Jameson ever had kids, do you think they would take her kids away?

375
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,100
You know what?

376
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,820
That's a good argument.

377
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:31,580
Maybe that's, by that judge's argument, you know, then that means every porn star in the country should have their children taken away.

378
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,040
Exactly.

379
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,120
In fact, why not the children of all movie stars?

380
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,100
Exactly.

381
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,020
Because when you think about it, movies are all about children.

382
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,740
Movie stars have been, you know, prostituting themselves in front of cameras in various different ways.

383
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:49,800
As Joe Cosby said, Jesus is the cure for a disease which you wouldn't have if you hadn't found him.

384
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,320
It's awful, though.

385
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,020
You know, they threaten.

386
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,680
Have you ever had one of them threaten to pray for you?

387
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,140
You know, they hold that over your head.

388
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm going to pray for you.

389
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,180
That's their whole problem, though, praying.

390
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,860
They're all talking to God.

391
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,180
As if he didn't already know what they had to say and hadn't heard it 10 billion times before.

392
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,160
And they sure as hell aren't listening to what he might have to say.

393
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,900
So, you know, it's sad.

394
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:28,540
They believe in a God so weak that illiterate human po-buckers feel compelled to do his dirty work for him because he can't do it himself.

395
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,760
As Joe Cosby said, Bob saved me from people trying to save me from myself.

396
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,420
And it is.

397
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:50,340
Friends, obviously, insane Muslim fundamentalists aren't the only ones who destroy lives over silly cartoons.

398
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,120
Because that's what this is really all about.

399
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:59,940
On the other hand, it has caused subgeniuses all over the internet to start into these debates and arguments.

400
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,400
We're trying to figure out now whether we really are a religion or what.

401
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,840
You know, if they're taking your kid away because you're a Muslim.

402
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,320
Because of a goat costume.

403
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,160
The other people around were dressed as aliens.

404
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,200
Jesus!

405
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,780
By the way, she made this herself.

406
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,780
This is handmade.

407
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,860
The mom made it.

408
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:24,060
And the real reason it's a goat was because when little Colburn used to say,

409
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,660
Mom, why does the moon get smaller and bigger?

410
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,700
And she said, well, she didn't want to go into the eclipse of sun and earth things.

411
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,800
And she said, well, at some nights the sky goes.

412
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,260
And the goat comes and he eats away part of the moon.

413
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:44,260
And so she was going to dress, we were having a deity contest, and she was dressed as the sky goat.

414
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:55,640
But even if she had been dressed as a devil goat, even if she had been a devil, that's no reason to take your kid away.

415
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:04,640
However, another subgenius who is, well, she was saying, people may justify the judge's decision.

416
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,820
But nothing can excuse his demeanor.

417
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,180
Every litigant in New York State has the right to be treated with dignity every time they appear before any judge.

418
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:23,220
Hurling insults at people at the top of your voice after making a snap decision based on tawdry photographs is pretty much exactly what the people of Orleans County hired a judge not to do.

419
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,920
I mean, any mob with pitchforks could do that.

420
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,900
You also need torches.

421
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,760
But here's the response to her.

422
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,080
And this is kind of pertinent.

423
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,620
From a viewer.

424
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,540
A very good writer of subgenius, Nenslow.

425
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,320
Nenslow said,

426
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:46,540
Dude, I mean chick, you fucked with his head and blew his mind.

427
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:53,480
He, the judge, is a normal, probably an uptight dumbass, and he definitely lost it there.

428
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,300
It is my opinion that you screwed up, and I'll tell you why.

429
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:04,620
You went in thinking that an old coot who spent most of his life whacking gavel was capable of responding to wit and imagination.

430
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,360
The chances of that are slim at best.

431
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:13,520
When you go into that environment and place yourself in the hands of normals, you have to do your best to think like a normal.

432
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,260
Just as Stang has described in every one of his stories about cops and FBI men.

433
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,520
The phrase is,

434
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,600
Officer, have you ever heard of Mad Magazine?

435
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:33,280
Anyway, he said, you have to try to come up with ways, and this is pertinent to every one of us here, potentially.

436
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,600
You have to come up with ways.

437
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:41,260
You have to come up with ways of explaining things which they can understand, which won't make them feel stupid and insulted and angry.

438
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,800
If they ask you why you were wearing a goat head and you have to make up some lie,

439
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,740
you have to make up some lie that they will understand and which will make them feel intelligent.

440
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,560
Like how it symbolized the biblical scapegoat and was a reference to pre-classical culture of the Middle East.

441
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,960
Not that you thought the word goat was funny.

442
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,560
That doesn't make any sense at all.

443
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,840
And it was obviously too much for the guy.

444
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,560
What the judge means is simple, rational explanations, not incomprehensible non sequiturs.

445
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:21,600
A real good liar would sit down and find ways of explaining how those crucifixion pictures were a criticism of modern liberalism

446
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,420
and its destruction of conventional moral standards.

447
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,880
How those pictures of you naked were a tribute to the beauty of God's creation.

448
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
One thing's sure is that when you walk into a courtroom,

449
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,900
you've got no rights at all.

450
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,080
It's great to have ideals, but when it comes to reality,

451
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,240
you, you scrawny little wretch,

452
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,860
are nine times out of ten dealing with people who are not only more ignorant,

453
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,540
but just plain dumber than you.

454
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,400
And the thing that pisses them off the most is realizing that fact.

455
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,440
So, in other words, I guess she should have had a better set of lies ready.

456
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,980
And I don't know.

457
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,040
I've had to worry about, you know,

458
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,280
anybody who has kids and is a pagan has to, at some point, that's crossed their mind.

459
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,220
You know, how much does a kid tell the other kids at school?

460
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,480
You know, how secretive do you have to be?

461
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,620
Anyway, another subgenius preacher weighed in because there were Christian websites and blogs picked up this news thing,

462
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,560
and they were arguing really vehemently about it.

463
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:38,860
And a lot of them could not understand why are they mockers?

464
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,200
Why would we mock other people's beliefs?

465
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,300
And that's a perfectly good question from a dumbass.

466
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:57,980
Our friend, our friend Reverend Carter LeBlanc wrote a really nice short thing full of great quotes,

467
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,200
which you may want to use.

468
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,380
He said,

469
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,080
The Church of the Subgenius is an extremely decentralized religion.

470
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,540
Although its founders produced a good deal of the core mythos,

471
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,480
in many ways it can be considered akin to Lennox, its open source religion.

472
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,980
This is reminiscent of William Blake's postulate,

473
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,320
I must create my own system or be enslaved by another man.

474
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,560
Because of this, many people bring many strange things to the table

475
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,220
when they go about generating their own style and variation of what it means to be a subgenius.

476
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,800
Much of this is offensive in nature, particularly due to a consistent penchant for overdoing things.

477
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,040
As J.R. Bob Dobbs said,

478
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,100
Don't just eat that hamburger, eat the hell out of it.

479
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,180
Or you might say,

480
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:47,020
Whatsoever you set your hand to do, do so with all your might.

481
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:55,760
It may be unsettling to Christians in particular, primarily because it seems to target Christianity to an inordinate degree.

482
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,200
This is primarily due to the fact that Church of the Subgenius was founded in the early 20th century.

483
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,020
It was founded in America by people who came from primarily Christian backgrounds,

484
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,880
and we mock what we know best.

485
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,980
Spend time around a subgenius and you'll eventually hear them mock Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Paganism,

486
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,200
that's my specialty,

487
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,420
Atheism, Hinduism, Mormonism, Hippieism, just about any other ism you can think of.

488
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,460
Why do we mock? Because humor is the most potent weapon of the marginalized.

489
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,180
Some mock out of anger, yes, but most of us mock simply because we have a keen eye for absurdity.

490
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,340
Hypocrisy and irony.

491
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,200
It is our job to draw attention to these things.

492
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,420
Plus, it's fun.

493
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:43,080
In conclusion, I would like to remind you of Revelations 3.16.

494
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,660
Because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.

495
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:58,960
Subgeni are anything but lukewarm, and as such, tend to be favored with a

496
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,740
swallow rather than a spit.

497
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,540
And you can't help, actually.

498
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,080
Did I mention the gay Bigfoot website?

499
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
There is one.

500
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,160
There is a gay Bigfoot website.

501
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,220
It's called mightyfudge.com.

502
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,840
If you don't believe me, check it out.

503
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,060
It's really funny.

504
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:35,540
The normal man who choices impostertunus can perform surgery on our weird women.

505
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:40,420
Yes, even your brother could be a victim of his plastic fantasies.

506
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,660
And if you weird out his daughter, he'll blast your ass.

507
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,400
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

508
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,080
Are you freaky with me?

509
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,420
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

510
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,240
So you can pluck out his feathers and smile.

511
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,160
Because you are defending our weird women from the freaky gander.

512
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,000
And you are the freaky ass thoughts of the bug-eyed, bow-legged, normal man.

513
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:28,600
If you believe that the circumstances described at rbevilacqua.blogspot.com, that's r-b-e-v-i-l-a-c-q-u-a.blogspot.com,

514
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,760
If you believe that those circumstances make someone a bad parent,

515
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,500
then you are a scruff in the head.

516
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:45,420
And I humbly submit the following as evidence of far, far worse parenting than most of us have ever known.

517
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,520
The rooftops are by custom the woman's province in Tangier.

518
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,480
And I made the mistake once of going up there during the day, and the Arabs threw little pieces of mud at my door for a week.

519
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,020
But Bill would go up there every night and watch the colors of the sky changing.

520
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,820
I would go up there sometimes stoned out of my squash to watch him.

521
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,920
He would stand perfectly still, right hand always holding a cigarette,

522
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,420
and only until it was finally absolutely night would he make the mad rush to the typewriter.

523
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,240
There was also an organ box in the upstairs hall in which Bill would sit, smoking kiffs,

524
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,920
and then again a sudden mad rush to the typewriter.

525
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:35,080
From that time on, Laura's mind began to go, and after I graduated,

526
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,180
I'd play guitar for her in the sunniest room of our house.

527
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,620
They tried to lich me and burn me and starve me,

528
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,480
so I had to come back as Bob Marley and Marcus Garvey.

529
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,400
I used to be Malcolm X, they thought they had me putting holes in my chest.

530
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,700
Now I'm on the planet as a one J.R.S.

531
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,460
Now I'm on the planet as a one J.R.S.

532
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,200
Ugliness continues, summer after summer,

533
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,180
cause the older generation teaches it to the younger.

534
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,880
The trick is to outlive the older generation,

535
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,660
let the old ideas die with the old education.

536
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,960
This is not the first time that I came to the planet, each time I do.

537
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,820
Only if you can understand it, I came as Isis.

538
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,420
My words they tried to ban, I came as Moses.

539
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,420
To the people that was lost, I came as Jesus and they nailed me to a cross.

540
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,440
They tried to lich me and burn me and starve me,

541
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:57,440
Angela Briggs

542
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,660
Billy Burroughs drank himself to death twice

543
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,440
and died decades before his father did.

544
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,520
Isn't that funny?

545
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,840
That's why I let him go on like that.

546
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,740
Anyway, let that be a lesson to you about your child rearing.

547
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,040
If you do it incorrectly, your child may wind up in front of a microphone, telling stories

548
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,780
about you.

549
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,880
And incidentally, if it's so good, why do they call it rearing?

550
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,800
To each their own, I guess.

551
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,780
And speaking of that, if you take nothing else from this, if you have no compassion,

552
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,680
no empathy, if you don't give a sh-

553
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:53,740
Hey, shh!

554
00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:00,840
even about your fellow subgenie, then perhaps you can look up from your malaise long enough

555
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,200
to take this to heart.

556
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:10,020
Perhaps you can take comfort in the knowledge that there are people, yetis, with real problems.

557
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,220
Real court problems.

558
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:19,180
Real Catholic judge screaming at you from the bench problems.

559
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,820
And as always, we shall leave it to Devo to share his story.

560
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,960
to remind us of what is really at stake in all of this.

561
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,020
This Prophylactic Tour,

562
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,420
friend of no one around me,

563
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,800
understands my potato.

564
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,880
Think I'm only a smart boy,

565
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,400
looking for a real tomato.

566
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,380
Even with the world tired of the simply show,

567
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,920
even with the world and this Prophylactic Tour,

568
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,800

and nobody around here

570
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,560
understands my potato.

571
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,560

00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,340
looking for a real tomato.

even with the world and this Prophylactic Tour,

I'll pay nobody the rent,

00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,440
and nobody around here

577
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,800
understands my potato.

578
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,760
Think I'm only a smart boy,

579
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:54,760


580
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,820
Think I'm only a smart boy,

581
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,620
looking for a real tomato.

Think I'm only a smart boy,

586
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,060
understanding my potato.

587
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,620
Even with the world tired of the simply show,

588
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:23,240
even with the world and this Prophylactic Tour,

589
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,360
I'll pay nobody the rent,

00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,160
and nobody around here understands my potato.

591
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,200
Think I'm only a smart boy,

592
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,700
looking for a real tomato.

593
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:38,520
this Prophylactic Tour,

594
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,240
friend of no one around me,

596
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,100
Think I'm only a smart boy,

597
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,880
looking for a real tomato.

598
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,560
this Prophylactic Tour, friend of no one around me,

599
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,160
Joe!

600
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,120
Joe!

601
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,180
Joe!

602
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,040
Joe!

603
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,480
Joe!

604
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,820
Smoke control, no where to go

605
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,080
Joe!

606
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,460
Suburban robots, the modern reality

607
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:29,880
Joe!

608
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,940
Common stock, we work around the clock

609
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,100
Joe!

610
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,720
We show the polls in the polls

611
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,460
Joe!

612
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,820
Joe!

613
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,000
Joe!

614
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:44,860
Joe!

615
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:44,920
Joe!

616
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,100
Joe!

617
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,280
Joe!

618
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,520
Joe!

619
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,060
Joe!

620
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,500


621
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:58,540


622
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,640
Joe!

623
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,140
Randomly something wrong

624
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,560
Is a man with a bag

625
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,100
A little do is a favor

626
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,500
A little human sacrifice

627
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,340
It's just a blinding fear

628
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,820
Now the time has come

629
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,840
It's the D.O.A.

630
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,460
It's the D.O.A.

631
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:22,740
.

632
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:22,840
.

633
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:41,900
comes from home

634
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,420
He's a man under the Coven

635
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,860
This thing is more than anymore

636
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,460
Now we must sacrifice ourselves

637
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,540
The video, video

638
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,360
Okay, we gotta let it go

639
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,140
Get fucking with the process

640
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,080
Woo-hoo!

641
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,740
Woo-hoo!

642
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,880
Woo-hoo!

643
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,300
Come on, come on, let's do it

644
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,900
Let's do it

645
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,380
Let's do it

646
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,200
Let's do it

647
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,680
Let's do it

648
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,660
Let's do it

649
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,660
Let's do it

650
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,300
Let's do it

651
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,560
Let's do it

652
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,280
Let's do it

653
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,980
Let's do it

654
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:35,740
Let's do it

655
00:45:35,980 --> 00:46:05,960
Let's do it

656
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,760
Let's do it

657
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,780
Let's do it

658
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,480
Let's do it

659
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,800
Let's do it

660
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:19,260
Let's do it

661
00:48:37,480 --> 00:49:00,780
Let's do it

662
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,960
Let's do it

663
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,560
Let's do it

664
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,440
Let's do it

665
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,500
Let's do it

666
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,120
Let's do it

667
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,120


668
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,120


669
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,120


670
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,120


671
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,120


672
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,120


673
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:56,820
Woo!

674
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:56,840


675
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:56,840


676
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:56,840


677
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:56,840


678
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:56,840


679
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:56,840


680
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,200
Let's do it!

681
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:57,480
Let's do it!

682
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:57,880
Let's do it!

683
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,300
Let's do it!

684
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,060
Let's do it!

685
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,060


686
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,640
Let's do it!

687
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,920
Come on, let's do it!

688
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:00,920


689
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:00,920


690
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:00,920


691
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:00,920


692
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,120
C'mon, let's go!

693
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,760
Ad тобac!

694
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,400
Yeah

695
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:05,960
Do it for me!

696
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:05,960


697
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,960
The alien people suffering from space, which is the vessel of all that is nerd.

698
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:28,320
And even now I shall lead signs in the heaven and suns and the earth, blood energies from the earth.

699
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:39,600
My lights in the sky rebuke thee, the children of heaven, and the angels from heaven are heard thee spreading lies and deception.

700
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,600
Thouпов

701
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,240
I am.

702
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,960
That was done by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

703
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:09,900
You can see video Google for the video Prescriptures 3-5.

704
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,080
The live preaching is from Winterstar of 2006.

705
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,160
This is Hour of Slack number 1039.

706
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,360
In a minute, we'll join Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell Philodrum,

707
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,400
and the newly remarried.

708
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,500
Congratulations to Philo and Chaos Kitty.

709
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,740
And Michael Pepe.

710
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,200
But first, Norell Preff.

711
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:57,680
Hey.

712
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,720
You know, I hate Karl Rove.

713
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,740
I walk right in.

714
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,000
Bush and Rove.

715
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,000
I walk.

716
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:04,780
Go right ahead.

717
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,900
Hatred, hatred, hatred for Bush.

718
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,760
Attack somebody.

719
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:09,760
I walk.

720
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,380
Blows you.

721
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,780
Throw him in jail.

722
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,880
Attack somebody.

723
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,000
I want it.

724
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,400
Blows you.

725
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,660
Brian.

726
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,320
Brian.

727
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,360
President Cheney.

728
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,240
I want it.

729
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:18,860
We're not going to do anything.

730
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,120
Brian.

731
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:20,700
Brian.

732
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,100
Man to man, eye to eye.

733
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:22,740
I want it.

734
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,340
We're not going to do anything.

735
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,780
It doesn't mean anything.

736
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,000
Man to man, eye to eye.

737
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:26,740
I want it.

738
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,220
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

739
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:28,840
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

740
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,660
The president's guilty.

741
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,700
Come on my show.

742
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,860
Bow.

743
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,880
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

744
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,440
You know what?

745
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,340
Come on my show.

746
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:33,620
Bow.

747
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:33,860
Mm-hmm.

748
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,180
Guilty.

749
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,520
Bomb throwers.

750
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:35,700
Bow.

751
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,220
Jim Crow.

752
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,280
This is ridiculous.

753
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,520
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

754
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:40,620
40%.

755
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:40,940
Bow.

756
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,360
87%.

757
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:42,920
Bow.

758
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,180
Bow.

759
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:43,760
Bow.

760
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,120
Bow.

761
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,540
Bow.

762
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:44,840
Bow.

763
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,100
Bow.

764
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,460
90%.

765
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:46,760
Bow.

766
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:47,340
70.

767
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,540
A high 70%.

768
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,860
Near 80%.

769
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,240
Bow.

770
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:51,640
Bow.

771
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,000
Bow.

772
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:52,400
Bow.

773
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:52,720
Bow.

774
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,060
Bow.

775
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:53,520
Bow.

776
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,000
Bow.

777
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,380
moo.

778
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,160
möchten.

779
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,380
Context.

780
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,100
Access.

781
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,100


782
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,020
But I'll date myself.

783
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,140
Date yourself.

784
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:23,940
We're gonna shoot 100��들eless conclusion here who likes we're live.

785
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:23,980
0713

786
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:23,980


787
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:23,980


788
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:23,980


789
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:23,980


790
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:23,980
1540

791
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,000
Nothing.

792
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,440
Don't give a tort

793
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:26,460
To a

794
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:26,460


795
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,500
Come

796
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,920
They

797
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,000
They

798
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,780
Are

799
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,000
Too

800
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,720
given to us.

801
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,940
The mothy marbles rest on the lips that he had

802
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,200
pressed in their bloom.

803
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,140
And the names he loved to hear

804
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,220
have been carved for many

805
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,640
a year on the tomb.

806
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,020
Oh, this guy sure did talk

807
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,440
purdy.

808
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,100
I got a purdy mouth

809
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:13,420
too.

810
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:16,780
Chapter

811
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,900
3, verse 4.

812
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,980
I see that our slacker

813
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,880
is available.

814
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,820
Number 984 is available

815
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,760
on eBay.

816
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,160
What? Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

817
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,420
It is from the

818
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,800
subgenius store on eBay.

819
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,740
That was a

820
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,560
sort of best of

821
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,980
using old,

822
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,200
old, old pieces

823
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,820
from the olden days

824
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,820
of ancient

825
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,880
mutantes.

826
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,820
It has Michael Papayata

827
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,800
and Gary Gabrogfran

828
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,860
and Puzzling

829
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,380
Evidence.

830
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,020
It's a rare doctor now.

831
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,960
Now, wait a minute.

832
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,520
You guys weren't supposed to see that.

833
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

834
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,580
this is the

835
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:05,280
climax of a remarkable

836
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,620
series of programs.

837
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,740
Now you and your family,

838
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,160
your loved ones and next of kin

839
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,600
can enjoy

840
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,280
thousands of hours of the world's

841
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,380
longest playing music.

842
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,180
The world's

843
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,840
greatest music.

844
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,020
The world's greatest

845
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,100
collection of musical

846
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,600
moth.

847
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,780
Where it is said.

848
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,480
In 78 RBM

849
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,680
phonograph records.

850
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,620
Oh, that was for

851
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,040
the used beat-up

852
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,660
tattered Revelation X.

853
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,360
Okay.

854
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,300
Out of print.

855
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:37,280
Okay.

856
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,640
Luckily, the negatives

857
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,920
for Revelation X

858
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,280
are located under

859
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,880
a secret bed

860
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,420
of mine.

861
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,600
Don't be too negative, man.

862
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,480
You're harsh and

863
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,260
slacker, man.

864
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,720
Like a flower bed,

865
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,500
Reverend Stank?

866
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,180
And so soon,

867
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:50,300
soon,

868
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:50,990
we will

869
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,510
some lucky publisher

870
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,230
will get to repent

871
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,290
the second testament

872
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,370
of the Church of the Subgenius.

873
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,630
It's in our fortress

874
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,770
of solitude

875
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:01,830
in Dobstown,

876
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:02,650
Malaysia.

877
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,230
But it's under the flower bed.

878
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:05,350
The Church of the Subgenius

879
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,390
is a special Church of the Subgenius

880
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,930
super underground flower bed

881
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,190
in Dobstown, Malaysia.

882
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,670
There, the Church of the Subgenius

883
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,250
is more the Church of the Subgenius

884
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:15,650
than ever.

885
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,770
You say it.

886
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:17,590
Saint.

887
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:18,250
Stupid.

888
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,390
The Church of the Subgenius,

889
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,070
for a limited time only,

890
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,770
will honor these torts.

891
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,030
You should have your

892
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:27,670
Book of the Subgenius

893
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,750
and a copy of Revelation X

894
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,450
on your extra meditation chamber.

895
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:34,830
Yes, so in the wee,

896
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:37,130
small hours of the night,

897
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,150
you can commune

898
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,050
through extra meditation

899
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,530
with your God.

900
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:42,270
On the porcelain God.

901
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,670
Which is the primary means

902
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:44,270
of distribution

903
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:44,830
of the Church's Word.

904
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,350
The paper is also very soft

905
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,230
and can be used after

906
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,050
reading for other

907
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,010
excrementational purposes.

908
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:56,070
It's particularly good to be used

909
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,610
after X-Day in case,

910
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:58,410
for whatever reason,

911
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:00,130
you don't make it to the saucers,

912
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,370
then you can use your book

913
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,970
as you will.

914
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,870
It's very, very nice paper.

915
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,110
It's a soft paper.

916
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:13,670
It's a pleasant feeling paper

917
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:14,750
and it's scented.

918
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:17,490
Yes, three-ply and it's nicely scented

919
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,830
so that after reading each page,

920
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,270
you can get a little bit of a

921
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:20,270


922
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:20,790
But you know,

923
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,050
some subgeniuses,

924
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,570
they skim through it,

925
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,990
they read page 50 first

926
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:27,950
and they rip out page one

927
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:30,190
and use it and that way

928
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,610
they miss a crucial,

929
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,490
the crucial instructions

930
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:34,770
about for instance,

931
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,890
depaking a prairie squid.

932
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,890
Some necessary thing.

933
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,370
Also right.

934
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,370
No, but the most important stuff.

935
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,830
It's all constructed as I see it.

936
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,010
Out of construction paper.

937
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,430
Here we come.

938
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:56,690
Now this to get the funniest.

939
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:59,970
Everyone we meet.

940
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:02,730

Bye.

955

Don't make me angry, man.

956
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:52,750
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
