1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
You could just see there were a lot of things going wrong in the world

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,280
and nobody was saying anything about it.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,020
You know, Bob had long since faded from the present memory.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,960
Iron Man is a great story, you know, revenge.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,620
And when I heard that story, I'm like, yeah.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,740
Khan, coming up in just a couple of days.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,060
Yes.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,340
All right.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,160
And I know I've already been told that I'm to refer to it as the Khan.

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,280
You call it the Khan.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,980
I mean, you can call it Khan.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,540
You can call it the Khan.

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,760
No, I had a nerdy guy say, don't call it Khan.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,760
You must call it the Khan.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,320
He called it the Khan.

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,340
He's going to call it the Khan for now on.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,820
You think they're playing a joke on me?

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,240
Because I'm going to the Khan in a couple of days.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,780
I'm going to make a little appearance there.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,680
And I thought maybe you could.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,360
Tell me what to expect because I've never been.

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,580
Everybody talks about it.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,980
And I know that this is your thing.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,800
This is your wheelhouse.

25
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,380
I like Khan.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,700
There's a lot of things there that I like.

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,580
And most of the shows that I make or have gotten involved with.

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,100
The Self-Genius Power of Squash.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,820
Goodbye, Bobby.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,800
Oh, great.

31
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,480
It's the Bob Twins.

32
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,100
It hasn't been a good day.

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,560
If I don't get to the top of the mountain real soon, I could get fired.

35
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,660
Friends, Dr. Howland Owl,

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,840
the toast of,

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,440
of stage, screen, and radio in San Francisco and New York City,

38
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,400
many other places.

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,880
We are so gifted to be,

40
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,860
to have him here with us.

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,080
Welcome, dear friends.

42
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,540
Because we truly can answer any question.

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,640
But I believe while,

44
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,200
while you try to attempt to come up with something to stump Dr. Howell,

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,160
I believe he will be doing a recitation of some kind.

46
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,560
That's correct, Ivan.

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
We begin and end,

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
with a recitation at this show.

49
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,420
And others often crop up in the middle.

50
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,560
But being not the middle, but the beginning,

51
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,000
the best way to proceed toward the end

52
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,080
is to start what we are going to do.

53
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,280
Leviathan.

54
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,340
This is the black sea brute,

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,000
bulling through wave rack,

56
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,580
ancient as oceans shifting hills,

57
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,440
who in sea toils traveling,

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,980
who, furrowing,

59
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,600
the salt acres heavily,

60
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,460
shoulders spouting,

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,420
the fist of his forehead,

62
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,380
over wastes gray-green crashing,

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,380
among horses unbroken,

64
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,400
from bellowing fields,

65
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,540
past bone wreck of vessels,

66
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,200
tide ruin,

67
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,440
wash of lost bodies,

68
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,520
bobbing,

69
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,240
no longer sought for,

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,220
and islands of ice gleaming,

71
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,200
who ravening the rank sea flood,

72
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,940
wave marshalling,

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,060
overmastering the dark sea marches,

74
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,740
finds home and harvest.

75
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,040
Frightening to foolhardiest mariners,

76
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,740
his size were difficult to describe.

77
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,460
The hulk of him is like hills heaving,

78
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,560
dark yet as crags of drift ice,

79
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,120
crowns cracking in thunder,

80
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,280
like land's self by night black looming,

81
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,960
surf churning and trailing along his way,

82
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,860
his shores rushing,

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,860
shoal water boding,

84
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,000
about the dark of his jaws.

85
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,460
And who would moor at his edge,

86
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,020
and fare on a foot,

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
would find gates of no gardens,

88
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
but the hill of dark,

89
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,260
underfoot diving,

90
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,020
and closing overhead,

91
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,960
the cold deep and drowning.

92
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,720
He is called Leviathan,

93
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,840
and named for rolling.

94
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,240
First created he was of all creatures,

95
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,760
he has held Jonah three days and nights.

96
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,500
He is that curling serpent that in ocean is,

97
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,760
sea-fright he is,

98
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,040
and the shadow under the earth.

99
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,780
Days there are, nonetheless,

100
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,780
when he lies like an angel,

101
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,780
although a lost angel,

102
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,000
on the wastes unease,

103
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,280
no eye of man moving,

104
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,560
bird hovering,

105
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,820
fish flashing,

106
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,300
creature, whatever,

107
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,560
who after him came to herit earth's emptiness.

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Froth that flanks seething,

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,920
soothes to stillness, waits.

110
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,960
With one eye he watches dark of night,

111
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,240
sinking last.

112
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,660
With one eye day rise,

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,680
as at first over foaming pastures.

114
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,360
He makes no cry,

115
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,340
though that light is a breath,

116
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,120
the sea curling,

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,540
star climbed,

118
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,720
wind combed,

119
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,340
cumbered with itself.

120
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,480
Still as at first it was,

121
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,760
is the hand,

122
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,460
not yet created of the creator.

123
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,000
And he waits for the world to begin.

124
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,020
See you soon.

125
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,200
Okay.

126
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,960
I don't have context for this more than two and a half months

127
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:45,960


128
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Look at what I do.

129
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,420
Here we go.

130
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,420


131
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,960
How hard and gloomy the world is.

132
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,280
transmitting an entire É Stars is.

133
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,520
Tell us your question?

134
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,160
With Orville she was just sitting there,

135
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,160


136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,760
Oh I don't have if.

137
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,800
I thought,

138
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,900
and that's always a question of where one must individually negotiate.

139
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:10,640
And besides, how much of a dance would it be?

140
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,060
I mean, just a gesture or something more?

141
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,060
Anyway, this may have to be put aside for subsequent negotiation.

142
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,820
But I am no stickler for a low price.

143
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,220
I will pay for value offered because that is the only fair and honorable thing to do.

144
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,960
I'll give you a free pamphlet number one if you do a lap dance for me.

145
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,380
Free pamphlet number one.

146
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,600
Let's continue.

147
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,120
Okay.

148
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,000
This question, although the name Bob is misspelled,

149
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,760
the question is, what will Bob do when the Mayan calendar ends?

150
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,460
Well, I guess he'll...

151
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,440
There was no money with that.

152
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,800
He'll put...

153
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,480
He'll put that big heavy stone thing in the garage

154
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,640
and probably not throw it away.

155
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,020
Maybe keep it for a garage sale.

156
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,440
I saw the Mayan calendar at the New York Museum.

157
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,500
Very impressive piece of carving, wouldn't you say?

158
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,180
Yeah.

159
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,140
It was...

160
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,200
Yeah, big...

161
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,740
A little too large for a paper weight.

162
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,340
You could crack walnuts with it, but it'd still be more trouble than it's worth.

163
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,280
All right.

164
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,340
Thank you.

165
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,200
Thank you.

166
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,260
Thank you.

167
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,940
Thank you.

168
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,120
Thank you.

169
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,740
Thank you.

170
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,740
in the newspaper

171
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,540
Performing clown

172
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,720
available

173
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,140
for your next

174
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,620
children's party

175
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,720
Pancho

176
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,860
spent his

177
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,080
last ten dollars

178
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,280
on a rubber nose

179
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,180
and face paint

180
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,940
and some funny

181
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,620
floppy shoes

182
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,640
The children

183
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,680
all ignored him

184
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,620
They thought

185
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,220
he wasn't funny

186
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,180
Their parents

187
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,900
wouldn't pay him

188
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,880
So he had

189
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,380
no food that week

190
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,260
No food

191
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,700
Nobody

192
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,600
cares

193
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,100
about

194
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,120
Pancho

195
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,440
Nobody

196
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,880
cares

197
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,640
at all

198
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,320
,

199
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,960
nobody cares

200
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,040
about him

201
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,940
He's a

202
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,180
good boy

203
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,340
and a

204
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,400
good boy

205
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,260
Pancho

206
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,140
fell in love

207
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,760
with a beautiful

208
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,580
trapeze artist

209
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,400
He showered

210
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
her with flowers,

211
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,320
gifts and candy

212
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,480
He was

213
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,060
a good boy

214
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,060


215
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,060


216
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,140
He was

217
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,140


218
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,140


219
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,140


220
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,240
He was

221
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,240


222
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,240


223
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,240


224
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,240


225
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,540
Hero!

226
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,520
He was a flower

227
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,160
and lazy

228
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,240
butweet

229
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,240


230
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,240


231
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,240


232
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,240


233
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,240


234
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,240


235
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,240


236
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,300
won't fly over his again.

237
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,440
New on the regain

238
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,260
His courage is bloomed

239
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,520
Nobody cares about Poncho

240
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,840
guitar solo

241
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,440
guitar solo

242
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,320
Poncho

243
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,820
Heartbroken and lonely

244
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,220
Jump off a bridge

245
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,160
Into

246
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,000
the icy

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,040
water

248
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,080
They found

249
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
his rubber nose

250
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,300
Smashed on

251
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,820
the pier

252
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,460
They found

253
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,520
him with his

254
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,480
face paint streaked

255
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,640
with tears

256
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,660
They buried

257
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,140
Poncho

258
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,960
in an

259
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,980
unmarked grave

260
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,380
Nobody

261
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,640
cared

262
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,600
about Poncho

263
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,440
Nobody

264
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,940
cared

265
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,000
about Poncho

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,780
Nobody

267
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,220
cared

268
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,340
Nobody

269
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,340
cared

270
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,940
Poncho

271
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,920
Don't you

272
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,400
caution

273
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,640
for a man

274
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,460
with a bloke

275
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,680
blood

276
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,500
Once at the

277
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,100
flowering

278
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,380
osair

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,500
Nobody

280
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,740
cared

281
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,460
about Poncho

282
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,380


283
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,380


284
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,380


285
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,880
in a

286
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,300
real

287
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,380
ت

288
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,760
Thank you.

289
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,700
Thanks to the Rudy Schwartz Project for that song,

290
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,540
Puncho the Clown from the new CD, The Year They Switched to Cornmeal.

291
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,560
If you need to know more about Rudy Schwartz Project,

292
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:51,360
Schwartz is spelled S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.

293
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,880
The Rudy Schwartz Project.

294
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,860
And now back to Dr. Howe.

295
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,140
Here's one.

296
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,300
One with a dollar bill.

297
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,600
If a Viking baby dies on a battlefield, does he go to Valhalla?

298
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,220
Trademark.

299
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,360
Isn't that an interesting question?

300
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,300
You know, if a Viking dies, a Viking has to die with a sword in his hand.

301
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:22,920
So this baby could go to Valhalla if it only had a sword in its little pudgy fist

302
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,820
when it died on the battlefield.

303
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,120
Then the choosers of the slain, the Valkyries,

304
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,900
would come diving down and they would seize that tiny toddler warrior's soul

305
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,520
in their long, slender fingers and fly up with him over the rainbow bridge

306
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,540
past Jotunheim, the frozen lands of the giants,

307
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,300
to Valhalla, the Hall of Heroes.

308
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:55,140
There, while all the Vikings drink enormous vessels of beer and fight all night

309
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,120
and then are miraculously healed of their wounds,

310
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,900
the next day when they start the whole thing,

311
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,740
this baby would be way out of place.

312
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,780
Sitting at the end of one of those long tables,

313
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,420
they wouldn't have much baby food for it in Valhalla, would they?

314
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,040
They'd have to start it on beer really early.

315
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,400
This may seem barbaric, but it's an honor.

316
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,100
It's an honor to be there.

317
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,760
What this reminds me of is that picture that was in the newspaper a few weeks ago

318
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,960
of this Filipino two-year-old who was smoking cigarettes

319
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,000
because they encourage kids to smoke.

320
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,240
He smoked cigarettes in the Philippines.

321
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,600
This smiling little naked baby with a smile on his lips

322
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,260
was expertly holding and puffing a cigarette in this photo.

323
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,160
Well, when that appeared in the paper,

324
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,180
the goo-goos of San Francisco almost had a cornea.

325
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,620
I mean a hernia.

326
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,580
I mean, you know, whatever.

327
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,980
A coronary.

328
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,340
They wrote endless letters to the paper.

329
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,840
They're still pouring in.

330
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,700
I'm sure that kid over in the Philippines is still puffing away.

331
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,220
This is from a relatively rich subgenius.

332
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,300
We can tell because it's a $5 bill.

333
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,420
A rich relative, eh?

334
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,640
Maybe it's from Richie Rich.

335
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,580
And the lettering is very, very clear.

336
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,360
It's rich lettering.

337
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,360
It has shading.

338
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,340
All right.

339
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,380
I have a throbbing sensation all over my body.

340
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:20,900
You too.

341
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,200
What is it?

342
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,120
It is knowledge that soon your chrysalis will crash.

343
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,680
And the new gleaming subgenius self will emerge

344
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:39,200
and flex and pump its atrophied muscles into fullness and hardness.

345
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,940
And then, reborn as a warrior for Bob,

346
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,580
you can reclaim your former domain,

347
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,260
which those who undervalued you kept from you.

348
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,600
And now, against them,

349
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,440
you can exert the full and glorious revenge.

350
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,580
Of ultimate success.

351
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
This July 5th, friends,

352
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,640
if you can stick around until Tuesday morning.

353
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,820
And even if you can't stick around,

354
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,160
they'll find you.

355
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,260
A long time ago in the 60s,

356
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,040
this reminds me of a TV show back on CBS,

357
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,160
back when there were only three networks.

358
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,620
They interviewed all these people,

359
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,620
including flying saucer cult contactees.

360
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,180
And they asked this one dumpy old lady,

361
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,860
well, Mrs. Yuka Brockowitz,

362
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,080
could you tell us a little bit about your trip to Venus?

363
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,520
And she said,

364
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,660
well, it started with a tingling sensation

365
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,860
all over my whole body.

366
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,780
Maybe a trip to Venus is in your future.

367
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,800
The planet Venus.

368
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,620
Anyway, let's go on.

¶¶

386
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,380
¶¶

387
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,280
¶¶

388
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,300
¶¶

389
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,060
the olive branch

390
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,180
observes the sky began to blanch

391
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,480
without a cry

392
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,880
without a prayer

393
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,980
with no betrayal

394
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,560
of despair

395
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,840
sometime when light obscures

396
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,660
the tree the zenith

397
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,900
of that life must be

398
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,940
past

399
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,800
done forever

400
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
and from thence a second

401
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,960
history will commence

402
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,420
a chronicle

403
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,180
no longer gold

404
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,480
of bargaining with mist

405
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,700
and mold and finally

406
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,540
the broken stem

407
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,600
the plummeting to earth

408
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,000
and then

409
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,380
an intercourse not

410
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,700
well designed for beings

411
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,200
of a golden kind

412
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,040
whose native green

413
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,940
must arch above the earth's

414
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,040
obscene

415
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,100
corrupting love

416
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,940
and still

417
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,960
the ripe fruit and the

418
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,120
branch observe the sky

419
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,100
began to blanch without a cry

420
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,580
without a prayer

421
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,860
with no betrayal

422
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,820
of despair

423
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,580
oh courage

424
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,860
could you not as well select some

425
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,760
other place to dwell

426
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,100
not only in that golden

427
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,680
tree

428
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,780
but in the frightened

429
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,620
heart of me

430
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,060
applause

431
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,300
applause

432
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,180
applause

433
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,700
applause

434
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,240
applause

435
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,400
applause

436
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,060
applause

437
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,140
applause

438
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,980
applause

439
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,220
applause

440
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,320
años

441
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,980
wikij

442
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,220
of

443
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,220


444
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,920
wind

445
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,140
courtyard

446
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,560
Are there any animals besides subgeni allowed on the saucers?

447
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,300
And if so, which ones and at what price?

448
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:28,180
Well, you know, it's a picturesque picture of leading the elephant and the kangaroo two by two aboard the saucer.

449
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,420
But all the time it takes and the feed bags and the vets and so on,

450
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:41,180
I think far more likely it is that the template for each species has been preserved by excess science.

451
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:51,780
Hence, the seeds saved, as Papa Joe Mama pointed out the other day in the redoubt in Antarctica against the oncoming disaster.

452
00:21:52,580 --> 00:22:01,660
They'll be whirled away with the saucers and there shall be a new heaven and a new earth like nothing yet seen.

453
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,620
Yea, like nothing ever seen.

454
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,800
There the tamarisk tree shall grow.

455
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,980
The lion shall lie down with the lamb.

456
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,820
And.

457
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,720
The titmouse will shiver in the tumtum tree.

458
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:22,660
But it may take some time to set these things up and I'm not leaving my stateroom until I feel like coming out.

459
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
I plan to.

460
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,780
We don't have plesiosaur seeds, but maybe they do.

461
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,040
Right.

462
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:37,380
I plan to beam up our pet newt when the time comes.

463
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,940
$16.99

464
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,360
Thanks for playing the next

465
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,360


466
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,540
Get your things, set them in a tent, a little bit faster.

467
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,240
Search, get what you find.

468
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,060
Can't you see we're in a tent, a little bit faster.

469
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,220
Get your things, set them in a tent, a little bit faster.

470
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,960
Search, get what you find.

471
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,840
That was Study in D, draft by the Psychoskeletons.

472
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,080
You can look at the log of this show on subgenius.com

473
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,920
and find the links for the Psychoskeletons.

474
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,820
Praise Bob.

475
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,840
And now back to Ask Dr. Howell live at 14X Day.

476
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,980
Here's a question related to an earlier one.

477
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,180
It's a logical question.

478
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,700
A Viking.

479
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,240
We get a lot of Viking questions here.

480
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,720
If a pregnant Viking woman is lanced with a sword

481
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,760
and the baby hand grabs the sword before self-aborting,

482
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,760
does it go to Valhalla, trademark?

483
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,880
Well, that is one for the judges, not for Dr. Howell.

484
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,440
The judges, you may remember, are three old ladies,

485
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,640
or actually one of them is quite fetching,

486
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,280
but they are the Norns who determine the fate of gods and men.

487
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,180
And this is such a narrow one that it would have to be called on one side or the other.

488
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,140
The baby hand has grabbed the sword.

489
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,820
He is a Viking baby.

490
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,980
He is dying.

491
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,700
He's dying with a sword in his hand.

492
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,140
But is he dying on a battlefield or in the comfort of his mother's womb?

493
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,940
There's a great difference.

494
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,260
You have to be in battle slain to go to the Hall of Heroes.

495
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,300
And they might have to put this fetus for all its valiantness

496
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,980
on the same end of the table with that other baby who died on the battlefield.

497
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,760
And now the gods are even more uncomfortable.

498
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,780
But they'll get used to it over eternity

499
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:20,560
until Ragnarok, the end, when flames devour Valhalla

500
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,540
and Midgard is destroyed only to be reformed.

501
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,400
Which should be the day after tomorrow.

502
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,160
That's right.

503
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,100
Jormungandr, the giant serpent, will rise from the sea

504
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,540
and, well, let's just say it won't be pretty.

505
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
Here's another question.

506
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,280
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?

507
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,040
That's a very good one.

508
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,760
And remember the slowpokes, the all-day suckers they used to say

509
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,260
as part of their advertising that it would take an entire day

510
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,440
to lick to the center of one of these.

511
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:57,640


512
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,700
Gluey, sugary, hypoglycemic concoctions.

513
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,040
They were made by the Welch's Candy Company

514
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,640
which supported the John Birch Society and Robert Welch.

515
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,080
Too bad if you were a fan of sugar babies, sugar daddies,

516
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:18,300
or any of the caramelized concoctions of this Midwestern candy company.

517
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,560
How many licks does it take if you're a mouse

518
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,520
and your tongue is three-fifths of an inch long?

519
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,240
How many licks does it take

520
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,000
if you're a camel and your tongue is a foot and a half long?

521
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,840
You know, who are you to lick a Tootsie Pop?

522
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,060
But I would have to say it takes as many licks

523
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,360
to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop as you care to give it.

524
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,540
Because if you're like me, after a while,

525
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,320
your tongue gets tired of the licking

526
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,600
and you just gnaw the thing between your teeth

527
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,740
and grind it up and have a large ball of caramel, sugar, and saliva in your mouth.

528
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,600
Whose aftereffects you will feel, perhaps even for years.

529
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,240
Ah!

530
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,820
Ah!

531
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,120


532
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,220
Ah!

533
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,540
Ah!

534
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,080


535
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,420
Ah!

536
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,560
Ah!

537
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,600
Ah!

538
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,860
Ah!

539
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,540
Ah!

540
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:16,900
Ah!

541
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,240
Ah!

542
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:17,340


543
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,080
Ah!

544
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,640
Ah!

545
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:18,640


546
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:18,780
Ah!

547
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:18,800
Ah!

548
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,880
Ah!

549
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:19,920
Ah!

550
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,140
Ah!

551
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:20,800


552
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:20,840


553
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:20,840


554
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,600
Ah!

555
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,660
Ah!

556
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,660


557
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,660


558
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,660


559
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,660


560
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,660


561
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,660


562
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,660


563
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,660


564
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,680
No.

565
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,420
Ah!

566
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,780
Ah!

567
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:42,880


568
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,180
Ah!

569
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:45,680
Ah!

570
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:46,460


571
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,040
Ah!

572
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,580
Ah!

573
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,840
No!

574
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:49,840


575
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:49,840


576
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,260
rooted muốn

577
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,240


578
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,080
I know sound effects are...

579
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:05,920
also from the movie Troll Hunter, a Norwegian movie that I would recommend if you love monsters.

580
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,900
And I'm not just a monster hugger.

581
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,820
Praise Bob.

582
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,180
And now back to Ask Dr. Howell.

583
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,960
Why does every day end in the letter Y?

584
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,660
Why slash why?

585
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,360
Why does every day end in the letter Y slash why?

586
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,320
Because this is the freedom-loving, red-blooded United States of America and not godless Russia,

587
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,540
where everyone looks at the sun when it goes down and shrugs and nods and says,

588
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,220
Duh.

589
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,480
But with us, it's day.

590
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,220
Glad, beautiful day.

591
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,700
Coming to its end.

592
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:53,240
Coming to the glorious end as the glorious lamp of heaven descends.

593
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,880
The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork.

594
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,180
Day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge.

595
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,820
There is no speech nor language where his voice is not heard.

596
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,820
His line has gone out through all the earth and his words unto the end of the world.

597
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,400
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, which is at us a bridegroom coming out of his chamber

598
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,480
and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

599
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,600
His going forth is from the end of the heavens and his circuit unto the ends of it

600
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,640
and nothing is...

601
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,040
hid from the heat thereof.

602
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,380
Thank you for your question.

603
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,860
That was pretty good for an unpaid question.

604
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,780
Speaking of the end...

605
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,300
If you could ask Bunny Day, she'd be Bunny Duh.

606
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,700
That wouldn't be good.

607
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,360
Welcome to my secret lair on Skullcrusher Mountain.

608
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,240
I hope that you've enjoyed your stay so far.

609
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,220
I see you've met my assistant, Scarface.

610
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:12,840
His appearance is quite disturbing, but I assure you he's harmless enough.

611
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:20,460
He's a sweetheart, calls me master, and he has a way of finding pretty things

612
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,940
and bringing them to me.

613
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:30,460
Oh, and I'm so into you, but I'm way too smart for you.

614
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,400
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy.

615
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,600
I'm not surprised that you agree.

616
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,180
If you could find some way to be a little bit less afraid of me,

617
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,600
you'd see the voices that control me from inside my head

618
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,340
and say I shouldn't care.

619
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,620
Oh, yeah.

620
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,940
I made this half pony, half monkey monster to please you.

621
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,880
But I get the feeling that you don't like it.

622
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,080
What's with all the screaming?

623
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,940
You like monkeys, you like ponies.

624
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,140
Maybe you don't like monsters so much.

625
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,520
Maybe I use too many monkeys.

626
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,180
Isn't it enough?

627
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,220
You know that I ruined a pony making a gift for you.

628
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:35,580
Oh, and I'm so into you, but I'm way too smart for you.

629
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,720
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy.

630
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,740
I'm not surprised that you agree.

631
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:49,320
If you could find some way to be a little bit less afraid of me,

632
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,560
you'd see the voices that control me.

633
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,480
You'd see me grill when my head is so black

634
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,980
and I get in trouble around you then

635
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,280
Shim Industrialぶみたい to kill you!

636
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,280
But I'm not surprised that you agree.

637
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,280


638
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,160
You look like an elk when you do something funny.

639
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:13,220
My lover is a monster, my lover.

640
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


641
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


642
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


643
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


644
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,980
token. And forever.

645
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,860
And the last one.

646
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:23,260
Fools who lead their foolish lives may find it quite explosive

647
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:30,380
Well, it won't mean half as much to me if I don't have you here

648
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,880
I know it isn't easy living here on Skull Crusher Mountain

649
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,700
So maybe you could cut me just a little slack

650
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,420
Would it kill you to be civil?

651
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,980
I've been patient, I've been gracious

652
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,380
And this mountain is covered with wolves

653
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,900
Hear them howling, my hungry children

654
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,920
Maybe you should stay and have another drink

655
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,540
And think about me and you

656
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:09,900
And I'm so into you, but I'm way too smart for you

657
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,800
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy

658
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,400
I'm not surprised that you're not

659
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,220
Can you agree?

660
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:23,600
If you could find some way to be a little bit less afraid of me

661
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,880
You'd see the voices that control me

662
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,080
From inside my head

663
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,180
Say I shouldn't kill you yet

664
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,620
I shouldn't kill you yet

665
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,980
I shouldn't kill you yet

666
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,580
I shouldn't kill you yet

667
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:49,580


668
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:49,580


669
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,500
Bobby!

670
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,060
Bobby!

671
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:54,680
Bobby!

672
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,540
Bobby!

673
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,740
You also do this character Bobby

674
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,480
And you made an audition tape

675
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Or Bobby made an audition tape

676
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,660
And I think you brought that

677
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,120
Let's take a look

678
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,100
Thanks a lot

679
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,320
Now it's stuck on that haunted house

680
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,920
I heard a witch lives there

681
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,020
I heard a Frankenstein lives there

682
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,820
You guys are way off

683
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,540
It's a secret lab where they take the brains out of zombies

684
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,100
And put them in the heads of other zombies

685
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,060
To create a race of super zombies

686
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,880
That's the house?

687
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,820
Ivan has to take to heart that he has control of his life

688
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,220
He's got all the tools to do whatever he wants

689
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,720
What you've done is so great

690
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,380
That I don't know how to even reciprocate

691
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,900
Ivan, can you be a good boy for me?

692
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


693
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


694
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


695
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


696
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


697
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


698
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


699
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


700
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


701
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:42,900


702
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,060
I want to be a good boy for you

703
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,280
I want to be a good boy for you

704
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,620
I want to be a good boy for you

705
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:44,640
Alright

706
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,460
I will tell you that you learned a lot

707
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,960
Bye Ivan

708
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,460
Bye

709
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,080
Bye Ivan

710
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,880
I think that the things that Ivan saw

711
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,280
Couldn't give us hope for change

712
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,480
But will Ivan change his ways?

713
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,460
I know myself better than anybody

714
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,080
Ivan please don't speak to your mother like that

715
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,480
Hey Ivan

716
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,800
How's it going?

717
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:05,900
Good

718
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,180
Got a few minutes?

719
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,200
I told Ivan I got a surprise for you.

720
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,620
It's a letter from Bub.

721
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,700
Mom, this is Amy.

722
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,140
Amy? Hi.

723
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,460
So you're the older woman Jay Arndt's been telling us about.

724
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,100
You are just as cute as a button.

725
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,460
And I can see what Jay Arndt meant when he said you have the curves of a video vixen.

726
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,940
What? No, I've never said that.

727
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,920
Oh, no, that was me.

728
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,560
Mm.

729
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:25,620
Hi.

730
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,980
How you doing? You can call me Bub.

731
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,180
Okay.

732
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,160
Mm, okay.

733
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,380
Have a seat.

734
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,080
Then bought a few bottles of the good stuff to go with it.

735
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,140
And Jay Arndt, if it's okay with your mama, you and Amy can drink as much as you want.

736
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,180
Yeah, a few sips.

737
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,600
Let's pretend we're French for the evening.

738
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:54,560
And Julio's gotta be a 착 on the cake?

739
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:54,560


740
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,260
But it's a little bit of a struggle.

741
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:05,240
Am I an ole animal club?

742
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,240


743
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:05,860
Maybe can she make it out with capt?

744
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:05,860


745
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,400
When it comes to music, Jamaica is all about Bob.

746
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,680
In fact, the late, great musical legend Bob is from right here, y'all.

747
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,980
Ladies, flash if you love Bob.

748
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,580
Bob's memory and music are kept alive at the Ocho Rios Reggae Museum.

749
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,200
In case you wanted to know what that Jamaican ganja was good for.

750
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,280
Captain Bob was in command of our sturdy little vessel,

751
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,620
and you could tell he really hated his job.

752
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,840
Well, like I always say, work is for people that don't know how to fish,

753
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,960
especially when you're out here off the Mexican coast,

754
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,660
catching 25, 30 sailfish a day on a good day,

755
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,540
and a good buzz and a bunch of naked ladies on a bad day.

756
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,100
Listen, I know a lot of you thought,

757
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,720
your world was going to end on Saturday.

758
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,400
Some of you even quit your jobs and sold your possessions.

759
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,960
What a bunch of idiots.

760
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:18,340
Bob it.

761
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,720
Salado, Texas.

762
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,540
Bob just turned 75, and he's having second thoughts about his birthday wish.

763
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Bob, first and last jump.

764
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,540
I'm not going to be parking last.

765
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,860
You want a word?

766
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,740
I'm going to get up and drive.

767
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,320
Before Bob can back out, they're at 13,000 feet.

768
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,040
But this trip will turn to trouble as he called in Bob.

769
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,640
The instructor forgets to release his safety belt.

770
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,560
Bob hangs helplessly two miles above the ground.

771
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,360
In less than 60 seconds, they'll be beyond the drop zone.

772
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
If they don't sever the belt quickly, there'll be no hope for a safe landing.

773
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,900
Just in time, the Tangling Duo is cut loose.

774
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,360
Oh, my God!

775
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,320
Now that they're finally free falling, Bob can enjoy the ride.

776
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,140
Safe on solid ground, he wonders what went wrong.

777
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,240
That's weird. Good job, Bob.

778
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,280
I couldn't see. I couldn't hear anything.

779
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,260
I didn't know what was happening. I was just dangling.

780
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,360
Bob waited 75 years for his first skydive and celebrated his birthday with the ride of his life.

781
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,440
Who's that, George?

782
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,780
That's me with Charlton Heston. He was...

783
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,220
Who's that, George?

784
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,500
Ah, see, you know him. That's Bob.

785
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,000
Recognize this?

786
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,080
Yeah, it's Don't Stop Believing by Journey.

787
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,460
Great song. Great song.

788
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,300
Yeah, but there's a few more. Listen.

789
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,920
My life is brilliant.

790
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,840
My love is pure.

791
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,100
I saw an angel.

792
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,880
Of this I'm sure.

793
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:35,900
Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you.

794
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:43,560
No one, no one, no one can get in the way of what I'm feeling.

795
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,440
Since the way you left me, I'm not pretending.

796
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,140
No love, no hope, no glory.

797
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,840
No happy ending.

798
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,320
Thanks, you were fuel for thought.

799
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:58,200
Now I'm all lonely than before.

800
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,040
But that's okay.

801
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,460
People killing, people dying.

802
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,460
Children hurt, women crying.

803
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,480
If you practice what you preach, you can turn the other cheek.

804
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,500
Cause you were amazing.

805
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,140
And we did amazing things.

806
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,020
If I could, then I would.

807
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,620
Oh girl, wherever you will go.

808
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,700
Don't let the days go by.

809
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,640
So tell me why should I let you go?

810
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:46,700
Cause we are gonna be forever you and me.

811
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,660
And where I go, I just don't know.

812
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,500
I gotta, gotta, gotta take it slow.

813
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,600
Say you're gonna stay.

814
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,720
Now I need to know it.

815
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:09,060
And I want a TV embrace.

816
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,960
And she will be loved.

817
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,680
Yeah, she will be loved.

818
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:25,720
Oh I can't live with or without you.

819
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:36,400
Whenever I fall at your feet, you let your tears.

820
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,240
Am I not pretty enough?

821
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,280
Is my heart too broke?

822
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,020
Hm.

823
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,660
When I find myself in times of fear.

824
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:46,660


825
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:46,880
When I find myself in times of trouble.

826
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,680
Mother Mary comes to me.

827
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,400
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner.

828
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm starting with the man in the mirror.

829
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,900
Can you feel the love tonight?

830
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,940
I come from a land down under.

831
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,760
Once a jolly swagman can't buy a billabong.

832
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,820
Do I cry too much?

833
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,800
Am I too outspoken?

834
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,940
Take on me.

835
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,780
Take on me.

836
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,000
Take me on.

837
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,680
Take on me.

838
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,160
I'll be gone in a year or two.

839
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,860
Save tonight.

840
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
And find the break of dawn.

841
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,440
Come tomorrow.

842
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,980
Tomorrow I'll be gone.

843
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,820
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.

844
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,740
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.

845
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,700
I know she's playing with me.

846
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,780
Well that's okay cause I got no self-esteem.

847
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,620
Away, oh yeah.

848
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,480
It's alright to tell me what you think about me.

849
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,520
I won't try to argue or hold it against you.

850
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,940
It's too late to apologize.

851
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,700
It's too late.

852
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,620
Take your canvas bags.

853
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,660
Take your canvas bags.

854
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,220
Take your canvas bags to the supermarket.

855
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,700
Take your canvas bags.

856
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,860
Nothing's right, I'm torn.

857
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,760
I'm all out of faith.

858
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,160
This is how I feel.

859
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,840
I'm cold and I am shamed.

860
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,740
Lying naked on the floor.

861
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,800
Illusion never changed.

862
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,100
Into something real.

863
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,140
I'm wide awake and I can see.

864
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,780
I'm more than a bird.

865
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,500
I'm more than a plane.

866
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,080
I'm a bird plane.

867
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,700
I'm a bird plane.

868
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,060
A motherfucking bird plane.

869
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,440
Doesn't that sound familiar?

870
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,880
Doesn't that hit too close to home?

871
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,680
Doesn't that make you shiver?

872
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,540
The way that things have gone.

873
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,480
Doesn't that seem peculiar?

874
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,900
Cause everyone wants a little more.

875
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,460
And something I do remember.

876
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,540
To never go this far.

877
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,260
That's all it takes to be a star.

878
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:39,980
And that's what I'm going to ask Dr. Howell.

879
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,460
Here, we keep getting questions.

880
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,540
And this one has an IOU of ten dollars.

881
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,820
From Reverend Fox over there.

882
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,760
Excellent. Ten dollars.

883
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:54,240
If all the dinosaurs came back for 24 hours,

884
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,920
how would you schedule that day?

885
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,020
I'd want to high tail it for the mountains.

886
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,960
Because as far as we know,

887
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,900
there weren't too many mountainous dinosaurs.

888
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,820
Actually, all the fossils that we have

889
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,800
come from the lowlands.

890
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,060
From the swamps.

891
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,760
The watery areas.

892
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,180
We have no idea what existed.

893
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,840
What lived up in the mountains.

894
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,460
At any time in the history of life.

895
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,260
Fossils just don't form up there.

896
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,120
Now you may know, or may not know,

897
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,060
that as a cartoonist,

898
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,500
I've worked on trading card sets before.

899
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,240
Of the non-sports group.

900
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,460
And I worked on the dinosaur's attack cards.

901
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,960
The thing about the dinosaur's attack cards,

902
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,460
is this was the scenario.

903
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,680
All the dinosaurs come back.

904
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,460
They pop into existence.

905
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,520
Sometimes they form into existence

906
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,740
around people who are entombed.

907
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,700
Partly sticking out of a dinosaur.

908
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,360
Wiggling their arms in vain.

909
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,440
And all sorts of thoughtful atrocities

910
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,380
are in these cards.

911
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,440
I would schedule this day with a nice trip to the mountains.

912
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,180
And that's where I'd stay.

913
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,080
Watch the whole thing on TV.

914
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,660
Come down when it was all over.

915
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,440
Although I wouldn't mind the dinosaurs coming back.

916
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,220
They wouldn't like it here.

917
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,480
Because there's not enough food for them.

918
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,340
In order for enormous monsters to exist,

919
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,480
there has to be lots and lots of food available.

920
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,500
And we have used almost everything up.

921
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,720
Soon there will not be enough for us.

922
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,740
Now hopefully this is the last question.

923
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,800
By the way, these...

924
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,160
You'll get it.

925
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,620
We're starting to get questions written on these

926
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,720
anonymous subgenius orgy invitations.

927
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,300
You're going to have to close us down.

928
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,820
That's what we do.

929
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,400
We can't go on forever.

930
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,600
And so at a certain point you say this session is closed.

931
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,200
But how long are we supposed to run anyway?

932
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,640
It's now 5.10.

933
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,240
Bulldada auction would be the next thing.

934
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,480
Okay, it's 5.10.

935
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,380
We'll do the last question, closing poem,

936
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,800
and start the bulldada auction.

937
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,340
What do you say?

938
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,200
That's fine.

939
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,540
And this is pretty...

940
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,100
So here's our final question, folks.

941
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:02,700
Yeah.

942
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,660
Take a look at the handwriting on this, Dr. Howell.

943
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,700
When is the anal prolapse for distance competition...

944
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:12,900
Competition.

945
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,300
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

946
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:20,180
Or is that taking it, quote, too far, non-end quote?

947
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,120
I wonder if the writer of this question

948
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,780
has been at earlier X days

949
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,100
where people played some of these games

950
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,740
and played them a little too hard

951
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,140
and had to have, was it helicopters coming in, ambulances?

952
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,680
Whatever.

953
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,840
People had to be hauled out of here screaming in pain.

954
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,160
Is that what you need to complete your X day?

955
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,200
Perhaps you should be the volunteer.

956
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,960
But, you know, the anal sphincter is fairly elastic.

957
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:56,020
You'd have to work really hard to create a prolapse like this,

958
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,580
like the one you mentioned.

959
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,780
You should probably get busy.

960
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,280
So that concludes our question and answer session.

961
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,780
And in keeping with the Viking theme early,

962
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,700
I will conclude with a Viking poem,

963
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,460
The Skeleton in Armor.

964
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,000
Speak, speak, ye fearful guest,

965
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,280
Who with thy hollow breast,

966
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,200
Still in rude armor dressed,

967
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,840
Comest to daunt me,

968
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,480
Wrapped not in eastern balms,

969
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,700
But with thy fleshless palms,

970
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,320
Stretched as if asking alms,

971
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,800
Why dost thou haunt me?

972
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,140
Then from those cavernous eyes

973
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,180
Pale flashes seemed to rise,

974
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,680
As when the northern skies gleam in December,

975
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,780
And as the waters flow under December's snow,

976
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,580
Came a dull voice of woe from the heart's chamber.

977
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,920
I was a Viking old,

978
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,740
My deeds though manifold,

979
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,000
No skald in song has told,

980
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,240
No saga taught thee.

981
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,540
Take heed that in thy verse,

982
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,620
Thou dost the tale rehearse,

983
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,760
Else fear a dead man's curse,

984
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,360
For this I sought thee.

985
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,960
Far in the northern land,

986
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,680
By the wild Baltic's strand,

987
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,040
I with my childish hand,

988
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,100
Tamed the girfalcon,

989
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,520
And with my skates fast bound,

990
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,620
Skimmed the half-frozen sound,

991
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,580
That the poor whimpering hound,

992
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,560
Trembled to walk on.

993
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,960
Oft from his frozen lair,

994
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,320
Tracked I the grizzly bear,

995
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,780
Oft from my path the hare,

996
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,000
Fled like a shadow,

997
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,140
Oft through the forest dark,

998
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,280
Followed the werewolf's bark,

999
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,520
Until the soaring lark sang in the meadow.

1000
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,640
But when I older grew,

1001
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,620
Joining a corsair's crew,

1002
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,520
Over the sea I flew with the marauders,

1003
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,200
Wild was the life we led,

1004
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,320
Many the souls that sped,

1005
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,320
Many the hearts that bled,

1006
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,420
By our firm orders.

1007
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,360
Oft the wild wassail bout,

1008
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,100
Wore the long winter out,

1009
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
Often our midnight shouts,

1010
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,740
At the cocks crowing,

1011
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,820
When we the berserk's tail,

1012
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,740
Measured in pots of ale,

1013
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,500
Draining the oak tree,

1014
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,280
The oaken pail filled to o'erflowing.

1015
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,060
Once as I told in glee,

1016
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,040
Tales of the stormy sea,

1017
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,740
Soft eyes there gazed on me,

1018
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,440
Burning yet tender,

1019
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,260
And as the white stars shine,

1020
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,200
On the dark Norway pine,

1021
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,140
On that dark heart of mine,

1022
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,940
Fell their soft splendor.

1023
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,780
I wooed the blue-eyed maid,

1024
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,100
Yielding yet half afraid,

1025
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,000
And in the forest shade,

1026
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,740
Our vows were plighted,

1027
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,700
Under her loosened vests,

1028
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,240
Grasped I her trembling breasts,

1029
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,980
Like birds within their nests,

1030
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,040
By the hawk frighted.

1031
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,220
Bright in her father's hall,

1032
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,440
Shields gleamed upon the wall,

1033
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,060
Loudly the minstrels all chanted his glory,

1034
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,360
When of old Hildebrand,

1035
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,860
I asked his daughter's hand,

1036
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,500
Mute did the minstrels stand,

1037
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,780
To hear my story.

1038
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,140
As the brown ale he quaffed,

1039
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,060
Loud then the champion laughed,

1040
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,340
And as the winds that waft

1041
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,580
The sea foam brightly,

1042
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,800
So the loud laugh of scorn,

1043
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,040
Out from those lips unshorn,

1044
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,620
From the deep drinking horn,

1045
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,800
Blew the foam lightly.

1046
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,640
She was a prince's child,

1047
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,060
I but a Viking wild,

1048
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,280
And though she blushed and smiled,

1049
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,540
I was discarded.

1050
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,500
Should not the sea-mew's flight

1051
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,800
Follow the dove so bright?

1052
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,480
Why did they leave,

1053
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,740
That night her nest unguarded?

1054
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,680
Scarce had I put to sea,

1055
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,960
Bearing the maid with me,

1056
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,000
Fairest by far was she among the Norsemen,

1057
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,040
When on the bright sea-sand,

1058
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,500
Waving his armoured hand,

1059
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,740
Saw we old Hildebrand with twenty horsemen,

1060
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,820
Launched they against the blast,

1061
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,240
Bent like a reed each mast,

1062
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,640
Yet we were gaining fast,

1063
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,000
When the wind failed us,

1064
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,880
And in the dusky scaw came round

1065
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,220
The windy flaw,

1066
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,220
So that the foe we saw laugh

1067
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,640
As he hailed us.

1068
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,660
And as the flapping sail

1069
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,200
Veered round to catch the gale,

1070
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,880
Death was the helmsman's hail,

1071
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,900
Death without quarter.

1072
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,240
Mid-ship with iron keel

1073
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,900
Struck we her ribs of steel,

1074
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,660
Down her black hulk did reel,

1075
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,420
Through the black water.

1076
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,900
As with his wings aslant,

1077
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,660
Sails the fierce cormorant,

1078
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,720
Seeking some rocky haunt

1079
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,660
With his prey laden,

1080
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,380
There towards the open main,

1081
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,400
Beating to sea again,

1082
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,720
Through the wild hurricane,

1083
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,100
Bore I the maiden.

1084
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,940
Three weeks we westward bore,

1085
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,260
And when the storm was o'er,

1086
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,500
Cloud-like we saw the shore

1087
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,020
Stretching to leeward,

1088
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,640
There for many years,

1089
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,680
Through my lady's bower,

1090
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,880
Built I the lofty tower,

1091
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,840
Which to this very hour

1092
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,480
Stands looking seaward.

1093
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,340
There we lived many years.

1094
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,300
Time dried the maiden's tears,

1095
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,380
She had forgot her fears,

1096
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,860
She was a mother.

1097
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,720
Death closed her pale blue eyes,

1098
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,020
Under that tower she lies,

1099
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,220
Never shall sun arise

1100
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,360
On such another.

1101
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,300
Still grew my bosom then,

1102
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,740
Still as a stagnant fen,

1103
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,360
Hateful to me were men,

1104
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,900
The sunlight hateful.

1105
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,100
In the vast forest here,

1106
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,220
Clad in my warlike gear,

1107
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,980
Fell I upon my spear.

1108
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,760
Oh, death was grateful.

1109
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,100
Thus, seamed with many scars,

1110
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,400
Bursting these prison bars,

1111
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,780
Up to its native stars,

1112
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,420
My soul ascended.

1113
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,860
There, from the flowing bowl,

1114
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,480
Drinks deep the warrior's soul.

1115
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,780
Skull to the Northland!

1116
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,440
Skull!

1117
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,240
Yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai!

1118
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,380
Thus, the tale ended.

1119
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,720
Thank you.

1120
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,480
Thank you, Dr. Howell,

1121
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,400
for answering so many difficult

1122
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,740
and impossible questions.

1123
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,620
Oh, by the way,

1124
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,980
why is a turtle mound,

1125
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,920
why do they call those turtle mounds?

1126
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,720
Well, Ivan, they called it a turtle mound,

1127
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,680
because to the Native Americans

1128
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,840
who inhabited this area,

1129
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,860
the turtle represented the great seat

1130
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,180
of the cosmos and the earth itself,

1131
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,520
was conceived as on the shell of a turtle,

1132
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,640
which is to say, more properly,

1133
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,680
a tortoise, not a turtle,

1134
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,840
the land-dwelling tortoise.

1135
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,120
And as you know, in some cosmoses,

1136
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,760
the earth and its seas

1137
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,480
are on the back of a giant tortoise,

1138
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,100
and beneath that, there's another giant tortoise,

1139
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,480
and some people say it's tortoises

1140
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,520
all the way down.

1141
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,700
Time will tell, when we take

1142
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,240
off, we may get a good view.

1143
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:22,800
Thank you.

1144
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,920
I had to ask Dr. Howell that question,

1145
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,760
because, and I've got this on tape,

1146
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,180
there's a turtle mound down the road,

1147
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,360
and I idly said,

1148
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,460
why the hell do they call that turtle mound?

1149
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,200
And I have a recording of Dr. Howell

1150
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,980
saying the phrase, I don't know.

1151
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,220
And I said, I'm going to ask you,

1152
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,940
now I know the question to ask you,

1153
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,320
and he said, I'll answer it.

1154
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,320
So, friends, thank you very much.

1155
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,580
I guess the Bulldada auction now begins.

1156
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,940
I need a break.

1157
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,100
Yes, let's get that going.

1158
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,340
Okay, you take a break,

1159
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,420
and we'll come back,

1160
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,300
and we'll start the auction.

1161
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,720
Yeah, and friends,

1162
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,780
these Jenkum Huffing Chamber things,

1163
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,080
anyone who wants to grab some Scotch tape

1164
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,340
from the registration box,

1165
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,620
and these anonymous, mysterious,

1166
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,540
subgenius orgy invitations,

1167
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,300
they're meant to be just left in mystery,

1168
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,840
mysterious places around here.

1169
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,080
The Jenkum Huffing Chamber, of course,

1170
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,460
goes in the chem toilets.

1171
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,340
And they always get taken down within a day,

1172
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,140
but it always does my heart good to see them.

1173
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,300
So anyone with the red minion bracelet

1174
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,020
should take on that chore at some point.

1175
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:39,560
Thank you.

1176
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,280
Don't let us deter you

1177
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,080
from doing business with us again.

1178
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1179
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,300
You're listening to

1180
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,960
the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1181
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,720
For free information on Bob Dobbs

1182
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,200
and the Church of the Subgenius,

1183
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,920
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1184
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,900
Got your pencil ready?

1189
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,980
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1190
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,620
Now this whole world has no clue what they're doing

1191
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,420
Got enough money in the bank for the tools

1192
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,600
So I gotta keep enough lettuce to support the shoe

1193
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,160
Fetish lifestyle so rich and famous

1194
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,000
Robin Leach will get jealous

1195
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,260
Half a million views

1196
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:50,260


1197
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:50,840
But it's gold

1198
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,820
Take a trip from here to Rome

1199
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,620
So if you ain't got no money

1200
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,560
Take your broke and moaned

1201
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,480
There was a boy

1202
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,320
And he said,

1203
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,220
I need a brand new ball

1204
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,400
I need a brand new ball

1205
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,100
And I don't wanna buy it

1206
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,500
I need a brand new ball

1207
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,660
There was a boy

1208
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,160
And he said,

1209
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,020
I need a brand new ball

1210
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,120
I need a brand new ball

1211
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,300
And he broke and moaned

1212
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:28,200
There were no teeth teaming him on

1213
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:47,120
How to support cool sports

1214
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,320
I can make you broke and lonely.

1215
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,340
No one knows what I'd be with.

1216
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,100
No one knows what I'd be with.

1217
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,900
No one knows what I'd be with.

1218
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,380
No one knows what I'd be with.

1219
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,680
Yo, DJ Pussy Party!

1220
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,260
Pussycat went to sea in a beautiful pea green boat.

1221
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,300
They took some money and plenty of honey

1222
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,340
wrapped up in a five-pound note.

1223
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,180
The owl looked up to the stars above

1224
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,860
as he sang to a small guitar,

1225
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:32,300
Oh, Pussy, Oh, Pussy, Oh, Pussy, my love,

1226
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,500
what a beautiful pussy you are.

1227
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,100
You are? What a beautiful pussy you are.

1228
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,880
Pussy said to the owl,

1229
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,260
You elegant fowl, how charmingly sweet you sing.

1230
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,620
Come, let us be married.

1231
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,880
Too long we have tarried.

1232
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,360
But what shall we do for a ring?

1233
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,880
So they sailed away for a year and a day

1234
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,280
to the land where the bong tree grows.

1235
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,120
And there in the wood a piggy wig stood

1236
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,940
with a ring at the end of his nose,

1237
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,740
his nose, with a ring at the end of his nose.

1238
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,580
Dear Pig,

1239
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,700
are you willing to sell for a shilling

1240
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,020
your ring?

1241
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,600
said the piggy, I will.

1242
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,120
So they took it away and were married next day

1243
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,160
by the turkey who lives on the hill.

1244
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,800
They dined upon mints and on slices of quince,

1245
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,480
which they ate with a runcible spoon.

1246
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,200
And hand in hand on the edge of the sand

1247
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,860
they danced by the light of the moon,

1248
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,260
the moon, they danced by the light of the moon.

1249
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,420
Oh, sire,

1250
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:43,920
no more money?

1251
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,380
We gotta get some money.

1252
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,220
That dirty purgish harker backflagging

1253
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,560
Wharton, Philip Bunker Burton,

1254
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,840
Perkaluma Burton,

1255
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,200
doesn't wash the night away.

1256
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,140
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1257
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,540
and we're even more glad that some listeners

1258
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,940
have donated enough to help us keep on going

1259
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,460
for another couple of months.

1260
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,280
And not just this show,

1261
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,540
but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1262
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,040
But if you truly love Bob,

1263
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:16,560
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1264
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,500
you should go to subgenius.com front page

1265
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,040
or especially the radio page

1266
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,060
or the catalog store pages

1267
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,380
and help out financially as best you can.

1268
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:31,740
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1269
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,760
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1270
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,400
to make their own situations worse.

1271
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,340
But some of you still have jobs.

1272
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,680
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1273
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,940
even if it's only,

1274
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,240
only once a month from enough of you.

1275
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,660
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1276
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,960
All we're saying is that

1277
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,360
blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs

1278
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,420
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1279
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:00,020
We also take checks and money orders to

1280
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,920
Subgenius Foundation.
