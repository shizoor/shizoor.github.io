Oh, my friends, my good, good friends.
This is going to be a pretty unusual Hour of Slack
because it's going to be an all-lymph node Hour of Slack.
Lymph Node Institute is, for those not in Atlanta,
are the alternate subgenius show at WREK Atlanta
that alternates with Reverend Susie the Floozy's show,
which I also often use to bail my butt out when I'm very late on shows.
And that's the situation here, friends,
as the swinging love corpses bangs away in the background
on the infamous Bay Dat jams.
We had some bad crashes, physical crashes of loved ones and loved computers,
things that slowed.
That slowed us down a bit.
Unexpected, but, you know, that's life, isn't it?
But yet, we've been making new things in between.
I've been very, very busy and learning new ways to make new things.
I love to learn new ways to make new things.
It's not very good for one's career
because you end up shooting your career down every couple of years.
As soon as you get good at something,
you move on to the next.
Hmm.
Newly invented medium.
Great!
But, yes, so many new, new things lurk on the horizon
for the dedicated subgenius.
Video.
I can do video editing now at home for nothing at last.
New CDs.
We have a new mail order company.
You still get stuff from Subgenius Foundation and so forth,
but we changed fulfillment companies,
so you might check out the website.
The website, www.subgenius.com,
which explains everything there is to know about all of this stuff.
But, oh, man, friends, I'm so far behind.
There are devivals from going back a year and a half
that I have not had time to edit and use on this show yet.
Some great subgenius preaching.
And there are new books.
New books.
More book.
In the making.
Remember those?
Those old Piper things?
Well, we're kind of doing that again.
It's a new day, people, so put your hands together.
Yeah!
Swing and love, gorgeous friends.
It's a new day.
It's a new world.
And this is a new way for me to get out of spending.
I just don't have time to spend on a show,
so you lucky...
You'll be a bridge to the new century.
You lucky centurions you get to listen to.
A bridge to the future that everyone can watch.
And walk on no matter what the state of their shoes.
That's the Swing and Love Corpses, friends.
But this isn't going to be a Swing and Love Corpses show.
It will be a Lymphnode Institute show from WREK in Atlanta.
The Lymphnode lads, well, they do a subgenius-ish show.
Completely different from the way I do it.
And let us just let them do it.
By the way, I should mention, as always,
that, uh...
The program you are about to hear,
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,
is parody, satire, and comedy.
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius,
religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects
is intended only as humor,
and should cast no reflection on the high standards of...
Insert station call letters here.
...its staff, or that of...
...the church.
This episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse
is brought to you by the Personal Tension Reduction Limited Series
plugs of ex-presidents.
From the cherrywood gorgeous George
to the tricky dick,
to the...
...the not-so-wimpy George Bushwhacker,
and our latest addition, the Slick Willie.
You can collect all 42.
Just relax, don't be so tense,
get help from the ex-presidents.
Hello, Don.
We now join the national anthem already in progress.
But we watch
whistle gallantly streaming
And the rockets'
red flag
Uh-oh.
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
I'll make up for it now.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oh, the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

You're listening to Bob Slaktime Funhouse,
the Lift Note Institute edition.
Very well.
Happy 4th of freakin' July, people!
Whee!
Happy birthday, America!
If you're here for your sub-G fix
and want to hear an X-Day show,
well, you should have listened to Suzy,
Reverend Sister Suzy the Floozy.
If you listened to our X-Day show,
oh, three years ago?
98, yes.
Yeah, we got stiffed.
They didn't come.
The X-DÂãù there's supposed to come on July,
July 5th, and...
Didn't happen.
No.
Were you surprised?
We stayed up all night.
We did.
Were you surprised?
I was not surprised.
No, I wasn't either.
So we're not doing it this time.
We're going to talk about the prevalent holiday that's occurring for most everyone else.
America!
Independence Day!
Wake up and smell your 225th birthday.
Independs.
That means you're wearing depends undergarments, and if you poop yourself, that's okay.
And I was going to say that our country is kind of crapping its own pants, but we're
going to try to be pro-America, right?
I'm more about number one than number two.
I think it's my country tis of pee, as opposed to poo.
We do live in the time of pee.
Urine testing.
Mayan testing?
Urine testing.
Mayan testing?
Exactly.
Mayan testings?
Your urine.
Who wiped out the Mayans, or was that the Aztecs?
Who wiped out the Aztecs?
I believe the Spanish did them both.
Bastards.
Columbus was a Spaniard, wasn't he?
He was an Italian.
He was funded by the Spaniards.
Queen Isabella.
That's right.
Whore.
That's one man's opinion.
She was not the virgin queen of Spain.
That doesn't work that way.
Likewise, I'm not sure if she actually sold sexual favors for money.
Well, as the story goes, she ran after Columbus after his third attempt at getting the money
and said, sell my jewelry to finance your mission.
All hail the American knight.
If Columbus were all the things were gone, I have worked for all my life.
And I have worked for all my life.
I have put start again with just my children and my wife.
I have worked for all my life.
On the 4th of July, there are fireworks to celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
I think my lucky stars could be lighting here today.
Our forefathers declared the independence of the colonies from England.
Watch to our face, little Mary God.
Cross the flag, it's close.
Stand for freedom.
And they can't take that away.
Then there was a war.
One if I land, two if I see.
I stand for the world of the free.
And I'm proud to be an American,
for at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died,
who gave that right to me.
The Redcoats are coming.
Yes!
A shot for a glass of wine.
I'm going to work for it.
Taxation without representation.
Most tax breaks make no use.
I'm those religious Washington's crossing of the Delaware River.
I've left the blue and white to bear on.
And I'm glad we stand up next to blue and defend post-Telcando.
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.
God bless the blue ass-o.
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee.
Onward!
Onward!
Onward!
Onward!
Across the plains of Texaco.
Onward!
From sea to shining sea.
From Detroit down to Houston.
And New York to El Dorado.
First pride in every American heart.
I still have faith in America.
And it's time to stand and say that I'm proud to be an American,
for at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died,
for God that right for me.
And I'll gladly stand up next to blue and defend post-Telcando.
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.
God bless the blue ass-o.
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee.






Onward!
Onward!
Onward!
Onward!
And it's time to stand and say that I'm proud to be an American,
for at least I know I'm free.
And it's time to stand and say that I'm proud to be an American,
for at least I'm proud to be an American.

I can go cause there ain't no doubt I love this man the god bless the blue ass man.
WAKE UP!
So they've got workmen here at the radio station and they keep using their leaf blowers and that's a lie.
They're a rumble cage.
Rumblefish.
Yes, the institute is always in flux. We're always changing things.
We're not on the radio station.
We're always moving things.
We're at the institute. We're reporting live from the institute itself.
My vision, not so good lately.
Not gonna understand. You're getting old as well.
I am. We're all getting very old.
How old did you say the country is?
225 years old.
This year?
Yes.
That's a pretty good anniversary. What is that?
It's nice and round.
Is it the China anniversary?
225? I don't know.
Barium.
Yeah, the barium anniversary or the drive a steak through its heart anniversary.
Cause anyone that's lived 225 years old has been doing something unseemly.
So anybody out in middle America, in the heart of America?
Yes.
Watch out, there's a giant wooden stake coming your way.
Them are good eating.
Yes.
Lots of steaks on the 4th of July.
Steaks and burgers and ribs.
Cookouts.
Cookouts.
I didn't say it was high quality. I just said it was radio magic.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I beg your pardon.
Vulgar song.
I beg your pardon.
Pull out a song.
The well-known vulgar song.
The bombs, bombs, bombs bursting in air.
I beg your pardon.
And the rockets, and the rockets, and the rockets, red glare.
Vulgar song.
The intense patriotism surging across our country
carried the national anthem to new and different heights.
Targeting.
All the way to the top of a music chart.
Vulgar, vulgar song.
Pull out a song.
I am an American.
You're an extremist.
Listen to my words.
Bombs, rockets, bombs, rockets.
Specimen collector.
Before you even start, I am an American.
I will escort you to the toilet to observe the passing of urine.
Two, three.
All he tried to do is obfuscate, to confuse.
I am an American.
The bombs, the bombs bursting, bursting, bursting in air.
The suspense, all the song.
And the rhythm.
The way it sounds more like a scream door.
A tail caught in a scream door.
I beg your pardon.
Are you dissatisfied with the song?
Sounds more like a scream with a scream caught in a scream door.
Well, no, it wasn't meant to be sung while sober, yeah?
Scream door.
Caught in a tail scream door.
I beg your pardon.
Yeah?
No, it actually began as a drinking song.
Oh, yeah?
Doesn't just hearing it make you wish you weren't sober?
Oh, yeah?
Oh, you mean, uh...
Yes.
It's author Francis...
He might have been charmed by topping the top 40,
but was this really what he had in mind?
Drink up.
Bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs, the bombs, the bombs, red glare.
Better yet, the sweet, delicious coldness of the first bite of peppermint ice cream on the 4th of July.
Better yet, drink up.
Was this really his song?
Drink up.
Well, you wish you weren't sober?
Who is?
Anacreon, a Greek poet who celebrated...
Scream door.
Drinking.
Well, I do.
Drink up.
To be free.
Yes.
The tune of our national anthem was lifted from an old English drinking song.
Go.
Doesn't just hearing it make you wish you weren't sober?
Who is?
The people who wrote it certainly weren't.
Drink up.
Francis Scott Key wasn't either when he stole the tune.
I'll bet I'd have liked him.
Oh, you would have liked Anacreon even more.
Anacreon.
Anacreon.
I do.
Even more.
Anac...
Well, all the good things in life.
Oh, you mean, uh...
Yes.
Let's sing it again.
Long a song, Spangler.
Long a song.
Oh, say can you...
No, no, no.
Those are the new words, remember?
Oh, so who knows the old ones?
A song sung in pubs throughout England.
To Anacreon in hell.
I am an American.
Very sad in full glee.
I am an American.
A few words such as the one.
Now we stand by the rails and receive a hair-raising impression of how this projectile sounds as it passes by.
To be free.
The rocket's bursting in air.
To be free.
When this answer arrives.
To be free.
And the bombs red glare.
The old creation.
Drink up.
The separation of the first stage at Burnham.
Freedom to think.
Freedom to speak.
The intermittent sounds of the guidance rockets.
Freedom to speak.
The separation of the second stage.
To pray.
To read.
To act.
To pray.
To criticize.
Freedom to eat and sleep.
To work and play.
Without pain.
Freedom to live one or two hundred million different lives.
I am an American.
Drink up.
Let it be a holiday in your house of eternity.
Let it be a holiday in your house of eternity.
Every American has at least one thing to be thankful for.
A cheap shot.
Just not true.
But be still sold a flag and not a shirt.
It isn't on there in the back.
No, no, no.
I thought it was beautiful.
But then there you go.
I know.
I know.
That's it.
I know.

I know.
I know.
I know.

I know.
I know.


I know.
I know.
I know.

I show it with my face on your face.

I don't want to see your face no more.
Life never ends like this.

I don't want to eat your little ones.
When you look at me.
Walk through my night.
I want you to do what you are allowed to do.
Speak your st√∂rlichestes.

And we're back.
It's like we never left.
Yeah, those damn Brits.
What do they got?
They got fish and chips.
That's all right.
They have terrible food.
They have terrible dental care.
Did we rag on the Queen, Mom?
She wasn't really Queen when we did the independence thing.
No, it was King George II, much like we have a King George II right now.
Ooh, so can we declare independence?
He's not really a king.
He's our sovereign.
Suck, though.
Whereas Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar, and if you're a Rhodes Scholar, you have to sign a document.
Take it as seriously as you want, but it basically says that you'll do whatever you can to get America back into the arms of England.
Oh, my goodness.
I know.
I wish I was making that up.
How did we end up on topic?
Go on.
The Bush lineage does meet up with the Rothschilds somewhere.
Therefore, they're cousins to many of the crowned heads of Europe.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, you're a devil, you're a man, you're a man
That's how it ever felt to me
Well, I've been like my heart when you stayed
Well, I've been like my heart when you stayed
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Did you know that there was a whole land of people living here before Whitey got here?
It's strange, isn't it, to say that we discovered America
because there were a hell of a lot of people who knew where it was.
The Norse went up to Newfoundland.
Did you ever see the movie, was it The Viking?
The Viking with Kirk Douglas?
It was Lee Majors.
Lee Majors, right.
Fighting the American Indians as Vikings.
Vikings versus Indians is what it should have been called.
I do remember that.
It was good fun.
Lee Majors.
He's a Teutonic kind of guy.
Teutonic plague.
Two tons of fun.
One Teutonic and gin and juice.
Laid back.
Go, go, go America!
Yes, the positive things about America.
What have we done?
We ragged on the English.
Oh, no, what have we as America done?
We went to the moon, maybe.
No, I think we probably did that.
It ain't that far away.
I've been to the moon without the assistance.
Taylor.
The segue to the moon.
I've got a hell of a trampoline.
Yeah.

We control our whole damn continent.
What European country can say that?
We don't, though.
The Canadians.
Excuse me?
The Canadians.
What about them?
They're on our continent.
Yeah.
They control their part.
Don't they control their part?
I'm not so sure about that.
We allow Canada to exist.

Free medical care, too.
Yeah, well, universal medical care,
and possibly the decriminalization of cannabis.
Our forefathers grew pot.
You're going to be hearing something about that
from the fellas at the Fireside Theater.
Yay!
Our founding fathers, heroes, or hobbits.
So gets them on board, though,


so moves on.
Now to the big thapes.
ÔøΩ
What do you think?
Created in 1957 as the result of a unique collaboration between NBC and conservative think tank General Consensus Incorporated,
Caliper Coggins is truly a marvel of telegenetics.
The product of the most sophisticated television equipment of the day and of DNA once thought to be that of Marshall McLuhan,
but later believed to be that of a prospector in 1820s California,
Caliper Coggins has been retained as a consultant to some of the most powerful, powerful corporations in the world.
A former head of the FBI and two-time Emmy Award nominee, Caliper Coggins pans for gold and has a core temperature of 16 degrees Celsius.
And Caliper Coggins makes its own gravy and stops on a dime.
Caliper Coggins loves to stay outdoors.
Caliper Coggins cleans your toilet.
Caliper Coggins loves the way you touch him.
Caliper Coggins is a real champ.
You are vulnerable and afraid.
And Caliper Coggins knows it.
Caliper Coggins is remarkably versatile and trans-thematic.
Caliper Coggins is a great man for the job.

You know, I like them old boys.
But they do ramble on.
Seems they doff protest too much.
I'm starting to sound just like them.
But seems to me, what the world needs now is a refresher course in American history.
People got no grounding in the basics.
Especially this new generation.
Lazy cowpokes.
Why, I got more tolerance for the WB net.
And I'm starting to think this is a real piece of work.
Seems everyone's operating under the assumption that this Rome was a real piece of work.
Well, I'm here to tell you it wasn't.
Well, it was real pretty, but hell.
We all knew it was gonna crash sooner or later.
Now, I'll be the first to say we ain't got everything all hunky-dory over here.
Thursdays, for instance, just ain't been the same for me since that Michael J. Keaton left Spin City.
Now, he's one class act.
But back to my point.
Seems to me that this thing is a real piece of work.
And I'm not saying that it's not.
I'm just saying that the whole nation has some real self-esteem issues.
That acting proud like a big bully in the neighborhood, sitting on your chest, dangling a snot over your face.
We've been behaving like a little girl with an eating disorder.
And I tell you, it's a crying shame.
Confidence.
That's what we need dry and secure.
Why, that lack of confidence goes back to the beginnings of this country.
Why, did you know that old fella Thomas Jefferson said that democracy has a lifespan of only 200 years?
Why, did you know that old fella Thomas Jefferson said that democracy has a lifespan of only 200 years?
Why, did you know that old fella Thomas Jefferson said that democracy has a lifespan of only 200 years?
Now, ain't that some kind of self-defeatist attitude?
But looky here.
He give us that timeline of 200 years.
And well, some real red-blooded Americans, they take that time.
And with a whole lot of hard work and some well-choreographed events,
we cut that time darn near in half.
Hoo-hoo-wee!
I tell you, I'm saying America, hoo-wee!
America means business.
Multinational business.
So you ask yourself, what has Rome done for me lately?
And you come up kinda empty.
Now you ask yourself, what has Merica done for me lately?
Well, how about over 750 premium deluxe channels of entertainment?
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, including all major holidays, both religious and otherwise.
And that's the point, ain't it?
The Coliseum, them lines and fighting, it was a good start,
but those fellas in charge over there didn't see no need to refine their methods of diversion.
Maybe if they had, they'd still be running things.
Maybe they underestimated the power of a syndicated situation comedy.
Well, I appreciate you letting me go on. I get so worked up.
You know, some scurred some-inch-jumped-McClain whilst I was a contestant on that
Who Wants to Be a Million Dollars?
If I not catch that scallywag, I'm gonna see to it that his head saddles up real cozy like with his colon.
That there's the Caliper Coggins way.
My way or the high- whoop!
High way to heaven's on.
Now don't you go jumping, McClain, or I'll eat your face off.
If the New World, quote unquote, hadn't been a, uh, potentially profitable,
Yes, we wouldn't really be here now.
The Indians, who would have been the best,
Who had never been called that, would still be here, I assume.
Sure.
Still hunting buffalo and smoking tobacco.
Not contracting syphilis from whiting.
No smallpox, no syphilis.
Up with America.
Up yours, America.
There, I said it!
Well, finally, our true feelings come out.
Damn, fat, rich.
We produce the most waste per capita of any country in the world.
The right to be greedy, sir.
We consume the most natural resources of any country in the world.
Canada gets our acid rain.
Our president's an ex-drunk.
At best, he's an ex-drunk.
I've slept with his daughters.
Wow.
Pat, pat!
I can't wait.
Chelsea was such a nice girl.
The kind you'd want to stay up late reading with.
But the Bush girls are just nasty.
They're just filthy little wenches.
It's downright un-American.
I was America this morning.
Driving.
I'm driving.
I'm driving.
Just to drive.
No destination in mind.
Just spinning my wheels like I said.
I was America this morning.
I was America this morning.
I was America this morning.

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!


Yeah!
Another turn, truckless
Sloan up the highway like a movie
A driving movie
Or a circus side show
We all waited for our turn
The cops for Mexican
Bunnies laid out like battle casualties
A fireman on one knee
Put hands still
Put white bloody Mexican bags
I will fight
I will fight
I will fight
I will fight
I will fight
I will fight
I will fight
I rolled by eating my egg mcgluffin
And I didn't care
For those few moments I let Rome burn
I was American
I was American
This morning
I was American
This morning
I was American
This morning
I was American
This morning
I was American
This morning
I was American
This morning
He was amazing
He was amazing

I was American

The Man on the Television
I know that if I had just the right outfit and hairstyle, they could be me
Don't you know you can't be cool if you dress down like you have time
Cause everybody's got one
I think about smoking, that would make me an intellectual
That's what I've always wanted to be
I need to lift weights, that would make me more sexual
That would be so good for me
Being in America is wonderful, I think you would fake it
Own anything you want, I think you would take it
Look for today, don't think about tomorrow
Have a good time in America, Gamora
What are you looking at? You better not make me mad
I'll drive by your house and shoot your dog on moment
That I don't need you or the Bible or anything
You tell me what
What is the law?
With a good enough lawyer, I can do anything
You know, I'm America
Being in America is wonderful, I think you would fake it
Own anything you want, I think you would take it
Look for today, don't think about tomorrow
Have a good time in America, Gamora
Look for today, don't think about tomorrow
You better not make me mad
I want to be in America
Okay for me in America
Everything's free in America
For us, for free in America
I want to be in America
Okay for me in America
Everything's free in America
For us, for free in America
All right, so it's America the Beautiful, guys.
It's beautiful here.
We do have a hell of a country.
It's nicely paved.
Could be better.
Could be worse.
Could be a lot worse.
It's gonna get a lot worse.
Yeah, so attention to Echelon Listing Project over here.
If you'd like to shut us up, pay us off.
It might be cheaper than you think.
Although they could probably pay WREK less just to get us off the air.
That won't shut us up, though.
No, it wouldn't.
No, you're right.
We've got the internet.
God damn you.
That's right.
God damn you all.
What's the deal with all that testosterone?
It's not a test, and it's not, uh...
Osterone?
Yeah.
What if it was a pasta?
It'd be testosterone-y.
I believe you're right about that.
If testosterone was a pasta, it would be testosterone-y.
So happy Fourth of July.
Keep your fingers on your hand at all times.
I'm with the old dog and the young dog
Come on together for us to breathe
You can miss a day, you'll all get away
They'll be running fast and free
I sing the end of homesick, homesick, homesick
Say me it loud and loud
Bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me
And you'll never run
I know the old dog got a bad head
And the young dog got teeth
And you can best it
Well, I'll give you a chance
I'm with the old dog and the young dog
Come on together for us to breathe
I sing the bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me
And you'll never run
Bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me
And you'll never run
There's a message
Yeah
In this detain
There's a bone
To this heart
With the dogs up
I get up on it
And burn up in hell
And money's never wrong
I sing it
Bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me
Say me it loud and loud
Bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me
And you'll never run
And you'll never run
And you can best it
But you've gotta free me
Zero to one

Yeah man
You're my friend
Don't lie to me
Don't tray me
Ain't no such thing

Don't drag me to my stream
When my party's out
Aren't you gonna soup me?
You're gonna get kommen
Hey, how about those history classes in school?
Glad you got the full story, people.
Lies.
Jeez.
Lies.
Every last bit of it.
You know, I read Grimm's Fairy Tales.
It was about as accurate a history of Germany in those ages as our freaking history books are.
The best thing about being a winner is getting to write the history books.
You can just have all kinds of fun.
Your enemies turn into the world's enemies and the devils of history.
Ah, what fun that must be.

Close your curtains to avoid our game.
Please use your headphones with your earphones.
Don't you hear the sound of a gunshot?
And if you're listening in the air, I suggest you get out of the room.
And if you're listening in the internet, thanks.
If you're listening in Atlanta, thanks.
If you're listening in jail then I guess you already know what America's all about.
Yeah, our props go out tonight for our Fourth of July show for all you guys who have lost
your rights as citizens.
Who the hell do you think it was that carved this country out of Indian flesh?
It sure as hell wasn't the bankers.
It was crazy dudes with knives who get real drunk and make mistakes.
stakes. But when you're standing in the middle of a prairie, it doesn't matter. But when
you're standing in the middle of a bar in Atlanta, it matters.
So just remember who it was that colonized the state of Georgia, alright?
Criminals, criminals, criminals, yeah!
So with that, happy Independence Day. All hail the Chief.
And like they say in New Hampshire, live free or die.
You heard Dogs of Democracy by Debo the Star-Spangled Banner as performed by Carl Lewis.
I am afraid of Americans by David Bowie. American women and U.S.S.A. by the But Whole Surfers
Deconstruction performed their song America, Beautiful America by Fox.
I'm Iron Frenzy the Misfits with American Nightmare, our national anthem by Negative
Land, our founding fathers, pharaohs, or hopheads by the Firesign Theater, the lymph node institute,
Contributed America, the booty for the sexy, sexy, sexy, Calliper Coggins.
Be watch.
When the Americans get out of this box, we're gonna be the first to get out of this box.

When the Americans find as they will, who could blame them if they said the hell with
the rest of the world?
Let someone else buy the foreign bonds.
Let someone else build or repair foreign dance, or design foreign buildings that won't shake
apart in earthquakes.
When the railways of France, Germany, and India were breaking down through age, it was
the Americans who rebuilt them.
When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them
an old caboose.
Both are still broke.
I can name you five thousand times when the Americans raced to the help of other people
in trouble.
Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble?
I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.
Our neighbors have faced it alone.
And I'm one Canadian who's damned tired of hearing them kicked around.
They will come out of this thing with their flag high.
And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating
over their present troubles.
I hope Canada is not one of these, but there are many smug, self-righteous Canadians.
And finally, the American Red Cross was torn apart by the American Red Cross.

music done on the show or whatever I can usually answer that eventually.
Well, this hour of slack is washed up and flipping and flopping fitfully on the beach as the great
orb of the sun goes slowly down, burning out as all things must go to make way for new things.
Can't wait to see the new universe. See you on the saucers, friends. Praise God.
