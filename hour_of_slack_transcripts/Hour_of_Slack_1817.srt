1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Oh Bob, oh Bob, won't you spare me over to another show?

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,120
Get ready for the judgment day.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,520
What?

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,920
Sun is shining, come on get happy.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,500
Lord is waiting to take your hand.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,360
Shout hallelujah, come on get happy.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,860
Let's go to the promised land.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,560
Yes?

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,100
Yes?

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,340
Yes.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,720
What I heard of once in a lullaby.

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,540
We're back here on the air at WWW.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,700
Wonderful Parkinson's, West Wisconsin.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,740
Home of the Thunder Bears, the Eager Eaters, and Grandpa's Homemade Onion Aid.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,340
We'll be talking with people on what does Thanksgiving really mean to us here in 1942.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,780
The war raging all around us, our feet fried, and our hands distended like so.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,140
We're gonna wake up one of us.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,320
Oh my god, what's going on?

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,500
The first thing I remember.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, there's blood everywhere.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,660
That's the last thing I forgot.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,160
No, he's trying to, he can't make them shut up.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,880
Ready, here we go.

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,560
He can't make them shut up.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,220
Will you be?

26
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,000
He'll never make them shut up.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Somebody gag the cowboy.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,080
Alright, here we go.

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,080
Five, four, three, two, one.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,240
And now it's that time you've been waiting for, kids.

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:44,280
Your hero, my lonesome cowboy name just rode in on his automatic horse bucket.

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,480
Howdy, kids.

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,860
I had a terrible ride here tonight.

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,220
I was threatened and accosted by three young bullies, one of whom had a rancid, arid eye

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,900
that kept on staring downwards while he beat me for my boots.

36
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,540
After being stabbed and knifed several times about the head and buttock,

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,660
I began to scream and chased a 13RTA bus all the way down Chester Avenue.

38
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:12,740
Once I got to the dumpster next to Mary Lou's, I had visions of her in my head.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,540
Oh, Mary Lou.

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,800
I had visions of ski patrol and visions of French bunny girls wearing little parkas

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,740
and teeny, teeny, teeny, tiny critterments you couldn't even call clothing.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,900
Smart guy.

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,080
And he kept me.

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,900
He kept me going.

45
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,620
As the oil was slicking up around my feet and the fires were raging, making the air

46
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,900
on my ears burn down, all I could do was think of the song, Jesus.

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,740
So you, uh, you go to prostitutes, huh?

48
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,520
And he banged me over to the conclusion I shouldn't have made, should've called the police.

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,520


50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,960
He said it wasn't enough.

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,220
He said they would put me to bed somewhere else for 30 miles.

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,220


53
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,220


54
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,360
That time after that, I said, may liar when you try to quit here.

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,460
And on the other time, I heard the fight tears wake up on my forehead.

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,540
And I remembered that night I infants would never sleep for many hours like I do every day when

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:22,540


58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,820
What about back then?

59
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:23,840
I've been there so many times over.

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:23,840


61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:23,840


62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,620
So all this time I felt like shooting aucisholas at the feet of the cop.

63
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,920
But 10 years later, he got kicked by the police.

64
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,540
Oh, yes, dear friends, welcome to our slot number 1,818.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:08,420
That instrumental was by Captain Beefheart and the magic band called Flavor Bud Living from the album Doc at the Radar Station.

66
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,580
Indeed, all the music in this episode is from that artist and album, except the very last song.

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,840
Oh, and one singing commercial by the Firesign Theater.

68
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,620
And this background music by Empire Jazz Orchestra.

69
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,900
All the rest of the episode is taken from...

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:37,320
My 2001 collection of best clips from ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB in Cleveland.

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:45,180
The great show of the late Chaz Smith, on which Lonesome Cowboy Dave and I were honored to be regulars.

72
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,420
If regulars is the correct term, it's probably not.

73
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:58,700
Anyway, Dave will now give us a synopsis of the glamorous part of that movie, The Space Princess Flies Again.

74
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,260
Anyone familiar with the expious exploits of a woman's various space exploitations

75
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:13,280
is familiar with the science fiction scenario wherein an antidote is found for the candidate as a human being.

76
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,860
She's vilified by her own environment and soon finds fun in the attic.

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,080
Granddad has found his own fun in the attic.

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,940
A little tin box given to him by his grandfather.

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,760
And the gonorrhea has gone away.

80
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,720
Oh.

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,780
I'm sorry, sir.

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,000
That was the glamorous part.

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,180
And then there's the sordid part about the addicts in the attic.

84
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,600
Jeez, it's, you know, weird when you have to hide your sexuality as if it were some form of...

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:41,960
CSB.

86
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,140
Hello, Kelly, you're on the air.

87
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,460
Tim.

88
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,120
Tim calling from Norway.

89
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,380
Freaking Tim ought to be slapped.

90
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,660
Doc Frop and Sister Decadence may be calling.

91
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,680
They may be calling at any moment.

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,740
Threatened to do that.

93
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
They threatened to call?

94
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,480
Yeah.

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,080
They threatened to call.

96
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,120
Look, Captain, their buzzards are flying.

97
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,040
Over.

98
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,640
Over.

99
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,020
Your head, not over.

100
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,420
Head.

101
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,700
Just over your head.

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,240
Just overhead.

103
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,960
Doc Frop has apparently grown some newly mutated forms of...

104
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,760
We got him back.

105
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,600
...Zipulops, the sacred Tibetan herb.

106
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,880
But the Dalai Lama has never really sneaked a puff, has he?

107
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,800
Or was he like a...

108
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,420
The Dalai Lama's the one who showed Bob how to grow it.

109
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,460
Well, he showed him how to grow it, but he frowned on the actual...

110
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,560
He gave him the droppings that he started...

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,900
That Bob started his...

112
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,460
His frop.

113
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,460
His home frop.

114
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,480
This was the first...

115
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,160
The Dalai Lama back in the 50s, not the one now.

116
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,020
In a darkened room, with lava lamps burning like crazy.

117
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,340
The love magic...

118
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,540
Oh, it's a party.

119
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,120
A broken party, friends.

120
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,800
It's a destroyed party.

121
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,600
It's gonna destroy your mind.

122
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,380
Mama told you not to come, and yet you did.

123
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,640
You played with yourself, and you came to the party, and you did it.

124
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,460
You came, and you did it, and you took it.

125
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,140
You took it all the way.

126
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Took all of them.

127
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,720
Too much was always better than none.

128
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,000
That's what Bob said.

129
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,720
And so you went ahead and did it, and now you've got to face the consequences.

130
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,980
You're beautiful.

131
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,380
Have you ever heard of...

132
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,660
Wow.

133
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,520
Wow.

134
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:27,620
Wow.

135
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:27,940
Wow.

136
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,420
Wow.

137
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,440
We called them and talked to them.

138
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,600
And they called him a bewitching person.

139
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,900
And then Bob spoke the far- distribute world...

140
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,460
And then Bob was the sole outmodian.

141
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:42,460


142
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:42,460


143
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:42,840
We made a whole process of August Versus June.

144
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:42,840


145
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:42,840


146
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:42,840


147
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,400
I couldn't keep quiet.

148
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,340
Because I was there.

149
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,480
I wanted to delicate myself.

150
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,500
You could always be your281.

151
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:50,720
James.

152
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,480
You were beggining the wrongahn???

153
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
You were.

154
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,400
I couldn't be more Race.

155
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,800
Or a dream.

156
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,520
It's all in your mind.

157
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,940
There are both of those.

158
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,880
My mind is not my mind.

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,760
The cholesterol.

160
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,820
The triglycerides.

161
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,560
It's in your brain.

162
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,320
It's in your brain now.

163
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,580
My mind is my friend.

164
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,500
My mind is my friend.

165
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,240
My mind is my mind.

166
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,900
My mind is my mind.

167
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,280


168
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,840
But that's so fine for you.

169
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,900
Those patches.

170
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,900
What path of continent?

171
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
I don't mind.

172
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,620
With Hecboa Zond

173
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,460
leading off the

174
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,860
Magma Arm report.

175
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,460
Mind your own business.

176
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
What path of continent?

177
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,740
I used to pray to it at night

178
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,420
in rubber leg.

179
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,180
Don't mind me.

180
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,700
My rubber leg was getting a little bit soft

181
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,500
from the trip over the hills.

182
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,760
But that stuff

183
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,640
was fine for you.

184
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,780
Those arches.

185
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,640
You could get in there

186
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,120
and breathe.

187
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,040
You could live like a regular simian

188
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,100
and forget about the water line

189
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,080
and machines coming back.

190
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,460
You could start again.

191
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,880
Start a whole new life.

192
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,960
All these kids these days

193
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,720
they figure, oh I'm going to get high.

194
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,420
I'm going to get high

195
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,260
and go to one of them

196
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,120
spaced out trans-so concerts.

197
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,400
I'm going to get high.

198
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,460
I'll try some of that mace

199
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,740
mixed with DMT

200
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,040
mixed with marijuana

201
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,780
mixed with Everclear.

202
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,980
Man, if you want to be really cool

203
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,420
you'd sever the connection

204
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,840
between your right and left brains.

205
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,560
Now if you want to get

206
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,920
buzz on, dude

207
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,800
you won't be able to tell

208
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,260
the difference between your car

209
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,720
and your glasses.

210
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,180
Reagan achieved that state

211
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,740
without even trying.

212
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,300
And Bob

213
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,380
was born that way.

214
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,840
And now he's born that way.

215
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,620
This isomb besрей

216
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:46,620


217
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:46,620


218
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,080
Brad closes your joint?

219
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,080


220
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,340
It's over.

221
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,380
John's a correct planet.

222
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,960
Mum, stop bringin' up

223
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,400
that bitter topic.

224
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,460
Hurry up.

225
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,900
Was there a high school

226
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,800
one home poisoning

227
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,940
She puts her head into the fire

228
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,820
Makes her red heart perspire

229
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,280
She's a hothead, hothead, hothead

230
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,360
She was burned before she was born

231
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,000
Burning up a storm

232
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,340
She's a hothead, hothead, hothead

233
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,260
Lick out like a flame and burn you to a shame

234
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,280
By the burning flame

235
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,260
Swingshot burning big

236
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,320
She's a red hot pig

237
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,000
She's a hobo by a toaster

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,880
She's a hobo by a toaster

239
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,340
She's a circle on a spit

240
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,680
She's a hothead, hothead, hothead

241
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,480
She can stitch you to a wheel

242
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,460
Take you to a fire

243
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,560
And spin you round and round

244
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,520
Pour you, drink you down

245
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,360
Fire, fire, fire

246
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,740
She's a hothead, hothead, hothead

247
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:21,860
She's a hothead, hothead, hothead

248
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,560
Burn you up in bed

249
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
Just like she said

250
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,920
Cause she's a hothead, hothead, hothead

251
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,700
She can lick out like a flame

252
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,980
Burn you to a shame

253
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,320
She's a hothead, hothead, hothead, hothead

254
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,760
Yeah, and by the burning flame

255
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,840
She can drag you up in bed

256
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,760
Or curl you up in steam

257
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,180
Cause she's a hothead, hothead, hothead

258
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,020
She can burn and fight a show

259
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,900
She can strut about a goal

260
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,080
She can burn and fight a show

261
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,500
She can strut about a goal

262
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,080
She can burn and fight a show

263
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,780
She can be a hero

264
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,140
She's a hothead, hothead, hothead, hothead

265
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,260
She can burn and fight a show

266
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,000
Is this coming on the air, Chaz?

267
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,940
Is this a caller, please?

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,600
Hello, Tim, you're a techno beat.

269
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:38,880
Or non-rivers.

270
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,780
How come some of these, like, um...

271
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,420
I don't wanna use the word, um...

272
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,100
Hombosexuals

273
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,280
Actually emulate the robot personality now?

274
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,620
You would think that, you know...

275
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:50,900
Hombosexuals

276
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,860
Humbosexuals

277
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:57,740
robot pets. Here in Humboldt Sexual, we know how to grow your own green sexuality. But,

278
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:04,100
that's you. Step alongside these fabulously meticulously kept swimming pools. And the

279
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,300
sex organs is all the fun.

280
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,980
Oh, sticky.

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,940
Pour out some very turkey right now.

282
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,100
Oh my God, I'm so wet.

283
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,780
Oh my God.

284
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:20,080
Now, what we need to do is take a little bit these nose hairs down. And you know, we look

285
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,800
so cute.

286
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,220
The robot is servicing the frog plantation.

287
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,660
Who loves?

288
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,120
Mastress.

289
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,660
We just take it right off.

290
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:27,900
Wild.

291
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,620
The harvesting this year's crop of newly mutated.

292
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,080
Oh, you have a dance like a he-man.

293
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,460
Have a frog zip your laps, Mariphasia lupina.

294
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm gonna get that cock in my mouth.

295
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,260
Colloquially, a...

296
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,480
It's called frog.

297
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,320
Oh, I'm gonna suck my balls.

298
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,300
Well, we're not into colloquialisms, baby.

299
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:48,360
Well, the colloquials like to smoke it. Others, though, where I come from, you pack it up

300
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,120
your exit wound.

301
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,500
They pack it up?

302
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,140
That's the way a Texan does it. That's the way a North Texan does it in November to commemorate

303
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,440
the...

304
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,680
I remember when Bob was in Korea, he was shot 24 times in the abdominal muscle. And he didn't

305
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,620
desire quinine or any of that alpha-stic himself. And when the medics came by, he asked for

306
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,240
pure 100.

307
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,640
100 percent has you brought to the fifth officer's office.

308
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:18,840
JFK was into frogs. That was what Jackie was crawling over the back of the limo to get out

309
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,400
of the trunk.

310
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,640
Oh, his head blew up. He must have needed more of his frappy.

311
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,840
Here ye, here ye, the case of Bob Dobbs versus the case of Florida. Me bonkers.

312
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,580
A pretty new act on Hell Space here in the Cathedral of Pain.

313
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,360
Bailiff, could you please bring in the bleeding head of Arnold Fluxus E.N. Palmer?

314
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,080
He said something I heard about him.

315
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,660
Hey, are you guys giving out legal advice?

316
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,900
Yes, we are.

317
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,580
I'm calling in for legal advice.

318
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,420
You will? You got the right people.

319
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,760
Okay, if you wanted to like sell your body to a necrophiliac, but you were still alive,

320
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,480
you know, like just get the money in advance and like just promise to take care of it, you

321
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,920
know, and you know, like not, you know, mess it up or anything. And you know, would that

322
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,380
be legal?

323
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,340
Did you make a contractual agreement with the federal government?

324
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


325
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


326
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


327
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


328
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


329
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


330
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


331
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


332
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


333
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


334
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,340


335
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,480
I don't think so.

336
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,700
Okay, so you have a contractual obligation with this person stating that at the moment?

337
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,960
Well, I'm considering it, yeah.

338
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,900
Okay, and at the moment of your death in this contract, it is written that he will be able

339
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,640
to perform rude stunts in the buff with you?

340
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:22,840
Yeah, yeah.

341
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,760
Is this an exclusive contract? Would any, would, can others get in on it?

342
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,820
I don't know.

343
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,660
Is he, is he?

344
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,600
Well, you know, I'm just saying, would that be legal to sell your body to someone after,

345
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,120
after you were dead? Speaking of pro-choice issues and...

346
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,320
If somebody, for instance, and not just for the pure fun of necrophiliac.

347
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,320


348
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,520
Necrophiliac, which I'm sure most people out there enjoy from time to time.

349
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,940
Many religious people do, is sort of sell their body to the highest bidder for what

350
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,040
happens after death.

351
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,460
Well, that's why the Chinese had to invade Tibet. They were selling stiffs as love corpses

352
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,680
for their strange worship activities.

353
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
They used lip service as payment to the gods.

354
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,340
Lip service?

355
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,600
And to, and to, so that the gods then can use them after death. But that's to use their

356
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,500
souls, not their bodies, I guess.

357
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,420
Now, specifically...

358
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,640
So if God can do that, why not man?

359
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,500
We'll see.

360
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,420
In this world where man is as great as God.

361
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,100
Now think like a lawyer. Okay, calm down, calm down.

362
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,080
So man says...

363
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,580
Think like a lawyer for a second.

364
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:21,840
Oh.

365
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,800
This cadaver...

366
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,560
Lawyers are greater than God.

367
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,700
This corpse or cadaver, whichever we call it, is non exosquisis hocs pro quo, meaning it

368
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,420
is not a cadaver until some certain point in time at which her contractual obligation

369
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,320
begins. And his also.

370
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,660
Do you have TP for my buttonhole?

371
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,560
You know what?

372
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,120
I think this show...

373
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,400
She's talking about Bob. Bob called you. You didn't call her.

374
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:41,400


375
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:41,400


376
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,480
I didn't, he, young lady.

377
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,560
I think...

378
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,040
Bob's been making deals with you. Now, I know Bob's taste...

379
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,940
This show proves that humans, it would be a scary idea if humans actually did start

380
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,180
colonizing the universe.

381
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,680
Just think they would want to take this rag-tag bunch of malarkey everywhere they

382
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:57,960
went.

383
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,700
I can't imagine that.

384
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,380
Can you imagine a bunch of us out there?

385
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:01,660
Colonizing.

386
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,820
Can you imagine a bunch of dorks on Alpha Centauri with their own radio show barking

387
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,080
up the airwaves in some other planetary system making, you know, huge mom...

388
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,160
We were...

389
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,380
Sure. We are...

390
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,040
We'd be the horrible monsters from outer space that infect.

391
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:22,000
We would be the ecclesiastical mongrels of which your own church and many other churches have whispered silently in our ears since the beginning of colonization.

392
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:29,500
Since the very first days that the devices were implanted in your anus, my anus, all of ours.

393
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,740
Hey, speak for yourself.

394
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,820
I am.

395
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,840
I'm not talking through your mouth, and I will never do that again as long as I don't, you know, those Tibetan scripture things.

396
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,560
I'll never, ever try and speak through another body, living or dead, but my own.

397
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,380
I say get those inserted devices out of yourself one expellation at a time.

398
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,540
I say get it while you can.

399
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,420
Every fart takes another few molecules of that device out with it.

400
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,900
Stan says get the devices out with the church of the subdues as your assisterator.

401
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,340
Chaz says your assisterator will be those flatulent devices in your corpus collectum.

402
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,400
Not corp one.

403
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,600
Hi, neighbors.

404
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,880
I'm Edgar Allen Paul, manager of Bird of Prey Motors, where you can follow the feathers to under the sign of the black bird.

405
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,480
If you've been turned down before, never more, never more.

406
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:30,420
Yeah, that's right, Nick.

407
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,120
That's my bird, Nick, and I guess I know a bird when I see one.

408
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,320
Even if you've been killed in an auto accident and can't get your driver's license back from the police,

409
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,280
we'll help you.

410
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,460
You know, it usually takes a lawyer to help a doctor cure a policeman,

411
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,440
but if it's action you want, well, we're all actors here.

412
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,140
And here.

413
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,840
And here.

414
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,240
At all the Bird of Prey garages in Gotham and Metropolis.

415
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,340
And now in Duckburg, dockside at the corner of something Pumpkin Avenue.

416
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,240
Well, for precision auto salvage, body belts, and transmission problems, too,

417
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,260
y'all come on down to where the president stands under every car.

418
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,160
That's the Bird of Prey garages serving the Tri-City area since 10 o'clock.

419
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,000
Every morning.

420
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,960
When do we close?

421
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,920
Every morning.

422
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,560
Every morning.

423
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,860
I will stand upon my aid

424
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,460
Until this bird is dead

425
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,340
At the Bird of Prey, the Bird of Prey garage

426
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,240
Get a loop job with Nick Garelli.

427
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:29,600
Thank you, the Firesign Theater.

428
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,280
Before that, except for the Captain Beefheart song, Hot Head,

429
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,200
it's been ESO Swamp Radio.

430
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,300
From old WCN.

431
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,100
All the way up.

432
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,740
And it's going to continue to be ESO Swamp Radio almost all the way down.

433
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,480
In fact, let's go to the phones now and see what this caller has to say.

434
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,940
But listen, Dave, I wanted to tell you that, you know,

435
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,960
the last time I listened to this show, I was a 16-year-old runt.

436
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,240
Now you're a 52-year-old runt with bad eyesight.

437
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,900
But it's amazing when I listen to the tapes now, I actually understand them.

438
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,280
Anyway.

439
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm so sorry.

440
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,680
Yeah, man, but did you ever think that when you were really young,

441
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,140
you really understood it better than you ever would understand if you ever understood it before?

442
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,040
Yeah, I understand that.

443
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,600
I understand what you just said.

444
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,120
And just think that next year, you'll look back and you'll go,

445
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,460
man, I understand this more than I ever understood it before.

446
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,500
And then you'll look back on those years that you understood it before that and go,

447
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,380
but I really knew that.

448
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,000
And the year after that, my head will explode.

449
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,560
Well, that's why most of them quit doing it, you know.

450
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,440
Well, listen, boys.

451
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,260
They only listen while they don't understand.

452
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,240
Listen, guys.

453
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,260
Bob bless all of you.

454
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,920
And have a wondrous new year.

455
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,940
Listen, it's so amazing that I've been able to get back in contact with you.

456
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,620
I'm glad this year.

457
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,300
What is this, 52 years you're on the air now?

458
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,680
Yeah.

459
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,920
Well, this is actually the 55th year coming up.

460
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,020
This is the year we have to board the Discovery.

461
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,720
Wasn't it the Discovery in 2001?

462
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,400
Very, very thin air, as they call it.

463
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,820
Now, are you doing any more episodes?

464
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,160
Are we doing any more episodes?

465
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,860
We do an occasional dog food commercial.

466
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,580
Dave had an episode on the air.

467
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:13,660
We're doing a maternity, uh, maternity, uh, and so we, uh, you know, are lifted by lawsuits and other incidental things.

468
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,260
Dave's got a lot of maternity suits happening right now.

469
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,080
That's the best.

470
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,520
That we are in a decade of change.

471
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,800
We may be in a decade of convulsion and upheaval.

472
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:37,040
And therefore, the biggest thing you can do to prepare for the 90s is to build your own.

473
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:37,940
You can build your own ship.

474
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,880
Marvelous things can happen to you despite what's going on around you.

475
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,600
I would recommend very strongly that everyone read...

476
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,440
The Book of the Subgenius.

477
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,600
Disease and pestilence stalking the land.

478
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,120
Bob's promise rings true.

479
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:02,620
Ah!

480
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:03,940
Ah!

481
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,100
Clean.

482
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,560
Children.

483
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,120
That I am God.

484
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,400
Hm?

485
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,880
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next thirty minutes.

486
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,840
God.

487
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:32,400
Here's a little poem by a contributor named Reverend Onan Kenobot.

488
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,080
Oh, that sounds like a piece of old man porn.

489
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,040
Everything happens for a reason.

490
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,160
We hurt our backs and pay our tax.

491
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,880
We take up jobs to fill the gobs of alien gods who eat pain beyond reasoning

492
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,040
and use human irony as a kind of seasoning.

493
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,160
They're the reason we lack even a moment of slack.

494
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,280
Because everything happens for a reason.

495
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,420
Everything happens for a reason.

496
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,320
A sea of pink will make one think that normalcy's not misery.

497
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,700
And getting along with the teeming masses by being bullies and kissing asses

498
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,320
is how things are run and gosh, even fun.

499
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,900
Because everything happens for a reason.

500
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,060
Everything happens for a reason.

501
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,260
True stories told of minds controlled.

502
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
True power spied imperiled.

503
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:32,980
True power amidst eye.

504
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,140
A UFO fuels our misery to grease the gears of the conspiracy.

505
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,640
Their lasers avoid.

506
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,240
Be paranoid.

507
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,300
Because everything happens for a reason.

508
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,600
Everything happens for a reason.

509
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,600
A salesman spoke.

510
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,400
Our hearts awoke.

511
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,140
Our church was founded.

512
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,940
Our hopes well grounded.

513
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,900
The church of the subgenius scoffs at rebuke.

514
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,160
Offering no reasons but.

515
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,120
An excuse.

516
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,420
And lays the blame.

517
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,940
And the damned false claim.

518
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,880
That everything happens for a reason.

519
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
I thank you, Reverend Onan Kanobai.

520
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,300
God darn it, man.

521
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,320
And the Empire Jazz Orchestra.

522
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,820
So, okay.

523
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,300
I'm happy to be here.

524
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,300


525
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,300


526
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,260
I'm afraid of my brain.

527
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,320
So that's your secret, man.

528
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,480
I always wondered why you attracted so many chicks.

529
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,540
He turns his brain inside out.

530
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Waggles his brain at the girls and they come running.

531
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,180
Your eyes are so red.

532
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,120
The Dave brain.

533
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,800
Oh, it's so convoluted.

534
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,720
Like your speech.

535
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,340
Oh, Dave.

536
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,500
That's right.

537
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,900
Dave, we need to just take a few more of the notes here.

538
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,140
Dave, you're so Bob.

539
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,440
I thought Bob was just kind of Dave.

540
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,800
It's like a saloon in the Dave brain.

541
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,940
It's like an old Western saloon in there.

542
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
It's always 2001.

543
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,620
Only 2001.

544
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,500
Right.

545
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,680
But it's 1888 and, you know, like...

546
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,920
It's 1888 and 2001.

547
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,060
At the same time.

548
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,840
And the year 2328.

549
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,460
There's them like lily, you know, type prostitute dancer girls around and cowboys.

550
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,260
The year 5449 is in there.

551
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,640
Well, of course.

552
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,100
The saloon at the end of time.

553
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,000
The saloon at the time intersection.

554
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,140
Where Dave meets every archetype of Dave.

555
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,520
From throughout history.

556
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,040
The transvestite hooker with a heart of gold.

557
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,480
Dave Visa.

558
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,020
Or Dave Vess.

559
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,840
The crooked mayor, Dave.

560
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,800
The rich.

561
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,820
Rich developer, Dave.

562
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,980
All in the saloon at the end of the universe.

563
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,580
The starship captain.

564
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,060
Handsome Dave.

565
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,060
The saddled crippled lawyer in a wheelchair.

566
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:02,260
Dave.

567
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,060
In the saloon of life.

568
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,920
What do you have, partner?

569
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,960
What do you have?

570
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,720
You there.

571
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,420
Partner with the one eye pointed down.

572
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,960
The other one pointed sideways.

573
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
What do you have?

574
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,160
I'll have a time.

575
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,540
I'll have a time intersection.

576
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,180
I mean a sarsaparilla, sir.

577
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,080
And we don't serve no sarsaparilla, no St. Louis sissies around here.

578
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,440
You drink a man's drink or you walk out there in the street and get shot down by him.

579
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:43,160
And at the moment that they, the inhabitants of the cosmic saloon,

580
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,100
did not even notice the passage of the time intersection.

581
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,000
But everything had changed.

582
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,440
And when they...

583
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,160
They walked outside.

584
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,540
The circus of Dr. Lowe was just arriving.

585
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,720
Now off ants and tankers.

586
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,560
Lions and...

587
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

588
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,500
I think clowns.

589
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,480
And Sheriff Grumley.

590
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,880
He was...

591
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,120
The yeti jumped...

592
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,000
The sideshow yeti broke free from its chains, ran into the crowd,

593
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,880
and carried off the spinster repressed Fridges librarian.

594
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,000
He and Pan, having a three-way with her, turned her on.

595
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,440
I'm sorry.

596
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,440


597
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,020
Then the stupid, ignorant, racist rednecks,

598
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:29,580
while getting the local town surviving Indians to dance,

599
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,580
accidentally knocked over the fishbowl containing the infant Loch Ness Monster,

600
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,720
which grew to gigantic size,

601
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,940
chased the man into a giant flaming cathedral,

602
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,560
where they threw spears at it until...

603
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,560
They traded it to James Franciscus, and it died.

604
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,740
And so we learn...

605
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,860
that nature, in its infinite wisdom,

606
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,180
mocks man with his puny pride.

607
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,360
Nature, which holds us in its tender grip,

608
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,800
its mercy is its gentle cradle

609
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,200
until we've approached the moment of wisdom.

610
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,000
And which time it turns its hand down

611
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,120
and its cold icy stare out of it.

612
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,640
And so we know that Godzilla will be back again

613
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,800
to teach man a lesson.

614
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,380
Only this time, he will come to man

615
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,720
in the form of a friendly little puppy

616
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,340
named Joy Boy.

617
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,640
We have already seen these things.

618
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,520
Dr. Panaram and Dr. Patel and I

619
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,460
have spent hours and hours in mystic dreaming

620
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,240
and this is our prediction

621
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,240
that not only will the white buffalo return

622
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,060
but the cute little puppy will be the messiah of mankind.

623
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,860
Oh man.

624
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,280
Yes.

625
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,840
It's a lousy prediction.

626
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,420
He got his hands.

627
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,140
The hands are in the air.

628
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,480
I was hoping you were bleeding.

629
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
I looked at all the other contestants

630
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,220
and noticed there wasn't a drop of blood on any of them.

631
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,820
How did you get so stiff and straight like that?

632
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,360
Oh my, what an unusual haircut.

633
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,720
You just sit down right here and cross both of your legs.

634
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,000
I mean all three.

635
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,720
We know how you work the room.

636
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,160
And you can just cross your eyes now

637
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,620
and fold your hands

638
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,880
and just listen to this message.

639
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,840
That's right, you won't remember anything.

640
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,040
Time is being distended.

641
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,200
You're going through a temporal shift right now.

642
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,740
You're going through a temporal shift right now.

643
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,580
Mom, I'm back.

644
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,280
Mom?

645
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,160
Mom?

646
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,960
Oh yes, friend.

647
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,780
What the hell are you doing down in the basement?

648
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,880
Jesus God, Mom.

649
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,020
What the hell are you doing?

650
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,540
That's a shame, isn't it all?

651
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,020
Give me the bald-headed Elvis from Michigan, I guess.

652
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,760
Call me.

653
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,300
Call me.

654
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,840
Call me.

655
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:12,900
Call me.

656
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,420
Call me.

657
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,340
Call me.

658
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,400
Call me.

659
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,400


660
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:16,640


661
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:16,640


662
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,080


663
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,240
Call me.

664
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,320
Call me.

665
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,640
Call me.

666
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,160
Call me.

667
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,040
Call me.

668
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,040


669
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,040


670
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,100
The pond shines dry like a lady's compact.

671
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,300
Lilies leap like flat green hearts with white hearts

672
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,060
squirting yellow pollen cocks.

673
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,720
Ferns rant like cool spades fossils away from rocks.

674
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,920
Bees echoed dark carbon hums that dashed in nothing.

675
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,740
Gnats fuck my ears and nostrils.

676
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,620
Hit my.

677
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,420
Brain like homes, in numb to nothing.

678
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,940
Wings stuck on liquid bones.

679
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,120
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on my knee.

680
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,080
The moon poured hollow down my milky leg.

681
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,580
Splashed still and moved.

682
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,700
The wind peed down the willows and pricked the needle fine.

683
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,600
The monkey moved a fur shadow.

684
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,680
Its soot tail curled in twos.

685
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,240
Its lips smiled needles.

686
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,060
Its eyes rolled loose.

687
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,500
Her throat broke open.

688
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,440
Glistened in the dew.

689
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,500
Red berries dangled like a dream of rubies too.

690
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,920
Snot muscles ran down her ivory chin and tooth within.

691
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,040
A lock and a pin held fast to then.

692
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,400
My love, my pocket deep within.

693
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,880
Incenses dangled a chain that clasped me to her then.

694
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,760
The messenger spoke the wind that blows between our time.

695
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,280
I sensed you then in whispers spin and flow in silver dust around the pointed pin.

696
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,980
Sent to nothing.

697
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,640
God please fuck my mind for good.

698
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,500
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on my knee.

699
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,240
Oh fuck that thing.

700
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,760
Fuck that poem.

701
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,900
Eyes crawl out with magics.

702
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,940
White cloth bones pile up like thrown blades.

703
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,600
Rags in skull scoop soil cracks drain screams.

704
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,820
Please take my hand and join me.

705
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,680
Too soon its clutches gleams.

706
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,760
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on my knee.

707
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,100
Death be damned wife.

725
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,860
The Savage Revenge of Helen Keller in retro vision.

726
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,740
What?

727
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,820
The Savage Revenge of Helen Keller in retro vision?

728
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,580
That is a real actual tract written by Dr. Mars, I believe.

729
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,800
It's a visionary piece.

730
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,680
It also involves performance, and it is quite visionary,

731
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,060
except for the fact that they duct tape your eyes shut.

732
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,900
And you're supposed to experience through your nasal cortex most of the experiences.

733
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,000
You express that so well.

734
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,600
The long knitting needles, believe me, are...

735
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,140
Express yourself.

736
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,200
Express yourself.

737
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,060
It's a kind of a clean feeling you get, you know, like you've all been...

738
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,160
Clean yourself.

739
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,140
Clean.

740
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,740
Fresh.

741
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,720
Clean.

742
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,340
Clean it out.

743
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,120
Wipe yourself.

744
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,140
Find refreshment where you live.

745
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,060
Ream yourself.

746
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,800
You peppermint douche.

747
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,000
Begin in a clean body.

748
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,220
A breath.

749
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:39,960
Refresh.

750
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,460
Clean body.

751
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,620
Lighten up.

752
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,860
Manhole.

753
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,500
Yourself.

754
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,740
Grab a rock.

755
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,300
Salish yourself.

756
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,800
I'll sit for you.

757
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,600
Move with...

758
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:49,920
What's he doing?

759
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,040
A hot lid?

760
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,180
Stallion.

761
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,840
Water.

762
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,300
Bowie knife.

763
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,240
That's pretty.

764
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,460
Brass cannonball.

765
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,460
Then a brick...

766
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,760
Shit house.

767
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,540
Ah, there he is.

768
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,540
And you just put this right on his head.

769
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,340
Oh, my God.

770
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,880
I've never seen anything like that before.

771
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,960
He's got a head condom.

772
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,480
It's really...

773
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,380
Dave has just put a condom over his complete head.

774
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,420
He's ready to dive right in.

775
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,620
I can't breathe, though.

776
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,180
It's doing...

777
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,720
Oh, my God.

778
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,940
That's obscene.

779
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,940
It's lubricated and I'm drowning.

780
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,160
He's getting into it now.

781
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,120
Ladies and gentlemen, you should see what's going on in the studio.

782
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,020
It's lubricated, man.

783
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,060
You gotta help me get this off.

784
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,160
I can't breathe.

785
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,460
It's...

786
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,040
I've never seen performance art quite like that.

787
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,980
Eat your heart out.

788
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,040


789
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,040


790
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,040


791
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,040


792
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,040


793
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,980
It spells out how it's stirring.

794
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,680
Ow!

795
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,560
All right, but I need something to play.

796
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,820
Yaw, yaw, yaw.

797
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,880
Lords of Acid is just about nothing but that kind of...

798
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,300
Yeah, right.

799
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,100
...Richard and kitty cat.

800
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,500
Well, how about a pronunzamento of earth-squacking impertinent?

801
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:07,560
Somebody told me that people have group sex at Lords of Acid concerts, and I said, I've

802
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,020
been to a five-exam...

803
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,020


804
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:19,000
days and a thrill kill concert i've seen them all just about but and this young lady that was

805
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,020
explaining this to me said well i had my first three-way at a lords of acid concert well everybody

806
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:31,060

807
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:39,020

808
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:45,520
a prairie squid a man on one end a woman on the other and a squid in the middle you better believe

809
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:52,140
it baby and sometimes you can get another guy or girl in there depending on how if it's a large

810
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:58,400
enough and willing enough depending on how big the ink sack is on the squid that's right you can

811
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,760
always use the ink sack if once it's been de-inked can you put them together like a little pioneer

812
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,740
toy when you were 75 years old we've got those de-inking suction cup pad

813
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,000
bags

814
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,540
,

815
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,660
machines for at subgenius foundation huh don't i mean just if you had three squid not three

816
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,640
squids i'm of course an erudite person three squid could you just snap them together like

817
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,640
blocks and they would serve the same purpose of perhaps a hundred uh just clear armies the south

818
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,260
american army squid oh they will do that they will actually form bridges of their own bodies across

819
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:38,640
rivers so that their horny squid mates can get across you know at the cost of thousands of lives

820
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,540
thousands of more will live

821
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,020
Consider the reason for the psychic experiments look here

822
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:50,100
The arm Squit are not only growing in size through conjugating and multiplying but they have one mind

823
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:51,700
one hurt

824
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,080
one mind much like you Dr.

825
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,320
finding the words

826
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,140
if you cut off the head it just grows in other words

827
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,420
one mind

828
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,680
if you pull a beak another beak appears

829
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,500
i'm short

830
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,020
Now another thing laughs at you and cries at you.

831
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,900
If you pull out its fangs, it grows twice as many.

832
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,260
If you pull its ears, it wants you to rub its belly.

833
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,140
If you give it milk, it will suck your blood.

834
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,480
All these things and more can be yours.

835
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,700
At Squid Town, Prairie Town, USA.

836
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,560
My, miles and miles of furrowed dirt.

837
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,720
And squid flipping and undulating in each and every patch.

838
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,720
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.

839
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,280
At Rose Pond Rose, I never believed there could be such a squid farm.

840
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,760
Squids, as far as I can see.

841
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,600
They're slopping and slutting. I think they're ready to be picked.

842
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,160
I got my viagra.

843
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,360
I'm all greased up and ready to go.

844
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:02,540
Look.

845
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,720
Look, I got a lot of them fake beauty marks on my...

846
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,440
Sorry, it's a melanoma.

847
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,460
But look, I got a terrible...

848
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,720
Tight, tight, tight pants.

849
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,220
I got a tight squid here.

850
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:14,900
Yeah.

851
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,580
I'm retired.

852
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,440
A little bit of that sorrel sausage sorcery there, eh?

853
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:20,980
That's right.

854
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:28,380
I like to get down in them furrows and just plow.

855
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,220
You know what I mean?

856
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,460
Just plow my way.

857
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,500
Use one...

858
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,200
And squid as a condom for use of another squid.

859
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,200
Yep.

860
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,300
And then a bigger...

861
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,840
And then use a bigger one atop them.

862
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,400
We were the ones who invented them things back in the dome.

863
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,660
You know, back in the dome.

864
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,620
Squid with them...

865
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,700
Back under them.

866
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,960
You could take one of them and you would shave your eyebrow for you.

867
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,520
You wouldn't have to even sit in a chair.

868
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,800
You could just sit there and lecture it about anything that came to your mind.

869
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,800
I tried to get a patent on those things, but it turns out you can't patent a formula.

870
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:01,840
That's right.

871
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,280
Yeah.

872
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,860
That didn't matter back in the day.

873
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,880
And that's all you really need to create that.

874
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,000
We just sit there whittling and having the squid.

875
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,400
Whittling and having.

876
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,940
Mammy didn't know nothing.

877
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,920
We did all kinds of songs.

878
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,420
Knowing and having.

879
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,080
Happy was none the wiser.

880
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,320
Remember the squid songs we used to make up when we had nothing else to do but just try

881
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,540
to recharge our depleted accordion?

882
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,900
Knowing the squids.

883
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,440
Yep.

884
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,200
Didn't know them real personal.

885
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,860
Loving the squid.

886
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,060
Having the squids.

887
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,220
Plowing the squids.

888
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:32,640
Squid.

889
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,300
Squidding around on the squid.

890
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,000
Squid cake.

891
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,640
I like to just take it in my hand.

892
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,320
Squid soup.

893
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,340
Squid sandwiches.

894
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,800
Look at it for maybe half an hour.

895
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,080
Squid bed.

896
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,440
Squid.

897
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,380
Squid flag.

898
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,800
Squid pudding.

899
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,500
Squid bait furniture.

900
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,720
Squid primavera.

901
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,560
There's nothing like squid pudding, though.

902
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,980
All that stuff.

903
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:53,460
Squid.

904
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,740
Everybody's grandmother made squid pudding out of their own orifices.

905
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,020
And squid strudel is good, too.

906
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,480
When you had it dry.

907
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:01,880
Dry.

908
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:02,480
Old granny.

909
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,000
Not like the rest of us.

910
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,920
Oh, no.

911
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,540
We used to dry out the grannies.

912
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,800
I remember that.

913
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,020
We'd take the grannies and we'd string them up.

914
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:10,800
Smoke them.

915
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,660
Smoke them.

916
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,260
And for a long time.

917
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,420
Get cured.

918
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,780
Two, three, four weeks.

919
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,420
We would be cured, but we would never get high off of it.

920
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:17,920
Jerked granny.

921
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,480
Nope.

922
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,020
Wasn't right.

923
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,140
Besides, grandpa didn't like that.

924
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,860
No, he wanted all of it.

925
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,760
He wanted to disrespect your elders.

926
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,340
He wanted to do his own jerking.

927
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,340
He walked 50 miles a day to go to a squid.

928
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,100
And he, grandma, she walked.

929
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,360
Look.

930
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:31,680
Look.

931
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:31,800
Look.

932
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:31,880
Look.

933
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,000
Look.

934
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,080
Look.

935
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,160
Look.

936
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,180
Look.

937
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:32,200
Look.

938
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,100
She walked about 25 miles a day.

939
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,600
And they just keep telling the same story.

940
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,940
Everybody knows you took the squid, bud.

941
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,340
You didn't do it in the old days.

942
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,400
That prairie squid homeowners.

943
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,540
I remember that old song.

944
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,840
I got...

945
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:56,560
You know, how the hell did you ever survive the last seven years without your...

946
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,200
What happens is if you've been around for a long time, you start to get...

947
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,800
enough squid, well, they get into you.

948
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,220
They just start reproducing and hollering and carrying on.

949
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,920
Before you know it, you're just a vessel for squid intelligence.

950
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,620
And then you got to send them to college.

951
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,540
Exactly.

952
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,620
Start all over again.

953
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,500
You got to get done with the little peckers.

954
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,340
Keep you young.

955
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,560
Keep you young and quick.

956
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,100
My feet have gone to sleep while we're talking about this.

957
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,820
I think my hemorrhoids come back.

958
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,180
No.

959
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:31,560
No.

960
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,440
If we could maybe change the subject a little bit.

961
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:34,960
No.

962
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,660
All right.

963
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:39,560
I know that's the only thing you ever want to really talk about in depth.

964
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,300
But for crying out loud, we've been talking about it for six weeks now.

965
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,080
I know.

966
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,400
Isn't a boy named Sue like that?

967
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,800
He cannot leave the back of the EMS vehicle,

968
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,580
singing to the various crippled victims of the gerbling problems.

969
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,280
I guess we want to call them problems.

970
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:07,620
Somebody was clearly at fault and didn't want to take credit.

971
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,040
If you don't feed the gerbil, what do you think is going to happen?

972
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,980
Soon, the gerbil becomes very hungry.

973
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,680
As his belly becomes hollow and his skin becomes slick,

974
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,880
as the hair falls out and his eyes grow weak, he will bite at anything.

975
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:31,160
At the last minute, I will substitute the starving gerbil for the healthy one.

976
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,860
The master won't suspect until it's too late.

977
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,020
He humiliates himself.

978
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,820
Hi, friends.

979
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,020
I'm Heinrich Himmler.

980
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,560
And boy, when it gets hard to understand, it really gets hard.

981
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,480
And when it gets big, it gets really big.

982
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,720
We like to make it big and hard for you to understand.

983
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,220
So zip up your zip suit and check it out, kids.

984
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,300
Is that why my tongue got this way?

985
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,680
It's all big and hard.

986
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,880
I can't have the truck.

987
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,680
It's my tongue.

988
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,600
You thought it was light?

989
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,960
And you thought that it was something mutant and ugly.

990
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,000
But really, in the subgenius church, that hanging, lollygaggy tongue

991
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,680
and that twisted face is the sexiest thing you've ever seen.

992
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,000
That's what the subgenius women call beautiful.

993
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,600
And wait till you see what the men go for.

994
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,320
Oh, my God.

995
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,780
Oh, my God.

996
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,320
Can you imagine?

997
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,000
Have you ever seen a woman with that many lips?

998
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,860
He's coming over here.

999
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,200
No, he's just coming over here.

1000
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,860
Have you ever seen women with that many lips there?

1001
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,840
And look, each one of them has its own separate personality.

1002
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,720
I can't imagine.

1003
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,900
That's what you want, guys.

1004
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:37,940
Believe you me.

1005
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:44,440
Once you've gone there, you'll never go the other place.

1006
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,060
Anytime ever again.

1007
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,400
I'm speaking to you professionally as a sex professional now.

1008
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:58,200
Now, professionally speaking, Stang, what is the best sex position for a subgenius to take?

1009
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,420
Under Bob.

1010
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:00,860
Under Bob.

1011
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,820
Under Bob.

1012
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,360
All is under Bob.

1013
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,460
I thought you were going to say that.

1014
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,260
Bob is always on top.

1015
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:05,820
Yeah.

1016
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,520
He is a visionary.

1017
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:13,520
And if one has earned a reach around from that great super salesman,

1018
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,980
that living avatar of slack,

1019
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,600
then one should leave a special tip for him.

1020
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,560
And it's important to leave that tip in the right jar, isn't it, Reverend?

1021
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,420
Yes, that's right.

1022
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:29,820
And use a nice clean knife when you separate the tip from all the rest.

1023
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,480
Yes.

1024
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:30,860
Yes.

1025
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1026
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1027
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1028
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1029
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1030
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1031
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1032
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1033
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1034
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1035
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1036
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1037
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1038
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1039
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1040
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1041
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1042
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1043
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1044
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:30,860


1045
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,480
Clean, clean, clean and sterilized knife.

1046
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,860
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1047
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,000
Extra sterilized, pure, sharp.

1048
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:49,920
I needed to bust in here and mention that the voices on that especially sexy mess of squiddy stuff

1049
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,400
from ESO radio were Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

1050
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,460
also known as William Cates, the Hollywood actor.

1051
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,520
And Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs,

1052
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,640
who I had just married shortly before that show was recorded, I think.

1053
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,960
But now back to Bob.

1054
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:16,980
Bob?

1055
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,300
I think of Bob as a protean sex gland.

1056
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,580
Often when I think of myself ensconced in a little home,

1057
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,200
a little domicile on the pipe on the ring of Saturn's moon,

1058
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,180
I can see that.

1059
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:29,920
Saturn's moon.

1060
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,860
Little fish.

1061
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,880
Flocks of pastures of green sheep floating by.

1062
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,220
And what do they call those?

1063
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,940
Hillocks, like a little cottage with smoke curling out of it.

1064
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,660
And each one resembles a pipe.

1065
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,320
And I can see myself there with my own little Connie.

1066
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,780
Connie of my own design, perhaps.

1067
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,360
Hairy footed, perhaps with a face much bigger than the rest of her body.

1068
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,400
But still.

1069
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,520
I like that kind, too.

1070
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,220
I thought you did.

1071
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,140
And that's why I brought her up.

1072
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,100
She's been calling you again, Stang.

1073
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,740
That big head girl?

1074
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,380
The big head girl.

1075
00:48:59,380 --> 00:48:59,800
From space?

1076
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,240
She's been calling you, Stanley.

1077
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:01,700
Ah.

1078
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:04,620
Hello?

1079
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,760
I think I hear her.

1080
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,020
I think all I ever get is your machine.

1081
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,680
I know you've been thinking of me.

1082
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:16,300
I went back to the carnival again and went on the ferris wheel and rode the merry-go-round.

1083
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,960
And all I could do was think of you.

1084
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,100
Of course, it was very hard to fit my head in.

1085
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,100
The merry-go-round was very low ceiling.

1086
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
But still, I was alone.

1087
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:29,780
And I was alone.

1088
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,280
And I thought of you.

1089
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,400
I ate a half a loaf of bread.

1090
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,580
And then I played with myself and cried again.

1091
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,220
Then I went on the ferris wheel.

1092
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,880
I had to be restrained because my head was disturbing the other passengers.

1093
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,520
And I thought of you again.

1094
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,480
I went down to the boardwalk and looked at the sea.

1095
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,760
And all I could see was you, Revlon.

1096
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,400
Why you don't call me back sometime?

1097
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,420
Well, it's bleeding.

1098
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:04,920
I'm a huge little ice cream woman from space calling you back again.

1099
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,760
Hoping sometime you'll return my call.

1100
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,340
Bye.

1101
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,860
Until the evening gets late and I'm alone with you.

1102
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,160
It's so strange.

1103
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,020
You know, they...

1104
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,520
All those groupies.

1105
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,380
Yeah, I remember.

1106
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,580
All they needed to do was to just send their $30 to Bob.

1107
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:31,240
And I know that's all they're trying to do is get close to Bob.

1108
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,140
They think I know Bob's phone number.

1109
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,120
And I do.

1110
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:34,560
You do.

1111
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,880
But they think I can give it to them.

1112
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,680
And I can't.

1113
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,840
I just can't.

1114
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,180
And instead of giving you the $30, what do they do?

1115
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,060
They come up to you and in time, they say something stupid.

1116
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,620
They play with your hairy feet.

1117
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,980
They talk backwards to you and try and trick you.

1118
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:50,880
Time is right.

1119
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:51,860
Listen to the words.

1120
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,840
Time, yes.

1121
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,680
How many times has this happened at Divisible?

1122
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,320
Every time.

1123
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,960
Every damn one.

1124
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,820
I remember the last time I was playing with Einstein's Secret Orchestra at the Divisible

1125
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,640
for the Reverend Ivan Zang of the Church of the Subgenius.

1126
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,640
We just finished a song and a rush of about 11 women.

1127
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,280
No, it's always 15-year-old guys with glasses.

1128
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,240
Stangly clothes.

1129
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,000
If only it was women.

1130
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,700
Yeah, if only it was women who didn't look like kind of fat guys in those weird, you know,

1131
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,600
Pendleston shirts with like...

1132
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,300
With a Bob shirt.

1133
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,300
With real thick glasses.

1134
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,600
With real thin slashes.

1135
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,580
That's too tight.

1136
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,080
Guys that kind of look like us, you know, and they're only...

1137
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,780
I thought that was really good.

1138
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,080
You know, the only part I enjoyed was saying, you know, they were all smart and everything.

1139
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,840
Yeah, but you know what?

1140
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,260
You missed this one note.

1141
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,720
I saw where you missed this note.

1142
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,560
Yeah, it was smart and shit.

1143
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,840
And there's a link on your website.

1144
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,420
It's dead.

1145
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,900
I wanted to make sure you knew about that.

1146
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,160
You know what's wrong with those CDs?

1147
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,840
That's where they go skipping.

1148
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,080
No, man.

1149
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:44,920
We don't want that.

1150
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:45,440
That's a coding problem.

1151
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:45,760
We don't want that.

1152
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,500
That's a coding problem.

1153
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,360
Hi.

1154
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,220
How have you been?

1155
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,100
I'm watching you tonight.

1156
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:51,960
Are you all right?

1157
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,920
Are you hungry?

1158
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,860
Can I get you anything?

1159
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,280
A cup of coffee, perhaps?

1160
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,380
A sandwich?

1161
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:56,920
A ham?

1162
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,880
I'd like some Guinness and some crackers.

1163
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,180
A bee job?

1164
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,140
Maybe some...

1165
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:01,840
Knotted nylons?

1166
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,360
Oh, yes, bees.

1167
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:02,880
Yes.

1168
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,100
I can bring you peas.

1169
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,320
Would you like some peas, honey?

1170
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,460
I can make honey for you.

1171
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,200
Oh.

1172
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,820
Oh.

1173
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,160
Oh.

1174
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,380
No, they don't talk that way.

1175
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,880
The hot Yoo-hoo bottle?

1176
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,660
No, they don't wear Hulu skirts.

1177
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,260
They don't talk funny language-ish for our pleasure.

1178
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,380
No, they just say, price Bob.

1179
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,160
None of them have hair on their faces.

1180
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,900
I found my copy of Price Bob.

1181
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:22,900


1182
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:22,900


1183
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:22,900


1184
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,260
I found my copy of The Book of the Subgenius for a dollar at the cutout bin.

1185
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,880
Would you sign it?

1186
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,860
Some of them do have the little lines, the dotted lines for the cranial implants and

1187
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,940
the place where they took off the top of their head.

1188
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,840
I like that.

1189
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,340
All right.

1190
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,680
Let's have a little break here.

1191
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,800
Thank you, ESO.

1192
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,140
But here's some wit and wisdom.

1193
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,320
I pulled these from The Week news magazine.

1194
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:52,400
A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between,

1195
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,720
does what he wants to do.

1196
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,080
Bob Dylan said that.

1197
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,940
Never hate your enemies.

1198
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,640
It affects your judgment.

1199
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:09,160
The fictional Godfather character Michael Corleone said that.

1200
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,540
I like work.

1201
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,140
It fascinates me.

1202
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:22,200
I can sit and look at it for hours, said author Jerome K. Jerome.

1203
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,420
If that really is his name.

1204
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:31,880
Adam invented love at first sight, one of the greatest labor-saving machines the world

1205
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,460
ever saw, said humorist Josh Billings.

1206
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:47,200
To die is poignantly bitter, but the idea of having to die without having lived is unbearable,

1207
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,060
said Eric Fromm.

1208
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,900
And now this.

1209
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,900
Oh, death.

1210
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,580
Oh, death.

1211
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,380
Won't you spare me over till another year?

1212
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:20,620
Well, what is this that I can't see with ice cold hands taking hold of me?

1213
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:22,880
Death.

1214
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:22,880


1215
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:22,880


1216
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:22,880


1217
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:22,880


1218
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,480
Well, I am death.

1219
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,880
None can excel.

1220
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,900
I'll open the door to heaven or hell.

1221
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,960
Oh, death.

1222
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,600
Someone would pray.

1223
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,100
Could you wait to call me another day?

1224
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,240
The children prayed.

1225
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,940
The preacher preached.

1226
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,780
Time and mercy is out of your reach.

1227
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,500
I'll fix your feet till you can't walk.

1228
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,880
I'll lock your jaw.

1229
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:52,880


1230
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,840
Just till you can't talk.

1231
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,860
I'll close your eyes so you can't see this very hour.

1232
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,520
Come and go with me.

1233
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:12,540
Death I come to take the soul, leave the body and leave it cold.

1234
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,520
To drop the flesh off of the frame.

1235
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,420
The earth and worms both have a claim.

1236
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,160
Oh, death

1237
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,040
Oh, death

1238
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,560
Won't you spy me over till another year

1239
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,820
My mother came to my bed

1240
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,920
Placed a coal towel upon my head

1241
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,900
My head is warm, my feet are cold

1242
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,000
Death is a-moving upon my soul

1243
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,040
Oh, death, how you treating me

1244
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,120
You close my eyes so I can't see

1245
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,420
Well, you're hurting my body, you make me cold

1246
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:14,460
You run my life right out of my soul

1247
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,760
Oh, death, please consider my age

1248
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,840
Please don't take me at this stage

1249
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,980
My wealth is all at your command

1250
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:31,740
If you will move your icy hands

1251
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,220
Oh, the young, the rich, or poor

1252
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,720
How like me you know

1253
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,760
No wealth, no land, no silver, no gold

1254
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,900
Nothing satisfies me

1255
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,220
But your soul

1256
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,500
Oh, death

1257
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,800
Oh, death

1258
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,040
Won't you spy me over till another year

1259
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,900
Won't you spy me over till another year

1260
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,280
Won't you spy me over till another year

1261
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,260
Sobering

1262
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,200
Sobering indeed, friends.

1263
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,540
That was Ralph Stanley singing,

1264
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,620
and I first heard it on the soundtrack of

1265
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,080
Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?

1266
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,900
That's actually kind of a hard song for an old person to hear.

1267
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,700
By the time you're my age,

1268
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,520
you've seen way too many younger folks

1269
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,640
taken before their time by illness or accident.

1270
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,480
Yes, sir, one thing I hate more than the conspiracy,

1271
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,440
even more than the conspiracy,

1272
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,720
is chronic disease.

1273
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,020
Not the aging, that's fair enough,

1274
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,640
but the hurting.

1275
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,180
At least this show was really funny up till now.

1276
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,720
But just as the grim reaper comes a-knockin'

1277
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,940
just when you'd rather he not,

1278
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,280
which is every time,

1279
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,560
well, so too must this hour of slack,

1280
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,680
much like beans,

1281
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,840
come to its end.

1282
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,000
People say in Boston even

1283
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,800
Beans do it

1284
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,020
Let's do it

1285
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,900
Beans do it

1286
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,220
Friends

1287
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,560
Let's vote

1288
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,980
Home again!

1289
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,280
And in fact, now I'm going to give you more information

1290
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,960
about where this all comes from,

1291
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,380
the Church of the Subgenius,

1292
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:39,980
the books,

1293
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,920
the videotapes,

1294
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,680
the monsters,

1295
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,420
the living madmen,

1296
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,880
and this...

1297
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,020
Post Office Box.

1298
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,900

1300
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,260

or Reverend Ivan Stang, or anybody,

1302

1303
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,800

Okay.

1313
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,100
And there it is.

1314
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,460
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1315
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,440
Hey, hey, hey.

1316
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:51,460
