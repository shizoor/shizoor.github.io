1
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,980
The

2
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,700
from PR News in Washington. I'm speaking out to stifle free speech.

3
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,320
As a result, President Trump says I'm a very good person. Chemical plants release chemicals for

4
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,660
human health, sending plumes of chemicals into nearby neighborhoods. Many chemicals were not

5
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:59,260
designed for such heavy PR news. The Dow is 32, 71, 25, 11, 77, 95, 5, 122, 3, 528,

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:06,320
200,000, 10, 46. Speaking to reporters, President Trump says PR news is sad.

7
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:14,180
Trump called PR news a very sad news last year. President Trump says PR news is in Washington.

8
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,560
Friends, we are here and I'm putting together this, I have put together an hour slack that's

9
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,900
largely composed of, well, part of it is WCSB shows from the last week.

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,800
Yes.

11
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,300
Talk shows about Starwood.

12
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:41,380
Our friends from Ace and Starwood were talking to Sustainable Love Corporation show last week.

13
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,440
So there's some great stuff about Starwood, which I edited quite a bit.

14
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:56,480
And there's also Dr. Sinister had the legendary 100,000 Leagues Under My Nutsack guy.

15
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
In the studio.

16
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,240
Yes.

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,440
Princess Lee and I have been seeing those stickers around town for why I don't know how long.

18
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,980
.

19
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:07,980

No, we're really down like you

126
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,420
No, we're down

127
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,920
No, we're down

128
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,700
We're down like you and we want you to die

129
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,160
Can't you tell by that gleam in our eye

130
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,180
Oh, by the way, forever you'll cry

131
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,460
Because we really down like you

132
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,820

152
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,120
No, we don't

153
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,300

No, we don't

156

We don't

157
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,560
No, we don't

158
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,780
No, we don't

159
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,980
Don't like you

160
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,300
Don't like you

161
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,480
No.

162
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,040
Don't like you

163
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,380
No, we don't

164
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,320
We're starting the talk show a little early tonight because why not?

165
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,460
I'm your host, Dr. Sinister, and this is Synesthesia.

166
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,800
And with me in the studio tonight is my very special guest, Dr. Max Arborezium.

167
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,560
Yeah, you know it, Dr. Sinister.

168
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,180
You know it. You've been listening to some of his music for the last few minutes if you've been tuned in.

169
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:55,280
And you may recognize him from such projects as, well, what else have you been party to?

170
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,800
Well, lately I've been doing a little dibbling and dabbling and a whole bunch of different projects.

171
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,420
But not dribbling or droodling.

172
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,700
Actually, I did one droodle and four deneedlefulcation nibbles.

173
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,440
And in December you do the dreidling.

174
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,260
Sometimes I do have a solid chrome dreidel that was given to me from a friend of mine

175
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,020
who knew that I needed the special kind of dreidel because of the kind of things I'm into.

176
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,020
And then, of course...

177
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,100
You have probably seen stickers around town if you've really been paying attention.

178
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
And it might be one of the best kept secrets of this city here.

179
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:43,260
But this is the real thing and we have, dare I say, the evil mastermind behind it all in the studio with us tonight.

180
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,760
Yeah, you know it.

181
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,120
We are talking about...

182
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,260
How would you... If you were trying to announce... If you were an announcer,

183
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,120
or if you had an announcer before your band came on stage,

184
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:54,920
announce...

185
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,360
Say the name of this band here exactly the way you would want it to be announced.

186
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,560
Well, originally it was said in ancient Arabic.

187
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,740
And I personally do not know Arabic anymore since I had that accident.

188
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,880
And I had a special surgery that completely got rid of me thinking about speaking in any other language

189
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,240
other than Cleveland Ebonics, yo.

190
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,080
So what's up with that?

191
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,920
But if I was a radio announcer, I would say...

192
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,000
Up next on stage...

193
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,700
Is the incredible stylish music of 100,000...

194
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,780
League's Under My Nutsack !!

195
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,320
Things which must shortly take place...

196
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,520
Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy...

197
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,260
And from the seven Spirits who are here today...

198
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,260


199
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,400
You are before his throne, the firstborn from the dead, kings and priests to behold.

200
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,700
He is coming with clouds.

201
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,400
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.

202
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,300
And his eyes like a flame of fire.

203
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,140
These things says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, and I found them liars.

204
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:27,520
To him who overcomes, I will give to eat from the tree of life where you dwell, where Satan's throne is, where Satan dwells.

205
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,900
Satan will be released from his prison.

206
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:38,920
Like a flame of fire, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what power I will come upon you, he who has an ear.

207
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:46,040
To test those who dwell on the earth, you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind.

208
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,000
End.

209
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,320
Naked.

210
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,540
And from the throne proceeded lightning, thundering, and voices.

211
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:08,800
And in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes, in front and in back, written on their foreheads.

212
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,860
Having seven horns and seven eyes, fallen from heaven to the earth.

213
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,120
For their tails are like serpents, having heads, demons and idols.

214
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,520
And they have the wings of gold, which can neither see nor hear nor walk.

215
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,020
Fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies.

216
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,040
And great fear fell on those who saw them.

217
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,420
And for the devil has come down to you, written on their foreheads.

218
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,180
And power was given to him to scorch men with fire.

219
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,740
And his kingdom became full of darkness.

220
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,820
And they gnawed at their tongues because of the pain.

221
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,500
For there are spirits of demons performing signs of the getting.

222
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,240
It is dawn.

223
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:15,420
Having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, the filthiness of her fornication, drunk with the wine of her fornication, eat her flesh and burn her with fire.

224
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,120
For no one by her hand can be saved.

225
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,120


226
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,120


227
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,680
And after carriers and archmachenes haveες all the guts to die.

228
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,060
Who sandwich their flesh and sẽ azàzâcëaa the flesh of their men and begin a work of life.

229
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,380
mudduī Trade is in progress.

230
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,080
Dedicated painful acts ofmek

231
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:42,100
So they the the title of the records nuts teacher ilizy.

232
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:42,740
Yes.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,020
A Qabit playing the mug there the�ak.

234
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,040
which is part of the name of the band

235
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,580
and then there's religious

236
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,860
which is a whole thing that has to do with religion

237
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,040
but when you put nutsack and religious

238
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,200
together there's this little play

239
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,120
of sack religious even though there's

240
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,380
nothing religious about the record

241
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,200
as a matter of fact I think that

242
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,280
the people as they're called

243
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,400
they even coined a term for that sort of thing

244
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
it's called a portmanteau

245
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,780
oh I love that kind of cheese

246
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,000
yes it is great

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,220
spread over water crackers and with

248
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,200
some figs

249
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,980
why do water crackers not taste like water

250
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,380
I've always been concerned about that

251
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,920
well the reason I think

252
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,080
has to go back to the fact that

253
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,000
if you got stuck on a ration

254
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,680
of nothing but bread and water as penance

255
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,200
I think they were actually giving you just water crackers

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,980
so you didn't get water

257
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,000
or maybe they just go well with water

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,460
I don't know

259
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,660
my concern is that we do not have enough

260
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,680
baby skin scented candles in the

261
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,920
stores around Cleveland

262
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,140
well you know baby skin

263
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,080
is one thing but

264
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,300
baby fat is really best for making candles

265
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,420
well I think that's illegal though

266
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,900
I'm pretty sure that's illegal there doctor

267
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,360
well you know back in the

268
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,240
during the burning times

269
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,640
during the witch hunt scare

270
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,300
women were accused of

271
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,460
witchcraft and one of the things they were accused of doing

272
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,160
is making an ointment

273
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,940
from the rendered fat of

274
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,040
unbaptized babies

275
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,620
that they would smear all over their naked bodies

276
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,380
so they could fly

277
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,420
story of my life

278
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,460
alright so fast forward a couple hundred years though

279
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,060
and then the more you do that the more you get

280
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,100
it back

281
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,040
and then the Mormons come along and they developed this sacrament called baptism of the dead

282
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,780
so what happens if a witch is flying

283
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,240
with that ointment made from the rendered fat of unbaptized babies

284
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,020
and a Mormon

285
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,800
church elder baptizes that dead baby

286
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
does the witch fall from the sky

287
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,640
um apparently she flies over to my house

288
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,100
which is located at

289
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,440
beep beep beep beep beep

290
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,040
yeah

291
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
so you know

292
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,160
anytime a witch falls from the sky

293
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,820
and uh

294
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,060
just happens to land right on your face

295
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,920
right in your home, that's a blessing from the gods for sure.

296
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,360
That could be my next song.

297
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,280
First of all, we're bombarded with messages and sounds and information.

298
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,240
This is kind of what we hear.

299
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,340
The problem is, it doesn't work.

300
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,300
And so reinforcing that, it's inevitable.

301
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,240
I mean, what's the point?

302
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,740
It's a point.

303
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,300
It's a point.

304
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,860
It's a point.

305
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,420
It's a point.

306
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,680
I believe in the power of the album.

307
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,240
I do believe it's coming back.

308
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,180
And I wanted to make one little statement.

309
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,060
Yeah, I don't fuck with nobody.

310
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,100
Like, at all.

311
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,520
Nobody.

312
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,680
So, it's very simple.

313
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,540
I stay at my house and...

314
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
And, yeah, let's do something like this.

315
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
First, we're going to have to turn our tempo way down.

316
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,340
So, we're going to have to turn our tempo way down.

317
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,700
Our breathing is slower and deeper.

318
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,800
Our breathing is slower and deeper.

319
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,400
It is important to note that...

320
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,920
D is for dumbness and despair and desertion.

321
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,440
And that is one of the biggest strongholds of all.

322
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,500
Take a listen to this.

323
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:35,540
What is it that you can't begin to achieve

324
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,160
so that you may be, in fact,

325
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,480
able to do this?

326
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,860
We gotta do something about this problem.

327
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,840
I don't get you.

328
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,580
We don't have a problem with that, okay?

329
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,200
No one knows what it's like

330
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,960
to be the bad man.

331
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,880
What do you think about the new band?

332
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,260
Well, it doesn't matter what I think.

333
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,780
I kind of have to tip my hat to any entity

334
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,160
that could bring so much integrity to evil.

335
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,880
I mean, imagine.

336
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,100
It's a seemingly voluntary, privatized gulag

337
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,340
that just managed to eliminate the meddling middlemen

338
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,060
of public accountability and free will

339
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,240
and wrap it up in a little bow

340
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
and give it to the public like a gift.

341
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,040
I mean, come on.

342
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,460
This is...

343
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,020
Whoosh!

344
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:24,860
Rrrrrrp!

345
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,220
This is awe-inspiring stuff.

346
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,660
Rrrrrp!

347
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,480
Rrrrrp!

348
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:30,780
Rrrrrp!

349
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,620
Rrrrrp!

350
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,320
Rrrrrp!

351
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,720
Rrrrrp!

352
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:32,940
Rrrrrp!

353
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,140
Rrrrrp!

354
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,660
Rrrrrp!

355
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:33,740
Rrrrrp!

356
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,160
Rrrrrp!

357
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,400
Rrrrrp!

358
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,500
Rrrrrp!

359
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,220
Rrrrrp!

360
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,300
Rrrrrp!

361
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,260
Rrrrrp!

362
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,520
Rrrrrp!

363
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,160
Ok, that's it.

364
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,520
That's it.

365
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:11,860
Cheers, glasses.

366
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:11,860


367
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:11,860


368
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:11,860


369
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:11,860


370
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,100
We'll see you next time.

371
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,360
Bye.

372
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,720
Bye.

373
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,860
Bye.

374
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,200
Bye.

375
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,860
Bye.

376
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,260
Bye.

377
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,280
Bye.

378
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,960
Yeah, pick up the pace now, come on

379
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,140
Yeah

380
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,460
Just feel like that type shit

381
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,480
Make things go get the keys to your whip, whip

382
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,520
And just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

383
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,500
But um, see, you know how boys stereotypically

384
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,640
Kick flows for ya, kick down doors for ya

385
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,140
Even left all my motherfucking hoes for ya

386
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,200
And therefore these marginalized groups

387
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,540
Who are being destroyed

388
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,220
Should organize to defend themselves

389
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,860
Instead of just watching passively

390
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,480
I noticed you had what it took just now

391
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,200
Hmph, I guess he proved that, didn't he?

392
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,160
How can these people fight each other

393
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,460
And still carry on their mission?

394
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,980
All of my niggas, all of my bitches

395
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,480
Give you something and it split you up

396
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,160
And leave you in stitches

397
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,020
Looking pathetic

398
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,440
I hit y'all niggas with the kinetic

399
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,460
Make you respect it

400
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,860
And beat you in the head till you get it

401
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,820
We suffer

402
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,080
When we

403
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,420
When the temple is destroyed

404
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,940
We rejoice

405
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,180
When the temple is healed

406
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,420
It's really about us

407
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,760
Create a strong impression on the owner's mind

408
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,260
This is a customer keeping program

409
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,000
Pieces of time

410
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,160
Lost in this treason

411
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,740
No rhyme

412
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,920
No reason

413
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,420
Everything's for sale

414
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,800
Everything is for sale

415
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,640
Consumed by life

416
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,600
One day at a time

417
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:28,100
One foot in front of the other

418
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,140
Time

419
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,260
Time to sell your soul

420
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,040
Don't sell your soul

421
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,660
The oath has been broken

422
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,240
Losing in sequence they fold

423
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,680
And now they're all empty

424
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,860
And rupture the question of its own

425
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,640
What have we become?

426
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,520
Time to sell your soul

427
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,640
Time to sell your soul

428
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:26,640


429
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:26,640


430
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,760
What have we become?

431
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,640
Time to sell your soul

432
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,940
The wound is now open

433
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,520
The routine is over we know

434
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:55,200
Pleasure from the seeker as he grows old

435
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,620
Pleasure from the seeker as he grows old

436
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,580
Pleasure from the seeker as he grows old

437
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,840
Everything's for sale

438
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,820
Everything's for sale

439
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,800
Everything's for sale

440
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,060
Everything is for sale

441
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:22,820
Time to sell your own soul

442
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,360
Time to sell your own soul

443
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,760
Time to sell your own soul

444
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,300
Time to sell your own soul

445
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,580
Time to sell your own soul

446
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,980
Time to sell your own soul

447
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:44,540
Time to sell your own soul

448
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:51,420
Time to sell your own soul

449
00:24:51,420 --> 00:25:00,040
are mostly notes, frequency, frequency manipulation, sound exploration, black hole cavity research,

450
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,280
and also yacht rock.

451
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,200
Oh, the yacht rock.

452
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,960
With a little sprinkle of Michael Jackson and a little sprinkle of Slayer.

453
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,400
Can I tell you what your music reminds me of?

454
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,760
Does it remind you of remembering what it reminded you of?

455
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,540
You're getting pretty meta there.

456
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,940
Well, to me, it sounds like a combination of Jethro Tull,

457
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,520
Have you ever met Jethro Tull?

458
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,920
He's a really nice guy.

459
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,860
Well, considering that he lived in the 18th century, no, I can't say I have.

460
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,080
Well, some of us have lived in the 18th century, and some of us have lived in the 14th century.

461
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,100
I mean, it's not that hard, dude.

462
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,240
You just got to save up your money.

463
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,400
I mean, like, what could have been beer money for one night?

464
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,940
You just save that up one night a week over the course of a couple of years,

465
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,520
and you, too, can go back to the 18th.

466
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,260
Why would you send the band U2 back to the 18th century?

467
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,700
That's really weird, Dr. Sinister.

468
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,320
Well, that way I wouldn't have to listen to them today.

469
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,060
Well, that's fair enough.

470
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,640
Fair enough.

471
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,940
No, that's...

472
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,180
I don't know.

473
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:09,080
I would like to tell you, your music reminds me of a combination of Billy Bob Thornton,

474
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,220
Kevin Bacon, and Wang Chung.

475
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,360
You take that back.

476
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,480
Okay, I will take it back.

477
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,900
It's taken back.

478
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,460
Thank you.

479
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,720
Thank you so much for caller number one.

480
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,080
You did a great job, and I'm a big fan of your work.

481
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,120
That's it.

482
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,440
Taps was created to honor his men following the Seven Days Battle

483
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,460
as they camped right here at Harrison's Landing near the Berkeley Plantation.

484
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,100
That's it.

485
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,280
Taps was made an official bugle call after the war.

486
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:06,960
That's it.

487
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,960
Just in order to prove our freedom from J.R. Bob Dogg,

488
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,160
the first law of the Church of the Subgenius is, of course,

489
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,420
and you will repeat after me,

490
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,440
the subgenius must...

491
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,080
have...

492
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,480
flat.

493
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,100
What must the subgenius have?

494
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:21,840
Flat.

495
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,400
What must he have?

496
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:23,980
Flat.

497
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,000
That's right.

498
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,680
The second law of the subgenius commandments is...

499
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,140
So talk about the Church of the Subgenius.

500
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,020
We're about to...

501
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,980
In Starwood.

502
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,060
Oh.

503
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,580
Oh, you mean us.

504
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,620
Right.

505
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh, well.

506
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,100
Ivan Stang came to Starwood.

507
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,620
Oh, God, it has to be 15, 20 years ago for the first time.

508
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,980
1990, 91, something like that.

509
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,360
Right, yeah.

510
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,160
And he's been with us ever since,

511
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,740
teaching us how to pull the wool over our own eyes,

512
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,360
which is probably...

513
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,280
He's probably one of our best speakers,

514
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,820
a really funny guy.

515
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,380
He's got his joke disguised as a religion,

516
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,200
or religion disguised as a joke,

517
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,800
depending on how you look at it.

518
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,600
And...

519
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,860
Right, immediately before Starwood,

520
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,740
there's X-Day, the celebration of the end of the world,

521
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,200
which happened in when?

522
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,100
Well, supposedly 1998 was the original scheduled date.

523
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,960
1998, but they think they may have gotten the date reversed.

524
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,600
So the message from Bob Dobbs was less clear today

525
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,100
than it was in 1998.

526
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,640
I was actually there that year, waiting for them to come,

527
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,700
and I was very disappointed that they didn't,

528
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,180
but I look forward to when they get here.

529
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,340
Well, legend has it that they have,

530
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,960
have already, that they have come,

531
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,900
or that they will come,

532
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,840
but we're not really sure what the whole...

533
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,320
Who's they?

534
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,300
What the whole...

535
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,280
The X's, of course.

536
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,200
The X's, the saucers.

537
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,360
The, you know, the people that are coming.

538
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, I'm so glad I never heard of that.

539
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,400
I don't want any of those people to take me away.

540
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,380
Oh.

541
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,580
Maybe I do, I don't know.

542
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,500
Maybe you do, right?

543
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,280
You don't want to go to the pleasure plant?

544
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,120
Have you seen one yet?

545
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,660
So I would say, is there any...

546
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,220
I mean, as approachable as anyone is at...

547
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,500
an open festival, Starwood, like,

548
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,320
if I were to see any of these

549
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,920
distinguished guests and community members,

550
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,140
it's not that easy to want to be like,

551
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,620
you're so-and-so.

552
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,740
You know, you get that...

553
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,260
Do people get fan, fan, fanboyed, fangirled a lot here?

554
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
I don't see a whole lot of that myself.

555
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,640
There's a lot of people at Starwood that really,

556
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,020
I think, see, you know, the people who present

557
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,180
and the people who attend.

558
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,040
They largely, I think, see everyone else as equals,

559
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,920
more or less, I feel.

560
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,920
I think part of the beauty of Starwood

561
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,000
is that you don't get a lot of that

562
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,820
because people don't feel the need to do that.

563
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,220
You don't have to walk up to Oberon Zell and say,

564
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,940
wow, you're Oberon Zell.

565
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,220
All you really have to do is walk up and say,

566
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,000
hey, man, I liked your lecture.

567
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,880
I liked what you said.

568
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,200
I saw your book.

569
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,500
Nice unicorn.

570
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,340
You know.

571
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,860
Although he likes it when you say,

572
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,180
oh, you're Oberon Zell.

573
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,980
Do you know?

574
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,560
Do you know who that is?

575
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,560
I don't know anyone.

576
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,820
So Oberon Zell, you look at him,

577
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,220
and he looks like a wizard.

578
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,360
He's one of those guys.

579
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,440
And in fact, I guess he is.

580
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,900
He is, in fact, a wizard.

581
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,340
He is, in fact, a wizard.

582
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,880
Founder of the Church of All Worlds.

583
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,960
So he's from the sci-fi,

584
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,500
neo-pagan kind of tradition.

585
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,480
And he's one of those elders

586
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,780
that you could actually just walk up to,

587
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,880
and say, oh, you're the legendary Oberon Zell.

588
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,420
I mean, what guidance do you have for me?

589
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,620
And Oberon's a cool guy.

590
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,980
Yeah, he does get a kick out of that.

591
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,820
He likes fanboys and fangirls, yes.

592
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,220
And I think we might have another somewhat wizard of sorts.

593
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,040
I think Helen's trying to figure out how to work.

594
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,300
Can you do it?

595
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,680
No, it doesn't sound good.

596
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:15,340
I think I hear a dial tone, so we'll try again.

597
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,760
I think what first,

598
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,480
what first attracted us to the Church of the Subgenius

599
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,720
was that it was the only church we found

600
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,240
that offers you a triple your money back guarantee,

601
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,720
eternal salvation or triple your money back.

602
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,600
And I think when a religion actually stands behind its product

603
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,940
like none of the others do,

604
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,440
you have to pay some attention.

605
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,380
Yeah, that's true.

606
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,060
Yeah, I don't want to hear that.

607
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,100
Actually, that's putting me in the kind of a zone.

608
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,800
I kind of like that.

609
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,400
Hypnosis.

610
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,760
Hypnosis.

611
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,980
The thing that I really like about the whole Starwood subgenius crossover

612
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,040
is this idea of that's where counterculture and science meets.

613
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,100
It's like the most intelligent humor there is out there.

614
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,520
It's subversive yet progressive.

615
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,400
And how it manages to do that in one step is remarkable.

616
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,940
These images that demand that you respond to them,

617
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,740
these things that you can't quite take,

618
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,960
hell, if they're picking fun at you

619
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,600
or really sharing some sacred knowledge with you.

620
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,820
And then when you combine that kind of atmosphere

621
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,460
with things like nightly fires and fire spinners

622
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:37,540
and the whole ritual and culture of fire

623
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,360
and spirit worship and rhythm

624
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,160
and the community sitting around the fire

625
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,240
and watching each other,

626
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:46,780
you can actually see the power of that.

627
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:46,780


628
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:46,780


629
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,960
how they can do new skills and perform in new ways.

630
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,000
It's just, you just end up with this unique transformative experience.

631
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,420
And people come to Starwood, walk away with new skills

632
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,900
and walk away with a resolution to learn new skills

633
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:06,560
and to be more than they were when they arrived.

634
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,280
And there's a peaceful connection between the people there,

635
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,740
where people learn to accept each other and not just go,

636
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:16,740


637
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:16,740


638
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,540
and not make judgments so much as make friends.

639
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,640
And where there normally wouldn't be a peaceful connection

640
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,720
out in the real world.

641
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,020
Yes, absolutely.

642
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,400
I find myself making some judgments.

643
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,320
For the sake or off sake?

644
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,040
No, just like for me.

645
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,480
But we don't judge him for that.

646
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah, I don't feel judged for making judgments.

647
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,260
That's true, but it's where boundaries are.

648
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,740
Like my personal boundaries get challenged there.

649
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,440
So I need to exercise judgment.

650
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,720
That's true. So I need to exercise judgment.

651
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:46,720


652
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:46,720


653
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:46,720


654
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:46,900
That's true. So I need to exercise judgment.

655
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:46,900


656
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,640
I need to exercise judgment in a different way.

657
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,080
And it's like, hey, this is okay for you.

658
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,360
There's always somebody that's more strange than me there.

659
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,420
So I feel like-

660
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
And we welcome them.

661
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:58,960
Yes.

662
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,320
And who out there doesn't like to know what happens in the Pufferdome?

663
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,160
There we go.

664
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,660
I mean, you hear that word Pufferdome and you're like,

665
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,420
what kind of a place is that?

666
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,300
What kind of a place is the Pufferdome?

667
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,220
I want to see what's happening over there.

668
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,260
That's a unique structure.

669
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,760
That's awesome.

670
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,280
The Pufferdome is our own.

671
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,140
I'm going to go with the radio with the Reverend Stangman.

672
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,100
I need to have him to tell us a little something.

673
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,360
All right.

674
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,500
We interrupt that thought.

675
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,760
We interrupt that thought.

676
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,600
Now interrupt the Pufferdome.

677
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,240
He's going to interrupt.

678
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,040
Am I talking over your cell phone into a microphone?

679
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,700
Yes.

680
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,320
Potentially.

681
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,320
Yes, you are.

682
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,200
Potentially.

683
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,480
That's how the way it looks in cowboy days, Doug.

684
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,180
Look, sometimes-

685
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,240
That's okay.

686
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,260
The problem with this system is drill holes.

687
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


688
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


689
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


690
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


691
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


692
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


693
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


694
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


695
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


696
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,260


697
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,680
It's so hard to understand anything you guys say.

698
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,420
Perfect.

699
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,220
But I can tell you this much.

700
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,760
I've been to almost every single Starwood since 1990.

701
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,620
And the first time I went, I was very suspicious.

702
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,500
I thought, is this a trap?

703
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,620
Is this an ambush?

704
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:15,500
Because I was mostly famous for making fun of woo-woo, new age type stuff, and even directly

705
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,240
mocked a person.

706
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


707
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


708
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


709
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


710
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


711
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


712
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


713
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


714
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


715
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,240


716
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,860
to nice Wiccans and Druids.

717
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,160
I've been mocked by you.

718
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,020
I thought they were setting me up.

719
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,220
They were going to chop me.

720
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,100
But a friend of mine said,

721
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,900
well guess what, I've been there.

722
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,600
You should keep an open mind.

723
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,100
It may be not quite what you expect.

724
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,960
And long story short,

725
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,640
I ended up not only coming back to Starwood

726
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,180
every chance I could possibly get,

727
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,040
but I married one of the people who's now one of the co-founders.

728
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,020
And now the Church of the Subgenius is literally

729
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
married to Starwood.

730
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,000
Lisa, let the court.

731
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,280
So that's terrifying.

732
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,340
Miscegenation of the highest order.

733
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,340
But it is high order.

734
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,440
There's been a lot of pride.

735
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Excellent.

736
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,080
Thank you for suffering through this brutal technology.

737
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,120
Will we see the Church of the Subgenius

738
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,340
at Starwood this year?

739
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:14,780
Well, no.

740
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,180
You won't see the whole thing.

741
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,840
But you'll see several of us.

742
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,580
You won't be able to not hear us

743
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,720
because we're really loud.

744
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,080
I'll be giving my annual sermon.

745
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,820
It's not the only big sermon I do anymore in public.

746
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,460
I don't do many live shows.

747
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,120
But I would never miss Starwood.

748
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,720
They're a very strangely polite audience.

749
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,740
They actually seem to listen unlike the Subgeniuses.

750
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,100
Dr. Hal Robbins will be there.

751
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,340
He's a well-known illustrator and raconteur from San Francisco

752
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,660
who has been doing Subgenius radio in San Francisco

753
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,480
for 40 years now.

754
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,100
John Shirley is a science fiction author.

755
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,800
He's written zillions of really cool sci-fi and horror books.

756
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,500
He's going to be a speaker there,

757
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,740
but not talking about sci-fi and horror, I think.

758
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,580
I've asked Pat Mandee, the singer.

759
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,420
He's almost always at X Day, too.

760
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,360
So the gang will be all there.

761
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,300
Excellent.

762
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,080
I can't wait to meet Vermin and the preen.

763
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,640
That'll be the two.

764
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,420
And collect on your pony, or do you already have several?

765
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,320
If I get a free pony, you can have mine.

766
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,640
Oh, thank you. That's very generous.

767
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,480
They're harder to take care of than most people know.

768
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,500
I've had to clean up after ponies.

769
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,440
Let me put it this way.

770
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,720
For $2 an hour, I had to clean horse stables,

771
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,080
like Hercules.

772
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,640
You can have my pony.

773
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,180
I can't even handle another dog.

774
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,100
Anyway, I should get off and let you guys talk.

775
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,240
You're wonderful.

776
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,120
Greetings to Lisa Lefcourt.

777
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,700
And we'll see you in July.

778
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,320
Have a fantastic day. Bye-bye.

779
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,080
You can't really talk about Starwood

780
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,380
without talking about some of the venues there,

781
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,480
because that's one of the things that makes it an incredible event.

782
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,080
We have, of course, our traditional main stage

783
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,120
that Regis runs so well,

784
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,340
with the light and sound that you would expect at a main stage.

785
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,080
We have the Caffeinas Coffee Shop,

786
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,060
which is a coffee shop-type stage.

787
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,860
We have the Green Man Tavern,

788
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,360
which is another traditional stage.

789
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,100
But we also have non-traditional venues

790
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,820
that we started to mention before.

791
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,580
The Puffer Dome, the Propane Dance Floor, the Didge Dome.

792
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,980
The Puffer Dome itself is a structure that I have not seen anywhere,

793
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,120
it's something, it was my personal vision.

794
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,160
It's a 40-foot wide, 20-foot high inflatable dance club.

795
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,660
It's an old military communications, you know, it was.

796
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,020
It's based on an old military communications idea,

797
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
but we have actually had it custom made.

798
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,060
This is our second custom-made Puffer Dome.

799
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,400
And the acoustics, the echoing are amazing,

800
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,860
and the projections, because the entire dome,

801
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,520
the entire 40-by-20-foot dome is also a projection screen

802
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,980
that you can see the visuals from both the inside and the outside.

803
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,660
So it creates a whole indoor and outdoor environment at once.

804
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,820
One of the things we're doing this year nearby and on the Puffer Dome

805
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,660
is our own version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

806
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,020
We're happy to have people coming and doing the whole Rocky Horror script.

807
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,800
We've also got concerts, movies, and...

808
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,500
With the real film.

809
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,060
Yeah, with the real film, of course, yes, with the permission of the company.

810
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,500
We have the propane dance floor,

811
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,780
which is basically a fire-based organ musical instrument

812
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,080
that not only plays notes, but plays flames.

813
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,960
And we have the dig dome, which is a quieter, acoustic, PVC-type dome.

814
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,260
There's some music magic happens in there.

815
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,780
A little small fire inside there, and you can listen,

816
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,940
zone out to the beautiful music of various Middle Eastern string instruments

817
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:22,080
with soft percussion and didgeridoos and stuff like that.

818
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,680
It's a beautiful spot, the dig dome.

819
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,820
I suppose the fire spots are noteworthy as well.

820
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,200
There's the Paw Paw Patch.

821
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,640
That's where the nightly bonfires are, and it's in a Paw Paw Patch.

822
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,380
Go Ohio.

823
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,300
Right.

824
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,040
And it's just a beautifully maintained, nice-sized fire,

825
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,820
bigger than the normal ones that you have when you're out camping, that's for sure.

826
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,020
And the drums can be protected, and there's places to sit.

827
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,500
But then Saturday night, Saturday night, you've got the most massive fire you've seen.

828
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,460
It's bigger than a house, and it takes a week and a half to build.

829
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,740
And just some amazing things happen around that big set.

830
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,280
That's the culmination of the whole thing.

831
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,540
The culmination of the whole festival, really, was when everybody's bringing their full game,

832
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,760
whether it's their party game or their magic game or their fire-spinning game

833
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,860
or just their coming into their own element.

834
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,320
Or their crazy game.

835
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,320
Their subgenius game or their nostril game.

836
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,820
Or their lonesome cowboy Dave game.

837
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,360
Lonesome cowboy Dave game?

838
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,880
Yeah, there's supposed to be a lonesome cowboy Dave game on right now.

839
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,460
I want to play.

840
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,620
Were you watching the game?

841
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,020
I thought we were watching the game.

842
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,860
I want to play that.

843
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,580
Dave?

844
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,420
Dave.

845
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,920
It's Dave.

846
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:57,300
I was following a certain kind of a psycho-spiritual hindrance, is what they call it.

847
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:02,100
And they said, well, if I was to go to Starwood or if I was to go to the Church of the Subgenius

848
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,800
X Day Festival or something, I think I'd believe it.

849
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:04,800


850
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,040
I don't think I belonged to a certain denomination or church or something like that.

851
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,120
I said, Stang respects all denominations, especially 10s and 20s.

852
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,540
And he laughed a little bit and I shot him in the foot.

853
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:27,200
That's all I had to say for right now because I had the miss-wollen correction, or the institution anyway,

854
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:34,400
that somehow Gilbert Shelton and R. Crumb had something to do with the first Hester Street.

855
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,780
Right.

856
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
And that's not impossible, isn't it?

857
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,960
Well, Crumb was in Cleveland early on.

858
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:53,060
Oddly enough, at that Hester Street fair last week, there was a big wooden cutout ripoff

859
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,520
of the Keep on Truckin' character.

860
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,540
Yes.

861
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,060
With the big foreshortened shoes coming at you in the foreground.

862
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,780
It was along with all those other wooden photo ops.

863
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,760
Yeah, it was a photo op thing.

864
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,620
And a comic pie truck and all that stuff.

865
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,860
But it was very noticeably not drawn by Robert Crumb.

866
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,300
Or Gilbert Shelton.

867
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,840
It was drawn by a person with a form of digitalis of the rectal cavity and foreshortening of the feet.

868
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,200
Dave's talking about those foreshortened underground cartoonists from the olden days of Zap Comics.

869
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:30,620


870
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:30,720
Jase.

871
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,780
And the fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, who are all real.

872
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,600
Relatives of ours, in a way.

873
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:44,000
We all have distant battles of DNA, homework, gone awry, or whatever you want to call it.

874
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,420
Well, I could brag.

875
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,860
We could all brag.

876
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,740
I jammed.

877
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,660
I'm the son of a...

878
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Gilbert Shelton was in our band.

879
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,580
The band that dare not speak its name crossed with Doctors for Wotan.

880
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah?

881
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,440
Yeah.

882
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:01,920
Wow.

883
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,380
Yeah.

884
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:10,940
And Shelton was a little disappointed because it was like, aren't you any of you guys trying to play any real music?

885
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,960
And we're going, no.

886
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,300
No, no.

887
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,160
You know, he and Jay Kenny were trying to tune their instruments together.

888
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,380
And we're going, what are you...

889
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,880
Maybe you guys don't understand.

890
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,960
You're not supposed to play an instrument you know how to play in this band.

891
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,360
And, yeah.

892
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:49,820
And of course, our good friend St. Paul Mavridis of the Lies Foundation drew the fabulous Furry Freak Brothers and co-wrote those with Gilbert under the name of Paul Mavridis.

893
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,740
That's like his human street name, but we know him as Lies.

894
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,480
Lies.

895
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,400
Usually a heterosexual name.

896
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,340
Sometimes it belongs to like an officer in the police.

897
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:06,660
We've never made any distinction about what kind of sexual anything was.

898
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,700
Anything goes.

899
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,580
Nobody even cared about mice in those days.

900
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,180
Everybody knows what a bunch of pack of rodents they are.

901
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:14,860
Right.

902
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,660
Right.

903
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,120
I found a picture of myself eating dinner with Robert Crumb.

904
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,240
Really?

905
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,620
About a hundred thousand years ago.

906
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,800
I had short hair and big thick black glasses.

907
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,380
And...

908
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:35,760
That doctor outfit that I used to use as if it were a white tuxedo.

909
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,960
But it was just a cheap doctor outfit.

910
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:39,860
And...

911
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,580
And Crumb drew a little picture of me that ended up in one of his sketchbooks.

912
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,780
That I didn't think looked anything like me.

913
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:56,620
It was strangely pencil necked and chinless wondered.

914
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:57,940
Odd.

915
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,400
Funny.

916
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,080
Strangely stumpy.

917
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,000
Strangely stumpy?

918
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,560
Yeah.

919
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,180
Yeah.

920
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:04,600
I...

921
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:04,980
I...

922
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,580
I...

923
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,560
Do you know him?

924
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,500
Do you know Stumpy?

925
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,040
Yes, I do.

926
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:14,420
In fact, I encountered a real person who's like a San Francisco person whose whole...

927
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,220
Appeared to...

928
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:20,640
His whole life appears to have been centered around the few brief times he was with R.

929
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:20,900
Crumb.

930
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:26,780
He had some records that R. Crumb did that were, you know, that Paul Weidman, Jelly Roll

931
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,800
Morton kind of jazz.

932
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,760
Early 20s, late 20s jazz music.

933
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,920
And Crumb used to play...

934
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,760
Did you know Crumb was a musician also, right?

935
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,160
Yeah, and he was only into really old timey music.

936
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:40,540
Right.

937
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,420
Like Jelly Roll Morton and Paul Weidman type stuff.

938
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:43,420


939
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,860
Yeah, he hates everything modern.

940
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,240
Yeah.

941
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:53,760
And so he had these records and he had these, you know, like Keep On Truckin', these art

942
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:54,740
renderings.

943
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,780
They were like the same as the fat of the meaty dog.

944
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,780


945
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,740
Or the Excalibur, the sword of...

946
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,000
Well, I forget.

947
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:03,900
Nevermind.

948
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,680
Well, I'll tell you a funny anecdote, Dave.

949
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,160
The folks that were making that...

950
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,540
You got the anecdote, I got the cure.

951
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,580
The folks that were making that Subgenius movie, of course they wanted to film any celebrities

952
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,600
they could get.

953
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:25,700
And we had a nice quote by Crumb on the back of Book of the Subgenius.

954
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,760
And they thought, well, let's get R. Crumb in.

955
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:27,760


956
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:27,760


957
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,140
And they wanted Crumb to say something about it.

958
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:35,240
And they talked to his agent, who is Gilbert Shelton's wife, it turns out.

959
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,260
And Crumb basically said, why do you want to talk with me?

960
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,980
I didn't have anything to do with Church's Subgenius.

961
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:43,920
I mean, I liked it.

962
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,240
I was a fan of him.

963
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,500
But I didn't really help with it.

964
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:55,660
And besides that, nobody's going to point a camera at me from now on.

965
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,900
Because...

966
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,640
He's pretty old.

967
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,420
They're all pretty old, those guys.

968
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,560
But Mavridis is probably the youngest.

969
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,580
And Hal Robbins, they're among the youngest of those folks.

970
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,940
And they're ancient.

971
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,960
They're like a year and a half older than me, both of them.

972
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,440
Daughtering.

973
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,400
Well, you're not werewolves.

974
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:16,960
Teetering.

975
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,500
Truly.

976
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,200
Not daughtering.

977
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,520
Tripling.

978
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,240
Teetering.

979
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:20,940
Yeah.

980
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,300
No, they're not.

981
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,120
You can get into all kinds of trouble.

982
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,180
Like, if you're a werewolf and they find out.

983
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,200
Like, they used to make you...

984
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,080
They would have to go to the back of the store to buy salami and bread and stuff like that.

985
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:38,200
And if they do, they'd come out and they'd act real nauseating and play with their pectoral muscles.

986
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,960
And, like, you know, grab their crotch area and stuff like that.

987
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,140
And go, yee-haw, yee-haw, and all that stuff like that.

988
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:46,720
No.

989
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,820
What do you mean, no?

990
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:49,420
No.

991
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:50,600
No.

992
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,840
This is not America.

993
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,460
This is not America.

994
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,340
Oh, no.

995
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,300
This is America, unfortunately.

996
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,420
Oh, boy.

997
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,280
America, co-co-co-co-co-co-co.

998
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,300
Well, we'll get our country back.

999
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,200
One of these days.

1000
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:12,480
Well, in about 300 million years after it's been completely destroyed and then reconstituted

1001
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,260
by some other species besides humans.

1002
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,660
Why isn't it that empires...

1003
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,300
They'll discover democracy again.

1004
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:20,920
... last about 600 years.

1005
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,500
Isn't that a strange thing?

1006
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,320
Well, I'm just saying, don't you think that's a strange thing?

1007
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,320


1008
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,320


1009
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,320


1010
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,320


1011
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,320


1012
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,320


1013
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,320


1014
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,780
They're gonna have to rediscover, I mean, the things that come along after humans.

1015
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:37,760
We'll have to rediscover democracy because I think that the whole history of that short-lived

1016
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,940
fad is being erased.

1017
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,660
Yeah, unfortunately.

1018
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:48,440
Because all the gangster dictators are friends now.

1019
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,420
They're all ganging up.

1020
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,760
They're in one big gang of gang dictators.

1021
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:52,560
You know?

1022
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,040
The North Korean guy.

1023
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,140
It's just like Hitler.

1024
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:55,140


1025
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,440
It's just like Hitler predicted.

1026
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:02,060
You know, the Axis powers, him and Mussolini and Tojo and all the guy from Bulgaria and

1027
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,820
the guy from Greece and everything and Franco and they all got together and...

1028
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,400
They just had to wait.

1029
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,520
They just had to wait.

1030
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,060
It's like that now.

1031
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,200
They just had to wait another 80 years.

1032
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,520
They were a little...

1033
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:20,600
They jumped the gun with that Third Reich stuff that it didn't fly then, but thanks

1034
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,480
to Facebook...

1035
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:21,860
Yeah.

1036
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,920
And the internet, it probably will fly.

1037
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,000
Well, it is.

1038
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,240
They're really taking off.

1039
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,220
Fascism is the new coming thing.

1040
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:39,580
It certainly sounds like there's some sort of idiotic movie preview that you don't want.

1041
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,340
You want to scream and throw your popcorn all over the place and run out of the building.

1042
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:49,740
Well, I mean, fascism in general, it's been the norm for the last several thousand years.

1043
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,560
There's just been these brief little...

1044
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:57,620
Little lights in history where there was a kind of an enlightenment or a little revolution

1045
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:03,680
or kind of an age of reason or something like that that would flicker in the darkness for

1046
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,940
a short time and then the light would go out and the demons would come back.

1047
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:16,660
The demons aren't real, but in the darkness, the people imagine the demons and so they're

1048
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,440
real to the people.

1049
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:19,700
Yeah.

1050
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,980
Somebody get them...

1051
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,040
Somebody get some dreaming on it too, though.

1052
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1053
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,040
The leaders get them dreaming on it.

1054
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:31,720
Yeah, their leaders explain to them how the darkness is filled with these horrible things

1055
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,100
they've never seen before.

1056
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,420
These things are called immigrants.

1057
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,480
Most of the people who are upset about them never actually met one.

1058
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,420
Oh, if you...

1059
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,540
But it's real easy.

1060
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:50,880
There's a lot of people in this country that are quite isolated in little towns where

1061
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,260
everybody's kind of alike.

1062
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,120
I live in one of those towns most of the time.

1063
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,900
I have a tremendous little town story about how diversity becomes politics, real politics,

1064
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,800
with a capital P and stuff like that.

1065
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,620
They had a big...

1066
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:12,140
They thought a bunch of illegals were voting in the county where I'm from, which is mostly

1067
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:17,300
agricultural now, so they assume naturally there's all kinds of agricultural workers

1068
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,960
they could cut and they could blame it on the Democrats because they're all being a

1069
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:20,960


1070
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:20,960


1071
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:20,960


1072
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:20,960


1073
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,080
I'm not going to vote Democrat because there's no place to vote in my county where you could

1074
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,760
walk in there and somebody not know who you were and they have to produce your license

1075
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,920
plates, especially if you're driving a police car that you just stole or something.

1076
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:42,300
That's just exactly how they'll get Sharia law going in Ashtabula, Ohio.

1077
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,880
Now, you look around, you don't see that many moose limes creeping around yet, but they're

1078
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,720
behind every billboard.

1079
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:56,240
They're behind every billboard and under every bed, just waiting for Hillary to release

1080
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:02,220
them from their sleep-induced hypnosis and they become triggered Manchurian candidates.

1081
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:08,980
They suddenly jump up and steal the apple pie from all the nice po-buckers of America.

1082
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:13,880
Check this out, it actually turned out they did find a voter who was not a citizen after

1083
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,080
the investigation and it was a Russian immigrant who voted for Trump.

1084
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,340
No.

1085
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,140
Isn't that...

1086
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,120
Isn't that hilarious?

1087
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,760
Well, no, it's actually a story I've heard over and over again.

1088
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,580
They had that kind of embarrassing thing in Texas, too.

1089
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:31,700
What?

1090
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:31,960
What?

1091
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,720
Look at this.

1092
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,620
We caught somebody vote...

1093
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,060
A fraud.

1094
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,760
They voted five times.

1095
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,940
Oh, for Trump.

1096
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:37,720
Oh, forget it.

1097
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,120
That's okay.

1098
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,500
Oh, well.

1099
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,920
Well, I've seen so many dystopian sci-fi movies.

1100
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,640
I used to think, you know, Planet of the Apes.

1101
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,260
Planet of the Apes was a disaster, you know, a horrible thing to even consider.

1102
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:03,200
Now, to me, it's like, whoa, that would be one of the best, better scenarios, you know,

1103
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,840
compared to what we're actually looking at, which is either a thousand...

1104
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:15,220
Well, basically a thousand years of everything looking ugly, as Frank Zappa put it, I think

1105
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,180
in better words.

1106
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,680
Can I just...

1107
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,560
Can I just very briefly plug my book?

1108
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:20,620
Yeah.

1109
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,360
I mean, I've been reading your book, Neighborworld.

1110
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,720
It's on sale in many places.

1111
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm sorry.

1112
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,920
I didn't mean to say that.

1113
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,960
It has to be taken out.

1114
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,600
But I was trying to say something...

1115
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:35,960
Dave, you can plug your book, Neighborworld, even though I'm one of the publishers.

1116
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:48,240
But if people were to type Neighborworld, one word, into their world brain, I think

1117
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,520
yours is the first one that comes up.

1118
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,000
Yes, I believe so.

1119
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,680
And if you type in Neighborworld Lonesome Cowboy Dave, it would sure come up.

1120
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,080
And everybody would be looking.

1121
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,520
They could look at a free sample.

1122
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:08,340
I could read the full first chapter of Neighborworld by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1123
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,100
By Aloy S. Hitler.

1124
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,400
At least that's what they used to say back in the old Bavarian days.

1125
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,680
I remember when Grandpa and I used to go out and chop wood, and he used to think he was

1126
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,620
becoming a direct-flow mononuclear.

1127
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,200
Or something like that.

1128
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,080
And that's why they had to put him in the institution.

1129
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,740
And he's still in there.

1130
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,200
And he still thinks he's somehow got a special line to God, you know?

1131
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:40,260
And that's why he listens to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack, which you all

1132
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,700
are listening to now.

1133
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,280
All of us, we're all listening to this together.

1134
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,340
And you can listen to all the other 2,000 episodes.

1135
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:52,160
At subgenius.com.

1136
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,760
Or see the 10,000 weird pictures.

1137
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:02,840
Yeah, and the good thing that you let people know that you are a font or a nexus.

1138
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,220
Whichever...

1139
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,000
I am a fontleroy.

1140
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,000
I am a nexus.

1141
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,740
You are a fontleroy nexus.

1142
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,760
Yes.

1143
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,200
I think that's a little bit silly, but I'll let it go by.

1144
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,820
Well, you know, Dave, with my poor hearing, and plus we actually have...

1145
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,820
...headphone problems tonight in the actual station per se.

1146
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,500
Did your dad and mommy both attend the nasal academy?

1147
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,660
Yeah, and well, that's why I have that spray for my nasal.

1148
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,740
And the populace is everybody out of their underwear in that place.

1149
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,520
They're all crazy.

1150
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,680
Hey, Princess Wee, are you watching the interocitor to see if that...

1151
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,280
I have just admitted Dr. Sinister.

1152
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,040
Oh, okay.

1153
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,540
And another individual into the building.

1154
00:56:51,780 --> 00:57:02,140
Yeah, the timing of this whole hour of slack, the whole evening has been set about eight minutes off, something like that.

1155
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,960
I don't know how long we had that dead air.

1156
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:14,080
Und if it wasn't Dr. Sinister, there's about to be some very dramatic times on this radio.

1157
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,460
If that is Dr. Sinister, then who is it?

1158
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,400
I don't know.

1159
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,760
I let someone in.

1160
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,040
Oh, I have to go let them in down the hall.

1161
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:21,620
Okay.

1162
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,700
Dave, we have to go now.

1163
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,040
Okay, okay.

1164
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,740
Slack, slack.

1165
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1166
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,060
What is this music in the background?

1167
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,660
I think it's CyberChump.

1168
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,440
Yes, it's CyberChump.

1169
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:41,640
It's another Ohio band.

1170
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,680
Crazy people.

1171
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,900
Okay, Dave, thank you, everyone.

1172
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,380
We'll see you next time.

1173
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1174
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1175
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1176
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1177
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1178
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1179
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1180
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1181
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1182
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1183
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1184
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1185
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1186
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1187
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1188
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,380


1189
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,120
Thank you, David.

1190
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,080
We got tired.

1191
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:14,580
Okay, David, thank you.

1192
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,040
Thank you.

1193
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,660
which my fellow Hendrix fans will understand.

1194
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,740
And Dave, we have to go now.

1195
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:21,860
All right.

1196
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1197
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,180
Okay.

1198
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,240
All right.

1199
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,140
All right.

1200
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:55,360
All right.

1201
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,220
All right.

1202
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,220
All right.

1203
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,300
All right.

1204
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:38,680
All right.

1205
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,240
All right.

1206
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:45,500
So I'm going to ask you to do this one little thing before we leave.

1207
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,020
And then we'll ask you to do this one little thing.

1208
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,120
I want you to grab hands of the person next to you very quickly.

1209
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,600
We're going to have a word of prayer.

1210
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,340
Just bow your heads.

1211
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,580
Heavenly Father, we thank you for tonight, for watching over us,

1212
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,900
for changing our lives.

1213
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,180
Watch over us as we go home.

1214
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,500
In Jesus' name, everybody said amen.

1215
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:02,360
Amen.

1216
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,960
You are dismissed.

1217
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:03,960


1218
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,260
But it got even worse.

1219
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,140
Hang on.

1220
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:17,980
What am I doing?

1221
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,100
What am I doing?

1222
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,000
But no, it's diamond.

1223
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,340
Does she want?

1224
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,100
No, she doesn't.

1225
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:31,400
She doesn't even know that I actually do, I don't know, like IRL streams.

1226
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,540
She's probably under the impression

1227
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,240
that I just do gaming streams.

1228
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,680
But little do they know.

1229
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,260
I don't even know.

1230
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:39,980
Maybe.

1231
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,540
Whether it's their party game or their magic game or their fire spinning game

1232
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:49,200
or just their coming into their own element and bringing their slip and slide

1233
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,400
and having their, bringing your pancake breakfast up there in the morning

1234
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,040
and sharing your nice guava melon, you know.

1235
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,320
Share your nice guava melon out there.

1236
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,080
The Paw Paw fire.

1237
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,940
Paw Paw is literally deep in the woods.

1238
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:10,760
It's in a ravine at the bottom of the woods and it's where we do our nightly drum fire.

1239
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,140
Our drum fire at Paw Paw is about the size of what you would expect a bonfire to be at

1240
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,580
many contemporary festivals.

1241
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:24,860
Then on Saturday night we do what I believe is one of the largest fires east of Burning Man.

1242
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:30,100
It's a, we've done this every year for the last 39 years.

1243
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,940
It actually began at the first Starwood as an accident.

1244
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:43,180
Where people gave us some brush and a fence to burn and we ended up creating this 40 foot bonfire with 80 foot flames.

1245
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,320
And we've been pretty much doing that again ever since.

1246
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:51,560
So if you're looking for something spectacular our Saturday night blow off is pretty spectacular.

1247
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,020
It's safety third.

1248
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,180
Well, hey the fire department's there.

1249
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:56,620
Don't worry.

1250
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,180
The fire department is actually there so it's safe.

1251
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:02,040
Starwood is a well monitored safe festival.

1252
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,940
But it's also a spectacular festival.

1253
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:04,500
It's a spectacular show.

1254
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,920
One of our other venues is called the Stone Circle.

1255
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:13,680
It's basically a ritual space where the stones are arranged to make a continuous calendar

1256
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:19,780
along the lines of the ancient druid calendar sun relationship.

1257
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:24,200
And we're going to be doing our all night alchemical fire there.

1258
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,420
The alchemical fire is pretty much what it sounds like.

1259
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:33,080
It's a transformational fire where you take the raw material of yourself and by morning

1260
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,120
have turned it into the gold that you truly are.

1261
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:41,240
And by the way I should mention that when you go online and check out the Starwood Festival

1262
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:46,460
to register for the Starwood Festival just because you're listening to this radio program

1263
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:52,500
you can use the promo code FREE capital letters F-R-E-E and get 10% off your ticket.

1264
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,480

1265
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:59,960
Arrive on Tuesday and stay until Monday or you can just arrive on Friday and stay until Monday.

1266
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,100
Don't we have that deal for the college students this year?

1267
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:06,860
Oh that's true. Thursday is college ID day and your free discount will count towards that as well.

1268
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,760
Yeah, you get the same amount that you pay for the weekend.

1269
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:14,640
You get an extra 24 hours free so you can get there at 4 o'clock on Thursday instead of showing up at 4 o'clock on Friday.

1270
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,720
Well that's a good deal.

1271
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,240
There is a web presence. It is StarwoodFestival.com.

1272
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,160
StarwoodFestival.com.

1273
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:24,980
StarwoodFestival.com.

1274
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:26,740
StarwoodFestival.com.

1275
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:32,080
However, off the public supported airways I can tell you to send $35.00 to the Starwood Festival.

1276
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:36,200
Or you will die on X day or something much, much worse.

1277
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:48,780
And if you already have become a subgenius minister, gotten that huge 25 piece membership kit with button and bumper stickers and minister's card and many frameable certificates and lots of dog's heads.

1278
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:58,060
You might not have the book of the subgenius or Neighbor World or even our world famous pamphlets over 100,000 sold.

1279
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,820
Well not Neighbor World, about 80 of those maybe.

1280
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,300
But come on man.

1281
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:04,820
A thing?

1282
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:14,540
For that matter there's fast clothing designs and drink wear with subgenius graphics on them and all manner of fine Dobbs wear and Dobbs gimmickry.

1283
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,320
Bob Daggetts and DVDs of movies.

1284
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,580
Good and bad ones.

1285
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,100
Mostly pretty good and very weird.

1286
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:28,560
And CDs of what we did before the radio shows and after like stage shows and such.

1287
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:36,520
Boy it's just an immense mess of keen and yet sacred collectibles, enjoyables and guilty pleasures.

1288
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,260
And the book of the subgenius is autographed when you get it from us.

1289
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,620
Not by Bob, no.

1290
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,240
Sorry.

1291
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,240
Just me.

1292
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:49,600
Philo and Sterno and Byron and Onan are all going to be here soon for that movie premiere.

1293
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,220
Though maybe I'll get them to sign the copies I have in stock.

1294
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:56,100
I won't let peas do it though.

1295
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,460
I better order those books.

1296
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:03,500
Anyway thank you friends and good night or good day or whatevs.

1297
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,700
Praise Bob.
