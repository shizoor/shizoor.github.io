1
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,720
What makes Bob holler?

2
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,340
What makes Bob holler?

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,260
When I asked Bob, he explained this way

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,300
And he said, well, when a little sweetie pie

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,840
In a misker twirls by

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,640
And rolls those big blue eyes

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,100
Oh, I holler

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,900
And when some pretty chick

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,080
Says she loves my fiddle legs

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,600
Well, now then, that can do the trick

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,980
Oh, I holler

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,360
The Self Genius Hour of Slack

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,580
Bob?

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,860
Well, I went on down

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,280
To the top of the hill

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,280


17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,740
To my girlfriend's shack

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,480
To see how they did hang

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,260
When I got there

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,080
Her cupboard was bare

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,780
I couldn't ignite a thing

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,800
There was no shard

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,460
No bone, no twig

24
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,440
I brought my comic book collection

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,480
Was about this big, yeah

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,060
Well, Frop Without Slack

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,220
Is like Slack without Frop

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,100
But where the hell else

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,720
Am I going to cop?

30
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,820
I found my dog food collection

31
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,280
About to go to sleep

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,360
About five o'clock

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,280
But all that food was stale

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,900
Thought I'd call that rip-off schmuck

35
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,720
Forgot he was in jail

36
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,400
Ended up killing a porcupine

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,020
Just to see if I could smoke his rhyme

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,940
Oh, Frop Without Slack

39
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,780
Is like Slack without Frop

40
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,840
But where the hell else

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,400
Am I going to cop?

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,320
Yeah, Frop Without Slack

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,280
Is like Slack without Frop

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,240
But where the hell else

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,780
Am I going to cop?

46
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,980
I just know that

47
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,240
This here trip ain't through

48
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,960
And fisses me off

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,860
And I can't keep myself

50
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,060
Staying one night

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,400
In my diffuse

52
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,020
Fрейette pare

53
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,440
I just gotta stay

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,340
Just stayin' with fear

55
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,880
There like never-ending

56
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,320
Trash МУЗЫКА

57
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,620
F先生 Disco

58
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,060
Slack, Slack, without FROP.

59
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,160
Don't cop from that guy there.

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,600
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,680
Oh, stay away from that.

62
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,380
Slack, Slack, without FROP.

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,800
Uh-huh.

64
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,080
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

65
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,640
No way.

66
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,320
No, no, no.

67
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,560
No, don't bother.

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,880
That was Reverend Bleepo Abernathy with...

69
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,360
FROP without Slack.

70
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,780
Thank you, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

71
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,020
In digital sound now.

72
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,760
But it'll be slightly different for those of you with lights of change.

73
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,560
This Saturday, August 12th.

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:05,860
About uncertainty.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,360
Blind Lemon Cleveland.

76
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,720
Chaz, can I ask you...

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,260
I'll see you there, young lady.

78
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,080
You've been bad, ain't you?

79
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,540
You've been bad?

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,820
You've been bad, little girl.

81
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,460
I'll see you there.

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,880
Bob will see you there.

83
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,900
He'll still be bad right there.

84
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,320
Little girl.

85
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,300
What's the Heisenpecker uncertainty?

86
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,000
Uh-huh.

87
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,760
Oh, yeah.

88
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,200
That's what I was going to ask.

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,760
I see you there.

90
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,580
I see you, young lady.

91
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,940
Young college student.

92
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,660
I'm in the vision.

93
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,340
I'm seeing her.

94
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,180
She's been bad.

95
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,540
And she wants to...

96
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,660
She doesn't want to be good, but she does want to be punished.

97
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,720
Oh, honey.

98
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,720
I've got a tongue lashing for you.

99
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,520
Oh, I've got some punishment.

100
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,480
You like it.

101
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,760
When you get what good?

102
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,660
We know what you're thinking.

103
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,680
The men don't know, but the little girls understand.

104
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,860
Praise Bob.

105
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,620
And the knees must be shaved.

106
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,520
Oh, yeah.

107
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,420
This is very, very, very...

108
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,760
Hey, you, them choir singers.

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,460
They know.

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,380
Brother, you bring your wife to church this Saturday night.

111
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
We don't make you.

112
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,980
This ain't the kind of church we have to get up at 7 o'clock on Sunday morning.

113
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,480
No, sir.

114
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,160
This ain't the kind of church where you come to our church.

115
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,060
You get drunk.

116
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,520
You drink beer.

117
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,960
You drink wine.

118
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,980
You drink mixed drinks.

119
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,000
You get drunk, buddy, at our church.

120
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,740
And you sleep well.

121
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:34,860
Late on Sunday morning, you pick up some creature and take it home and have intense physical love with that thing.

122
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,620
And then you wake up in the morning and you just deal with it.

123
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,780
But praise Bob, at least his promise rang true, Bob said.

124
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,380
Have intercourse with a beautiful live girl or anything else you want.

125
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,060
Does that go for that digital player right over there by your neck muscle?

126
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Ignore the digital device.

127
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,860
How about that reel-to-reel player over there?

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,780
The one we're going to give you in the next few hours, maybe not, maybe longer, maybe the next few years.

129
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,360
Do I have to say it again?

130
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,280
You can make love with appliances.

131
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,560
You can do what you're called for.

132
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,740
Anything you want.

133
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,540
Anything you need to do.

134
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,040
You can have long lives.

135
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,020
Bob loves you.

136
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,940
And he wants to feel you up.

137
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,800
Bob loves you.

138
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,280
He wants to shake your hand, mister.

139
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,200
And he'd like to shake your money maker, honey.

140
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,120
Bob's out there.

141
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,280
Bob's real.

142
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,520
Don't you doubt that.

143
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,580
And that stark fist of removal, it's real.

144
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,160
And it's going to remove us from the air right about now.

145
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,480
Bob is not the illegitimate son.

146
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,580
Michael Jackson, take it from me.

147
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,720
más

148
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:01,880
más

149
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,040
más

150
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,320
más

151
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,820
más

152
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,060
más

153
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,440
más

154
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,820
más

155
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,140
más

156
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,400
más

157
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,480
más

158
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,560
más

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:16,900
más

160
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,260
más

161
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
Why?

162
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,340
I get up in the rain

163
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,760
The sun has yet to rise

164
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,460
I shake the webs and clear my head

165
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,240
Put on my doggy

166
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,800
I get eyes

167
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,460
Brown boots and brown fields

168
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,860
Brown is all I see

169
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,460
But the red spot on my middle stick

170
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,980
Is all I really need

171
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,520
On my ride there's many sides

172
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,140
And the bandit's on my tail

173
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,060
Another target in the eyes

174
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,700
Of midnight's growing pale

175
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,720
Of midnight's growing pale

176
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,680
Of midnight's growing pale

177
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,140
From morning mist I rise

178
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,960
To help them greet the day

179
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,540
With little silver sunbeams

180
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,220
And little light

181
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,940
In for rays

182
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,220
I paint the house

183
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,700
I paint the dog

184
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,940
I paint the chicken coop

185
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,280
And when they come out

186
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,700
To see the show

187
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,160
I turn and paint them too

188
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,820
On my ride there's many sides

189
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,320
Bandit's on my tail

190
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,260
Another target in the eyes

191
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,920
Of midnight's growing pale

192
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,040
Of midnight's growing pale

193
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,080
Of midnight's growing pale

194
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:34,680
Of midnight's growing pale

195
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,200
They'll never know

196
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,700
They'll never see

197
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,360
Before the hit I'm gone

198
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,760
Back into the dragon's breath

199
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,220
To sing the twinkle of a star

200
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,000
To sing the dragon's song

201
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,660
Back home folks think what I do

202
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,160
I do to keep them free

203
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,080
And no one knows my secret

204
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,100
No one knows I fly for me

205
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,600
On my ride there's many sides

206
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,120
Bandit's on my tail

207
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,920
Another target in the eyes

208
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,560
Of midnight's growing pale

209
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,260
Of midnight's growing pale

210
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,640
Of midnight's growing pale

211
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,680
Of midnight's growing pale

212
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:42,280
Of midnight's growing pale

213
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,240
Of midnight's growing pale

214
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,580
On their percentile

215
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,400
On their percentile

216
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,040
It's me is what I'm worth

217
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,040


218
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,540
I'm the one who'll airplanes

219
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,320
On their scrolling

220
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,180
Suspects areUL

221
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,980
So why not

222
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,480
When they see their side

223
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,320
My bold 갈

224
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,540
And instruction my fates

225
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,260
Studios,defots,imports qui-

226
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,040
Ooh, midnight's growing.

227
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,000
Ooh, midnight's growing.

228
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,900
Ooh, midnight's growing.

229
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,580
Ooh.

230
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,600
Hey, who's on the line there?

231
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,320
I can hear the foam coming through the other side of the line.

232
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,560
Ida.

233
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,780
Ida who?

234
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,640
Ida, would you like to say something?

235
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,060
You'd like to say something?

236
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,840
Say it on.

237
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,160
Well, I just wanted to ask Stank.

238
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,740
Stank, okay, like if we sell our souls to the devil,

239
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,760
assuming we can't sell our souls, like our souls are our own possessions now.

240
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,020
As far as I know, the devil and Bob are the only ones who will actually pay for souls.

241
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,900
I have seen the devil in my microscope.

242
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,220
We can like buy our way out of hell.

243
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,720
Does the devil know you can buy that?

244
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,080
With that like extra $30,000.

245
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,060
You can only see it.

246
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,520
That's why the devil hates Bob.

247
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,140
Because Bob gives him money.

248
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,360
You can only see the money that Bob's getting.

249
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,760
Because our triple your money back guarantee.

250
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,060
I think it's a very long legal process you have to go through.

251
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,760
You have to go through an apostate court.

252
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,600
Signed and blood.

253
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,540
And then you have to stand naked in front of a large tribunal.

254
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,500
You know, it might scare you just the sheer size of it.

255
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,240
And so, you know, before you even get down to get your reparations and repayment,

256
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,340
before being sent to hell and you could buy your way out,

257
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,280
you'd have to sue.

258
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,880
In other words, you'd have to sue the devil.

259
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,940
Or, you know, not the devil in car.

260
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,820
Or the incarnate, but the concept of the devil.

261
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,440
Which I guess we all have to do on a daily basis.

262
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,060
That was actually the egg lady.

263
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,260
Thank you so much for that.

264
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,580
Actually, I was actually contemplating that thing this very day.

265
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,160
Buying your way back out of hell.

266
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,940
Yes, exactly.

267
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,920
Well, that's what they go to staying for, you know.

268
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,380
You see, but that's not the only thing that you can do.

269
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,540
You see, what you also have to do, if you are going to sell your soul to the devil,

270
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,840
which you should have a lawyer present when you sign that contract.

271
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,560
How are you going to sell your soul to the devil?

272
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,120
How are you going to sell your soul to the devil?

273
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,160
You have to find the devil.

274
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,480
You've got to look in your microscope.

275
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,660
You've got to look at your DNA.

276
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,920
The devil has a tiresome connection of genes.

277
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,760
You have to look at your DNA and then you see the devil.

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,440
You have to look at your DNA and then you see the devil.

279
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,140
And trace it back, right on back to your reptilian complex.

280
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,160


281
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,920
Horny little helixes.

282
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,900
Yeah, little lizards.

283
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,460
Snapping the heads off of other little lizards.

284
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,640
Little red capes.

285
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,540
My intention is to root out the devil.

286
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:36,860
My intention is to root out the devil.

287
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,120
Evolution is the devil, Chaz. You just said it.

288
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,020
In your most retarded, elucidated moment.

289
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
In your most retarded, elucidated moment.

290
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,920
What, evolution is the devil?

291
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,680
What, evolution is the devil?

292
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,420
Why, because it's survival of the fittest?

293
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:49,620


294
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,720
I mean, nature.

295
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,540
Is that somehow devilish?

296
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,460
That's natural law.

297
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,240
Is natural law evil?

298
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,340
Whoever leaves more offspring survives?

299
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:01,900


300
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,920
That's evil? That's the devil?

301
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,300
There is no life without death.

302
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,260
There is no pleasure without pain.

303
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,280
How can that be?

304
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,740
There's no pickle spears without

305
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,780
mounds of potatoes out.

306
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,960
I can't see a world in such opposition.

307
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,000
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

308
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
You're right.

309
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,780
Right hemisphere, wrong planet.

310
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,400
Right hemisphere, wrong planet.

311
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,480
Susie the floozy said.

312
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,260
And that pretty much sums it up.

313
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,040
Let's play devil's advocate here.

314
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,820
No pun intended.

315
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,460
You're C-B-4, you're an object figure.

316
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:40,640
But if the devil was DNA and evolution and natural selection, what then would God be?

317
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,840
Yeah, some never-ending state of sameness would somehow maybe reflect a differentness without moving or something.

318
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,340
Stasis.

319
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,580
Stasisism.

320
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,800
Then we must all be Luciferians because we worship the light and quick movement.

321
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,180
Well, I see that's all right.

322
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,600
You can't go talking about, you can't go saying,

323
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,440
well, I know about what God's gonna think about that.

324
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,500
I know about God,

325
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,680
because I know God real well.

326
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,100
I know what he'd think about that.

327
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,940
And he'd agree with me, not you.

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,820
Well, maybe God was before the Big Bang.

329
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,700
The moment before the Big Bang.

330
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,920
That infinitely eternal moment before the Big Bang.

331
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,480
Like that was God.

332
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,640
And then the devil took over when the Big Bang.

333
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,340
So the Big Bang was the devil.

334
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,080
Now, there's many who subscribe to that particular.

335
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,120
The Big Bang was the devil?

336
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay, how many of our, like, prophets?

337
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,580
And the Big Bang was the beginning of civilization.

338
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,580
Satan.

339
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,200
That's right.

340
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,000
And the beginning of all, you know, 15 billion years.

341
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,980
We are the legacy of 15 billion years of evolution.

342
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,100
Satan owns this world!

343
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,080
Well, think of all those prophets all the way from Enosh down to Enoch.

344
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,000
So that means then we are the devil.

345
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,180
Any atomic vibration slower than light is satanic.

346
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,320
If you wanna talk about moral objectives and where do we go in our classrooms and how many times can we go there, you know?

347
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,220
But then what is...

348
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,320
Think of like Moses being bent over a log and being, you know, burned to death.

349
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,880
But then what is love then?

350
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,300
But then what is love then?

351
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,580
The death of Satan.

352
00:15:59,580 --> 00:15:59,580


353
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
What is love in the universe?

354
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,880
I think love is gravity.

355
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,980
It's a mild form of hatred.

356
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,580
I think love is just gravity.

357
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,700
You know, gravity makes the earth goes around the sun.

358
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,180
That means the earth loves the sun.

359
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,320
Gravity is a mild form of hatred.

360
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,720
Yeah.

361
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,560
Well, I used to do art. Lots of weird shit.

362
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,600
But I gave it all up.

363
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,120
Cause it was too much work.

364
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,740
And it didn't pay.

365
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,500
And it was really just a big pit in the ass.

366
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,540
Anyway.

367
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,000
Anyway.

368
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,680
Anyway.

369
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,200
Anyway.

370
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,580


371
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,580


372
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,580


373
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,580


374
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,580


375
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,580


376
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,800
Anyway.

377
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,580
What the fuck?

378
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,040
What the fuck?

379
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,960
What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?

380
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,080
So now I ski

381
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,820
And watch TV

382
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,620
Cause that's a lot more fun

383
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,820
And relaxing

384
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,000
And it's what I really want to do with my time

385
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,740
Art gets old

386
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,180
When no one pays you

387
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,660
Or even understands

388
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,000
So what's the point?

389
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,500
Unless I was going to do it

390
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,440
Just for me

391
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,140
But to tell you the truth

392
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,560
I'd really rather just ski

393
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,820
And watch TV

394
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,740
Cause that's what's a lot more fun for me

395
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,280
And I might as well have fun

396
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,380
Cause that's what life's for, you know

397
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,740
Rap for all the gusto and all that

398
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,140
And I'm alive now

399
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,940
But someday

400
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,820
I'll have to die

401
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,780
And then

402
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,160
I'll be dead

403
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,100
For a long time

404
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,480
For a long, long time

405
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,320
For a long, long, long, long time

406
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,820
For a fucking forever in fact

407
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,920
So I might as well ski

408
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,480
And watch TV

409
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,720
Now while I have the chance

410
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Don't have time to waste on art

411
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,220
And I'm sick of torturing myself

412
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,740
And of wondering if it's done yet

413
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,660
And I'm sick of

414
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,260
Hanging out with all those lazy flakes

415
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,760
Who think they're so smart

416
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,940
And now that I'm free of them

417
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,820
I might as well just listen

418
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,600
To the music that I grew up with

419
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,140
That's the only music that ever really moved me

420
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,580
That new stuff's just gone

421
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,260
Just a trend, it's not real

422
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,580
And now

423
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,880
I can get all those old great songs again

424
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,120
On CD

425
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,720
And then

426
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
I can download them all again

427
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,860
On MP3

428
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,240
Cause that's the ultimate technology

429
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,680
Can you see?

430
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,400
Oh I'm so glad to be alive

431
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,260
In this modern age

432
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,120
So much so that

433
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,920
I really don't wanna die

434
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,640
But there's not a whole lot

435
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,620
I can do about that now

436
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,220
So I'm gonna go to the church

437
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,460
And pay my $30 to the church of the subgenius

438
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,760
And eat more vegetables

439
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,560
And I think I better marry my girlfriend

440
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,600
Because it's such a risk nowadays

441
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Even though I'm not one of those people

442
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,180
So I'm probably safe

443
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,480
But you can never be too sure

444
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,440
And so we'll marry

445
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
So we can ski

446
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,900
And watch TV together

447
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,000
And feel free and happy

448
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,740
Without having to worry about art

449
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,080
What a pain

450
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,500
Glad I'm through with all that shit

451
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
But now I've got all

452
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,660
That I could ever really reasonably

453
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,700
Expect to ever get out of life

454
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,300
Anyway

455
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,580
Anyway

456
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,360
Anyway

457
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,960
Anyway

458
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,460
What the fuck

459
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,060
What the fuck

460
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,560
What the fuck

461
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,060
What the fuck

462
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,960
What the fuck

463
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,280
What the fuck

464
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,580
Anyway

465
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,620
Anyway

466
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:00,580
Anyway

467
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:02,960
Anyway

468
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:03,760
Anyway

469
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,220
Anyway

470
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:22,460
Anyway

471
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:27,840
Anyway

472
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:27,860
Anyway

473
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:27,880
Anyway

474
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:27,900
Anyway

475
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:27,920
Anyway

476
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:27,940
Anyway

477
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:27,960
Anyway

478
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:27,980
Anyway

479
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,000
Anyway

480
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,380
Fuck, am I so pissed off right now?

481
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,540
Why?

482
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,180
I'll tell you why.

483
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,300
Because I've been reading that book for years.

484
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,340
And I've been reading and not intentionally memorizing, but absorbing the word of Bob.

485
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:52,920
And for a decade and a half, I had completely ignored that one line in all things.

486
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,660
Slack must come first.

487
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,860
And that is why I am so motherfucking pissed off right now.

488
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:07,520
I am pissed off for ignoring the plain and obvious truth that Bob has presented to us.

489
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,700
But if Slack must come first, then why am I still pissed off about it?

490
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,980
Well, it's very simple, friends.

491
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:24,140
Whenever I find myself starting to get pissed off, I ask myself, is there Slack to be had?

492
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,300
And is there Slack to be had in being pissed off?

493
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,120
Well, dear friends, BRAVE FUCKING BOB, I AM PISSED OFF.

494
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:51,440
You know an effort by my attractin' friend didn't even hurt the guy's reputation.

495
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,920
That's why I am so freaking pissed off.

496
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,380
But one day, I'll get an answer, and I'll translate it to me in full.

497
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,480
Will you polls up or swap me for a lower ability?

498
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,480


499
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,740
You're the 추igan to every crush on You hammering German boys, too.

500
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,100
So take a deep breath, and don't hesitate.

501
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,100

No more goddamn

God, Bob, Buddha, Jesus on a pogo stick,

rabbis, Robertson, popes, hell popes,

No more $40 gourmet

Italian restaurant meals that taste like

543
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,740
they were eaten once before they ladled it onto your

544
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,320
plate. Boom!

545
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,880
No more turd-gobbling, piss-spraying

shit themselves. Boom!

549
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,700
And speaking of twitching and

550
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,540
shitting yourself, no more craptastic

551
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,320

556

Boom!

557

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,280
tax-diddlers, former bouncers who think they're

562
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
platinum turds, finger-sniffers

563
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,220
finger-sniffers or foaming hysterical

564
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,260
pontificators with dingleberry-bedeck fruity

565
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,320
pink hats writing shitty, sputtering little

566
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,080
PCs to the mental health of others. Boom!

567
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,840
Boom!

568
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,040
Boom!

569
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,600
No more ball-twisting student loans,

570
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,700
ovary-rotting junk mail, or

571
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,220
triple goddamn fucking Ed McMahon.

572
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,580
Oh, may I have another? Yes, you may,

573
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,600
you flatulent Tim Breckham. You can have one

574
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,560
nuke after another until they can see your

575
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,060
ass blowing from Bluto. Boom!

576
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,740
Boom!

577
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,480
No more enraging

578
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,460
emails from commercial e-rapists telling

579
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,540
me about how they're gonna make me rich.

580
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,260
Fuck that! Nuke them!

581
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,380
Boom!

582
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,240
And no more Duke Nukem. In fact, triple

583
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,380
goddamn Duke Nukem because I paid six dollars

584
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,280
for a plastic octobrine and the goddamn fucking

585
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,460
tentacles fell off within the first week. Nuke them

586
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,420
twice! Boom!

587
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,760
You all sicken me.

588
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,060
You jest about killing the normals, but I

589
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,260
wanna nuke the Super Bowl and stack the skulls

590
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,840
into a new tower of babbles so high

591
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,920
I can climb to the top and scream at God

592
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,100
for his shitty handiwork.

593
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,020
How dare he create us

594
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,040
and then hinge us in the middle so we have to go

595
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,960
through life bent over just waiting for the next big

596
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,580
butt missile.

597
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,820
If it weren't for that mole

598
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,900
masturbator Jim Baker getting a load of

599
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,000
karma right up his duchess, I'd wanna shoot

600
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,780
the Almighty up his eternal sphincter with a

601
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,140
a cobalt 40s impository.

602
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,420
Boom!

603
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,060
Now, some mewling skanks

604
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,400
will probably blanch in horror

605
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,220
at my proposal.

606
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,640
These pathetic pansies

607
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,800
see life as a precious gift

608
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,420
instead of the planetary skin disease

609
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,520
most of it represents.

610
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,980
They think I'd like people better

611
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,020
and couldn't bear to shoot them

612
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,400
in their drooling sucker-rim faces

613
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,920
if I got a glimpse of a snapshot

614
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,340
featuring their wretched offspring

615
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,400
and pooting grannies.

616
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,640
Bah!

617
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,440
Guess what?

618
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:03,920
Boom!

619
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,480
Yeah!

620
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,320
If I got to know them personally

621
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,060
I'd have to fend off their nasty breath

622
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,280
listen to their interminable droning stories

623
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,300
and scratch the rashes

624
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,200
that inevitably develop

625
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,300
when I'm exposed to their

626
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,800
violently offensive normalcy.

627
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,940
I don't care.

628
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,240
I say nuke them

629
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,480
until even the goddamn roaches

630
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,500
turn to one another and say

631
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,760
Maya, it's certainly hot in here

632
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,380
isn't it Chauncey?

633
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:24,700
Boom!

634
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,640
Go nukes!

635
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,680
I'm not gonna be happy

636
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,560
until they're flying around

637
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,920
like goddamn gnats in a rainforest.

638
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,940
Never mind, fuck you.

639
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,800
I say nuke you

640
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,340
and stop wasting your tick-picking time

641
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,400
with mere insults and guns.

642
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,260
I want to see nukes a-poppin'

643
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,900
in numbers that rival

644
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,560
the number of times

645
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,640
Richard Simmons has played

646
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,280
Rump Rangers of the Old Wild West

647
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,240
with every bodybuilder

648
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,060
in the tri-state area

649
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,300
who fell asleep on the bench.

650
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:46,620
Boom!

651
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,100
Boom!

652
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,500
Boom!

653
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,080
Boom!

654
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:48,960
Boom!

655
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,080


656
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,200


657
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,260


658
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,400
Boom!

659
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:49,420
Boom!

660
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,760
Go nukes!

661
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,820
And go speed racer

662
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,640
but don't go country

663
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,680
at least have a little reserve.

664
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,520
Goddamn you.

665
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,180
I'm just kidding.

666
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,220
Oh no I'm not!

667
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,980
A goddamn cock ripping,

668
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,680
blood dripping,

669
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,600
baby on a spit,

670
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,220
gobble shit,

671
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,820
tit splitting,

672
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,680
leech hurling,

673
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,840
colon twirling,

674
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,700
eyeball puncturing,

675
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,120
old church lady punching,

676
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,760
bone spitting,

677
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,020
scattering,

678
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,100
soul splattering,

679
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,060
cat sodomizing,

680
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,780
poodle clubbing,

681
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,440
fuck to you all!

682
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,820
Except for Friday,

683
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,160
Susie and Sister Decadence.

684
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,320
Hi.

690
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,440
prototype in the backyard

691
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,220
and use it to nuke

692
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,580
all of your goddamn asses

693
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,180

694
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,340
Praise Bob!

00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,740
Before the before life

735
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,800
He was my special friend

736
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,860
Always watching out for me

737
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,180
And he'll be there waiting

738
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,560
After my living end

739
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,160
So I'll get into eternity

740
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,060
Believe in Bob

741
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,780

743
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,080
Into my heart he stole

He's the man who sold

756
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,880
my soul

757
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,320
He's the one who made me whole

758
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,740
He explained my cosmic role

759
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,280
He's the man who sold my soul

760
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,740
Yes, dear friends,

761
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,000
the man who sold my soul,

762
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,720
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

763
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
That song was done by

764
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,060
St. Kenneth,

765
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,560
Hughie,

766
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,880
and Reverend Bunny Boy.

767
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,940
Friends,

768
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,660
and before that,

769
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,980
we heard some preaching

770
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,120
from XXX Day

771
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,080
with Einstein's

772
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,740
Secret Orchestra

773
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,960
in the background.

774
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,080
And that song about

775
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,500
on your grave

776
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,280
in the fog

777
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,820
and the dew

778
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,520
was Rudy Schwartz Project.

779
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,100
We heard Hell Pope Hughie

780
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,720
doing that boom rant

781
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,660
and the November 22nd

782
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,160
Kennedy assassination thing

783
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
was by Pope S. Lilith

784
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,120
who also did

785
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,120
that pissed off rant.

786
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,520
And anyway,

787
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,160
I'm not going to say

788
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,160


789
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,160


790
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,160


791
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,120
that this is a good song

792
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,100
but it was

793
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,660
Little Theodore

794
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,100
and

795
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,140
Midnight Growing Pale

796
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,500
if you didn't figure that out

797
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,080
was by Einstein's

798
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,980
Secret Orchestra.

799
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,920
In the background,

800
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,740
we are hearing

801
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,340
Electro Slat Treatment

802
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,640
by Lamprey Systems

803
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,220
and we're about to hear

804
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,700
some Jehovah Hates Fred

805
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,580
and some more

806
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,680
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

807
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,960
So hang on, friends.

808
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,600
In fact,

809
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,580
I know you're going to hang on

810
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,560
because you have to

811
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,780
because you love

812
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,460
Bob.

813
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:41,740
Hey!

814
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,780
Keep those mutilated cattle rolling.

815
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,080
Here comes 9 billion,

816
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,580
200 billion more Zarkons

817
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,780
for the alien empire.

818
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,680
And why they call them doggies?

819
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,340
They're not doggies.

820
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,620
That's a cow, man.

821
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,720
It's a maca.

822
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,360
Up that saucer rant

823
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,520
for Bobbies.

824
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,240
Right up.

825
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,560
That's not a slaughterhouse door.

826
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,760
It's a saucer rant.

827
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,920
Throw them in that saucer.

828
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,460
That's it.

829
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,260
Thanks for the money.

830
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,200
Praise Bob.

831
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,780
Praise Bob.

832
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,060
So you think

833
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,700
you've discovered

834
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,000
the final secret, do you?

835
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,640
We've been good.

836
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,780
I think you've got

837
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,080
all the answers solved

838
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,140
and all the questions

839
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,020
well posed.

840
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,300
Now, by the time

841
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,340
you pick yourself up

842
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,500
from that basement floor

843
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,600
and you screw the light bulb

844
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,340
back in your head

845
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:39,940
while you belong,

846
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,460
it won't be long

847
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,540
before you understand

848
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,660
you've been mistaken.

849
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,720
I'm kind of a rattlesnake

850
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,300
picking,

851
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,240
kicking,

852
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:47,780
scratching,

853
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,680
cactus wiping,

854
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,260
old Brandon Iron

855
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,140
chuck wagon feller.

856
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,520
I'm kind of a Marlboro man,

857
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,360
I just say,

858
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,180
and I like to boss

859
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,960
them little weaklings

860
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,920
and sissies

861
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,060
and city boys around.

862
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,200
That's me.

863
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,620
I'm a subgenius minister

864
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,760
and I've got a whole flock

865
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,700
of dumbass Bobbies

866
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,660
that do anything.

867
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,280
I say,

868
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:11,980
and you know what?

869
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,580
You could do the same thing.

870
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,260
You're buddies with Bob.

871
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,220
Now, all it takes me

872
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,080
buddies with Bob

873
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,680
is just that membership

874
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,620
to his friends

875
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,320
to join up.

876
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,740
Church of the Subgenius.

877
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,780
Praise Bob.

878
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,400
It won't go.

879
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,460
It won't go.

880
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:37,840
So much.

881
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,060
Much for American made products.

882
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,260
This, this,

883
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,160
there was an advertisement

884
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,140
for moon pants

885
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,540
that made cow sound

886
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,100
and when you press it,

887
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,740
it makes

888
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,160
the appropriate cow sound.

889
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,320
It's ladies night here

890
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,160
down at the farm.

891
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,060
Don't ask too many questions.

892
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,860
The moonlight is

893
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,300
twanging over the post hill.

894
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,960
Tom and Marvin,

895
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,440
Maria and Slim,

896
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,960
all the rest of the people

897
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,700
down at the Double Z,

898
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,300
all taking a nap.

899
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:13,960
Chickens,

900
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,480
cows,

901
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,080
the beefalo,

902
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,540
the mighty pig,

903
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,420
have all decided

904
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,940
to throw a party

905
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,020
for yours truly.

906
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,960
And nothing's truer

907
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,580
than this.

908
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,720
Let me tell you

909
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,620
a tale

910
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,540
of the old Spanish trail.

911
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,560
She and I

912
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,540
She was a puerca

913
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,200
si pasera

914
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,860
down the old Spanish trail.

915
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,860
It's easy, little pig,

916
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,300
but I love her so much.

917
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,760
She and I

918
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,880
She wore red shoes.

919
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,240
Everybody said

920
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,740
she would make

921
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,560
very good jamón,

922
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,620
but I think maybe

923
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,920
we're gonna fall in love

924
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,280
sometime.

925
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,140
So we talked

926
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,820
of a June honeymoon

927
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,700
on the old Spanish trail.

928
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, yeah.

929
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,680
But then I started

930
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,000
getting a little bit hungrier

931
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,340
and we're still about

932
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,520
four hours from the museum.

933
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,400
Ah, slack.

934
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:06,800
Because that's where

935
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,480
we gotta go

936
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,680
because that's the nearest place

937
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,480
to the end of the year.

938
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:09,660
Slack.

939
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,500
Ah, yes,

940
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,180
dear friends.

941
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,660
Einstein's

942
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,440
Secret Orchestra

943
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,620
on the radio.

944
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,580
ESO's

945
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,700
Swamp Radio.

946
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,420
Broadcast originally

947
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,500
from WCSB

948
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,780
in Cleveland.

949
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,680
New home

950
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,740
of the hour of slack.

951
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,040
Though not of

952
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,940
the church

953
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,340
of the subgenius

954
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,420
which is still at

955
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,780
Cleveland Heights,

956
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,600
Ohio.

957
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,340
Where you

958
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,580
can learn more

959
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,720
about the Bible.

960
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,480
The Bible.

961
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,360
If you will just write

962
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,500
to the number I'm about to give

963
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,920
for free information

964
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,380
that's

965
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:44,900

966
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,480

www.subgenius.org

982
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,700
Well, it was like

983
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,080
a cheap psychedelic

984
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,960
Martha日

985
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,320
Chess

986
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,640
There were

987
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,040
68

988
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,780
street

989
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,200
world

990
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,680
street

991
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,480
place

992
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:38,640
your

993
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,260
by

994
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:39,780
town

995
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,460
walk through that airlock right now.

996
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,820
What would he think?

997
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,920
He should display his image,

998
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,220
his graven image,

999
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,600
like some of that

1000
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,180
volatilist statue

1001
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,140
with the worshippers

1002
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,680
raining down the fort.

1003
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,780
Bob would say,

1004
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,860
hell no, what's wrong with you people?

1005
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,040
You're acting like a bunch of

1006
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,860
religious nuts.

1007
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,160
What are you doing in this room,

1008
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,320
though?

1009
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,580
You should be out there

1010
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,020
running through that field

1011
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:05,840
partying.

1012
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,120
Live it up.

1013
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,800
Hell, this is Starwood, baby.

1014
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,140
Maybe the world ends tomorrow

1015
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,300
and you may die.

1016
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,740
You should be

1017
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,760
doing whatever the hell

1018
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,240
you would be doing

1019
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,720
if tomorrow was the last day on Earth

1020
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,520
or if you had all the time

1021
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,680
in the world.

1022
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,160
That's what old Bobby

1023
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,100
likes you to do.

1024
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,140
Either live life just as if

1025
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,780
this was the last day of it

1026
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,880
or as if it was never,

1027
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,780
ever going to end

1028
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,480
because if you go to threaten,

1029
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,820
who knows if it was

1030
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,200
the great,

1031
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,100
or great forefather,

1032
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,440
Ken Kesey

1033
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,660
of the Mary Planksters

1034
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,180
who said,

1035
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,240
the only sin

1036
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,180
is fretting.

1037
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,800
Ah, yes.

1038
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,400
The only sin

1039
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,260
is fretting.

1040
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:56,740
And of course,

1041
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,100
it's hard not to fret

1042
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,160
and worry in this

1043
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,520
miserable world.

1044
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,260
Well, it ain't so miserable,

1045
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:03,760
actually,

1046
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,820
if you quit reading

1047
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,580
the newspaper.

1048
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,080
That's what I did, friends.

1049
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,300
It's strange,

1050
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,140
as you may see.

1051
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,600
There was a time

1052
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,680
not even a year ago

1053
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,840
that I was a news junkie

1054
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,160
just like so many others.

1055
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:17,960
I kept reading

1056
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,640
and reading every bit

1057
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,280
of the newspaper

1058
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,300
from the back.

1059
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,340
Even the obituaries

1060
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,040
where I was starting

1061
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,460
to see my friends' names.

1062
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,480
And friends,

1063
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,340
I quit.

1064
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,220
I quit reading the news.

1065
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,520
It's been a year since

1066
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,180
I've seen it.

1067
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,240
I don't know why.

1068
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,160
There'll be some news

1069
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,860
on the TV

1070
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,100
or some newspaper headline.

1071
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,580
And by God,

1072
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,060
it's exactly the same

1073
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,720
as it was the month before.

1074
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,580
And it's the same

1075
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,000
as it was a year before.

1076
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,320
And it's always

1077
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,340
the same damn game.

1078
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,100
Keeping you distracted

1079
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,400
from your own business.

1080
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,340
God Almighty,

1081
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,480
just listen to my friends.

1082
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,040
There's enough bad news

1083
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,160
to fill a whole life line.

1084
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,580
So I decided

1085
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,120
I can't do a goddamn thing

1086
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,460
about all those poor,

1087
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,200
wretched people

1088
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,180
in those countries

1089
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:07,820
starving,

1090
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:08,560
fighting,

1091
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,500
or the poor,

1092
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,200
wretched people

1093
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,320
in my own country.

1094
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,900
There's nothing I can do

1095
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,340
immediately

1096
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,820
except to keep

1097
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,860
my own sanity

1098
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,960
and keep my handle

1099
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,800
on some slack.

1100
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,780
Because friends,

1101
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,560
if you don't have slack,

1102
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,800
you sure as hell

1103
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,020
cannot share it.

1104
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,380
And once you do have slack,

1105
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,820
you've got enough

1106
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,620
to go around

1107
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,920
because there's no end

1108
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,000
to real slack.

1109
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,740
Real slack, friends.

1110
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,660
But once again,

1111
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,560
this ain't no religion.

1112
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,360
It's not even

1113
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,560
giving you the slightest

1114
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:38,780
chance to get

1115
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,060
a message of a hint

1116
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,880
as to what real slack

1117
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,860
might mean to you.

1118
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,340
Because it's up to you.

1119
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,520
It's always going to be

1120
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,480
a deal between you

1121
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,420
and J.R. Bob Dobbs

1122
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,600
or Connie Dobbs

1123
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,660
if that's who you talk to

1124
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,460
late at night.

1125
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,320
You know,

1126
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,840
we all do it.

1127
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,900
Either Bob or Connie,

1128
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,820
you've got to serve somebody.

1129
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,760
Ah, yes.

1130
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,940
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1131
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,920
Or your pet dog,

1132
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,540
Rover.

1133
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
Ah, yes.

1134
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,980
Ah, yes.

1135
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:08,780
Ah, yes.

1136
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:08,780


1137
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:38,780
Ah, yes.

1138
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,480
Ah, yes.

1139
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,920
Ah, yes.

1140
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,440
Ah, yes.

1141
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,000
Ah, yes.

1142
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,440
Ah, yes.

1143
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,700
Bidding starts at a quarter.

1144
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,640
Yeah, bidding starts at a quarter.

1145
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,440
A mere quarter.

1146
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,300
Do I hear a quarter?

1147
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,060
Do I hear a quarter?

1148
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,920
We got a quarter.

1149
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,160
What's your song, sir?

1150
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,160
What's my song?

1151
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,180
What's your word?

1152
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:03,700
Give me a word.

1153
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,380
Give me a word.

1154
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,380
Just a word?

1155
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,140
Just a word.

1156
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,560
Any word.

1157
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:07,940
Sausage.

1158
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,780
Sausage.

1159
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,240
Sausage.

1160
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,380
Lord, I love my sausage.

1161
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,300
It's brown and fatty.

1162
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,520
Unsung, like some guy named Matty two years ago who we had the misfortune to meet.

1163
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,740
Matty liked sausage and Matty liked a lot of other things.

1164
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,000
And he also liked to make trouble.

1165
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,140
Well, he often talked about his sausage to anyone who'd give him a chance to listen.

1166
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:53,300
And then Matty took out his sausage, started waving it around, got down with the ground.

1167
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,400
But he was a jerk.

1168
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,980
He just waved at them.

1169
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,540
And then he said,

1170
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:08,880
That nasty brown sausage had put him in a swing.

1171
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,000
Didn't like the way that he acted.

1172
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,240
Always asking questions.

1173
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,880
Such as, you know, you guys aren't really all that abnormal.

1174
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,000
You some genius.

1175
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,800
Aw, you guys do.

1176
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,200
Nothing but sit around.

1177
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,120
Then he whipped out his sausage.

1178
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,520
Woo-hoo!

1179
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,140
And we pummeled him to the ground.

1180
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:47,720
But, Matty, where have you gone?

1181
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,300
Where have you gone?

1182
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,280
Far away.

1183
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,080
Now my song is gone.

1184
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,160
Thank you.

1185
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,380
That was Sausage.

1186
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,780
Rum this is strange too.

1187
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,960
Just know that if I sweetshad it out, then you'd even like it here.

1188
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,300
No, not nice.

1189
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,040
The regular sacrificer won't come out of what he split his start.

1190
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,540
I think it looks just normal.

1191
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,200
Not everything goes as he pleases.

1192
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,040
I'm an industry snitch like you.

1193
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,120
lit

1194
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,220
What?

1195
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,160
CRUNCH!

1196
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,320
Suddenly a haze descended over the crowd

1197
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,680
And they could feel the pee-pees between their knees

1198
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,100
But they could not convert it to the necessary juices

1199
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,620
With which to transport themselves away

1200
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,180
The day unfolds from lamp-lit steams

1201
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,080
The asphalt shimmers like blackened streams

1202
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:39,600
And all about I feel and smell and sense your presence near

1203
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:45,660
The lines have drawn the wrong direction and I am aware

1204
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,600
No words are needed

1205
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:47,600


1206
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,700
No words in books here

1207
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,120
Have a look there's something in the air

1208
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,500
And measurements of time

1209
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:59,840
Crumble and climb for Jaguar, Knight and White

1210
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,140
Yeah!

1211
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,540
Living in jungles of radio waves

1212
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:21,080
Never now or ever or yesterday

1213
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,260
And just now in the road

1214
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,300
The wind becomes cold

1215
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:34,040
For Jaguar, Knight and White dear

1216
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:38,280
No words in books here

1217
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,720
Have a look there's something in the air

1218
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,060
And measurements of time

1219
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,600
Crumble and climb for Jaguar, Knight and White dear

1220
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:47,920
No words in books here

1221
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,340
Crumble and climb for Jaguar, Knight and White dear

1222
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,160
Here's a little tango

1223
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,460
I can't see you do tango

1224
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,820
Well, not yet.

1225
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,400
Living in jungles of radio waves

1226
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,740
I never, now, no never, no yesterday

1227
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,420
And just now in the air

1228
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,560
Where black becomes clear

1229
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,320
For jaguar, knife and white deer

1230
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,620
In the woods in Buccia

1231
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:56,200
I will look for something in the air

1232
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,520
And measurements of time

1233
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,000
Are grumbling and clang

1234
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,820
For jaguar, knife and white deer

1235
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,500
What's to be seen

1236
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,380
Just a space

1237
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:28,380


1238
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:28,380


1239
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:28,380


1240
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:28,400
To get to the dark

1241
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,400


1242
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,400


1243
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,400


1244
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,400


1245
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,400


1246
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,400


1247
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,400


1248
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,440
Oh, no

1249
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,100
Oh, no

1250
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,700
Awoo

1251
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:33,700


1252
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,960
Take a rappin'

1253
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,400
・・・・・・ural

1254
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1255
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,420
On to explain

1256
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,920
Isn't that right

1257
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,140
Nice and white, yeah

1258
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,100
4J Wild Night

1259
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:40,900
Thank you!
