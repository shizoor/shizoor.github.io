1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:11,600
Yes I vow, ere this night this way, you will drink the black sperm of my vengeance.

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,500
Here's Buck Owens.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,840
Hello! Hello! Hello!

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:25,960


5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,060
Hello! Hello! Hello!

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,680
Hello! Hello! Hello!

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,520
Hello! Hello! Hello!

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:47,620
Where we are now, it's a dangerous, here we are now, and dangerous.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,320
Ah!

10
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,380
I know I didn't need that second barrel, but who counts birdshot in a man's chest?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,980
Rock and roll is dead. Long live rock and roll.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,480
Rock and roll is dead.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,420
There was no accident.

14
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:23,320
My efforts to expose them have been discovered, so I, the hunter, become the hunted.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,940
All my adult life, through four presidents, has been spent in a twilight world of COVID.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,940
I have been a victim of the over intelligence of my country.

17
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,780
They are the moles who cannot come in from the cold.

18
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,980
We call ourselves the 39 steps of fanciful code name.

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,220
Our assignment, neutralize the three pied pipers of rock music.

20
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,000
Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix.

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,940
Okay. What are your plans for the future and the new experience?

22
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,260
Well, we're going to make our music into a religion, which it already is anyway.

23
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,200
Only solidify it, you know, to that.

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,620
And really, for us to play outside more, you know.

25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,780
People don't realize that music has so much to do with what's happening today, you know.

26
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,800
And you're not going to stop the music.

27
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,780
When I say you, though, I mean, you know, whoever is listening through the microphone there.

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,500
I can say you.

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,500
Got it.

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,500
The youth in this country and their idols are an incredible power block.

31
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,460
Musicians, artists, campus radicals.

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,280
They listen to voices.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,200
These voices must be stilled.

34
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,240
And we'll use anything.

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,620
Internal revenue, infiltration, wiretaps, street walkers if you need.

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,680
We're well funded.

37
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,620
Hello. I'm Bill Kreutz.

38
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,580
Hi, I'm Jimmy.

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,720
It's such a thrill to meet you, Mr. Hendricks.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Girls, are you ready?

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,340
Sure.

42
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,180
This is Deborah.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:02,920
Hello.

44
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,120
And this is Cindy.

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,700
And a pleasure to meet you.

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,240
All right. Shall we get into position, girls?

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,600
Let's have a little skin now.

48
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,660
I can keep you there maybe all time.

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,580
What kind of position is it you have in mind?

50
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,040
Well, Mr. Hendricks, do you think you could take your jacket off and your shoes?

51
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,480
We've got to get in a tropical mood, you see.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,220
Well, it's not that I don't want to get undressed.

53
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,340
It's just that...

54
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,980
I think I'm going to be buried in this jacket.

55
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,900
Oh.

56
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,120
Lend an ear, voodoo child.

57
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,180
Who counts birdshot in a dead man's chest?

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,520
You don't want to hear about napalm.

59
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,800
You just want to rock.

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,140
Lend an ear, voodoo child.

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,040
And now, the Soap Genius.

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,500
Our Soap Genius.

63
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,260
We'll blow a hole in your shorts.

64
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,580
When we said reality will never be the same,

65
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,100
we weren't kidding.

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,020
What's this button?

67
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,080
Escape.

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,120
Yeah, well, that's in case things get a little intense.

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,660
It's kind of like an eject button.

70
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,860
Things can get a little squirrely, you know.

71
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,040
It's reality driven by...

72
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,200
Then there's no escape.

73
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,980
Look, man, I'm warning you.

74
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,340
I saw this kind of thing in the 60s.

75
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,900
You could go insane.

76
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,140
Or worse.

77
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,420
I'm worse than one.

78
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,240
I do best before the skiff.

79
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,140
I think best.

80
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,840
I'm in a rush.

81
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,480
Worst Coach Att entrepreneur.

82
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,780
When you'vekaped your order on

83
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:06,780


84
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,760
menstrual period?

85
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,760
Yeah, you have a

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,160
Just as many things as I should.

87
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,480
How's the blood sugar level?

88
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,020
Gray-faced guys keep showing up at concerts.

89
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,820
I could stuff him with a pillow.

90
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,740
No, he must go the way he's expected to go.

91
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,180
Look, I've got a blade.

92
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,480
I could open up a lung.

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,740
That's right, he's got that choke on it.

94
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,160
When the music's over

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,840
Turn up the lights

96
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,600
Turn up the lights

97
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,680
Turn up the lights

98
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,040
Turn up the lights

99
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:03,120
If you look in the back there, you see I don't have a rug on the floor.

100
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,380
I got linoleum.

101
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,140
That's for puke from people like you.

102
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:07,920
Yeah.

103
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,980
You two have a very abstract thing going here.

104
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,420
What is the nature of the accident?

105
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,540
It's not an accident.

106
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,540
My God, he's dying.

107
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,760
Won't you hurry?

108
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,260
Is this emergency drug related?

109
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,880
God damn it, why does it matter?

110
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,120
Yes, yes, he's dead.

111
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,760
He's been dead.

112
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,140
He's been dead.

113
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,760
That's right, he's got a choke on it.

114
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,180
Look, this is too easy.

115
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,700
I've come this far, why don't I get it right?

116
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,780
The black is stoned.

117
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,320
Let me finish him off for good.

118
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,660
No.

119
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,060
Just follow instructions.

120
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,240
Get out of there.

121
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,940
I could snuff him real easy with a pillow.

122
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,600
No.

123
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,060
We'll do it.

124
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,660
My way.

125
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,660
He must go the way he's expected to go.

126
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
Look, I've got a blade.

127
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,760
I could open up a lung.

128
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,020
Look, I've got a pipe.

129
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,480
This is getting interÃ¼cketal.

130
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,540
Good.

131
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,860
Let's do this.

132
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,920
Are we leaving?

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,440
Of course.

134
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,500
I can tell...

135
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,060
Of course.

136
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,360
Don't worry.

137
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,140
We know the game.

138
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,480
is expected to go.

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,400
He must go the way he's expected to go.

140
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,320
I don't say that it's true.

141
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,880
I'll just leave that up to you.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,640
If you don't believe, I'll understand.

143
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,940
When I fall like this,

144
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,960
and I want to kiss,

145
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,300
baby, don't say no.

146
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:31,260
No, no, no, no, no, no.

147
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,720
Leave my embrace.

148
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,020
For still in my heart,

149
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,680
it is your turn.

150
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

151
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,680
Lend an ear, voodoo child.

152
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,860
It's nothing new to me.

153
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,280
I see it every time there's a concert with cops.

154
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:02,920
Shh.

155
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,580
Shh.

156
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:07,880
Shh.

157
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,620
Shh.

158
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:09,780
Shh.

159
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,640
Shh.

160
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:10,900
Shh.

161
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,020
Shh.

162
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,100


163
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,100


164
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,320
Shh.

165
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,400
Shh.

166
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:13,500


167
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,000
Shh.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,620
Shh.

169
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:15,620


170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,660
Shh.

171
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:17,660


172
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:17,660


173
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:17,660


174
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:17,680


175
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,380
Shh.

176
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:20,900


177
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,580
Alexandria.

178
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:41,620
Credits.

179
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,660
Hunds.

180
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:41,660


181
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:41,660


182
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:41,680
middle schoolers with a applies going on over and

183
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:41,680


184
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:41,680


185
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,300
Yes, oh yes friends Jenny,

186
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:46,800
Jimmy.

187
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,660
Yes, love you,

188
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:47,660


189
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:47,660


190
00:10:49,600 --> 00:11:00,500
Janice, Jim, John, Drelloid, Gigi, Janer, Kurt.

191
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,020
Well, at least they're off the J's.

192
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,420
Say that much for them.

193
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,580
I guess they're started on the K's now.

194
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,780
But who's going to be next?

195
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,780
Who's next?

196
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,200
Keith?

197
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,240
Get it?

198
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,820
Keith?

199
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,420
Who's next?

200
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,620
Real funny.

201
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,960
And what about Sid, man?

202
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,780
What about Buddy Holly?

203
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,360
It's a shame, but friends, it was all predicted in the pamphlet.

204
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,240
It was right there in pamphlet, subgenius pamphlet number two,

205
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,380
printed nearly ten years ago on page five.

206
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,420
It says, and I quote,

207
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:44,720
Compared to slack, nirvana is like having your eyes slowly gouged out

208
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,600
with a carrot peeler while resisting.

209
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,440
It's like a

210
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,580
It's like a

211
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,040
operation known by the fanciful codename, the 39 steps.

212
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:15,580
We know from the great Larry Buchanan's film, Down on Us, also known as Beyond the Doors,

213
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,500
that the Nixon,

214
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:25,900
the White House, deliberately, yes, had Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison murdered,

215
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:34,080
yes, murdered to prevent their leading the lemming-like youth of America in a mass stampede

216
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:40,620
into LSD, free sex, and body painting, friends.

217
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,580
So far in the game, the 39 steps are winning.

218
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:52,760
15 to 0 over the 27-year-old left-handed guard players from Seattle.

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,380
It's a stone bummer.

220
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:05,420
And what we want to know is how come the Johns die while the Pauls at least appear to live on.

221
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,800
Barrier.

222
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,000
A challenge.

223
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,580
A wall they have to climb.

224
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,480
Like waving a red flag in front of a bull.

225
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,400
Worn out.

226
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,100
Harsh.

227
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,600
Wrung out.

228
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,600
Hands reaching in the air.

229
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,020
Grabbing at everything.

230
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,580
A lot of guys with boners.

231
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,220
A lot of girls in heat.

232
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,980
Everybody angry.

233
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,460
Crying.

234
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,660
Hard up.

235
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,120
The lady is a poet.

236
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,140
The mystics could tell us.

237
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,380
The gurus.

238
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,240
The medicine men.

239
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,820
They feel we're in the 15th round.

240
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,940
The 9th inning.

241
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,480
The bacon for tomorrow.

242
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,180
Tomorrow's breakfast will have the peculiar color of ash.

243
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,840
The

244
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:53,960
The

245
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,820
The

246
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:04,860
The

247
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:04,860


248
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,140
The

249
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,160
The

250
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,360
The

251
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,360


252
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,360


253
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,480
The

254
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,760
The

255
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:05,760


256
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:05,820
The

257
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:05,920
The

258
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:05,940
The

259
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:05,980
The

260
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,000
The

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000


262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,400
The

263
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,780
The

264
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:07,780


265
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,480
The

266
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,480


267
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,480


268
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,480


269
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,700
The

270
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,720
The The

271
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,240
The The The The

272
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
Theform wanna have this.

273
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


274
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


275
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


276
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


277
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


278
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


279
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


280
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


281
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


282
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


283
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,680


284
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,280
Love me.

285
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,180
The liars love me.

286
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,520
I know our little safeguard.

287
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,000
I've always believed that love is the only bond that is in harmony.

288
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,700
!

289
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,300
Oh!

290
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,600
As we end the broadcast,

291
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,040
let me say that you ain't got nothing,

292
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,860
and he's got it all.

293
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,140
And your miserable self is against the wall.

294
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,160
The only thing you have not tried

295
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,460
is the sport of chumps.

296
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,740
That's suicide.

297
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,860
You'll say there ain't no use in living.

298
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,140
It's all a waste of time.

299
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,360
And you want to throw your life away.

300
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,300
The people, that's just fine.

301
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,480
Go on and get it over with then.

302
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,380
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

303
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,940
Just make sure you do it right the first time.

304
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,940
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.

305
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,740
Oh yeah.

306
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,160
Just think of the rain, no light to shine in.

307
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,740
Through the bushes up ahead.

308
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,200
And we're all going to be so sorry.

309
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,080
When we find out who was it.

310
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,300
Go on and get it over with then.

311
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,280
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

312
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,700
Just make sure you do it right the first time.

313
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,820
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.

314
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,680
Oh yeah.

315
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,620
Just think of the rain.

316
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:16,640
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

317
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:16,640


318
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,700
And you want a little attention.

319
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,980
And you need it pretty quick.

320
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,260
Don't want to mess your face up.

321
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,060
And we won't know if it's you.

322
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,360
But there's just so much to worry about.

323
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,980
Now what you gonna do?

324
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,220
Go get on and get it over with then.

325
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,240
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

326
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,700
Just make sure you do it right the first time.

327
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,280
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.

328
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,280


329
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,280


330
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,280


331
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,280


332
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,580
I jump.

333
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,280
Oh, yeah.

334
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:54,160
Oh, yeah.

335
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,120
Oh, yeah.

336
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:36,640
Oh, yeah.

337
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,380
Oh, yeah.

338
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:55,960
Oh, yeah.

339
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,560
Oh, yeah.

340
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,800
Friends, at that point,

341
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,040
Frank goes off into yet

342
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,860
an entirely different rant.

343
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,680
Frank Zappa there

344
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,900
at the end of our

345
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,040
Dead Rock Star collage.

346
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,720
Once again,

347
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,220
of course, the newspapers,

348
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,120
they always call it drugs

349
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,060
or suicide.

350
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,420
But, you know,

351
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,980
I could snuff him with a pillow.

352
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,880
But, no, he must go the way

353
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,120
he's expected to go.

354
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,360
I got a blade.

355
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,680
I could open up a lung.

356
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,460
That's right.

357
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,600
He's got a choke on it.

358
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,820
And this is

359
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,680
our friend Tommy Lopez

360
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,720
in the background.

361
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm trying to think if there's any other credits

362
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,960
I need to give.

363
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
I can't think of anything right off hand.

364
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,240
I've been too ticked off lately, friends.

365
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,820
Yes.

366
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,600
I spent a lot

367
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,340
of time yesterday being angry.

368
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,560
Angry at what you ask.

369
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,240
You're asking me?

370
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,140
I know you want to know.

371
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,000
Well, at all the things

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,960
that make me mad.

373
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,620
That's what I've been angry at.

374
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,000
The things that make me mad all the time.

375
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,060
Now, they don't bother me

376
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,020
when I'm not thinking about them.

377
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,680
But, uh,

378
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,740
and I try not to think about them.

379
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,380
But, friends, they get in my face.

380
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,640
Ugh.

381
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,660
Ugh.

382
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,040
Ugh.

383
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,440
Ugh.

384
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


385
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


386
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


387
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


388
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


389
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


390
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


391
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


392
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


393
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


394
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,540


395
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,520
Mainly people that pester me.

396
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,380
My friend, uh,

397
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,840
conservatives.

398
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,280
Republicans.

399
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,660
I get ticked off at them.

400
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,560
Racists.

401
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,080
They make me mad.

402
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:40,940
Prudes.

403
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,120
Busy buddies.

404
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,700
Censors.

405
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,740
Sexists.

406
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,880
Socialists.

407
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,440
Democrats.

408
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,380
I hate Democrats.

409
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,820
Speecists.

410
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,840
Nasty.

411
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,260
Spoiled kids.

412
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,500
And all the press, friends.

413
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,440
All of the press.

414
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,180
They're my new idols of hate.

415
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,120
Although I did read, uh,

416
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,800
the most encouraging,

417
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,720
well, of course, it was tiny and short,

418
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
little article in the news.

419
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,140
I was amazed that they would admit this.

420
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,380
Allowing us how people in Little Rock, Arkansas,

421
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,600
were getting really cynical about the press

422
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,100
because some of the things that appeared

423
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,600
about, uh, Whitewater in major newspapers

424
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,120
like the Wall Street Journal

425
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,180
and, uh,

426
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,080
Newsweek?

427
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,060
Those were patently a bull hockey.

428
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,780
And the, the Arkansasians would complain

429
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,500
that such-and-such was a total lie

430
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,260
and, uh,

431
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,980
the Journal or Newsweek

432
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,860
would print the correction

433
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,500
at the back of the paper

434
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,540
in five-point type.

435
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,180
And so even the conservative fundamentalist

436
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,900
Arkansasians are going

437
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,740
well,ï¿½ï¿½

438
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,900
and maybe it's not a liberal bias media

439
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,160
after all because then they sure oughta get on the Indians,

440
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,160


441
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,380
stretching the truth and flat out lying and twisting things.

442
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,560
I hate to cut.

443
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,200
I hate to do that to Jimmy, but he's starting to step on me.

444
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,700
Anyway, you know, it's gotten to the point where it's so obvious, friends,

445
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:21,400
that those Republican insiders, the only reason they haven't killed Clinton with poison

446
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,060
is they're afraid they might get caught.

447
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,280
And they will assassinate the Democrats any way they can,

448
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,120
not because they're patriots, but because they want the power.

449
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,740
And the only thing they've been able to use so far is that this guy and his wife

450
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,700
have some kind of swinging lifestyle,

451
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,780
as if George Bush didn't have girlfriends and Dan Quayle didn't smoke pot.

452
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,900
And this stupid two-bit real estate deal in the 70s,

453
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,740
the cover-up of which they have succeeded,

454
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,380
and they're going to have to do it again.

455
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,520
And making look in the press like it was, oh, somehow much worse than Watergate,

456
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,520
much worse than Iran-Contra,

457
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,140
because it shows that the president might have cheated.

458
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,280
Well, of course he cheated.

459
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,900
Clinton's just another conspiracy puppet,

460
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,480
greedy, egomaniac, corporate communist.

461
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,880
I'm not defending him, friends.

462
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,700
No way.

463
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,880
Or what he represents.

464
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm just attacking.

465
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:27,500
I'm attacking the other conspiracy, uh, uh, uh, bastards, pink boys,

466
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,480
whose secret police really run things by extortion anyway.

467
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,540
Oh, but the normals, oh, it's okay to lie to Congress,

468
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,060
have entire wars where thousands are killed and enslaved

469
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,260
without Americans ever hearing how they sponsored it,

470
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,700
even after the elected Congress specifically said,

471
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,240
no, no, you can't do that.

472
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,920
Oh, that's my friends.

473
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,820
It is as nothing compared to going around saying that American laws

474
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,800
don't actually have to be biblical.

475
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,180
Or being an uppity woman whose husband runs around and she doesn't even care.

476
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:13,340
And what's the worst of all is me being reduced to defending a bunch of pinks.

477
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,460
Like I say, man.

478
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,620
But it's so terrible to get pissed at your friends and relatives

479
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,980
who happen to be fundamentalist, conservative nuts.

480
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,780
And I was sitting there this morning reading the paper going,

481
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,760
by the beardlessness of dogs.

482
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,920
Oh, damn it.

483
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,260
These pinks, they are Nazis.

484
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,380
This country would go Nazi in the blink of an eye

485
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,820
if they just put enough red, white, big enough red, white, and blue flag

486
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,380
in front of the Fuhrer

487
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,400
with enough big, pasty, roly-poly men up in front

488
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,220
to say enough nasty things

489
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,180
about making them.

490
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:49,960
And I was reading the paper,

491
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,380
and I was reading the complex impulse

492
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,140
so that all the other good old boys and girls

493
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,640
can read between the lines.

494
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,120
Man, I hate it, friends.

495
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,700
I hate that Nazi side of America.

496
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,520
I hate it.

497
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,800
I hate it so much.

498
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
God, I hate Nazis.

499
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,660
I hate conservative butt boys who are really Nazis

500
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,100
and pretend they aren't.

501
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,340
I hate them worse than Nazis.

502
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,900
At least the German Nazis would come right out and go,

503
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,980
yeah, yeah, we think we the greatest.

504
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,240
We kill everybody.

505
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,620
Oh, no, we're much more subtle here in America nowadays.

506
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,660
Get a nice, plump, rump boy up there to say,

507
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:27,960
liberal,

508
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,560
with just the right ring in his voice.

509
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,900
And hey, his people know what that word means.

510
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,440
Uppity women, all Jews, all Arabs, most Catholics,

511
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,400
all Micronesians, Macronesians,

512
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,400
Silanese, Negroes, Mexicans, Guatemalans,

513
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,660
even wasps like myself, who happen to recognize closet Nazis

514
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,240
and commies when we see them.

515
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,160
Oh, yeah, we get thrown in that mix, too.

516
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,780
Of course, we're the worst ones of all,

517
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,920
because we're traitors to the good old pink boy race.

518
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,620
And when I hear one of my own good subgenius doctor friends

519
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,260
say something to me like, you know, Stang,

520
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,300
the most powerful person in this country now is a woman

521
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,960
who wasn't even elected, I have to look at him, and I say,

522
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:16,960


523
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,440
I'm ashamed of you, because you've fallen right into the trap.

524
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:26,680
Did not Dobbs tell us 13 years ago that all those presidents

525
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,120
and their wives, no matter what party,

526
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,480
all of those characters are just scarecrows put up there

527
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,140
to keep the idiots throwing rocks at them

528
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,520
so they wouldn't pay any attention to the real power behind the scenes?

529
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,800
And now here you're falling for this line that this one incredibly powerful person,

530
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,840
is going to ruin your country as if it wasn't already half ruined.

531
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,300
Now think about it.

532
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,960
Aren't you just barking at their latest scarecrow?

533
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,060
Haven't they succeeded in distracting you just by updating the decoy?

534
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,960
It makes me mad, friends.

535
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,420
But what also makes me mad is when actual, true, bleeding-heart liberals

536
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,900
don't realize the dangers and how they've been set up.

537
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,940
And they don't realize the dangers of the world.

538
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,040
They don't realize nearly how bad it actually is.

539
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,200
When they open their mouths about politics,

540
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,880
what comes out sounds like the conservatives' cartoons of them.

541
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,000
Rush Limbaugh quotes them,

542
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,680
Oh, well, the liberals will just say,

543
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,640
it's only because she's a woman.

544
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,980
Well, what about Kay Bailey Hutchison down there in Texas?

545
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:43,660
Friends, it ticks me off that well-meaning people set themselves up

546
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,080
and play along with that propaganda game,

547
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,920
and in some cases,

548
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,540
actually become the hand-wringing commies

549
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,020
that the fundamentalist right-wing idiots make them out to be.

550
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,140
It ticks me off.

551
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,300
It makes me mad.

552
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,580
It's getting to where the middle of the road,

553
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,780
which is Clinton, for God's sake,

554
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,620
that means communist now.

555
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,440
And liberal, well, that means demon.

556
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,600
And nobody even talks about radicals anymore.

557
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,860
Yeah, to hear some people talk,

558
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,100
Clinton's a radical.

559
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,280
I'll tell you who's radical by the true definition, friends.

560
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,080
The fundamentalists.

561
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,920
They want to put you behind bars

562
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,840
because someday you might be contagious.

563
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,680
And, uh, well, there is a little thing in the newspaper here today.

564
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,260
Galveston, Texas.

565
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,180
Galveston County Republicans are being harshly criticized

566
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,160
and even threatened

567
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,080
by their, merely their call

568
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,580
to quarantine people

569
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,660
carrying the virus that causes AIDS.

570
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,360
Yes, friends,

571
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,520
Galveston GOP calls for AIDS concentration camps.

572
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,780
The county GOP approved the resolution March 26,

573
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,780
but it only came to light in recent days.

574
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,500
The GOP resolution recommending

575
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,160
the isolation and quarantine

576
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,580
of persons who are HIV positive

577
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,020
was passed by the majority

578
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,660
of the 300 Republican delegates

579
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,760
of the party convention.

580
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,520
The resolution calls for quarantine

581
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,980
until a cure is found.

582
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,220
See, at least it's not quarantined forever.

583
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,000
Just until a cure is found.

584
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,820
So the general population can be protected

585
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,920
from the disease.

586
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,440
It also calls for identification

587
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,060
of individuals carrying the AIDS virus

588
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,580
and the tracing of their sexual partners.

589
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,580
So, uh,

590
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:44,580


591
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,420
the GOP measure was one of 115 passed

592
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,000
at the county party meeting

593
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,080
and forwarded to the Texas GOP

594
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,740
for possible consideration

595
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,580
of AIDS concentration camps

596
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,180
at the party's state convention in June.

597
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,720
Oh, well, you know,

598
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,400
there's probably some of my listeners

599
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,180
out there going,

600
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,120
whoa, AIDS concentration camps for queers?

601
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,060
That sounds like a pretty good idea to me.

602
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,240
I hate them, friends, hate them.

603
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,280
But, let us, um,

604
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,200
where are we now?

605
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,100
Where are we in show?

606
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,100
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away

607
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,400
for the last 20 minutes.

608
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,740
It's just, you know,

609
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,940
it was just a little thing I did.

610
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,080
Let's let our old friends,

611
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,040
uh,

612
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,920
let our old friends,

613
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,120
where are our old friends?

614
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,800
Here they are.

615
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,040
Oh, I'm sorry,

616
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,040


617
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,180
we'll let these old friends

618
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,060
carry us down into

619
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,820
some other part of the show.

620
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,840
Cut that out!

621
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,840
Look, man, I'm warning you.

622
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,160
I saw this kind of thing in the 60s.

623
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,140
I'll tell you what.

624
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,060
You can't just kill a woman

625
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,060


626
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,060


627
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,060


628
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,060


629
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,160
but we won't do that.

630
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,160


631
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,160


632
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,220
We'll do it now.

633
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,040
We'll do it now.

634
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,040


635
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,040


636
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,040


637
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,060
We'll do it now.

638
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,500
He must go the way he's expected to go.

639
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,300
Skimpy, climb inside.

640
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:22,000
Fun awaits you if you climb inside.

641
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,520
Skimpy.

642
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:33,380
If you look in the back,

643
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
you'll see I don't have a rug on the floor.

644
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,620
I got linoleum.

645
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,760
That's for puke from people like you.

646
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,240
Rock and roll is dead.

647
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,240
Enhanced, enhanced, substantially improved.

648
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,280
Refinements have been carried out and all results are good.

649
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,240
Enhanced.

650
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,000
Now dance, embrace a happy mood.

651
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,700
Rejoice that Florence Henderson substantially improved.

652
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,120
Running the strut and wiggle her butt

653
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,660
has pulled her out of her rut

654
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,160
and found her a whole new personality.

655
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,800
The right is to wing a critical thing

656
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,740
that's meant for a king.

657
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,300
The chicken has got a certain westernality.

658
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,980
Let's ensure her shrubberies have been shaped

659
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,800
to resemble Wisconsin.

660
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,260
Before she dons her rubbery head

661
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,760
that looks like Wendy Johnson.

662
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,420
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

663
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,840
Enhanced, enhanced, delightfully improved.

664
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,720
Refinements have been implemented like we knew they should.

665
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,580
Now dance, please dance, embrace a joyful mood.

666
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,300
Shout out that Florence Henderson substantially improved.

667
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,220
Rejoice that Florence Henderson substantially,

668
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,500
Effectively,

669
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,500
Remarkably,

670
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,480
Considerably,

671
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,640
And evidently, certainly,

672
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,880
Very much improved.

673
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:03,600
Oops!

674
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,440
Enhanced.

675
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:05,880
Ahhh!

676
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,180
Hahaha!

677
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:08,900
Haha!

678
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,580
Heh hahah!

679
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,600
Happy as fuck!

680
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,640
Hehe.

681
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,400
Hehe.

682
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,860
So it is.

683
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,540
Hehe!

684
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,340
Hehe.

685
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,200
vocals

686
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,200


687
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,200


688
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,880
windows

689
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,640
Principals

690
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,280
F UI

691
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,280


692
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,700
Shut up.

693
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,660
Sounds a bit crazy, huh?

694
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:30,660


695
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,380
25 years of my life and still

696
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,300
I'm trying to get up that great big hill

697
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,360
I'll hop for a destination

698
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,960
I realized quickly when I knew I should

699
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,580
That the world was made up of the brotherhood of men

700
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,060
For whatever it means

701
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,640
I'm trying to get up that great big hill

702
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,600
I'll hop for a destination

703
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,260
I'll hop for a destination

704
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,320
I'll hop for a destination

705
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,000
For whatever it means

706
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,700
I'll hop for a destination

707
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,060
I'm trying to get up that great big hill

708
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,180
I'll hop for a destination

709
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,880
I'll hop for a destination

710
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,880
I'll hop for a destination

711
00:34:48,880 --> 00:35:00,300
I'll hop for a destination

712
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:14,500
I say, what's going on?

713
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,740
I try, oh my God, do I try

714
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,740
I try all the time

715
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,420
In this institution, yeah

716
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,420
And I pray, oh my God, do I pray

717
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,960
I pray every single day

718
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,640
For a revolution, yeah

719
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,500
I am something by some dress

720
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,600
Well, I am the way and giving it all

721
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,340
I am what I am, I am the way

722
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,720
I am the way, I am the way

723
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,600
I'm somebody Jesus

724
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,900
Well now you're gonna lie

725
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,440
Eb Condition Cheers

726
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,720
You don't find it hard

727
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:10,080
Hell is free hardware

728
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,180
I want to remain

729
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,220
Bye

730
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,640
Once it's here

731
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,220
I'll stand here

732
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:54,700
Let's go!

733
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,080
Let's go!

734
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,520
You were not excited at all from that.

735
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,720
Well, it's so funny because even some people look at my music and say,

736
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,540
is that why they're going?

737
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
I say, what do you want?

738
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,440
You know, what are you trying to get first out for?

739
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,580
Try to go by the feeling?

740
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,300
Because it goes loud.

741
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,140
That's what you say.

742
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,860
That's great.

743
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,620
All those things that work for you, like you,

744
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,040
are supposed to work in living room.

745
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,500
Before I heard of it,

746
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,720
I knew it.

747
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,120
I knew it.

748
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,420
Oh, yeah.

749
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,960
I know you're going.

750
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:47,780
I know you're going.

751
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,080
I know you're going.

752
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,880
I know you're going.

753
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,600
I know you're going.

754
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
I said, hey.

755
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,940
Yeah, I said, hey.

756
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,060
Yeah, I said, hey.

757
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,260
What's going on?

758
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,040
What's going on?

759
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,520
You can take that and shove it in the place where Bob Dobbs don't care to look.

760
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,180
Ha ha ha.

761
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,480
Ha ha ha.

762
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,000
Woo!

763
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,640
Hello?

764
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,480
Boy's got his nose and everything here.

765
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,800
Hello.

766
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,180
Caller, you're healthy.

767
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,100
Can you do a bristling for me?

768
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,480
A bristling?

769
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,760
A bristling.

770
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,900
A brishing?

771
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,440
A brishing, man.

772
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,620
A beatitude.

773
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,320
A brishing.

774
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,960
I thought, the reverend, can you do a brishing?

775
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,700
I guess he wants you to masturbate his child.

776
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,640
I mean, clip his toenails.

777
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,840
Oh, I know what they want.

778
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,060
Authoritative breastfeeding.

779
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,680
No, they wanted you to circumcise his wife.

780
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,440
Or his child.

781
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,240
No, no.

782
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,640
His man child.

783
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,800
He circumcised his wife last night.

784
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,200
No, in the church, we only circumcise females.

785
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,100
Oh, the clitorostomy.

786
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:08,840
Yeah, it's because of the gods from Sodom, the ancient star in space.

787
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,580
I remember.

788
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:10,820
Analectomies.

789
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:16,800
It's all occult, obscured from our everyday mundane garden variety knowledge.

790
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,520
I heard about the anal cults that would sew up their anuses.

791
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,840
I don't think that would be nice.

792
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,580
They were packing a mean load.

793
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,720
And that was not a very good thing.

794
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,280
That was not a very successful cult.

795
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,820
Nor were the Kastrati.

796
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,040
Nor long-lived, that's true.

797
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,260
The Kastrati of Russia were a short-lived fanatic cult.

798
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,980
Did not last long either, yes.

799
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:40,620
Two things that you must do if you want to keep on having, you know, another cult to follow is procreate and...

800
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,140
Right, look at the Mormons.

801
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,020
And dung-reate.

802
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,520
Yeah, many of them.

803
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,440
I mean, that's a successful damn cult.

804
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,820
Less than about a hundred years ago, they were a bunch of idiot nuts, you know.

805
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,640
Now they run.

806
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,280
Right down the street here.

807
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,100
That's where they started.

808
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,460
Right.

809
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,360
Based on misogyny and dog puppets.

810
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,980
And then they all took off.

811
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,140
Right over there, where that one guy, Lundgren.

812
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,520
Did you ever hear about that?

813
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,680
Jeffrey Lundgren, do you remember him?

814
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,380
Todd Lundgren?

815
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,300
There was a big...

816
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:04,680
Todd Lundgren.

817
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,580
There was a big...

818
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,480
When Joseph Smith was on his way west, Ohio was once west.

819
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,580
If you're coming from Albany, I guess that was a big deal back in them days.

820
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,880
And so they started that big old temple over there in Kirkland.

821
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,320
And that's where Lundgren...

822
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,120
Todd Lundgren had that vision for utopia.

823
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,460
Yeah.

824
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,840
It was like virtual reality.

825
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,100
No, there was a Mormon offshoot.

826
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,340
Which killed some other guys by luring them into...

827
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,920
A wizard.

828
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,660
A wizard.

829
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,040
A true star.

830
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,660
Oh, the Lundgren...

831
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:29,880
Yes.

832
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,720
A clown.

833
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,140
That's right.

834
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,260
There was...

835
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,020
I think there was a Hollywood meat puppet and three army organisms.

836
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,440
One of them was a soldier ant, and the other one...

837
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,420
Three of them were let go at an earlier date.

838
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,460
I'm with the Ervil LeBaron cult of Mormon.

839
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,100
We're against the Lundgrenites.

840
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,100
Yeah.

841
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,500
I remember it badly.

842
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,020
We must do a covenant sealing upon them.

843
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:59,160
Using the sacred holy secret underwear to strangle the faith out of them.

844
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,360
Now that was actually a part of the story.

845
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,720
The covenant had to do with sealing the sacred underwear.

846
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,340
And they strangled some people with sacred underwear.

847
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:06,820
Did they?

848
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,060
And he expected to be next Joseph Smith or Brigham Young or one of those other people.

849
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,300
Jacques de Molay.

850
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,260
Jacques de Molay.

851
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,780
Joan of Arc.

852
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:14,800
David Cora.

853
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,420
Oh, wait a minute here.

854
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,600
This just in.

855
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:23,540
Current Affair has just declared Nancy Cry again has won the National American Popularity Contest.

856
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,080
Oh, yeah.

857
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,660
So Tanya Harding is now out of it completely.

858
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,920
That babe will never...

859
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,160
She got glass knees.

860
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,160
She'll never make it as just big time skater.

861
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,340
And the Russian went after the German today with her skate.

862
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,880
It just came in over the wire.

863
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,560
Threw the skate.

864
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,500
Threw the skate, it says.

865
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,540
Threw the skate at her and hit her in the leg causing her to get three stitches.

866
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,460
This is wild.

867
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,840
Female ice skaters getting violent like a bunch of hockey guys.

868
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,140
There must be something about the cold.

869
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:53,260
It was predicted ten years ago in Book of the Subgenius that a blonde slut...

870
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,920
One by name.

871
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:10,220
...Russian full-bucker skater would attack using a gigantic Samoan as a weapon would attack this high-class, snooty-looking, long-legged, rich girl, rich brunette girl.

872
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,240
Said that right in Book of the Subgenius.

873
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,680
Oh, Red Boy, you know the people from Samoa are not snooty.

874
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,160
I can't wait for those Tanya Harding pornos to come out.

875
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,600
Huh?

876
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,460
I can't wait for those Tanya Harding pornos to come out.

877
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,420
Well, now you know that...

878
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,080
She signed a contract with a homeowner.

879
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,720
I can't wait for those Tanya Harding pornos to come out.

880
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:24,720


881
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,760
You know, HOM video or something like that?

882
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,680
Well, they always come out with a porno movie with a cute title like Sperminator.

883
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,040
Or Psycho Sluts on Skates.

884
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,420
Yeah, right, right.

885
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,180
They've got to do something with that.

886
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,420
Olympic Fever could be a...

887
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,760
Oh, yeah, that would be a cool one.

888
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,420
Olympic Fever.

889
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,800
You'd have like the village...

890
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:42,840
Olympic Press.

891
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,540
Yeah, yeah.

892
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,000
You'd have your village there and everybody's sitting around drinking their Gatorade.

893
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,100
And then the stewardesses would come up, see?

894
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
And they'd be dressed up in dog suits and everything.

895
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,060
And then like, say, the one who's the best.

896
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,740
Yeah, one guy with a huge hat would come up being dressed in a dog suit.

897
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,400
Another good Winter Olympic would be like ice chewing.

898
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,280
Where you get the ice at the bottom of the drink and you have to chew it.

899
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,200
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

900
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,320
That would be another good one.

901
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,420
Oh, he broke a tooth.

902
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,280
Uh-oh.

903
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,420
It died.

904
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:16,980
Yeah.

905
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:23,340
The life was sucked right out like a flatulent prairie squid convulsing on the ice.

906
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,260
In the rink of our own amphitheater.

907
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,820
Never mind.

908
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,960
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:29,980
Oh.

910
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:37,280
I was casting through some pieces and I managed to come across that.

911
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,520
In the back of my mind I saw that.

912
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,020
Hello?

913
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,300
Uh, hello?

914
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:45,840
Hello?

915
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:46,520
Goodbye.

916
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,780
I think one of your tape loops called up.

917
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,340
Chaz.

918
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,160
It was the hello one again.

919
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,480
Oh, just the little hello loop.

920
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:58,940
Yeah.

921
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,680
But they just do that to hear the echo.

922
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,380
Oh, uh, trucker radio, huh?

923
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,340
Trucker radio?

924
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,720
She wants to do trucker radio.

925
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,380
I'm not doing trucker radio tonight.

926
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,400
I recognize that laugh.

927
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,380
Oh, I recognize that squeal.

928
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,280
Truckers, truckers.

929
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,000
I recognize that squeal of pleasure.

930
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,760
A familiar slice of meat to the Reverend Ivey.

I'll see you then.

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,480
I'll see you then.

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,340
I'll see you then.

992
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,680
Slack floweth in abundance.

993
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,360
And I'm going to give you that number.

994
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,840
You can write to Bob himself.

995
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,000
Just write to Bob.

996
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,020
Or drop us a self-addressed stamped envelope.

997
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,480
You got that pencil ready, my friend?

998
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:38,240
Whip it out to Bob at Post Office Box.

999
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,660
Wait a minute.

1000
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,380
Let me do this right.

1001
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,500
That's Bob at Post Office Box.

1002
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:51,640
Box 140306.

1003
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:58,200
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1004
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,620
Once again, that's Box 140306.

1005
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,720
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1006
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:08,100
And now we're going to leave you with the most psychedelic song of all

1007
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,640
taken from last night's Ren and Stimpy episode.

1008
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,400
What do you do?

1009
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,400
Cinnamon gumdrop.

1010
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,000

Day glow bubblegum pork chop.

1012
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:29,000
Lilac lady will go down in history.

1013
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,180
I'm inside my world.

1014
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:40,480
I'm inside my belly button.

1015
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,960
Meet that plastic world.

1016
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,180
Me and she spell out a mind game.

1017
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,320
Big Ben Henry drinks his prune juice every day.

1018
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,260
My guy, businessman snowflake.

1019
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,860
Rubber man bouncing down the mushroom gravy highway.

1020
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,140
Climb inside my world.

1021
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:08,280
Climb inside my belly button.

1022
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,700
Meet that plastic world.

1023
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,880
Saffron teabag pierogi.

1024
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,540
Parsley panda.

1025
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,180
Parsley panda.

1026
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:16,480
Parsley panda.

1027
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:16,480


1028
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:16,480


1029
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:16,480


1030
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:16,480

Meatloaf monkey drives a movie motor home.

1034
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,940
I'm inside my world.

1035
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:36,140
I'm inside my belly button.

1036
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,580
Meet that plastic world.

1037
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,060
actors and musicians.

1038
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,780
crushed prison.

1039
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,480
this song is up and 6th with the band playing,

1040
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:46,480


1041
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:46,480


1042
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:46,480


1043
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:46,480


1044
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:46,480


1045
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:46,480


1046
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:46,480


1047
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,080
Okay.

1048
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,480
What, in your opinion, is the future of pop music?

1049
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,460
Well, I like the word pop in the first place.

1050
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,240
Well, okay.

1051
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,920
All it means to me is pilgrimage of peace.

1052
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:00,700
Okay.

1053
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,940
Well, we'll get down.

1054
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,760
Okay, what do you think the sound of the future will be then?

1055
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:05,760
Well, I don't know.

1056
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,440
I'm not a critic.

1057
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,300
You know, I can just only go by what I want.

1058
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,120
On my own side, I like to get into more symphonic things

1059
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,120
so then kids can respect the old and the traditional,

1060
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,240
you know, like classics.

1061
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:22,620
I like to mix that in with, you know, with so-called rock today.

1062
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,880
But it's always changing according to the attitude of the people, you know.

1063
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:31,940
When the air is static, loud, and aggressive, that's how the music gets.

1064
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:37,120
When the air starts getting peaceful and harmonic and so forth,

1065
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,260
that's how the music will get.

1066
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,940
So it's up to the people how it's going to be.

1067
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,040
But music is going to be here regardless if it's rock or whatever.

1068
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:45,860
You know.

1069
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,840
And it's going to influence a whole lot of people's minds now

1070
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,640
because like I said before, that's part of their church now.

1071
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,760
Well, music is considered extremely emotional

1072
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,260
and it's supposed to rid the individual of frustration.

1073
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,660
That's what they say.

1074
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,920
Yeah, if people let it.

1075
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:03,460
I judge.

1076
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,480
It's marvelous.

1077
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,620
Yeah, instead of trying to...

1078
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,480
I can tell you that from my own experience.

1079
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,380
If I'm really uptight and I'm tense and everything,

1080
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,560
I go to somewhere like the Whiskey and really enjoy myself.

1081
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:13,820
Yeah.

1082
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,040
I enjoy to listen to Andy Williams or something.

1083
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,520
You know, he's very relaxing, for instance, you know.
