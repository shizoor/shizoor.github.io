Praise Bob!

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,780
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Turn on the machine.

6
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,300
This is Radio Yerevan.

7
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,940
Wake up, puppet boy!

8
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,680
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,600
which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

10
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,620
There is absolutely no other possibility.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,080
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,120
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

14
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,180
The Subgenius Hour of Slack!

15
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,360
Gosh!

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,440
The practice of hallucinatory drugs was big back in then,

17
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,960
and they were here to help.

18
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,660
We're hearing these messages that the Beatles were placing backwards.

19
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,120
For those who believe in Bob, no explanation is necessary.

20
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,640
For those who do not believe in Bob, no explanation is possible.

21
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,600
It makes you feel like you're hearing the same tune over and over and over.

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
It's like the sound of the letter blue.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,560
Never end.

24
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:17,780
Ever.

25
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,160
Never end.

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,260
I dreamed he took his little monkey hand and began rubbing my...

27
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,740
My clintaurus very furiously.

28
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,480
He was saying things to me I couldn't understand.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,100
And I started yelling back at him, and I poked him with that broom over there.

30
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,420
And the next thing you know, there was...

31
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,660
It's the witches!

32
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,980
It's the witches and the masturbation monkeys!

33
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,960
And Dave!

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,720
Ah!

35
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,780
Ah!

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,020
Oh, good.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,540
Now it sounds more like a commercial.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,780
Well, we're glad to be back, aren't we?

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,460
Because that was just a five-minute short stop away.

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,760
It was like kind of a rocket away.

41
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,520
It was a thing that just didn't really, really happen.

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,620
I'm wondering if the caller out there from Birmingham, Allobingus, could maybe call us back.

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,620
You're talking about the last time you were for services in Iraq.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,800
You were a member of the 100 IDs over there.

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,720
I guess there's a lot of idds and super egos somewhere in Baghdad.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,700
But anyway, at least we'll take it straight from the horse's eye.

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,440
Somebody's got to make the decisions!

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,300
Somebody's got to keep the trains and camels running on time!

49
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,660
Someone must be.

50
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,300
Be the decision.

51
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,900
Are you yes or are you no?

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,200
Somebody's got to keep privates like you in their pants!

53
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,000
Somebody.

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,360
Private!

55
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,020
More!

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,720
More production!

57
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,660
More efficient machines!

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,180
More bullets!

59
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,140
More bombers!

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,180
More soldiers!

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,640
More soldiers!

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


64
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,140
More war!

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,220
More!

66
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,080
Better!

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,120
Faster!

68
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,020
More!

69
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,200
Super!

70
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,180
Ultra!

71
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,100
More!

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,220
Production!

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,080
More labor!

74
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,140
More!

75
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,920
Comfort for slaves!

76
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,180
More!

77
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,000
Comfort for slaves!

78
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Check to check, I struggle.

79
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,680
Just to reach the next day.

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,540
More! Taxes! More plunder!

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,180
More! Arbitrary law!

82
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,200
More! Police to suppress!

83
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,640
More! Rules of law!

84
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


85
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


86
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,900
Lingering salary!

88
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,780
Something more!

89
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,600
More money!

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,600


91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,600


92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,600


93
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,600


94
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,340
Intığını!

95
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,040
Cyber justice!

96
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,160
Morenique!

97
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,500
More money!

98
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,500


99
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,260
slaves

100
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,720
Check to check

101
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,840
I struggle

102
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,000
Just to reach

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,540
the next day

104
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,040
Though my veins

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,900
are empty

106
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,200
The high hand

107
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,860
beats me more

108
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,800
More labor

109
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,980
more output

110
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,980
More comfort

111
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,860
for slaves

112
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,860
More increased

113
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,700
production

114
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,100
More

115
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,040
comfort for slaves

116
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,980
More

117
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,140
comfort for slaves

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,100
More

119
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,960
comfort for slaves

120
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,200
More

121
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,240
comfort for slaves

122
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,300
More

123
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,320
comfort for slaves

124
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,280
More

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,000
That's it.

126
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,720
A Yesterfriend's

127
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,600
man from the

128
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,820
CD called

129
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,520
Machine.

130
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,300
And you can learn

131
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,480
more on man

132
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,080
at www.beerforman.com

133
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,400
Man is one man

134
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,180
with one bass guitar

135
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,960
and one drum.

136
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,180
There is no band.

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,580
There is only

138
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,340
man.

139
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,160
Friends, we saw

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,600
man at the

141
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,180
Detroit Devival.

142
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,520
He's from Detroit.

143
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,520
And I

144
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,920
I hope that he gets

145
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,520
really rich and famous.

146
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,760
He acts like he

147
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,180
really doesn't want to.

148
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,420
And he's great.

149
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,480
We'll be hearing a lot

150
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,800
more man on this show.

151
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,780
But that song was called

152
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,320
More.

153
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,540
For a real change of

154
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,400
pace now, here's another

155
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,760
song called More.

156
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,220
One more more.

157
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,700
Which this CD came in

158
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,760
the mail the same day

159
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,240
as Man's CD.

160
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,600
But this one is from

161
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,360
Reverend Jimmy Ryan,

162
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,280
dear friends,

163
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,160
who from his new

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,040
album or band

165
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,660
or both,

166
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,320
Truth Squad.

167
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,460
Jimmy Ryan is the

168
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,900
guitar virtuoso

169
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,860
subgenius,

170
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,580
you might say.

171
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,040
In fact, his last album,

172
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,740
Legacy,

173
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,200
with the Flying Ryan Brothers,

174
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,560
was in the Grammy Awards

175
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,980
for Best Instrumental

176
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,000
Rock Band or something

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,460
like that.

178
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,840
So, More from

179
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,820
Jimmy Ryan.

180
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,160
More.

181
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,200
More for me, not you.

182
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,660
More.

183
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,820
More than I can do.

184
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,800
More than this life I live.

185
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,400
More.

186
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,760
More than you can feel.

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,180
Hey man,

188
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,140
it's just a dream.

189
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,140


190
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,520
It's just the way it is.

191
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,500
I know it's not your fault.

192
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,620
Five things you don't need.

193
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,860
Money you don't have.

194
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,060
To impress people you don't know.

195
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,580
More.

196
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,060
More than I can stand.

197
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,520
More.

198
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,520
More is my demand.

199
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,020
More.

200
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,460
And make no mistake.

201
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,980
More.

202
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,520
More than I can take.

203
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,980
Hey man,

204
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,120
I know it's not your fault.

205
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,860
And it's like I said before.

206
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,040
More.

207
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,860
It's just the way it is, you know.

208
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,160
More.

209
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,640
More.

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,440
You're an original.

211
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,340
You're so unique.

212
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,140
More.

213
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,840
Just like everybody else.

214
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,900
More.

215
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,800
More for me, it's true.

216
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,820
More.

217
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,680
More.

218
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,520
So much more than you.

219
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,560
More.

220
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,240
I just can't refuse.

221
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,460
More.

222
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,360
More than I can use.

223
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,040
So much more than you.

224
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
More.

225
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,260
More.

226
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,060
More.

227
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,540
Yeah.

228
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Oh.

229
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,860
The way thisfere is harder.

230
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:02,860


231
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:02,980
True ugTruth unpleasant.

232
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,360
Oh, my God, why do you call yourself man,

233
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,520
when we get a reuse all the time?

234
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:05,520


235
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:05,560
And your life is different.

236
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:05,560


237
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:05,560


238
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:05,560


239
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,680
guitar solo

240
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,440
solo

241
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,440


242
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,620
solo

243
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,520
The one with the most wise ways

244
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,280
Oh, oh, so I can win

245
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,240
Oh, everlasting sin

246
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,040
Oh, I just don't know why

247
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,120
Oh, till the day I die

248
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,360
Oh

249
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,620
Ah!

250
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:54,060
What bothers me is that they're marketing a video game now

251
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,280
called Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time,

252
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,860
where one of the features they're advertising is time control.

253
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,740
Really?

254
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,280
Wow.

255
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,340
That sounds like a libel story.

256
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,460
I'm disturbing about it.

257
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,060
It took a conspiracy long enough to rip it off, didn't it?

258
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,880
Yeah, well, if your character dies, you can wind time back.

259
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,440
Cool.

260
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,360
And you are the character, of course.

261
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,100
So we're learning how to control time in our own existence

262
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,960
just by focusing on a video game.

263
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,280
In the old days, it's very realistic.

264
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,440
They put away our real time control,

265
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,840
and they're selling us fake time control in a damn video game.

266
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,160
Wait a minute.

267
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Okay, so you can somehow wind time back by doing things or something like that?

268
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,580
Is that it?

269
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,960
I think there's like some button or control key.

270
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,020
Got to find a secret room or something like that.

271
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,420
It's a control key, and then you go, no, and you're back where you started.

272
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,800
You know, in the old days, that used to be called start over.

273
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,040
Play again.

274
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,080
It used to be called play again in the old days.

275
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,420
Well, that's what it's going to be now.

276
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,480
In the new world, that's what it's going to be.

277
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,380
People are going to be asking to replay their lives and so forth.

278
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,860
Play again.

279
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,780
They'll be able to do it because of the implants.

280
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:03,940
Yeah.

281
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,800
When you get to the end, is there a play again button?

282
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,920
Well, you got to make sure you have a record apparatus implanted in the back of your skull.

283
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,860
And once you do, at the moment of your leaving of this body,

284
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,420
you get a number of previews.

285
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,800
And also, when you get previews from the next things coming up,

286
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,700
and trailers from what you already did, called this life.

287
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,380
Unfortunately, many people forget to punch the erase tab.

288
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,200
Well, some of them.

289
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,300
They put an erase tab on their brain and they go ahead and blank it all out.

290
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,000
And then overdub it.

291
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,880
There's the next life.

292
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,300
Right.

293
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,940
And overdubs right over it.

294
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,040
You've got two lives going on at the same time.

295
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,140
Well, that's why institutions are filled up with these people in chairs,

296
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,840
you know, wrapped to the chair and duct tape.

297
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,860
Well, I think that's what I want to do as far as being a criminal is concerned,

298
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,280
is I want to overdub my past existence,

299
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,800
and I would like the police state to come in and overdub me for my crimes.

300
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,380
That makes sense, doesn't it?

301
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:51,860
I just want better background music.

302
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,780
According to Bob,

303
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,900
the problem with time control is that to travel, like, for instance, into the past,

304
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,280
you have to, it's like a slingshot.

305
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,780
You have to go way into the future, stretch it real hard,

306
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,160
until you're way out in the future, then let go,

307
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,380
and it'll shoot you, it'll slingshot you.

308
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,520
Well, see, way, way, it's not a quantity that we can quantify.

309
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,460
There's another way to do that.

310
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,240
Way, way, what's way, way?

311
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,800
Wait, there's another way to do that.

312
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,200
The Silver Surfer proved that.

313
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,380
To go so fast and far forward that you break through the wall of inertia

314
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,760
and just pop back to the future.

315
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,060
To the beginning of time, or wherever you want to dump off.

316
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,740
Well, after you break through the wall of inertia,

317
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,600
you're just in the wall of momentum yourself.

318
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,180
I mean, I hate to sound so realistic, but, you know.

319
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,520
I don't know.

320
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,760
Once inertia flops by, you become part of Mr. Momentum,

321
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,660
who's a much harder guy to stop.

322
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,900
He's like one of those weasels.

323
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,980
You can't get a grip on it.

324
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,220
You can't wrap your teeth around it.

325
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,020
You can't smoke it.

326
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,060
You can't wear it to bed.

327
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,600
What do I know?

328
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,180
You can't buy a little glass of wine or give it a little sleeping pill.

329
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,040
But it'll sure knock you upside the head.

330
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

331
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,600
You know, it's more than smoke.

332
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,200
Knock your head.

333
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,200
Smoke and banana.

334
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,480
One cannot see or touch the wind, and yet the wind has great power.

335
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,100
The wind may caress you while you know it not exists.

336
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,120
I mean, you know what I'm saying.

337
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,200
Just drop my drawers and let it run right at me right now.

338
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,080
We're not interfacing with the elements.

339
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,940
That's another illusion.

340
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,960
The servants ain't got nothing to do with it.

341
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,480
As long as it's in color, that's all I ask.

342
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,600
Well, it's colored.

343
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,500
It has many different colors, but it's not in color.

344
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,740
We didn't even see in 3D when I was a kid.

345
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,420
It was all flat.

346
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,300
Everything was flat?

347
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Yeah, but as long as it's in color, man, that's virtual enough for me.

348
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,360
Kids don't know that.

349
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,260
They don't remember that.

350
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,100
They think, well, you know, before color TV, there was black and white TV.

351
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,580
But before black and white TV, there was only a two-dimensional world, a flatland world.

352
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,180
Your grandparents grew up in flatland world.

353
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,060
You had to get a three-dimensional being to write A on a piece of paper.

354
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,540
It was only since color TV was invented that the world...

355
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,480
And draw a line.

356
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,580
Yeah, it was only since color TV was invented.

357
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,020
That the world became three-dimensional.

358
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,020
In fact...

359
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:02,240
Only when we started breeding the people with the two eyes that you could even tell the difference.

360
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,140
That was a good idea.

361
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,140
Two instead of one.

362
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,860
And, you know, like, just think of like Goliath and some of these guys that had the one poked out.

363
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,500
Just think if you're in a battle, you could have...

364
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,760
You can't take that crap for granted.

365
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,500
They think it's all...

366
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,720
Oh, yeah, we've always had two eyes.

367
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,360
We've been gifted with two eyes.

368
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,360
That Bob or some other character didn't bestow them on us.

369
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,120
Of course he did.

370
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,160
Or else how would they have come into existence?

371
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,700
You know?

372
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,920
I remember when you were billed for color.

373
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,420
I remember when you were billed for having an extra eyeball.

374
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,060
Remember that?

375
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,980
What happened to the Cyclopses?

376
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,700
The Cyclopses went the way of Mother Westwind.

377
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,540
They just passed into the flying, into the air and never returned.

378
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,840
People think that's like a myth.

379
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,060
They don't know that there really was Cyclopses.

380
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,840
The Betamax.

381
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,880
The Macintosh.

382
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:42,940
Yep.

383
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,840
The American Empire.

384
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,360
Yes.

385
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,120
The Revolution.

386
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,720
Uncle Sam.

387
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,460
All those other extinct creatures.

388
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,060
The Flat Cyclops Revolution.

389
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:50,700
Freedom.

390
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,300
3D freedom.

391
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,640
Other dying things.

392
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,900
Liberty in 4D.

393
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,400
So to speak.

394
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,460
Oh, screw that.

395
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,920
Let's just come up with some formulaic pop idols and sell them as rebellion.

396
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
I tried, man.

397
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,820
What, the little bobbleheads?

398
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,480
I'm lucky if I can get, you know, five or ten CDs sold at a D-Bible.

399
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,860
I tried, man.

400
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,420
The Jesus Christ bobbleheads.

401
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,580
The Reverend Ivan Stang bobbleheads.

402
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,320
These are lovely gifts for anybody or anything.

403
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,880
Pop icon.

404
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,040
Idol.

405
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,360
Well.

406
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,320
No.

407
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,100
I guess we should.

408
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,420
Use the pink bob that Dr. Legume designed for Mojo.

409
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,060
Then he'd be as rich as Mojo.

410
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:27,820
You still.

411
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,820
You gotta, like, wait.

412
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,160
Leave that.

413
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,820
I think.

414
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,540
I think Jackson should be martyred and sanctified and consecrated in the blood of the lamb.

415
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,580
Brittany and Christina.

416
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,620
That's what sells.

417
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,880
If we could just find the perfect teat.

418
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,460
The perfect one tit and nipple.

419
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,880
It lasts a week, though.

420
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,060
The perfect tit flavor only lasts one week and then it begins to sag and then there's

421
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,560
a new tit flavor.

422
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,040
No, but then you got your money and you can.

423
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,880
What you are laundering is the munchkin.

424
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,720
Or the little people flavor of the entire universe.

425
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,220
You're not really copulating with what's great.

426
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,720
With what's superb and what's essential and quintessential.

427
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,720
You know what I'm saying?

428
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,020
Yeah.

429
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,220
You're putting down bubble gum bands, man.

430
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,660
You gotta get sexy in your grill.

431
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,020
I'm just saying.

432
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,400
No.

433
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,820
Are you a snob?

434
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,860
Are you putting down stupid drill?

435
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,080
No.

436
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,460
I'm not.

437
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,440
I'm not snotting.

438
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,920
There's no mucus in my thought.

439
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,800
This is what I am saying.

440
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,200
Pop smears.

441
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,500
Is that they should take at least one tithing's worth and give not only to Bob, but to Bob's

442
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,040
minions and his denizens as well.

443
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,860
Why give it to a fat tit?

444
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,340
Or skinny like Michael Jackson.

445
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,620
That waif, that strange waif.

446
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,720
Look at all the money he's accumulated so he could engage in perversions.

447
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,940
We engage in simple perversions.

448
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,400
We don't need that much money, but we need some.

449
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:34,860
Dave.

450
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,480
His skin doesn't have any color either.

451
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,380
I know, man.

452
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,280
That's some sick ass shit right there.

453
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,480
His songs are just a little more hummable than yours.

454
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,380
I don't know about that.

455
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,120
Look at how he hums with that weird triangle nostril area.

456
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,820
Except for beat me to a pulpit.

457
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,800
But that's very you could I wake up with that coming in.

458
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,300
Yeah, that's a happy little ditty.

459
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,480
But we got decent recordings of the band the other night.

460
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,520
That's incredible.

461
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,680
Even your even even your band.

462
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,400
How strange.

463
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:06,860
Yeah.

464
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,660
Yeah, it was weird.

465
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,320
I cannot offer any solace to you people whatsoever.

466
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,320
I've been having blistering hot, lovely dreams.

467
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,160
I dreamed that I fell asleep in front of watching the subgenius quality channel network the other

468
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,380
night.

469
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,220
And I was hearing things like this.

470
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,980
Oh, we have a wonderful set of figurines here when we got the hundred and we got the new

471
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,760
military figurines, the 103rd ID disfiguring.

472
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,540
They're so beautiful.

473
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,520
And we've also got one looks like Jessica Lynch completely bare chested with an AK-47

474
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,600
in one hand and a box of condoms and a Bible in the other.

475
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,160
And also for the commemorative season, it's the 40th anniversary.

476
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,560
Let's not forget, we got the JFK bobbleheads that swing.

477
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,360
Oh, those are the bobbleheads.

478
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,360


479
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,360


480
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,420
Oh, the head goes back to the far right back into the far right.

481
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,920
And also these wonderful little squanto pumpkin headed children.

482
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,240
And we'd like to.

483
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,020
Oh, I'm watching my TV.

484
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,080
I'm a suspend my disbelief.

485
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,820
When I'm listening to the radio.

486
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,340
I'm a suspend my disbelief.

487
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,340


488
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,000
And I don't mind them lying.

489
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,440
Cause lying is what they'll do.

490
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:34,020
And I don't mind them trying to get in my head, too.

491
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,200
But when they come around and bring the electrodes to my town, slap them in my brain and then

492
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,580
they slap my body down, the fans are driving up and then the mind can blow them down.

493
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,300
And everybody's singing.

494
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,320
Everybody's singing.

495
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,320


496
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,320


497
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,320


498
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,880
And become unusual

499
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,680
Ooh

500
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,740
Ooh

501
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,380
Governor on the mansion

502
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,080
And the cop on the beat

503
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,480
Ooh

504
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,080
I'ma suspend my disbelief

505
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,940
Ooh

506
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,040
Watching my radio

507
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,660
Listening to my TV

508
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,640
I'ma suspend my disbelief

509
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,500
Ooh

510
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,380
And I don't mind them dying

511
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,820
Cause dying is what they'll do

512
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,820
I don't mind them dying

513
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,720
I have them in my house

514
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,340
I don't want them dying on you

515
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,200
When they come around

516
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
With their mind control devices

517
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,040
Ready to plug them in

518
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,900
And do all the things they like

519
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,120
And they put my head in

520
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,960
And they pull the hose out

521
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,440
And they jump around

522
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,200
Until I can't see anymore

523
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,800
Ooh

524
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,960
Ooh

525
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,020
Ooh

526
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,680
I'ma suspend my disbelief

527
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,460
Ooh

528
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,540
I'ma suspend my disbelief

529
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,340
Ooh

530
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,180
I'ma suspend my disbelief

531
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,060
Ooh

532
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,900
I'ma suspend my disbelief

533
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,760
Ooh

534
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,760
I'ma suspend my disbelief

535
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,480
Ooh

536
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,500
I'ma suspend my disbelief

537
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,240
Ooh

538
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,600
Ooh

539
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,820
I must suspend my disbelief

540
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,540
I must suspend my disbelief

541
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,680
I must crush all my former beliefs

542
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,160
I must suspend my disbelief

543
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,780
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

544
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,980
And now...

545
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,860
Nicholas wasn't on anything, I was certain of that.

546
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,200
And if I do get to sleep, Nicholas said shakily, I have dreadful nightmares.

547
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,940
He told me one of them.

548
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,300
In the dream, he was shut in a tiny cage under the Colosseum in ancient Rome.

549
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,280
In the sky overhead, huge winged lizards were searching for him.

550
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,480
All at once the flying lizards detected his presence under the Colosseum.

551
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,280
They swept down and in an instant were tearing open the door of his cage.

552
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,280
Trapped with death at hand, all Nicholas could do was hiss at the lizards.

553
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,900
Evidently he was a small mammal of some kind.

554
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,200
Once more the impression had begun to come over me by slow degrees that I was in Rome,

555
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,120
not in Orange County, California.

556
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,280
I sensed the empire without seeing it.

557
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,860
I sensed a vast iron prison in which human slaves toiled.

558
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:56,380
I saw as if superimposed on the black metal walls of this huge prison certain rapidly scurrying creatures in grey robes,

559
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,620
enemies of the empire and its tyranny.

560
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,120
A remnant opposed to it.

561
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:07,920
And I knew from a deep internal clock down within my own self that the true time was AD 70.

562
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,380
That the savior had come and gone but would soon return.

563
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,840
The grey robed hurrying remnant with a feeling of joy,

564
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
awaited and prepared for his return.

565
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,800
I was in deadly danger from the spies of Rome.

566
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,520
The Roman agents would kill me in an instant.

567
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,960
It was empire policy.

568
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,980
It was an ancient fight I was in, not a new one.

569
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,680
It had been fought without cease for two thousand years.

570
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,000
Names had changed, faces had changed, and the adversaries remained a permanent constant.

571
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,600
The slave empire against those who struggled for justice and truth,

572
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,820
not freedom exactly,

573
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,760
in the modern sense,

574
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,360
but for virtues obscured today,

575
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:53,040
buried under the bulk of an empire that embraced both the United States and the Soviet Union as twin,

576
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
equal manifestations.

577
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,900
The US and the USSR, I understood,

578
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,040
were the two portions of the empire as divided up by the emperor Diocletian,

579
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,740
for purely administrative purposes.

580
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,200
At heart it was a single entity with a single value system,

581
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,860
and its value system was the concept of the supremacy of the state.

582
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,880
The individual counted in its scales as nothing,

583
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,820
and individuals who turned against the state,

584
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,820
and generated their own values,

585
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,500
were the enemy.

586
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,060
We were the enemy.

587
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,600
We who wore the grey robes and waited with eager anticipation for our king to return.

588
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,140
Would we be able to survive against the Romans,

589
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,460
by stealth, since we had no worldly power until he returned?

590
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,860
Or would he return to find us gone,

591
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,540
or worse, assimilated into the customs of the empire,

592
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,560
our own memory of what we actually were lost forever,

593
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,520
or perhaps,

594
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,600
lost until, by his return, he could restore such memories,

595
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
reawaken in sleeping men a forgotten knowledge of who they were?

596
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,860
Rome was here now.

597
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,780
It had invaded the landscape, rising up from within it,

598
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,440
manifesting itself from its centuries-long place of inner concealment.

599
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,980
Rather than me being back in the ancient world,

600
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,020
Rome had revealed itself as the underlying reality of our present-day world.

601
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,560
Hidden still from the eyes of other Americans,

602
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,400
it was nonetheless blatantly visible to me.

603
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,140
The empire had never died.

604
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,440
It had only receded,

605
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:13,980
out of sight.

606
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,520
A reading from Philip K. Dick's Radio Free Album of...

607
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,900
It's All Crap!

608
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,520
Radio DJs and new strip malls,

609
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,220
the record contract and the softcore bond,

610
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,320
The music, television, chemical on,

611
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,400
the critics' choice in over-counted drugs,

612
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,220
It's All Crap!

613
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,320
I've been sharing the current in song,

614
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,380
the CD prices and the oil wars,

615
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,080
It's All Crap!

616
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,480
The new age wisdom and the smarter bombs,

617
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,560
the Microsoft turd and the liquor laws,

618
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,260
Gimme some more, gimme some more, gimme gimme gimme more,

619
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,080
It's All Crap!

620
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,540
Gimme some more, gimme some more, gimme gimme gimme more,

621
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:19,980
It's All Crap!

622
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,020
More crap!

623
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,920
It's All Crap!

624
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,280
Hippie jam bands and the new self-help,

625
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,340
The pop-up ad and the smoking laws,

626
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:31,960
It's All Crap!

627
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,300
The new sitcom reality show,

628
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,720
The cheese taco steak pizza chemical nacho,

629
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,260
It's All Crap!

630
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,480
Milwaukee taco with the dumb fight song,

631
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,020
The gated clone housing with the phone,

632
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,420
The old facade,

633
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,360
It's All Crap!

634
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,600
Drunk dead hymns in the dress-up show,

635
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,840
The embedded breast of the bro-tux hoe,

636
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,580
Gimme some more, gimme some more, gimme gimme gimme more,

637
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,600
It's All Crap!

638
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,860
Gimme some more, gimme some more, gimme gimme gimme more,

639
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,720
It's All Crap!

640
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,580
It's All Crap!

641
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,940
It's All Crap!

642
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,500
It's All Crap!

643
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,400
Man!

644
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,360
Again, dear friends, from the CD called Machine.

645
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,000
More on man at beerforman.com.

646
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,100
Incidentally, this music in the background is from Automatic Robot Fish,

647
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:34,280
which is the side project of Reverend Angry Larry of the amino acids.

648
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,120
Yes, Automatic Robot Fish.

649
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,200
And now...

650
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,080
Oh boy.

651
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,160
It's just getting worse every day.

652
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,380
We complain, but we never do anything.

653
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,960
Like, what could we possibly do?

654
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,280
Could we go to the mirror?

655
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,000
Complain louder!

656
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,220
Well, you know, more specifically...

657
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,920
We need to be louder.

658
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,780
The sufferers are fanning us.

659
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,080
Buy more amps, man.

660
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,220
A little tiny man with a huge beat.

661
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,760
The music will save society.

662
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,160
The dance music is different.

663
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,040
Buy bigger speakers and buy more Marshall amps, man.

664
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,740
We're gonna need them.

665
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,160
We're gonna have to buy them.

666
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


667
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


668
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


669
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


670
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


671
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


672
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


673
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


674
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


675
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


676
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,160


677
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,860
We're gonna have to series every amp in America together.

678
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,680
Could you imagine?

679
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,260
And we'll have Humvees to go around and do it.

680
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:18,620
Yeah.

681
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,520
And we'll have every amp in America...

682
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:20,820
Say that for a little bit, Camel Gear.

683
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,460
We'll be series linked together, and every guitar player in America will hit that one

684
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,740
big power chord.

685
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,200
Bill and Ted were right!

686
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,200
And then...

687
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,720
So on a little time ok?

688
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:00,840


689
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,240
And now I want sentence passed.

690
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,780
I want the death penalty.

691
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,960
I want to be executed according to the laws of the state.

692
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,400
I know my rights.

693
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,320
What right do you have to that information?

694
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,120
What right do you have to that information?

695
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,440
Mind control.

696
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,220
What?

697
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,620
Mind control.

698
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,840
Lady, you are out of your mind.

699
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,600
You are conspiring to commit mind control.

700
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,160
Mind control.

701
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:39,960
What?

702
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,260
Mind control.

703
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,460
Lady, you are out of your mind.

704
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,280
You are conspiring to commit mind control.

705
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,900
They put microchips in their heads, and then it works sort of like remote control.

706
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,120
They've been at it since World War II.

707
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:55,860
Oh.

708
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,560
Drugs.

709
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,320
Psychosurgery.

710
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,740
Mental medicine.

711
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,420
Manipulation.

712
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,920
Break them down.

713
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,740
Build them up.

714
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,760
They've been at it since World War II.

715
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,480
Oh.

716
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,180
Drugs.

717
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,000
Psychosurgery.

718
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,600
Mental manipulation.

719
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,500
Break them down.

720
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,360
Build them up.

721
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,540
You don't know paranoia, my friend.

722
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,460
You just don't know.

723
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,240
Three ways to die.

724
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,960
I choose the firing squad.

725
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,380
Can you do that?

726
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,840
Uh, Reverend Norell Preff did that.

727
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:44,420
And more about Reverend Norell Preff's work, and some of his work, at www.heavyconfetti.com.

728
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,360
And, uh...

729
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,640
Hey, where's my saw?

730
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,360
We're sawing now, baby.

731
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,820
We're chopping wood.

732
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,440
I remember the way the furniture used to be in here.

733
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,040
Ah.

734
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,180
Stang once spoke of the church of the subgenius.

735
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,240
What?

736
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,460
That old thing? Oh, that old thing?

737
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,820
He once spoke of it.

738
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:16,220
That tired, old, worn-out, old, dandruff-covered, grimy, mangy old church.

739
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,940
Tired as an old moley bag.

740
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:23,120
Tired old whore of a thing, an old mattress-back whore of a religion.

741
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,800
An old grandmotherly prostitute with moles all over her gizzardly gizzard,

742
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,660
and her craw is all covered with crusted things, too.

743
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,120
That church would spread for anybody.

744
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,180
And it has.

745
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,620
50 cents, line up.

746
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,240
It spread across the land and now across the world.

747
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,340
Oh, a lot of them went for it.

748
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,180
They like to dirty themselves, you know.

749
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,540
Yes.

750
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,320
It turns them on.

751
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,160
It gave them those blue pine foreheads, those wolfish faces.

752
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,040
Oh, everyone liked to lick the wisdom teat of the church of the subgenius,

753
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,480
but no one had the correct eyesight to see what was going on.

754
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,700
Yeah, but we've moved.

755
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,400
We've moved up to a better religion now.

756
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,320
The wisdom teat itself.

757
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,480
The religion of the conical Christ.

758
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,420
It just goes straight to the teat.

759
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,600
The wisdom, oh, oh, yeah.

760
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,020
There is no God.

761
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,100
There is no absolute.

762
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,920
There is no Bob for certainly, and there is no Connie.

763
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,720
There is only.

764
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,620
Well, there might be a Bob and Connie, but they're just going to rip you off.

765
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,200
Well, they're just like image crackpots in the background.

766
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,460
They're what you call the scenery for the scene.

767
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
You know, they're prop people.

768
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,160
Oh, they make you love being ripped off.

769
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,840
They teach you.

770
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,600
They literally do.

771
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,780
They aren't lying when they say they teach you to enjoy.

772
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,140
Enjoy it.

773
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,880
You're being ripped off every day.

774
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,580
You can learn to enjoy it.

775
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,280
That's true.

776
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,340
But you never do learn to enjoy it.

777
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,980
It feels like your forehead's being raped every second of your life.

778
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,020
No, no, I enjoyed it.

779
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,740
When I was a cult member, I enjoyed the hell out of being ripped off by Bob.

780
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,120
I gave him everything.

781
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,820
I knew I was being ripped off.

782
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:43,960
I know you did.

783
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,320
And I felt free, man.

784
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,560
I felt totally free.

785
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,100
But you know.

786
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:47,860
That's sick.

787
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,880
I just, to me, it was like I'll do anything to taste lobster and steak again.

788
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,120
And blood.

789
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,320
And blood.

790
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,000
So I sold out.

791
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,120
Sold out.

792
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,600
And got this contract here and these handcuffs.

793
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,260
And you'll be coming with me, Dave.

794
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,680
Not at the same time, I hope.

795
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,880
I mean, we're grown up gentlemen.

796
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,740
We're not into that.

797
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,300
Like, you know.

798
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,820
Like, remember when you were little?

799
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,120
You'd all go off in the woods and maybe rape or burn one of the other children.

800
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,700
Speak for yourself, Dave.

801
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,480
We just did that with animals when I was a kid in Texas.

802
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,880
We didn't rape or burn other kids.

803
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,100
Just little animals.

804
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,980
They were ostracized children that you chose to call animals.

805
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:25,640
Yeah.

806
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:25,980
Yeah.

807
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:25,980


808
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:25,980


809
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:25,980


810
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:25,980


811
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:25,980


812
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:25,980


813
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:25,980


814
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:25,980


815
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,880
They weren't animals.

816
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,660
They might as well be.

817
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,020
Pobuckers are animals.

818
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,180
They had beaks and feathers and liverly wings.

819
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,100
And they had like little.

820
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,680
Pobuckers are as low as animals.

821
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,860
It's like if you eat a Pobucker face sandwich, that's no different from a bologna sandwich.

822
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,940
A Pobucker face?

823
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,860
Bob's eyes.

824
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,580
Well, what do they commonly use in the South for, you know, dressing for a face sandwich?

825
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:55,840
To Bob's taste buds, you're, to quote Jane, your grandma's face would taste as good as

826
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,560
a bologna sandwich.

827
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,920
It'd be all the same to him.

828
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,660
But have you guys actually tasted grandma's bologna face?

829
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,280
I mean, is, or is this just another one of those, you know, hollow pronouncements?

830
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,180
I honestly don't know.

831
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,640
I heard the old guys talking about it like it was a real thing.

832
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,640
You know how those guys are.

833
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,360
They'll try to blow your mind.

834
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:13,860
Yeah.

835
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,420
The barbershop subgeniuses.

836
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:15,760
Yeah.

837
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,420
They like this.

838
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:16,880
Bob's friends.

839
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,780
Those are G. Gordon, Gordon and Philo and those guys.

840
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,080
They're, you never know.

841
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,140
Very philosophically.

842
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,540
Like him.

843
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,420
You don't, well, yeah, but you don't know how much.

844
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,160
Kind of hardcore.

845
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,040
Talk.

846
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,240
I can't handle that kind of hardcore talk.

847
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,680
Okay.

848
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,920
Just cut that hardcore talk out now.

849
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,660
Okay, boys.

850
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,400
Well, we can't.

851
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,800
But the miracles are real.

852
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,880
I've seen miracles.

853
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,700
Miracles are hardcore.

854
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,840
I've seen the healings.

855
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,320
I've seen people vomit.

856
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,940
I've seen people vomit up their sickness.

857
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,240
I've seen people lose the sickness that causes them to walk so that finally they could crawl

858
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,220
out of that temple of Bob.

859
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,340
They could crawl again, my friends.

860
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,500
I've seen, I've seen people at subgenius church revivals.

861
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Who have actually fallen down the floor and found their face in a baloney sandwich and

862
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,760
cannot turn their face to the baloney sandwich or their face to their bodies proper.

863
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,620
I've seen subgeniuses fall down and vomit out vile things that were the accruedment of

864
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,860
other lives, which did not actually exist.

865
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,840
They're picking up caca from other realms and spitting it out.

866
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,060
That's how they get up.

867
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,680
That's how they get high.

868
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,580
They fall down.

869
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,200
Yeah.

870
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,340
It's free.

871
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,100
That's what you call a sickening.

872
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,140
They snap fingers.

873
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,280
They laugh.

874
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,980
They bang.

875
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,160
They hit their head against hammers and things.

876
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,080
It's, it's, it's a thing that Bob teaches.

877
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,880
And most of them had very, very unfortunate childhoods and look at them now having a fortunate

878
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,740
adulthood.

879
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,800
They are the happiest people you'll ever hope to see because you know something?

880
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,480
They don't know something, you know, they do.

881
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,280
And they have that look on their face, that self-satisfied smirk because they've lost

882
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,540
those brain cells that torment you.

883
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,280
No.

884
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,060
Well, maybe not you, Dave.

885
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,640
But you.

886
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,480
I mean, yeah.

887
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,640
The generic you.

888
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,520
Rule number one.

889
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,380
The listener who still has a brain cell.

890
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,560
Rule number one.

891
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,900
Never commit adultery with an adult tree.

892
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,540
Rule number true.

893
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,700
Uh, number, and rule number two.

894
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,640
Never commit vile acts of vileness with a subgenius humoral or any other person assigned

895
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,260
with papers.

896
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,080
I, I'm sorry.

897
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,300
I, I.

898
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
It's very complicated.

899
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,120
It is.

900
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,900
It gets more complicated.

901
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,820
It's also very interesting.

902
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,100
I can't read the fine print.

903
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,140
Well, it's, it's a legal nightmare.

904
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,740
It's become, the whole thing has become.

905
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,680
Just a legal nightmare.

906
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,860
A trademark and copyright nightmare.

907
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,220
A living death of, of plagiarism.

908
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,100
And shame.

909
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,080
Remorse.

910
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,660
Legal briefs and files.

911
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,500
Slacklessness is what it is.

912
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,020
Slacklessness.

913
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,840
It's because of the hypocrite.

914
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,840
The hypocrite.

915
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,240
Oh, he, oh, he talks, he talks big, big on Bob.

916
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,720
But can he act?

917
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,640
His teeth whistle.

918
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,240
He talks slack.

919
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,960
But does he, does he understand what slack is?

920
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,200
He would not know slack.

921
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,360
He would not know slack.

922
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,420
He would not know slack.

923
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:55,740
When a man.

924
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,880
He called up his urethra in the form of an Amazonian snake.

925
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,560
That's correct.

926
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,740
That is correct.

927
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,480
He wouldn't know it if Slack bit him from the inside and chewed its way up his kidneys.

928
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,900
He wouldn't know.

929
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:14,280
He wouldn't understand the thing in front of him if it stood behind him.

930
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,760
It's a form of fealty.

931
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,020
It's a form of loyalty.

932
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,900
It's a form of inverse freedom.

933
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,160
We need it.

934
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:28,020
He wouldn't know Slack if he was buried up to his neck in the middle of it with the ants chewing his eyeballs out.

935
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,420
Nope.

936
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,360
He wouldn't understand a single...

937
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,040
He wouldn't recognize the Slack he had at that time.

938
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:42,140
If he walked out of the window and the bug ran over his pajamas, it's not something easily understood.

939
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,560
No, they don't get it.

940
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,100
They can't get it because they're not born with the Yeti blood.

941
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,000
They don't have the blood coursing through their veins.

942
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,580
The snowman of the Himalaya.

943
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,780
The so-called abominable snowman.

944
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,980
To some, I'm sure he's abominable.

945
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,460
But to us, he's a beautiful thing.

946
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,100
Daintily, daintily, we step on each plantain.

947
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,700
And each door opens and Bob's face is there.

948
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,540
And yet, he eludes us.

949
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,380
He eludes us.

950
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,000
He drifts.

951
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,360
The elusive J.R. Bob dogs.

952
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,800
The more we smile, the more he grits his teeth and clenches that pipe down fast.

953
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,140
The harder you clutch for him, the slipperier...

954
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,020
The faster you run after him, the faster he gets away from you.

955
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,220
Oh, yeah, Bob's looking for clean socks, too, just like every indigent American in this society.

956
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,140
He saves you.

957
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,080
That is what...

958
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,980
If he lets you get close to him, where's your slack gonna go?

959
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,140
Straight up his pipe.

960
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,440
He's gonna smoke.

961
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,220
He's gonna huff it.

962
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,280
His dorsal pipe, my friend.

963
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,100
He's taking you on in a form, friends.

964
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,960
He's suppressing his own self so that he may meld with you.

965
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,220
He does not just put you on.

966
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,060
He takes you on.

967
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,500
He becomes one with you.

968
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,420
He wears you, and then he takes you off.

969
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,540
He wears you like an old dirty Brooks Brothers suit from Gentleman's Wear.

970
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:08,920
He wipes with you, and then he flushes you away to heaven.

971
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,980
To eternal slack, friend.

972
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:20,720
When you've been that which Bob used to wipe with, friend, then you know slack from inside.

973
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,880
Yes.

974
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,080
It's slick.

975
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,100
It's more than lies and cabbage, friend.

976
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,200
Slack can be slick.

977
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,400
100% truth in a brown paper bag.

978
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,000
And you want to soak that slack up with a fine, porous tissue.

979
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,540
No.

980
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,780
You want something gentle to get that slack.

981
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,940
You'll need a shovel.

982
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:47,660
Every drop, every little vestige of it, you will need a gentle yet porous tissue of slack absorbent tissue.

983
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,520
I think you need one of these star trusses.

984
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,940
I don't know what he said, but it's true.

985
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,740
It's so true.

986
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,220
I said you need a star-scrushing, star-scrushing screwdriver.

987
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
Dang to get in.

988
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:08,660
You need a double-ply slack-absorbent wipe, and that's what you are to J.R. Bob Dogg.

989
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,620
And you need that chainsaw and a bag of eggs.

990
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:19,420
When you feel that slack running up your leg and grabbing you and humping on your leg,

991
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,080
that's the real slack, baby.

992
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,540
That's the old dog you've been trying to...

993
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,540
That's loyalty.

994
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,240
Look how that thing loves you.

995
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,300
He humps your leg like a dog.

996
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,820
Slack comes to you just like that when you...

997
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,720
He's loyal like a dog, and he drinks out of the toilet like a dog.

998
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,380
When you have slack awareness, yes.

999
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:37,920
You shall.

1000
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,500
And forevermore.

1001
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,060
It's not a place that we take lightly.

1002
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,360
You can drink from Bob's toilet, friend.

1003
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,200
Yes.

1004
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,100
He'll leave the lid up for you.

1005
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,760
Yeah, Bob always leaves the lid up.

1006
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,500
And the light on.

1007
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,260
Well, maybe not the light on, but the lid up.

1008
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,200
Yeah, watch out for them urinal cakes.

1009
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,260
They can be toxic.

1010
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
They can cause instant paralysis.

1011
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,460
You can eat at Bob's, friends.

1012
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:10,760
I think what I'm going to do is, uh, in my more normal and happiest, happiest basis,

1013
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:17,100
I will put my head in this aperture here, the commode.

1014
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,660
He will feed your need for...

1015
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,780
Slap from behind.

1016
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,860
I know all the rituals, damn you.

1017
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,360
Let me get my head in here.

1018
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,680
I think what I will do is just fly away from here.

1019
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,940
You don't know!

1020
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,180
You don't know!

1021
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,940
I can see his face now.

1022
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,740
I can see him in my mind's nostril.

1023
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,240
My third nostril is opening.

1024
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,540
Wow.

1025
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,880
It's like a saint's day for all werewolves.

1026
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,720
I can see palm trees and beautiful babes dancing and little...

1027
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,140
Clarinets falling from the sky.

1028
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:52,840
I see him too.

1029
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,560
I see him too.

1030
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,980
Look, it's wooden human in the front...

1031
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,200
I'm getting confused again.

1032
00:42:59,260 --> 00:42:59,840
Somebody better...

1033
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,900
He can sure play guitar, though, can't he?

1034
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,400
Yeah.

1035
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,480
Wooden human could really play.

1036
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,000
Six on each feet, man.

1037
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,840
Look at those fingers fly.

1038
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,360
Yeah, Bob's fingers had wings on them.

1039
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,040
Bob was part of one of the old dinosaur crew itself.

1040
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,300
Used to fly like a pterodactyl.

1041
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,320
And picked those strings like a chicken.

1042
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,240
He'd bite them with his beak.

1043
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,600
He was crazy, man!

1044
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,900
He was...

1045
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,920
He was crazy.

1046
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,900
He was crazy, man.

1047
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,940
I love that guy.

1048
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,900
He gave his...

1049
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,460
He gave his...

1050
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,940
He gave something for me, man.

1051
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,920
He gave for my snack.

1052
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,140
He gave his wife for my snack.

1053
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,860
He gave those...

1054
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,400
Don't be cynical, Sean.

1055
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,000
Sit down.

1056
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,000
You're gonna believe.

1057
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:48,820
You're gonna believe.

1058
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,580
You're gonna believe.

1059
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,800
You will never believe.

1060
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,880
I can't keep from frying sometimes.

1061
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,300
The supernatural.

1062
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,040
The supernatural.

1063
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,880
This is a proof.

1064
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,880
This is a proof.

1065
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,140
The supernatural.

1066
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,660
The supernatural.

1067
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,000
The supernatural.

1068
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,600
The supernatural.

1069
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:02,260


1070
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,080
Signal, the famous Goldfarber gasoline.

1071
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,320
Invite you to sit back and enjoy another strange story.

1072
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,120
The supernatural.

1073
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,840
The supernatural.

1074
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,760
This is a proof.

1075
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,740
This is a proof.

1076
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,040
The supernatural.

1077
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,540
The supernatural.

1078
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,820
The supernatural.

1079
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,480
This is a proof.

1080
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:55,480


1081
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,320
The supernatural.

1082
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,360
This is a proof.

1083
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,340
This is a proof.

1084
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,680
The supernatural.

1085
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,020
This is a proof.

1086
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,020


1087
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,180
The supernatural.

1088
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,200
The supernatural.

1089
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,880
Signal, the famous Goldfarber gasoline.

1090
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,080
Invite you to sit back and enjoy another strange story.

1091
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,120
And more Nor-El-Pref.

1092
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,940
And now, more Nor-El-Pref.

1093
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,220
Sit down and say, okay, number two, then stick with me.

1094
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,180
And as a result, you feel rejected.

1095
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,820
You might feel uncomfortable.

1096
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,220
We tend to hallucinate when we say, I feel bored.

1097
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,340
I feel foolish.

1098
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,040
I feel insecure.

1099
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,100
How do you respond to that?

1100
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,800
The guilt's going to come back.

1101
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,300
It'll get you sooner or later.

1102
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,220
It's back there.

1103
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,000
It's deep.

1104
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,740
It's dark.

1105
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,720
It'll get you.

1106
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,280
Good.

1107
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,120
How stupid.

1108
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,520
You can feel really bad.

1109
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,440
You can feel disappointed.

1110
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,300
You can feel frustrated.

1111
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:54,920
You can feel angry.

1112
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,580
You can feel hurt.

1113
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,400
You can feel sad.

1114
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,360
And remember, nothing in life has any meaning.

1115
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,580
I feel like I was meant for something more than this.

1116
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,680
I want to do something with my life.

1117
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,980
I want to be somebody.

1118
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,520
Craft and destroy freedom-loving people everywhere.

1119
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,500
I feel like I was meant for something more than this.

1120
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,740
I want to do something.

1121
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,600
I want to do something with my life.

1122
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,900
I want to be somebody.

1123
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,440
Craft and destroy freedom-loving people everywhere.

1124
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,220
We prefer to keep our powder dry.

1125
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,260
What are your opinions on post-war planning and the peace show?

1126
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,840
You know, a dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier, there's no question about it.

1127
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,140
No, I've always...

1128
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,160
You know, a dictatorship would be...

1129
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,180
What are your opinions on post-war planning and the peace show?

1130
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,020
No, I've always...

1131
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,780
You know, a dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier, there's no question about it.

1132
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,740
No, I've always...

1133
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,040
We prefer to keep our powder dry.

1134
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:17,120
Boy, listen to those lovely guns.

1135
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,100
There's nothing lovely about them, Trigger.

1136
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:19,680
What?

1137
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,420
As long as people anywhere can hear that sound,

1138
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,200
we haven't taught anybody a thing.

1139
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,920
Slogans, guns.

1140
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,440
They don't settle anything.

1141
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,240
They only lead to suicide.

1142
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,800
Not only for kamikazes, but for the world.

1143
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,140
That's the reason they let's teach the Tasha and all the rest of them.

1144
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,420
Yep.

1145
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,840
And maybe even ourselves.

1146
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,820
What about what them French did to those poor Huron Indians?

1147
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,800
I wouldn't blame the French for doing nothing after what happened.

1148
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,120
The Huron Indians?

1149
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,000
Yeah.

1150
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,780
The Huron Indians.

1151
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,140
The Huron Indians and Quebecers.

1152
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,280
Yeah, what about them sub-Furrier Indians from Minnesota?

1153
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,880
They got them all sick and they all died and the Iroquois wiped them out.

1154
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,920
Chaz still feels guilty about this crap that happened hundreds of years ago involving people he's never met.

1155
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,660
Stank doesn't know.

1156
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,600
People he's not even related to, even descended from.

1157
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,260
Stank.

1158
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,840
Has nothing at all to do with it.

1159
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,260
Stank.

1160
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,720
But he's still just feeling this terrible, terrible feelings over this.

1161
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,380
We were lied to.

1162
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,420
No, not evil feelings.

1163
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,860
I want to see him rise up and, you know, wipe.

1164
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,460
Hey, I think Whitey's done a pretty bad job.

1165
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,100
In Ohio history, Stank, you don't know.

1166
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,220
I think Whitey is really due for a, you know.

1167
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,500
Whitey has been around not very long.

1168
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,440
Whitey's going down.

1169
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,680
I have firm confidence that Whitey's going down by his own hand.

1170
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,640
Whitey's going down.

1171
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,860
He's going to be making beans by the old railroad tracks.

1172
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,920
Who are you trying to kiss right now?

1173
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,180
Whitey and Reddy.

1174
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,020
I think you're in love with Frenchies summer, fall, winter, spring.

1175
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,720
I think there's a beautiful Indian maiden who has her eye on you and you are trying to butter up to her.

1176
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,420
No, I agree.

1177
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,140
Brother's going down with him because he's, you know, right there.

1178
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,180
If you guys would study Ohio.

1179
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:13,560
Remember Ohio history, Chaz, how they made it sound like the white guys came here and nobody was here?

1180
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,680
And now all this stuff is coming out.

1181
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,240
There were thousands.

1182
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,860
There were big towns everywhere.

1183
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,960
They're just blown away.

1184
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,500
Modern society.

1185
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,520
Modern society's going down.

1186
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,020
Just like, hey, man, you stole some of my pie.

1187
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,680
I'll kill all 12 of you, you know.

1188
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,560
And all this stuff is coming out now because everybody has Stang's attitude.

1189
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,600
Oh, that happened so long ago.

1190
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,260
Modern society's going down.

1191
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,680
I haven't seen the Burger Kings closing.

1192
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,480
I've seen them multiplying.

1193
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,700
I've seen the multi-play cinema spread from town to town.

1194
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,760
They aren't drying up and going away.

1195
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,400
They aren't drying up and going away.

1196
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,460
The Starbucks and bought.

1197
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,800
Monsterbusters aren't disappearing.

1198
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:51,620
They're growing.

1199
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,960
They copulate with one another.

1200
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,320
What happens when a Starbucks copulates with a McDonald's?

1201
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,500
What kind of weird monster would you have then?

1202
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:05,420
What happens when one of those little bugs, like the factory-made AIDS virus, gets out of control and wipes everybody?

1203
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,780
The other day I got a two-headed hamburger.

1204
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,820
Well, you can always pray and hope, Chaz, but in the meantime, you're just praying and hoping.

1205
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,420
I actually know.

1206
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,500
If you're not going to Fort Detrick, breaking down the doors with machine guns and saying,

1207
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,000
Smash that file! I want the world like all dead now!

1208
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,320
Then you're just part of the problem and not part of the solution.

1209
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:33,620
If you look at the statistics, Africa really is getting wiped out, and it's moving through everything now.

1210
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,040
It's just not in the news.

1211
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,200
It's not moving through.

1212
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,280
So that you don't think about it, and you don't think, oh, it'll never come here.

1213
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,040
You've got to check your internet.

1214
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,280
If you don't know what's going on, you know.

1215
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,140
You're going to be living on batteries and old soap or something.

1216
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,100
Dave, we're already living on batteries and old soap.

1217
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:57,480
There's lots of people who never, ever get those diseases you're talking about.

1218
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,340
They'll be just fine because they use people like us as doormats and soldiers.

1219
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,840
It'll be the tribal people.

1220
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:04,960
Doormats and soldiers.

1221
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,060
That sounds like the name of a band.

1222
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,940
Doormats and soldiers.

1223
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,480
Down in the rainforest.

1224
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:15,300
Well, I think you should put your ghost shirt on and go down to that protest and charge them cops.

1225
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,980
Put on your ghost shirt.

1226
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:17,840
Save the world.

1227
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,780
You will be invisible to the white man's bullets.

1228
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,400
They will not be able to see you or shoot you.

1229
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,520
Take your whale to the rainforest and set him free, baby.

1230
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,000
Carve it up and set it free.

1231
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,540
I don't need to do any of that.

1232
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,240
Yeah, that's right.

1233
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,020
Wait, what am I being a mediator?

1234
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,360
Why do you have this need to tell me what to do?

1235
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,200
Why don't you guys just start duking it right out here in the studio?

1236
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,520
I'm just being sarcastic.

1237
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,600
I'm not seriously telling anybody what to do.

1238
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,920
I'm just being a downer.

1239
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,620
I'm just being a sarcastic old.

1240
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:44,940
Yeah.

1241
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,200
Yeah.

1242
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,200
I'm a man of tankerous.

1243
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,740
Oh, devil's advocate bummer guy.

1244
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,420
I see a balloon.

1245
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,720
I've got this peen.

1246
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,760
I've got to pop it.

1247
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,440
No, actually, the anthropological computer models.

1248
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,980
I'm the old beaten cushion man.

1249
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:07,900
The anthropological computer models that are modeling humanity right now show a big, huge breakdown coming sometime between 2010 and 2020.

1250
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,080
Well, of course, a computer's going to tell you that.

1251
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,720
That's what you've seen Terminator and Matrix.

1252
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,800
Okay, Terminator, Matrix.

1253
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,540
That's telling you what's going on, baby.

1254
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,760
No, it's just a big calculator.

1255
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:17,980
That's all it is.

1256
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,360
Calculating unrenewable and renewable resources and how fast they can do it.

1257
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,980
The big computer succubus or incubus is going to come down and suck the bus.

1258
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:25,680
Yeah, right.

1259
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,580
Or it's going to impregnate us all with its, you know, thoughts, so to speak.

1260
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,580
Hey, you need to go change its ink cartridge, Dave.

1261
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,240
Right now?

1262
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:33,620
Yes.

1263
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,540
It's asking.

1264
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,060
That beeping, that means you have to go change its ink cartridge.

1265
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,460
The ink cartridge of the beast.

1266
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,400
The beep sounds different, though.

1267
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,720
The computer beast that runs the universe, planet Earth.

1268
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,280
It needs its ink cartridge.

1269
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,960
I think that's just the radio alarm clock for DJ A.

1270
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,860
I think his forehead's waking up.

1271
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,740
Oh, it's out of paper.

1272
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,760
You need to go.

1273
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,140
You just need to go put some new paper.

1274
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,720
All right.

1275
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,840
I can't believe anything.

1276
00:53:59,180 --> 00:53:59,820
I'm going to die.

1277
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,860
Hey, Dave.

1278
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:03,700
What does this really mean?

1279
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,200
Hey, Dave, I'm collecting money for the rainforest.

1280
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,080
That is so disgusting.

1281
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:08,760
Give me some.

1282
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,420
You're watching full.

1283
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,360
Stop it.

1284
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:11,700
No.

1285
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,620
We're going to set the whales free in the rainforest.

1286
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,060
Man.

1287
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,540
God, what a great idea.

1288
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,840
Give me money.

1289
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,260
Free Charlie?

1290
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,160
We're going to bring free?

1291
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,320
We're going to bring mansion and the whales into the?

1292
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,280
Charlie was innocent, man.

1293
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,440
The pigs lied.

1294
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,400
Man.

1295
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,940
Charlie's innocence is a form of, it's a euphemism for the innocence of a mad murderer.

1296
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,380
Of course, he is innocent in his ways, but he's not innocent of crime.

1297
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,620
Hey, man, Charlie's just doing what Chaz wants to see done worldwide.

1298
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,380
It's just end it all.

1299
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,520
Hey, man, that's not us.

1300
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,780
One pig at a time.

1301
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,120
One pig at a time.

1302
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:45,900
And you know, you've got to learn to act locally.

1303
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,280
Wait, I don't want to see that.

1304
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:47,880
I'm just.

1305
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,020
I don't want to kiss a pig any time.

1306
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,520
Hey, I don't want to see anything.

1307
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,000
Say, go on, believe me, act locally.

1308
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,040
We'll kiss your pigs.

1309
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:53,200
That's what Charlie did.

1310
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:53,820
Come on, man.

1311
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,720
I don't want to see anything.

1312
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,060
I'm just reporting the.

1313
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,280
The snout bristles and everything.

1314
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,400
Nobody needs that.

1315
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,080
Guys, they're all local.

1316
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,600
I think they have some kind of big generator like in that old Star Trek with Landru's blue

1317
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,540
and red days when everybody go crazy on certain days with a generator.

1318
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,640
Well, one thing we know.

1319
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,200
I think they have that.

1320
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,220
One thing we know from all the media we've seen.

1321
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,060
When they.

1322
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,080
The red glowing lights are evil and blue glowing lights are good.

1323
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:18,980
See, that's right.

1324
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,620
They co-opted the future.

1325
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,240
And now we're part of the past.

1326
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,880
They got it from the movies.

1327
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,200
It's a.

1328
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,260
But you'll notice when the glue.

1329
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,720
When everything glows blue, that's going to be good.

1330
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,800
But when it's glowing red, it's going to be really bad.

1331
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,280
Look out for the lights.

1332
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:33,820
Relax.

1333
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,540
Drink the iced tea.

1334
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,760
Have a donut.

1335
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,100
Look at the beautiful blue lights glowing from the eyes of the singing children.

1336
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,980
I see one little red light in the distance.

1337
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,520
Children.

1338
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,500
Don't be afraid.

1339
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,300
Don't be alarmed.

1340
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,360
Now it's going to be another half an hour before.

1341
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,660
They ritually ring the neck of the baby meerkat.

1342
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,920
I know one of the children is like.

1343
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,180
He's a very happy and motivated child.

1344
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,200
He keeps up with the rest of the children.

1345
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:06,880
And again, this background music is by the Reverend Angry Larry of the amino acids.

1346
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,040
In this case, under the name Automatic Robot Fish.

and Castiancorbinrando

1371
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,580
We do appreciate what you old wobblies did for us, Dave.

1372
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,640
Now you're being nailed up on those crosses, telephone poles.

1373
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:58,040
I am so sorry that I broke your heart.

1374
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,340
That's the last three nails we've got.

1375
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,480
I love you.

1376
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,640
I love you.

1377
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,780
You're going to have to nail that last one in yourself.

1378
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,440
I'm hurting out.

1379
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,200
What will you do when the government troops are coming for you

1380
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,440
and the only thing you have to fight with is your nail gun from Walmart?

1381
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,660
I'm not slurpy.

1382
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:21,880
Sorry.

1383
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,040
Nail guns and slurpees. Thank you.

1384
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,080
You're welcome.

1385
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,680
Thank you.

00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:44,800
Thank you.

Thank you.

1389
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:47,600
Okay.

1390
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:47,620
We're going to have to go.

1391
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:49,460
Bye.
