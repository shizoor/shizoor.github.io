See, they'll never, never know.
I'm surprised at you.
I can't believe what you just said to the microphone.
I don't care. I don't care. I don't care.
This is London.
Sink into the abyss of a new dark age, made more sinister and perhaps more protracted by the likes of perverted science.
The subgenius power of flesh.
This was their final hour.
Dear God.
Why is it?
Why is it so cold tonight?
Dear God.
Father, Son, Holy Cow!
Oh, well, well.
Moses went up to the mountain high
to find out from God
why did you make us?
Why?
Secret words in a secret room.
He said a humbub, a lubub, a lop, bam, boom.
I did not put you here to suffer.
I did not put you here to whine.
I put you here to love one another.
And to get out and have a good time. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let my people go. Let my people go.
You've got to let my people go.
Let my people go. Let my people go. Let my people go.
Let my people go. Let my people go. Let my people go You've got to let my people go.
Let my people go. Let my people go. Let my people go. You've got to let my people go.
Josh a freak.
You better let Jericho
He told the boys with the horns
Get down and blow
They reared back.
They aimed their bales at the stars.
He saide, Bet me boats and daddy
ain't to the bar.
I did not put you here to suffer.
I did not put you here to whine.
I put you here to love one another.
To get out and have a good time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let my people go.
Got to let my people go.
Let my people go.
I said go, go, go.
Let my people go.

You got to let my people go.
Which way boys?
I said yeah, yeah, yeah.
I said yeah, yeah, yeah.
I said hey, hey, hey.
I said oh, oh, oh.
I said .
Jesus went out for a walk with his mother.
He was a good boy.


The scribes and the Pharisees, they're plottin' hug and mugger.
They locked him up.
They threw away the key and said,
why is everybody always picking on me?
I did not put you here to suffer.
I did not put you here to whine.
I put you here to love one another.
And to get out and have a good time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let my people go.
Oh, you know how people go.
You got to let my people go.
Every day, every night, all the time.
Let my people go.
Let my people go.
You got to let my people go.
Let my people go.
I was taking a turn.
I feel so bad about this.
Let my people go.
You know how people go.
Let my people go.
Let my people go.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Let my people go.
You got to let my people go.
Oh, ay.
He never shows up, does he?
Why doesn't he show up?
What are we doing wrong?
I mean really what are we doing wrong what have we done why has Bob forsaken
us do we not have enough do are we not slack enough is that what it is are we
not mutant enough is that the problem or maybe they're just waiting for the
balance to be struck the balance to send the signal to the exodus maybe they're just waiting
for us to prove that we are ready to take our rightful place as the gods we are destined to be
in this universe maybe that's what they're waiting on and it is up to you
to prove
to prove
to prove
that you are different and you are better
I better go record this
because you my friends are some genius
now as a side note I've noticed a disturbing trend
I mentioned this briefly during the live hour of slack has anyone noticed that it seems that
quite often
quite often
the subgenius is the smartest mother in the room and I don't know about you brothers and sisters but when I look at a room full of pinks and clorps and bosses and assholes and ex-wives and ex-boyfriends and shitty cops all horrible things and I look at that room full of people and I know that I am an heiress to this world and I know that I am the most






responsible
and I know that I am the most Jos fundament Jason
I am the most responsible fuckwad of the living creature
I know that I really really really shouldn't be in charge of anything and I certainly brothers and sisters should not be the smartest mother fucker in the room
I know that I really really really shouldn't be in charge of anything and I certainly brothers and sisters should not be the smartest mother fucker in the room
but again and I am finding myself to be the smartest mother fucker in the room
the conspiracy is out-subging us
and its come to the point brothers and sisters that the subconscious have been も

geniuses are the geniuses.
How the hell did that happen, brothers and sisters? How the hell did we
reach the point that we, the subgeniuses, were
the smartest motherfuckers in the room?
I am disturbed. I am watching these conspiracy
fake motherfuckers walking in their
predestined paths for, you know what, they don't want to come to Ex-Tag.
They don't want to do that. Because it's too much work.
There's risk involved. It is so much easier to suck
down the conspiracy poisons, the conspiracy
media, the conspiracy news, to
suck that down as they travel, chargingly
through the path, the gate, the gate that
is known as the easy way, the gate that is known as don't make
waves, the gate that is known
as normality. And as they trot through those gates,
they are blinded by the conspiracy media. They are blinded
by the false slack that conspiracy provides.
And they do not hear the blades of the
abattoir. They do not hear the sounds
of rending flesh and crushing bone as they go to
their end. No, they do not.
But we do.
And that is why we're here. Because we are different.
And we are better. Because we are subgeniuses.
And even though it is sad to say, we may be the smartest
motherfucker in the room. But when the exes do come,
when we have proved our right to this universe,
we will own that abattoir.
We will be the butchers
riding those pink lambs to slaughter.
Can I get a praise Bob?
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Can I get a fuck the pinks?
Fuck the pinks!
Thank you brothers and sisters for listening to my impromptu bitch.
And next up very shortly here will be the amino acids.
As you can see, their mortal slaves are currently setting up their gear.
And as soon as they are ready, they will be on stage.
And as soon as the aminos are done, we will set that pipe smoking motherfucker on fire.
Can I get a hell yeah?
Hell yeah!
Can I get a praise Bob?
Praise Bob!
And you know what we're going to do next?
We're going to kill him. So can I get a kill Bob?
Kill Bob!
Thank you brothers and sisters.
Praise Pisces!
Praise Pisces!
Give me that old Johnny Cash show.
Give me that, give me that for me.
Give me that for me.
Give me that, give me that for me.
Give me that for me.
Give me that for me.
Thank you Lemur.
The intents of genius preaching before that was of course the great Priestess Pisces.
Improvising at 60 Next Day.
And that song, Let My People Go Go, that was in fact The Rainmakers.
And it was not recorded at 60 Next Day, but was extracted from a new live concert DVD called 25 On Live.
In which they performed their entire first album in order followed by their new album 25 On.
The Rainmakers would be my X Day Dream Band.
I am equally impressed with my old touring pal, St. Andrew the Impaled.
Who's been proving that he's not just a sideshow marvel, but a sideshow songwriter.
Right up there with Barry Manilow.
Alright now, since we're being preachy, alright, I promised Stang this.
He didn't get to hear this at the Divival we had a week and a half ago.

In the fine city of Pittsburgh.
I don't normally do parodies, but I do do some parodies.
And this is one of them.
Tori Amos stole this from the Boomtown Rats.
I'm stealing it back.
Sorry.








I'm not hearing from your line, but then we've had a whole new problem of our own here.
A buzz, eh?
I've heard cross talk from other worlds.
I mean like, what's the matter?
We need to hear cheerful talk from other worlds.
All these beings and entities venting their spleen.
They cannot possibly hope to achieve representation.
Time is just too limited.
Especially with the tools they have, they'll never vent their spleen the right way.
Not in time.
I hate to hear those aliens go on and on gossiping about us, calling us ugly bags of water.
Yeah, all that stuff.
That really gets old, what some of those aliens.
The Nazmurk called us squirming bags of unfulfilled appetites.
You know, this from creatures whose bodies are supported by machinery because they're so decayed in general.
Obsolete.
Why should we take this guff?
Really?
Yeah, why are we gonna let giant hundreds...
Yeah.
...foot tall aliens with superpowers push us around, eh?
Yeah, soon they're gonna be the rulers of the roost.
Bantamweight.
Henry Hawks of the Galactic Center.
Can I say one thing?
We gotta do something about it, see?
We can't let it go on.
Well, it's too late.
We can't let it go.
We've got to realize we're in a situation where diplomacy is going to be...
Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.
Not just our little planet.
Oh, yeah.
Right?
So I think we've all studied the manual and we know what to do when the ships land.
And the others are just gonna have to let this be impressed forcibly upon them.
Yep.
It's Mother Nature's way of receiving you.
If you don't meet the grill cage, you're not gonna withstand the fire, you know?
There will be a delicious...
Devouring of a fellow Earth creature.
Don't make it all up in my grill cage.
Will there be soul eating?
Because I hate that.
Well, you don't have to participate.
If you cook it long enough, you know, it...
Man, but the things you gotta do to cook a soul, I mean, that's so complicated.
I went to...
Oh, I'll ask you in a while.
Enough butter and salt.
It's a quantum event.
The soul itself is so tiny that it's cooked...
Actually, the best thing to do is you gotta cut it up into very tiny pieces.
You gotta cut it up into very tiny pieces and fry it at very high heat for a short amount of time.
And if you cut the pieces small enough, you'll find it quite palatable.
You just blanch the entire...
All the comestible parts there, you just blanch it briefly and violently.
Hey, Blanch.
Oops.
Is this on?
You know, there are a number of people...
My name, yes, I know my name means from the woods, so don't be silly now.
What?
I...
Well, if you...
I thought you said Blanch Dubois.
Blanch, uh, yeah, sure.
It simply means...
Not W-E-B Dubois, but Blanch Dubois.
Or Dubois, Pennsylvania.
It means pale, whiteness, paleness.
You look like a man I can trust, or maybe not.
I don't know where that came from.
I'm glad I forgot.
Tennessee Williams.
Tennessee Williams.
That sounds like it.
Boy, what a guy.
He was Tennessee Williams.
Absolutely.
That was another one by him.
Right next to him, as a matter of fact.
Then there was The Boston Miss Greeting from the Aardvark.
That was...
Or, uh, the, uh...
Went nowhere.
They're making a movie of that.
Yeah, after all these years, it was a big flop on Broadway.
And it never sold as a novelette.
Then there was The Night of the Iguana.
The Night of the Iguana.
Yeah.
I mean, it was a great movie.







It's a great movie.















Cooked rare.
Oh, and blanched like those souls.
The Night of the Fried Iguana.
Mm-hmm.
The Night the Tide Tethered Iguana Got Loose.
The sea was red that night when...
The sea of weeds.
Oh, how tortured we are in this life, and how ecstatic it will be as soon as X-Day
finally turns over and
our new selves will
bud and grow in the sun of a different
planet.
Oh, how we all aspire for such things.
We will sprout from the soil,
brothers and sisters.
I was about to say I can't wait,
but obviously I've proved that I can
wait for going on 18 years
now to...
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Please, Bob.
Waiting for those little bean pods of Bob
to germinate.
You know, I really don't want to have to haul those 400
boxes downstairs to the van
again. Set them on fire.
You know what I...
Actually, never mind.
He had a suggestion.
Because the idea that I just had
will not solve your problem.
Your problem is that it keeps happening
year after year. This ain't happening.
This just ain't happening.
You've got to start a whole new cult where you don't put a
specific date on the end of the world.
Well, we didn't do it.
Bob.
Bob did it, so we have to
go with it.
When's the last time anybody saw Bob in public, though?
You know, he's a very...
He's hard to pin down.
People do see him around.
We've heard him talk before, but he's
very hard to get on camera. He's very hard
to get on the record for an interview.
He's been on camera, I'm afraid to say.
Not very often.
But often enough.
He's very reclusive.
And he wears dark lipstick and
strange eyelashes.
I've seen...
I've seen him on the highway
three or four times, always
shooting past me.
I've seen him...
I used to see him at this coffee shop
and right after they instituted
the smoking ban in the state of Ohio,
you know, he came in like usual
with his pipe. And they tried to tell him,
hey man, you can't smoke that thing in here anymore.
And Bob didn't say a thing.
He just, you know, continued with that
big grin of his and
the pipe just kept smoldering and
they kept on telling him, come on man, you can't
smoke in here anymore. You gotta get out.
They picked him up and they literally
threw him out under the bus.
There was a bus coming along at the same time they threw him out in the street.
The bus went right over him.
Literal throwing under the bus.
I totally forgot about that time.
But he was fine. I mean, you saw like
a broken pipe
on the ground there
where the bus went by him, but you could tell it wasn't
Bob's pipe. You know how you could tell?
It wasn't in Bob's mouth.
That's right.
But I saw him again a few weeks later.
Clearly he survived that.
I mean, this is the, one of the
chief advantages that Bob Dobbs has
as a savior over Jesus Christ is that
Bob has died and risen
more times than anyone can count.
Jesus only ever did that once.
And that was like what, 2,000 years ago?
Bob does this all the time.
Oh yeah, that's right. Apollonius
of Crete or wherever it was.
Diana. He died and came
back also. Yeah, every
spring he came back. That was
the cult of Dionysius, wasn't it?
No. Nope.
That's different. That's quite different,
my boy.
And Apollonius of Diana,
he was, he worked with Dr.
Lowe in his circus for a while. In his circus, yes he
did. Apollonius? And boy, people
did not like his message
because he would, he would tell
them the truth and
they'd go, wow, what's my life gonna be like?
Am I gonna meet that tall, dark, ancient
Oh, we got somebody calling from one of my favorite
area codes now. He'd tell them what they didn't
want to hear. We got somebody calling from BC.
Fake. And he told them what was actually going to happen.
Hello, you're on the air. And they hated it.
They always wanted their money back after that.
That's utter nonsense.
The future is always nonsense
until it becomes
the past.
I'm sorry, but you see, it is my curse to tell the
absolute truth.
I got an email just last
week that said,
Reverend Stang, I was listening to the
hour of slack and you played a sermon
from that last X Day drill.
Some girl was going on
and on and on and I didn't like her voice.
That girl wasn't funny at all.
Why did you play that?
There's a simple answer,
dear friends. She showed
up. She was
there and got on the radio.


She was on stage and let the tongues of
flame burn through her.
And yes, she forgot her
lines and the recording was
awful and Reverend Funny Name
kept yelling at her, but
she did something that
email critic didn't do.
She showed up.
The Church of the
Subgenius is not a
democracy. It is not
a collective socialist
law. I added
that part. The Church of the
Subgenius is a strict
hierarchy. There are three
immutable means of advancing up
the ladder of sales success.
The first is yours for
a beer $35.
The second is, you
got to be funny or
smart or attractive
or some combination of these.
But the hardest one is this.
You have to
show up.
You think all those early
doctors had it going right from the
start. You think
Dr. Drummond and I were the best
choice for running a global
mail order mind control cult.
Well, you think
funny, son. We showed
up. That girl at X Day
showed up. If you want
that date or that
sales diocese
or to be lifted up in glory
ass first on the day of
Xist Grintervention,
you have to show up.
You could be part of the
greatest show up
on earth if you
just show up.
Now, I just
mentioned that at the day of rapture
of the rupture, I mean
the rupture, pardon me,
all subgeniuses who have paid
their $35 to Bob will be lifted
up into the heavens
ass first.
And that is literally true.
Whenever you've seen a comic strip
character go feet up in that third
panel, that's what I'm talking
about. It's a big
shepherd's crook pulling us off
the stage. Not because we
showed up and we're no
good, but because riverboat
Dobbs got us a better
gig uptown.
Can't you just see it, dear friends?
Your hands and feet flapping in front
of you while your keister shoots to
the sky. Bob will
save your ass and the rest
of you will follow.
As you all know,
humans are the internet's way
of making more
internet.
Thank goodness for the internet. Yay
internet. But those rules
don't apply to us. Not
entirely. Because of that hideous
yet kind of sexy
human yeti miscegenation
so long ago, we are
half-breeds.
The subgenius are the wolf
men and the mermaids.
The neither here nor there, neither
hot nor cold, the circle
without center or circumference.
Therefore, both
logic and moral
hygiene demand
that we use the internet
but nay, let it not
use us.
Go the hell outside.
Go for a walk. Go clean your
house and cook some food.
Go meet your friends. Talk
to your family. Show
up. Believe me,
your unpaid job doing
data entry for Facebook will still
be there when you get back.
Yes,
there are pictures of naked
ladies online, but you could
have sex with a beautiful
live girl. Or
an ugly one. Or a fellow
yetisan.
Step away from the computer. Put
the phone down and live.
Whichever planet this is,
it's unbelievably big and scary.
Bigger and scarier
than any screen.
It's nut-wrenching.
We
stand to receive thee,
you who are of flesh
and understand not the way
of the lead-clad ones.
This is it, friends.
Time to close the deal.
Eat the hell out of all those
hamburgers. All of them. You
are the one you've been saving yourself
for. Living well
is the best revenge.
But, you have to live well.
And, you have to live.
When you pass a mad scientist
on the street, does he
roll his fingers and shriek,
it's alive!
If the answer is no, then you need to get on that.
You are good enough.
You are clean enough. But, if,
if and only if, you get right
with Bob tonight.
Good night it will be.
A good night.
Because, you showed
up, my friends.
Praise Onan.
Praise Onan and Canabite
for that.
See, that's
my secret. Onan Canabite.
He still has
the faith.
He was the youngest subgenius in
1980.
He joined when he was only 16.
I saw him a couple years ago. I met his girlfriend.
I thought, what's Onan doing with that
40-year-old woman?
Then I remembered.
He's 40.
Then he was 40.
He's probably my age by now.
I'm surprised that you're not.
I can't believe what you just said
to the microphone.
Reverend Heathen has just arrived
with a truckload of
dead giant mammal carcasses.
An enormous
barbecue is going to take place
and the smoke of that burning
ascendeth forever.
The crackling flesh.
Well, so, don't
ask where Lonesome Cowboy Dave is.
This weekend, just be thankful
as you devour that
quote, pork, unquote.
That long-awaited pig.
He gave of himself
that one X-Day. That was when, like,
Game of Strange cooked it and ruined their weekend.
Did you know that Forrest Ackerman also
consumed human flesh?
What? Forrest J.
Ackerman, the editor of Famous Monsters of
Filmland, was lucky enough to
eat human before X-Day?
He was into all sorts of
California kook
society.
Before they were ever famous
or trendy, including nudism,
uh, unarius, and
it is said by
those who are his distractors that he
enjoyed a human snack on
certain occasions.
Obama eats dogs in Kenya.
I read that on the internet.
I met Forrest
and I'm sure you did, too. I
certainly bear him no ill will.
He wanted to try every possible experience.
Well, it's too bad Susie's
not here because she spent many
nights at the Acker mansion,
which my house is named after.
My girlfriend took me there once,
which was a wonderful thing to do,
and, uh, I saw all the usual monster stuff
that he had, but there were areas where you were
not allowed to go, which were blocked by the
large troll-like bodies of Ray Harryhausen fans
who would stand there so you couldn't get through,
but you could see just behind them bizarre shrines
to Marlena Dietrich with a thousand candles,
burning, and other things that Ackerman had.
So he wasn't all about the monster movies.
Was it Marlena Dietrich or Greta Garbo?
Now I'm thinking it was Greta Garbo.
Honestly, no kidding. I saw it.
The guy wouldn't let me go further.
That's fine. Yeah, you know.
We all have some kind of hidden pornography altar
somewhere, don't we?
We call them slack altars.
Yeah. Mine has a lot of monologues.
I think it's a little bit of a
microbe, germs and things breeding in it.
There you go. For my bug porn.
I brought my microscope, by the way.
We don't have the projector yet, but I'm hoping
later on that we can do a little show.
Did you have a projector? Oh, great.
Did you bring the bug porn movie?
Yeah, I did, but I was hoping to do some live bug porn.
Well, we can do that, too.
You know, once we get a projector and can make a picture
on that thing back there,
then I'm just going to sit here and play video games
the whole festival.
That's what I'm saving up for a projector
so I can have a setup like Dr. Drummond.
Friends, do you have a slack altar at your house?
I do.
Or has your house become a slack altar?
Yeah, we...
Right, I've been to Reverend Fox's house,
and it's...
The whole thing is pretty much a slack altar.
The slack altar wishes to spread and diversify,
but then even some top flight subgeniuses
at some point in their careers
have had the entire house be sort of pink and normal
and all of the crazy stuff just kept in one little hobby room,
you know, where no one important would see it.
The visiting parson or whatever would not be horrified
by an array of plastic toys.
Or the pink spouse.
Yes, the pink spouse might be.
That's usually the problem.
That not too strong a subgenius flavor
be spread about the premises.
Princess, we and I have been surveying
the slack altars of subgeniuses around the country
and the world and photographing them.
Of course, the Flusium at Susie the Flusie's house
is by far the largest slack altar
and bulldata collection I've ever seen.
It should be a National Historic Site.
Your room is one gigantic slack altar,
but it's just one room.
Yes, I know. Yes.
Craig Potter and Ostrel, Potter and Petal
have a house that is one really nicely organized slack altar.
Very good.
You don't need the false drugs when you go into a house
that is all everywhere.
Everywhere you look, everything's swimming with faces
and monsters and robots and...
Like a Todd Schor painting realized in three dimensions.
Reverend Angry Larry and Reverend Lucy
have a slack altar house loaded with decapitated heads
and Peanuts characters.
This is all elevated, progressive, and correct.
Yeah, well, he's a monster makeup guy on the side.
Yes.
As well as being a rock star and, I believe, an exterminator.
Yeah, yeah, that's it, an exterminator.
Well, isn't that what the monsters always try to do?
Yeah, they always, yeah.
This one you might know.
Yeah, it's the one of the terrible vole necessarily
ọi
That was the slot rods, friends.
A greatest surf hate band since the amino acids at 60 Next Day,
recorded by Reverend Suds Bashaw.
And so is this music in the background.
Following is my Next Day location mic recording of,
unplugged due to tornadoes,
The Mutant Mountain Boys.
Okay.
Welcome to Me Can't Tell a Joke.
Oh!
I thought the joke was over my head.
I didn't understand anything.
See me after, I'll break it down.
I've got diagrams.
I'm 10 years old.
If you have a tablet, you're a film strip.
PowerPoint.
Handouts.
Swift kick in the ass.
I'm so sure.
Get me it.
Get me a pamphlet, okay?
Because that's all I know.
Color forms.
Drinky dinks.
Tea leaves.
We've got one more for you guys.
All right.
Thank you so much for listening to The Mutant Mountain Boys.
You guys can play the amino acid song,
because they're probably not going to show up without me.
Probably.
We can.
We can.
But we've got a cover, actually.
This is Bob's favorite hoedown song.
Yes.
That's right.
He had a lot of hoedowns there.
Yes, he did.
Boy, were they down.
Error.
Error?

Oh!

. So...
Well, there is a subtext today,
and that is a remarkable book,
which may be familiar to some of you.
Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon.
You may be aware that in recent times,
the third subgenius book has gone through the roof.
It now sells for what preposterous price?
700 bucks or something like that?
Either $999 or one cent is the way we've seen it on eBay.
Well, that's a good spread.
But at any rate.
No, actually, Revelation X has shown up
with both of those prices within the same month on eBay.
Interesante.
Philo follows that.
And it's partly because there's big eBay dealers
whose business is run by computer
and watch each other's eBay site.
So when competitor one raises his Revelation X copy to $5,
competitor two, his computer automatically bumps the price up to six.
And vice versa, it goes back and forth for 999 days.
Next thing you know, a book that you can buy at that table over there for 20 bucks
is going for $999 to suckers on eBay.
Well, it is quite shocking how many soi-disant subgeniuses do not own this special book.
Right.
They think it ended with,
Look at the subgenius.
It certainly did not.
They forget the Second Testament and the Third Testament.
This is a place where you can get it signed by Reverend Ivan Stang
or even by me since I have so many illustrations and things.
And Dr. LeGume and Princess Wee.
And Dr. LeGume, Princess Wee.
This is better than any eBay auction or online order
or even in a quaint old-timey brick-and-mortar bookstore
because here you can get yours,
well, you can get the value added to information.
Definitely.
Well, the safe thing to do would be to buy two copies,
one as a spare,
and go around and just find everyone you see here who looks old,
get them to sign it,
and probably you'll end up with a fully...
With one of the treasures of time, Jack.
Right.
Now, if we had copies of the Third Testament,
the Cyclopedia of Slack...
Is there even one copy?
Oh, in my vault, there's 30 of them,
but...
Yes, it's all your vault.
Yes.
That one, that was so popular
that it went out of print after the first printing.
Actually, what happened was the publisher went out of business.
My first book's out of print.
We're all going to go out of print, let's face it.
No, for we invested in Bob's great printing press in the sky.
Well, his great mimeograph.
Well, his ditto.
Gestetner.
Yeah.
So, his carbon copy up in the sky, that's us.
That's the way he duplicates it.
And angels turn the crank even now.
Oh, yes.
So, yeah, we don't have to...
We get to choose when we die.
Unless we get in a big fight with a fellow subgenius on X-Day
over what loot from Earth to bring home.
Heaven was content to suffer violence.
Anyway, make sure...
Make sure that you don't leave without a spanking new copy of Revelation X,
the Bob Apocryphon.
Yes, we have to.
Many people have never even cracked it open.
I got to say.
All the stuff about the Yetis, of Mutantus, the entire thing.
And on top of that, there's only one copy of Book of the Subgenius here
because isn't it interesting how giant corporations like Simon & Schuster,
one of the biggest publishers in the world, lose orders?
Well...
Much more frequently than drunk subgeniuses do.
It has been...
A lone drunk subgenius can fill orders better than a gigantic megacorporation?
Isn't that funny?
Too much top-down interference.
Yeah.
This has to be done instinctively.
And you know, that person wouldn't even admit that she just simply ignored,
lost my orders.
Just giggled and tittered.
Oh, well, we'll send that out as soon as we can.
Huh.
Huh.
An ant so large that it fell off this table.
Really?
It's clumsiness.
Yes.
Let's...
Because I've got an ant farm here we could put it in.
It's rather large.
It'll be a pretty high ant.
Scrambling away across the...
We let him out.
...the floor now.
But we could smoke him, man.
Yeah, we could.
What would happen if you smoked a size...
A few sizeable, say, big red ants?
Anything?
The Hour of Slack, that's what happens.
And next up on Hour of Slack is the fabulous and luxuriously appointed Fat Man D.
Fat with a P-H, D with two E's.
Live and unplugged from X Day.
Hal, I did a show with a bunch of friends of Hal's, Hal West, in a fancy schmancy poetry place.
He's a great guy.
He's a great guy.
But they didn't like...
They didn't like my patriotic number.
And I'm not sure if this was the part they didn't like or the fact that Hal had painted
my boobs like eyeballs and lips on my belly and I came out tap dancing in an Uncle Sam
hat.
But, you know, I thought that was poetry in motion and apparently that's not what they
thought and they never let them do any shows there ever again.
So I really hope that Wisteria ain't, as my GPS likes to call it...
Doesn't do that to us.
Because then we'd have to hold the revival at my house and that'd be awesome for like
eight minutes.
Here we go.
This is how I pray for the good of the nation and for the record I am an incredible patriot.
This is called the sacred act of fat chick fist mastication and it is how I pray.
Go!

Go!
Oh man.
Wow.
Man's statement.
Goddong jComment.
Uh huh.
Oh uh huh.
Oh uh.
ост.
Kind gameplay.
You say you feel equal.
Uh.
Ho whelwe wood Western understand theütth量
Oh it's literally loud.

God philosopher.
Let's play with Bob's Ball!
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!
Oh, we've got a free pass here to the secret caverns.
Yeah, yeah, Princess, we and I are really hoping to go to this.
It's Cobbleskill, New York, secret caverns.
And what's down there?
Whoa! That's why they don't want to tell us.
My main curiosity would be about the gift shop, I think.
Well, Reverend Steve O'Deva works there.
Mm, yes.
He lives in a cave.
Cobbleskill, New York.
That explains a lot.
In a cave in the hills, he dwelt alone.
What's down in there makes Old Sequa look like
a sweet little cave.
A little baby.
What's down there makes Old Sequa look like a sweet little baby?
Yes, just so, apparently.
Some ancient horror of inner earth.
That's almost as frightening as your speculation about
where the beanstalk could go after it goes to giant land
in the giant killer story.
Well, we watched that movie, and at one point,
those of you who saw it may remember that
someone drops a magic bean,
up in giant land.
You know, you reach giant land by climbing up a beanstalk from here.
But once they're up there, through some blunder,
they drop a bean, and sure enough, a beanstalk starts growing in giant land.
Now, they didn't pursue this, but if a giant climbed it,
would he come to an even larger place,
where even more huge, uncouth, anthropophagous giants dwelled?
You know, shrinking him down by comparison to a moderate size.
But as the game goes on, it's a little bit more interesting.
In the case, maybe the giants grabbed the beanstalks
and bent them down to the earth so they could invade.
And this intriguing possibility was not borne out.
It would have been so easy to do.
Oh, now that I remember, we did, it was explored on that radio show the other night.
We mentioned it because we want the powers that be who are listening to consider it.
Fee-fi-fo-fan.
I smell the blood of an evil.
You speak of the Welles man name, we can be sure of it.
You might wonder what happened to Fee-fee,
Don't understand it, and that mean something about it.
So I wonder, what did he go and do to protect the low-rank titan?
Nothing anything uncomfortable?
There, there you are.
I told you, it's in the sl姐.
So try to help us.
Did you do it to protect him?
We did.
Did he?
No.
And to open it, you know.
Well, it was only a movie.
In the movies, giants can do stuff like that.
In real life, giants, of course, obviously, as we know, have trouble with small bags of beans.
They're clumsy, but they have got a bad press.
You know, humanity won against the giants.
And so everything that we read about them is suspect.
Who knows?
They may have been better than us.
History is always written by the winners.
Peking Man exterminated the giants in their area.
Hey, that means we get to start on our history of planet Earth next week.
Yes, we'll wipe the slate clean and begin with a whole new round of stories.
Because history itself is too painful to be examined directly,
but must be discreetly shrouded in legend to be bearable.
Oh, I don't know.
I'm going to...
As soon as...
I get my MoM machine, I'm going to send a time camera back to get videos of things like the crucifixion,
quote unquote,
which I have a feeling the camera will fly around going,
well, there's a whole bunch of guys crucified out here.
They're all the same.
Well, on that day, they only had three to deal with.
But since you are going to do it, it has therefore already happened,
and therefore you're flying...
And the whole project is probably the result of the weird weather that was reported at the time.
You know, you would find out...
The clouds, electric flashes, and lightning and so on,
which arose from a hitherto peaceful day.
Oh, it's like the end of so many comic books and sci-fi movies.
The time traveler finds out, as he's being nailed to a cross,
who the miracle worker Jesus really was.
And it was trademark Gunderson,
and the Evolution Control Committee,
live at X-Day.
That song is a pop music footnote.
I didn't say stop.
Okay, now it's time to use the Vinnie Masher 3000,
which is what you can hear.
The Vinnie Masher 3000 is something that I've been using for a long time.

I put together myself a hat from Nintendo Wii controllers,
which are sitting there on the ground.
I'm holding pens that do infrared light.
Actually, the green is for you puny humans who can't see infrared light,
so you can actually see them doing something.
But there's another LED there that's infrared that the Wii notes get to see.
And I've been assembling this screen for years,
like almost a decade.
It became like this.
It was this dump site where I could put in all these samples that I had collected.
And then when Ableton Live didn't crash,
I just thought I'd see how far I could go.
Right now, the set has about 800 or more different sound bits, samples, loops.
I'm mashing up stuff from the original stuff.
Nothing is pre-mashed.
That's not a word.
And let's see what comes out,
because I don't think I'll get a chance to make a full set list.
It's webtoon.
So, here's Justин Slatterny's Samurai,
and I'm just gonna put another 2D material on his phone.
We solders have actually set up a few Ideal Keyboards since the first 기�nik,
which I have been several times,
and people probably chose those.


xX-2
Well,
goddammit!
That was great.
Oh, a very bad measure.
