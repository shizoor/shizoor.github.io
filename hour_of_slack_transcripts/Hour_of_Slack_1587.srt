1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,320
The Subgenius Power of Squash!

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,980
It's hard to believe they were attacked by an owl.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,620
Praise Bob.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,040
Bob?

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,740
Bob?

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,800
Bob?

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,960
Bob?

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,000
Bob?

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,000
Bob?

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,620
Bob?

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,000
Bob?

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,980
Bob?

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,400
Bob?

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,780
Bob?

15
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,400
Bob!

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,200
Bob?

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,660
Bob?

18
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,620
Bob!

19
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,580
Bob?

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:38,920
Bob?

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,380
Bob?

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,400
Bob!

23
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,040
God bless you, Lord.

24
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,560
Hopefully I won't make him menthol melted.

25
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,600
Once I cover you in blood and you go nuts aboutventh drive, I'll Dub raw.

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:53,700
Bob?

27
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:54,340


28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,900
Bob, Bob, oh, oh, Bob.

29
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,620
Sadly he can't remember ALL songs.

30
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:58,740


31
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,300
You probably don't...

32
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,580
Bob?

33
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,080
Bob?

34
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,480
Bob, can you hear me? It's shruggin'!

35
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,300
Bob?

36
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,540
I guess I'll have a side of pancakes since

37
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,620
My drum was like dessert for dinner!

38
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,960
Water scrum!

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,160
I'm gonna have some of that, but what do you put on it?

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,020
What do you put on your pancakes?

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,380
It's on! It's all scrummy!

42
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,680
You put on the Mind Control Syrup!

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,540
An extra scrum.

44
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,700
To tell you a story, it's really delicious, you need to check it out.

45
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,000
Womblehouse.com, our new sponsor!

46
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,260
Thanks Womblehouse!

47
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,840
Love your Mind Control Syrup!

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,340
Bring on the aliens!

49
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,040
Thanks for wearing yellow!

50
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,040
Wear yellow so they can find you first!

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,840
That's it!

52
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,700
First ticket holder is a yellow-wearing ticket holder.

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,980
That is correct, sir.

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,180
I'm gonna drop there for all scrum sprinkles in your scramble!

55
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,340
If you ask the one who's in the middle of the phone for you in Alabama,

56
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,080
Womblehouse there will definitely serve you up some scrum scramble.

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,500
In your hash browns.

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm not allowed in my own house for breakfast, so I head down to the only place in town.

59
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,160
Womblehouse!

60
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,720
Open 24 hours a day, and serving up the same shit from yesterday.

61
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,180
Oh my gosh, that's like it's opened all the time, almost!

62
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,480
Always busy, never working.

63
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,900
Call now!

64
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,100
Thorazine urine can be subscribed through your mobile cellular internet interactive device.

65
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,820
www.thorazineurine.com

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,420
Subscription fees may vary.

67
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,700
It's been too long.

68
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,620
It's been too long.

69
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:03,920
It's been too long since.

70
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,640
Too long.

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,140
It's been too long.

72
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,520
If you can't taste the syrup on the tongue, it's been too long.

73
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,840
If you're in control of your mind, it's the wrong person.

74
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,500
Go and have some Womblehouse mind control syrup tonight.

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,380
They're open, they're waiting for you.

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,340
Yes, you can bring your support parent,

77
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,820
your emotional support parent,

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,700
and welcome anyone to the house.

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,260
They're open.

80
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,480
They're open.

81
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,760
And there are many standard bathrooms.

82
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,780
Everyone is welcome to Womblehouse.

83
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,340
But not the one on 14th Street when you, uh,

84
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,960
I think that was in Dublin, Georgia.

85
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,580
The one on 14th Street.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,900
Saving your ears from Dr. Degas all over the country.

87
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,220
All over the world.

88
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,540
All over the podcrest all the time.

89
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,340
Thank you, internet.

90
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,440
Have you stared at the phone tonight?

91
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,860
Have you stared at your phone tonight?

92
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,840
What?

93
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,700
I haven't stared at my phone tonight.

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,740
I'm concerned. I'm worried that things aren't happening that I know about.

95
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,020
Or I'll be like, whatever the fuck I'm missing out.

96
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,140
Is that what the F stands for?

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Well none of it matters because all of your friends

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,240
who didn't pay a bob are gonna die and then you don't have to worry about their shit anymore.

99
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,260
That's very helpful.

100
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,820
You know, you're wrong from the beginning.

101
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,600
I don't even believe in the internet.

102
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,260
I don't think the internet is actually a thing.

103
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,860
You need to have your eyes checked, Julie.

104
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,540
But it exists for some reason.

105
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,720
Just because it's not real for you doesn't mean it's not real for everybody else.

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,140
You're just biased because you grew up in a pro-internet community.

107
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,860
You're just jealous because you couldn't try scrumming until you first ordered it from Amazon.com.

108
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,340
I was given a tool to abuse and I've horribly done that.

109
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,940
I think it's a good thing that everything that I, you know, the internet is a thing.

110
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,560
Yeah.

111
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:52,080
Friends, tonight we're playing some recordings from 19X Day,

112
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,980
our festival last summer.

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,480
We've been playing bits and pieces of it.

114
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,780
We call them 19X Day B.O. or Best Of.

115
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,260
There's a lot of scrum in the air tonight.

116
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,620
Different to ranting and jamming from the evening shows.

117
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,600
The daytime shows are more like the hour of slack in the last half when we talk.

118
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,660
But the nighttime shows are totally chaotic.

119
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,060
And it's a mess.

120
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,380
And insane.

121
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,120
Except when the occasional actual band plays.

122
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,260
But we're all members of this one big band which has a different name every X Day.

123
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,540
Not sure what it would be this time.

124
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:43,360
But when I'm involved, I like to think it's Vulcan Jedi Mentat is the name of the band.

125
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,860
And when it's just Princess Wee and me mainly, then it's Pooh Watertel.

126
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,860
Anyway, we're about to hear some jamming and ranting.

127
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,680
This one unfortunately is a good example of what happens when I get up away from the sound booth and the mix board

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,100
and get on stage and rant myself.

129
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:09,780
Because when the second guitarist decided to join in, there was no one at the mix board to turn it down.

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,420
So there's a little bit of that in here.

131
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,080
So that's what we're doing tonight.

132
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,180
We're back at 19X Day.

133
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,060
Oh no, oh no.

134
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,740
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,300
Groupies must leave the stage.

136
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,180
You can't all have sex with Reverend Ivan Stang.

137
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,040
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,180
We are his...

139
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,020
We're at his...

140
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,060
We are his minions.

141
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,040
Yes.

142
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,780
We are his fluffers.

143
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,020
Hi, Reverend Ivan Stangs.

144
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,660
You know, if I were to take you seriously, my job description would mean that I would spit in your face now.

145
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,400
Okay.

146
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,140
I was accused of spitting in the face of my followers.

147
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
Now that's a quote.

148
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,780
You spat in the face of your followers, unquote.

149
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,520
Now here's the thing.

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:14,080
What the fuck am I or any other subgenius supposed to do with any followers?

151
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,980
Spitting in the face is a perfectly acceptable option.

152
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,180
Followers?

153
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,060
No, we're not looking for finger suckers.

154
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,100
We're looking for people who know how to look, where the finger points, and we're looking for people who know how to draw.

155
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,320
Everybody's a damn art critic, but we're looking for people who know how to draw.

156
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,180
That sums up the church of the subgenius.

157
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
How to draw people?

158
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,220
No, just how to...

159
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,700
Draw flies?

160
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,360
Draw flies, draw customers, or draw pictures.

161
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,740
It's a metaphorical thing, Reverend Angry Larry.

162
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,420
I mean, we are actually looking for people who can draw pictures.

163
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,260
We're looking for people who can draw flies.

164
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,560
We're looking for people who can draw money.

165
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,320
All of those have uses within the church hierarchy.

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,760
But the big thing is money.

167
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,200
Well, no, that's not the big thing.

168
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,060
The big thing is slack.

169
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,100
Shitty.

170
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,760
We're hopefully we sell...

171
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,340
Slack.

172
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,400
Slack for money.

173
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,340
Or at least we sell the understanding or the...

174
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,400
Appreciation.

175
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,480
Yeah, that's the word.

176
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,960
The appreciation of slack is what we're selling.

177
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,960
It's 1140 at night.

178
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
The night before X day.

179
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,720
Yeah, so we can quit selling.

180
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,940
Anybody who is going to buy in already has or hasn't, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

181
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,860
But the more shit you bought today, the more likely you are to be accepted onto the ship.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
Uh, yeah.

183
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,180
Yeah.

184
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,460
I'm sure of what he said.

185
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,120
Yes.

186
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,680
That's fine.

187
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,560
The more slack you get today, the more likely you are to be drawn upon the ship.

188
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,820
But really, that doesn't matter.

189
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
You spent your 35 bucks.

190
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,340
According to the rules, that's all you have to do.

191
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,400
And that's about the only rule.

192
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,500
The other one being fuck them if they can't take a joke.

193
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,380
And I'm moan make gobstown great again.

194
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,160
That's a one of a kind hat that Reverend Lee Carlton...

195
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,680
Oh, John, now I can't remember his proper church name.

196
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,200
Anyways, great guy.

197
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,940
And thank God I forgot the giant bottle of absinthe that he mailed to us from Switzerland.

198
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,560
Thank God in heaven and Dobbs in hell for that we forgot that giant bottle of absinthe

199
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,600
because oh my God, it would kill us all.

200
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,220
We'll save it for when Dr. Howell is in our home again, safe and sound aboard our saucers.

201
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,840
Well, really, it's faucets of absinthe.

202
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,100
And you don't get a hangover.

203
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,060
That's right.

204
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,340
On your saucer, what will you get?

205
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,680
Fountains of whatever drug you want with no negative side effects.

206
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,080
If you like drugs.

207
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,020
If you don't, you'll just be as high as you already were.

208
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,240
It's great.

209
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:16,660
The problem is do you have enough imagination and memory to think of all the things that you want?

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,460
Because you can get them.

211
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:26,300
If you don't have, if you're just so adjusted to this modern world that that's all you can really conceive of,

212
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,340
well, your escape saucer might look just like your crappy apartment.

213
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,800
Now, wouldn't that be a shame?

214
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,380
Yes, it would.

215
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:45,700
Well, friends, I suppose most of you don't have to worry about that because you've got pretty good imaginations despite all the pornography.

216
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,700
You've been watching Monster News all night.

217
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,800
You've been reading Price is Common first.

218
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,680
Underground is on the books.

219
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,860
The nuttiest shit you can find.

220
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,780
Acres and acres of nutty shit.

221
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,440
It's the stuff we call bull dada.

222
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,200
You can save all of your bull dada and preserve it aboard your straight vessels.

223
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,940
You can also beam up any kind of bull dada you want.

224
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,480
Yeah, things are great.

225
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,040
Things can bring slack.

226
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,820
But even with all the bullshit,

227
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:28,820
you'll find I'll bet you that the greatest slack of all is probably just the fact that you don't have to worry anymore.

228
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,200
You don't have to worry about money.

229
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
You don't have to worry about getting a date.

230
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,020
You don't have to worry about somebody paying attention to you.

231
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,240
You don't have to worry if anybody thinks you're smart.

232
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,300
You don't have to worry if you're ugly or stupid.

233
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,020
You don't have to worry about anything.

234
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,000
Because whatever you want, there it will be.

235
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,320
The trick is knowing what you want.

236
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,660
And the funny, funny, funny trick is if you really know what you want,

237
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,620
you might be able to get it whether the exes hand it to you or not.

238
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,240
You might even be able to get it for yourself.

239
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Just imagine that without love, without the exes, without any stupid stuff.

240
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,260
You might actually be able to get it without any thought.

241
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,800
You might simply figure out what the hell you goddamn want.

242
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Something to think about.

243
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,720
From Reverend Ivan Stan.

244
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,940
Thank you very much.

245
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,140
I would like to request Suzy to come on up here and go-go dance with us.

246
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,400
What are you talking about?

247
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,440
We're talking about the new interactive subgenius...

248
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,340
No one's talking to you!

249
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm talking to me.

250
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,820
I think I'm the most interesting person here.

251
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,160
It's dark.

252
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,940
From PR News in Washington.

253
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,020
I'm not likely to move to the Senate.

254
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,840
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said

255
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,900
But I will tell you this.

256
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,140
None of us here.

257
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,300
Kerry said that while the acknowledgement system is a framework

258
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,800
We don't have yet that framework.

259
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,300
The House has approved a bill that helps wealthier Democrats at the expense of the poorest working parents.

260
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,540
Because it hurts the poorest immigrant families and children.

261
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,420
The key proposals include closing PR News.

262
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,040
Republicans say this would eliminate PR News.

263
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,200
Bob!

264
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,920
Bob!

265
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,080
Bob, you're a hungry god!

266
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,320
You demand so much, but not that much.

267
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,060
Bob!

268
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,820
Bob!

269
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,040
Bob!

270
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,320
Bob!

271
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,660
Where are all the Bobbies?

272
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,700
What if Bob was one of us?

273
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,140
Can I have some Bobbies, please?

274
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,500
Hey, Dr. Chagall.

275
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,140
It turns out we have a listener question that's coming specifically for you.

276
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,960
Yeah?

277
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,920
Yeah.

278
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,020
It's from Johnny J. Q. Smith.

279
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,140
Johnny J. Q. Smith in Detroit.

280
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,220
Asked you specifically, why do you have such a problem with scrum?

281
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,800
I don't have a problem with scrum.

282
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,680
I use more scrum than anybody else.

283
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,820
I'm sorry, I wasn't done reading the question.

284
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,560
Johnny J. Q. Smith in Detroit.

285
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,340
Dr. Chagall, why do you have such a problem with scrum and Japanese animation?

286
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,640
Well, who said I had a problem with the Japanese?

287
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,340
And the Japanese animation.

288
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,960
Apparently your scrum consumption with Japanese animation.

289
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:22,280
If you have a problem with Japanese animation, take a look at my Netflix history and you'll see a sad trend.

290
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,380
Anyhow, on scrum...

291
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,680
It's almost like...

292
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,700
Bob?

293
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,920
Yeah?

294
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,900
Hey, where'd you stop?

295
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,920
I don't have a problem with scrum.

296
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,040
I just... I use more scrum than anybody, except for Anna Moll.

297
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,660
And she's just gonna die from scrum, but that's fine.

298
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,800
I hope I die from scrum.

299
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,540
That's one of the ways to go.

300
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,180
There's a lot of them.

301
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,220
Strangulation.

302
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,900
Why'd you wait? That's all. Seriously.

303
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,400
Auto-accident, defenestration, and...

304
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,660
Facial warming.

305
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,040
Disease.

306
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,620
All kinds of diseases.

307
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,440
Bob.

308
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,900
I got the wet...

309
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,800
Bob!

310
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,040
Final chance to cure cancer.

311
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,780
Only three days to go.

312
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,120
Final chance to cure heart disease.

313
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,900
Only...

314
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,060
Hours to go.

315
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,700
Let's end all the car crashes in the next few hours.

316
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,760
I swear we can.

317
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,240
Time is running out to save the world.

318
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,120
Save the world from cancer.

319
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,140
AIDS.

320
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,440
It's over now.

321
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,600
The end of the diseases is...

322
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,720
Coming with the destruction of all the ill.

323
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,840
And all their ilk and all their...

324
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,220
Children.

325
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,760
No more inheritance...

326
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,260
Of diabetic tendencies.

327
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,420
No more inheritance of those breast cancer proclivities.

328
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,120
We found the cure.

329
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,020
We found the cure.

330
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,980
We found the cure.

331
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,800
Only three days to go.

332
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,000
Only three days.

333
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,460
Only three days.

334
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,980
And three minutes from the end of time,

335
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,020
Cure us all.

336
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,300
No more.

337
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,280
No more sickness.

338
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,240
Nothing but burning, burning, burning.

339
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,480
No more sickness.

340
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,900
All the cancer wards off in flames.

341
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,520
No more sickness.

342
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,400
No need to take...

343
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,480
Life.

344
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,560
saving doses of aspirin so that you do not die of a heart attack or stroke

345
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,340
don't even have to put away those smokes

346
00:17:51,920 --> 00:18:01,240
because we found the cure found the cure for the world we found the cure and it's

347
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:09,420
destroying the world we found the cure and it world world we found the cure

348
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,260
end of the world end of the world end of the world

349
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,660
we got some defective wristbands they don't stick to themselves so I have to

350
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,820
use like one of those big office staplers and just staple it onto your

351
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,140
wrist

352
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,140
so if somebody else is doing that make sure they don't staple it to the underside of

353
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:43,400
your wrist because you might bleed to death we staple it to the upper side the back of the

354
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:52,800
hand side of the wrist for that matter since we're stapling the registration wristbands on we

355
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:00,700
probably could just staple them onto your forehead it'd be easier to see that way and it's like a

356
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,220
tiny wristband and it's like a tiny wristband and it's like a tiny wristband and it's like a

357
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,860
mini mini trepanation it's possible to increase your consciousness with a

358
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:12,460
staple to the forehead but not by much so it's probably not worth it unless

359
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,520
that's where you want to wear your registration negative stimuli

360
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:27,180
electro-enforcement wristband available at the swag shop tomorrow

361
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,840
or tonight

362
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:38,540
I'll leave Bob this grotto friends tomorrow night you'll hear about grotto

363
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,600
is pretty scary

364
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:51,860
you can get to it in five minutes but it takes 49 hours to come back from there

365
00:19:52,660 --> 00:20:00,720
ollie bothers drop there it's pretty there's a waterfall and it doesn't like I

366
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,960
said even get down there in five minutes and prop up or whatever you want to do

367
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:15,060
you better schedule further trip back it's 49 hours that's a couple of days

368
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:23,600
that's two days and an ad now inner time we're trying getting tired of deja Prius

369
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,700
just some righto so regular at least know it is is it bad you can be real cause it's getting mad around your mouth?

370
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,700


371
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,700


372
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,700


373
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,700


374
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,700


375
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,700


376
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,120
because you don't have a watch on.

377
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,180
So I would be interested in finding out

378
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:42,040
about the fluid time available after July 5th, 1998.

379
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,120
It should be any minute, hour, day, or hour.

380
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,060
See what I mean?

381
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,880
It's fluid.

382
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,360
Or it's not fluid enough.

383
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,580
It's like we're stuck, like buds of amber.

384
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,140
Locked to the clock, you might say.

385
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,480
Well, our symbol for slack is a clock

386
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,680
with a dagger stuck through it.

387
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,660
But I'm afraid that's wishful thinking

388
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,000
until the saucers get here, boys and girls.

389
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,680
So I'm gonna tell you a goodnight Betty-bye time story.

390
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,580
Once upon a time, there was this subgenius.

391
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,480
He came to X Day, and something happened to him

392
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,880
that we're not allowed to talk about

393
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,720
anymore because apparently it's decreed

394
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,140
to be not politically correct.

395
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,480
But I'll say it anyway.

396
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,200
He had a hot dog with mustard!

397
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,480
I know that's symbolic of something.

398
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,400
It might cause untoward and unseemly memories to erupt.

399
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,300
But yes, he came.

400
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,800
A boy came to X Day and had a hot dog.

401
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,780
And a girl came to X Day and had a hamburger.

402
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,860
And that's probably symbolic.

403
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,480
It's symbolic of something offensive too.

404
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,840
So we have to be really careful about it.

405
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,900
Better thing now is,

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,540
because you never know when Facebook is gonna bust you!

407
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,940
Oh no!

408
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,520
The worst thing that could ever happen in life.

409
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,500
Someone might get offended,

410
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,480
and Facebook might get angry with you.

411
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,620
That's worse than having God angry with you!

412
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,960
That's even worse than having Bob angry with you!

413
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,760
At least, that's what I was told.

414
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:24,860
That's what I was told.

415
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,020
That's what I was told.

416
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,580
Anyway, the hot dog and the hamburger got together

417
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,180
and had little burgers, and they were called Hot Burgers.

418
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,980
That's the end of the story.

419
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,880
Thank you very much and good night.

420
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,000
This one goes out to Dave.

421
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,020
This podcrust is dedicated to the following podcrustists.

422
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,000
Don't mind, my good name is Dave.

423
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,000
You're gonna take the pigs up like a slave.

424
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,120
Gonna make new oil chores all day long.

425
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,380
Gonna tell them, hey, this is my song.

426
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,300
We're up here making a lot of noise at night.

427
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
It was X day ago, it's pretty all right.

428
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,900
Get out now, get out in the crowd, get drunk, get frumped,

429
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,140
get really, really loud, yo!

430
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,560
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!

431
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,280
If you give him a dollar,

432
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,200
he'll stop trying to rap.

433
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,620
And select a song.

434
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:13,820


435
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,780
Come on. Fuck you, friend.

436
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,000
Commodify your friends.

437
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,260
Commodify your experience.

438
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,640
You have the money for the experience.

439
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,360
Bring the folks at home. That was like, this.

440
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,080
You have the money for the experience. You have the money for the experience.

441
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,500
You're experiencing right now.

442
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,120
I know I paid my dollars for this.

443
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,440
What?

444
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,340
My Earth monies went to this.

445
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,620
Check it out.

446
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,620
Right now, have you decided to enjoy this on a gold membership level?

447
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,920
Or a platinum level?

448
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,360
I think we have, uh, what?

449
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,460
Well, there's a gold membership.

450
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,280
There's a key membership.

451
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,440
There's a platinum membership.

452
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,360
Do we have the, uh, bronzite?

453
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,940
The...

454
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,920
Next time, if you can get that little more in the mic.

455
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,920
Tin. Tin was a membership level.

456
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,340
You can leave those who really want the scholarship.

457
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,520
You can be a tin member.

458
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,820
You can be a copper member.

459
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,860
Copper member?

460
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,500
The copper members get 25% of every 25% of every song.

461
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,020
That's absolutely fantastic.

462
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,040
What a deal.

463
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,540
You can't beat that kind of thing.

464
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,760
You can't.

465
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,820
You can't.

466
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,680
You can't beat that deal.

467
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,020
You can't beat that mother-in-law deal.

468
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,280
To the kids' cost.

469
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,620
Yeah!

470
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,740
Because I said.

471
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,440
I'm not a mother-effing because I'm a Christian.

472
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,180
Wow!

473
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,280
And I'm not going to say what the F word,

474
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,840
even though you know what the F word is.

475
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,140
F word.

476
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,540
F word.

477
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,200
F word.

478
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,420
F word.

479
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,160
F-U.

480
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,080
F word.

481
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,360
C-K.

482
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:38,800
F word.

483
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,860
That's the other side.

484
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,520
C-K.

485
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:40,820
F word.

486
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,280
Where's your kazoo?

487
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,620
F. Oh, yes.

488
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,440
If I had a nickel for every time the letter F had a word.

489
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,740
If you find a black kazoo, please return it to APO's KC.

490
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,100
Can't get it off.

491
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,400
Darn.

492
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,460
fee德.

493
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,680
F-U.

494
00:24:59,680 --> 00:24:59,700
F

495
00:24:59,700 --> 00:24:59,720
F

496
00:24:59,720 --> 00:24:59,760
T.

497
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,680
Not heard.

498
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,220
Rep Hyeori.

499
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,660
G.

500
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,440
I'm going to play it right now.

501
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,780
See, to me, this song is about politics.

502
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,620
Yeah, politics.

503
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,780
Not like the politics that you think about where it's on the TV.

504
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,360
But about the interaction of more than one person.

505
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,920
It's non-onanic, if you will.

506
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,080
Yeah, non-onanic.

507
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,900
I'm sure some of y'all don't like that.

508
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,980
Because you can't have politics by yourself.

509
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,600
No, you can't.

510
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,680
Oh, that's politics.

511
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,040
Is this politics?

512
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,960
I don't think so.

513
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,320
It plugs in.

514
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,160
It gets penetrated.

515
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,300
Is that a consensual act?

516
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,720
Huh?

517
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,920
Are there two things involved here?

518
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,780
Are they people?

519
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,560
Are they people?

520
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,720
Are you people?

521
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,920
Are you guys people?

522
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:26,420
What?

523
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,280
No, you're not people?

524
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,600
Are you lizards?

525
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,540
Yetis.

526
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,300
Yeti lizards?

527
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,120
Just hecklers that I can't hear?

528
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,200
Oh, yes, dear friends.

529
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,020
If I can give credits right for all of that.

530
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,520
I'll be way ahead.

531
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,820
There's almost I'm almost certain to leave somebody out.

532
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,100
You're about to hear me leave out Reverend A.P.

533
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,340
O Stacey, the lives of his exceeding and terrible murder victims.

534
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,700
and Reverend Bovver.

535
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,480
Let's see.

536
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,680
We heard a lot of the Thorazine Urine Podcast crew,

537
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,800
which includes Reverend Fid Chooley,

538
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,060
Reverend Anna Mall,

539
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,060
Reverend Shaw Goth,

540
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,700
Reverend Nugget.

541
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,040
Reverend Nugget was doing that Nuclear Cancer song.

542
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,680
Let's see.

543
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,940
We heard Reverend Daniel and Goldilocks.

544
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,160
They're newcomers.

545
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:43,080
Daniel was doing that politics rant or statement or whatever.

546
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,960
We heard...

547
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,220
And Goldilocks was accompanying him on the drums.

548
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,040
Right.

549
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,240
I don't have peas on here,

550
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,700
but he's playing bass in the background right now.

551
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,380
Oh, okay.

552
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,980
Guitar work was done by Reverend Hazel of the Windmills,

553
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,740
Reverend Angry Larry,

554
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,060
St. Faltimus Sexmortis,

555
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,580
and Lord Rock God,

556
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,960
and Lord Ferg.

557
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,380
Let's see.

558
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,260
Lemur did the PR news.

559
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,020
We heard Reverend Fox

560
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,240
talking or something.

561
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,160
Dr. Cosmack was on synthesizers,

562
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,000
as was Catfeather at some times.

563
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,400
Reverend Baby Bear was heard somewhere back in there.

564
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,080
See what I mean?

565
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,800
It's hard to...

566
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,280
And that's from looking at a list.

567
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,500
I heard that sweet Baby Bear voice,

568
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,680
and I heard all those things that you just mentioned.

569
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,400
It all sounded really messy and messed up and fun.

570
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,260
It was very messy and messed up and fun.

571
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,960
Although I did work very hard to extract the listenable stuff.

572
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,220
Soon I hope to have hearing aids,

573
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,200
and I'll know what the words are.

574
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,020
There's one person...

575
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,560
who wasn't there,

576
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,340
and I'm afraid won't be there.

577
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,280
We lost a subgenius last week,

578
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,740
Reverend Kenny Floyd,

579
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,320
who was one of P's clench of it,

580
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,500
one might say.

581
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,760
Apparently he died just like today or yesterday

582
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,440
of a massive heart attack

583
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,820
that hit him a few days ago.

584
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,620
And he's not somebody that I knew,

585
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,920
but he was a subgenius

586
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,140
who amused lots of other folks

587
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,220
on the Facebook pages that he was on.

588
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,300
And so...

589
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,500
See you on the saucers there, Reverend Floyd.

590
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,300
You will be missed.

591
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:53,960
Also...

592
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,940
Oh, wait, look.

593
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,400
Here's Lonesome Cowboy Dave calling in, I think.

594
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,640
Let's see.

595
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,380
Is that Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

596
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,520
Yes, it is.

597
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,340
We got our Dave!

598
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,420
Is it for any of your beeswax?

599
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,220
Or other subjugated materials?

600
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,500
Your beach wax?

601
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,740
Beach wax.

602
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,580
Oh, you got that beach waxed, right?

603
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,000
No, I had a wax job,

604
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,400
but I was at the beach.

605
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,840
I noticed that I've been taking pills

606
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,700
that have a warning on them that said

607
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,900
do not go out in direct sunlight for too long.

608
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,200
Vampire pills.

609
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,440
Yeah, vampire pills.

610
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,500
And I've been taking these vampire pills

611
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,980
and I've been going out in hot sunlight

612
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,000
and didn't know it.

613
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,380
I hope I haven't screwed myself up,

614
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,520
over the last three months.

615
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,380
We do too, Dave.

616
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,060
Well, you do too, Dave.

617
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,700
Yee.

618
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,460
Well, the sunlight won't hurt you.

619
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,840
It'll just hurt the drug.

620
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,560
The drug is the vampire.

621
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,660
And because it works for the insurance

622
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,300
and medical companies.

623
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,060
See?

624
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,500
But you're not in a position where you can just

625
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,800
drive a stake through its heart.

626
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,180
Because they'll charge you for that, too.

627
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,760
Mm-hmm.

628
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,160
Yeah.

629
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,280
Take it out of your deductible.

630
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,300
It's like a porterhouse.

631
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,400
Yeah.

632
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:05,400


633
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,280
Or something like that.

634
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,480
They charge an awful lot to drive a porterhouse

635
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,440
through the heart of any big farm as a CEO's heart.

636
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,860
And it won't fit, but that's the biggest thing

637
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,580
they have in their chest is a porterhouse.

638
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,620
But what about a T-bone?

639
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,040
A T-bone would work because of the design.

640
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,240
That's what I was thinking.

641
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,180
Yeah, it would be a lot better than the porterhouse.

642
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:25,660
Yeah.

643
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,500
You'd have to remove the meat

644
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,660
and then just use the bone to impale the vampire person.

645
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,660
Right.

646
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
And it helps if it's silver,

647
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,380
if the bone is made of silver.

648
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,040
Yeah.

649
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,660
There's been a lot of sickness lately.

650
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,260
On today's recording date, which happens to be 9-11,

651
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,260
Hillary Clinton got sick at that 9-11 memorial.

652
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,840
Did she?

653
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,900
You haven't heard that?

654
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,460
The deplorables were dancing in the street all day

655
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,040
because it proves that she's going to die

656
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,820
in the next five minutes, which is, apparently,

657
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,160
they seem to feel is the only way their boy Trump is going to win.

658
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,360
Yeah.

659
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,520
But I've got some bad news for them,

660
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,800
because that thing that gave the hour-long,

661
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,660
flawless, energetic speech at the Democratic Convention

662
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,020
was obviously a CGI fake.

663
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,880
And that would explain everything.

664
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,020
Friends, the real Hillary Clinton died 20 years ago,

665
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,600
and a cleverly designed evil socialist robot

666
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,060
has been filling in since then, pretending to act

667
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,360
like a moderate robot.

668
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,380
A Republican disguised as a Democrat.

669
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,720
And it might be breaking down now,

670
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,240
but they'll have a new one ready soon.

671
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,280
It's immortal, you see.

672
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,660
The Clinton bot...

673
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,760
Is that British way when you call them socialist robots?

674
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,680
Or robits?

675
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,680
Well, the thing is that it's...

676
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,100
Okay, yeah, Hillary's already dead,

677
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,440
but she can't die.

678
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,720
She's an immortal, evil Clinton bot robot.

679
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,060
And I read that on Internet websites

680
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,080
that all tell me everything I most want to hear

681
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,960
and hide the things they know would make me uncomfortable,

682
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,100
so it must be true.

683
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,060
Well, what about Humpty Grumpy Dumpty?

684
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,360
He's immortal, too, because he's so amazing.

685
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,560
His amazingness makes him immortal.

686
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,180
Well, I know his hair's been around for a while.

687
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,760
He's never been wrong.

688
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,880
He can't be wrong.

689
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,940
Well, Rob, he can't be wrong.

690
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,700
And his Kool-Aid is the finest and most habitable.

691
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,060
He's the most habit-forming of them all.

692
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,920
They thought the Obama Kool-Aid was good,

693
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,020
but, man, that was nothing compared to the Trump-Aid.

694
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,860
Mm, Trump-Aid.

695
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,820
Sweet and silly.

696
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,580
Ah.

697
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,620
So, yeah, the Hillary bot cannot...

698
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,780
It's the bot that refuses to die.

699
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,600
It could die, but it won't,

700
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,560
and it's just doing that just to make people mad.

701
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,680
Well, what about all the weird robots?

702
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,420
They're all going to vote for Hillary for berries,

703
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,500
and they'll have to come up with stuff like that.

704
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,720
I heard they were all going to vote for Hillary.

705
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,640
Now what are they going to do once they find out she's a socialist robot?

706
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,800
There, her.

707
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,260
I think they'll still vote for her,

708
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,240
because they're we people, you see,

709
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,000
and if they're we people, then they'll vote for Hillary.

710
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,460
Like you as a we, perhaps?

711
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,420
A we as in Princess We.

712
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,200
Yes, I thought so.

713
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:29,860
This.

714
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,300
Four more days.

715
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,940
And you told us this is funny.

716
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:51,880
Well, that's the thing.

717
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,060
I actually am very long- möglichst,

718
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,600
so we're stillam Wave.

719
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:54,720
These time-time people think like that ...

720
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,140
Big-that's the thing,

721
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,140


722
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,140


723
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,820
More often than not,

724
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,380
even though I know something,

725
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,980
That's an eyes-only, ears-only, foreskin-only classified email, dude.

726
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,080
It's okay.

727
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,860
I won't wear the funny snout, either the pig snout or anything like that.

728
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,220
You know, there were several cases of swine flu, and I was one of them.

729
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,540
I'm not a kid, but I was a swine for quite some time.

730
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,320
And I got out of the military, and I couldn't stop it.

731
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,020
I had to keep on keeping on.

732
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,740
That's when I realized I'd joined the wrong political rumpet.

733
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,180
Oh, no.

734
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,560
I mentioned the burgers on the calendar.

735
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,620
Oh, my glands.

736
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,060
Oh, poor Dave.

737
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,640
No, that was somebody else I invited.

738
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,000
He's hiding under the table again now.

739
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,060
Oh, I see.

740
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:53,860
Hmm.

741
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,140
Under the table, you say?

742
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,000
Yes.

743
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,360
This is where he prefers to stay.

744
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,180
He's afraid of birds and chipmunks and squirrels and other small animals.

745
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,260
Are you talking about Bob?

746
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,360
Well, I was talking about Bob, but I guess this is even more about Bob than I thought.

747
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,440
He is afraid of squirrels, isn't he?

748
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Well, you know, he said to pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

749
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,660
But when he said that, it had the opposite effect, because people line up.

750
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,100
Cash in hand, hoping to relax in the safety of his delusions.

751
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:36,780
Which proves to themselves by giving him money that they, too, are truly stupid.

752
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,260
Just like him.

753
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,840
Some of these people are doctors, lawyers, world leaders, famous artists.

754
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:55,680
But they know that as the years go on, income and peace of mind will become dependent not on wit and perceptiveness or ethical judgment,

755
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,500
but on...

756
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,840
Your lack thereof.

757
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,180
They're investing in a devolving future.

758
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,400
And we can see in the comments on all internet articles that that is true.

759
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,800
People want to be as dumb as their best hero.

760
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,560
Or dumber.

761
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,420
And when Bob is your hero, that's a tall order.

762
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,640
Or a short order, as it might be.

763
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,200
Because, see, how can you even hope to match Bob?

764
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,860
In that way.

765
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,280
It's impossible to be that witless.

766
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,540
I would never even try.

767
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,880
I would never even try.

768
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,900
That's because you're too smart, Dave.

769
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,400
Well, there's those people who want to have Bob for a boss.

770
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,860
They want Bob to tell them what to do.

771
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,740
They want to put a mood ring on Bob.

772
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh, no.

773
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,740
That's repugnant.

774
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,640
And that's so they can know where they stand with him.

775
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,640
And if he's feeling good, his mood ring turns...

776
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:01,180
And if he's feeling bad, it leaves a great big ugly dent on their forehead.

777
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,940
Price Bob.

778
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,260
I've got one of those.

779
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,700
And I don't even know how I got it.

780
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,260
You mean it's like proximity to Bob?

781
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,400
It looks like somebody took a big spoon or something and whacked me on the head.

782
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,480
I have this long, like, indentation on my forehead.

783
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,800
No.

784
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,320
An indentation on my forehead.

785
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,140
And it was...

786
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,700
I think it was about a year ago.

787
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,540
Somebody said, hey, did you ever notice you've got a large indentation?

788
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,140
On your head?

789
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,140
I said, what?

790
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,980
And I looked in the mirror and I had one.

791
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,860
I have one.

792
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,500
Dave is Bob's mood ring.

793
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,240
You're the mood ring.

794
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,860
You're part of Bob's mood ring.

795
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,760
My life has meaning now.

796
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,420
Finally.

797
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,400
I can go on.

798
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,680
I can carry on.

799
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,960
I'm Bob's mood ring.

800
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,940
Are you sure?

801
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,960
What a terrible existence to wish on anybody.

802
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,060
Are you sure that it's not just a forehead dimple?

803
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Um, it could be.

804
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,240
You know, like the kind people get on their cheeks?

805
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:07,160
Well, remember, Dave's got two foreheads to deal with on account of the double mean baby head on the back.

806
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,620
On the back side.

807
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,660
It's a double meaning baby head, too.

808
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,820
It's just an optic brief.

809
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,400
There's a double meaning baby head as well?

810
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,380
Yeah, double meaning, double meaning, double...

811
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,340
Yeah.

812
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,480
And double mean?

813
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,260
Double entendre.

814
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:23,980
Double.

815
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,760
Double.

816
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,400
Double.

817
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,760
I thought it was the scuff left by my doppelganger.

818
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,940
But I realized my doppelganger was in a different gang than I.

819
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,020
Right, the gang.

820
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,840
If you got more than one, they gang up on you.

821
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,520
A doppelgang up on you.

822
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,700
But you kind of have an idea of what they're going to do because they're all just like you, right?

823
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,780
Right.

824
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,440
So it's like you both hit each other at the same time and your fists meet right in the middle.

825
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,640
Instead of hitting each other's face, you hit each other right in the fist.

826
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,360
Fist?

827
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,380
Over and over again.

828
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:57,720
You bounce off each other.

829
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,640
It's like the Groucho and Pico routine and also Harpo routine where they're dressed alike

830
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,560
and it's the pretend mirror.

831
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,280
Was that from Night at the Opera or Day at the Races or...

832
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,560
You know what I'm talking about.

833
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,420
Right, yes I do.

834
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,080
It's an amazing scene because, yeah, one of them looks just like Groucho

835
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:23,920
and Groucho thinks he's in front of a mirror because Harpo or whoever is duplicating his every move.

836
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,740
I know that scene.

837
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,340
Yeah.

838
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,720
Was that All Hail Fredonia Land of the Freeman Home in the Rain?

839
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,560
I'm not sure which one that was because I haven't seen any of them in such a long time.

840
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,680
Now why is that?

841
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,360
I'm wondering.

842
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:45,300
Well, we know that we're in bad times when we don't watch the Marx Brothers, even if we like them or not.

843
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:53,200
We know it produces an enzyme in the body that's close to the spit muscle, at least as far as change things go.

844
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,720
And it produces a happy...

845
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,060
It produces a happy glow for many, many, many, many, many, many times.

846
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,580
Well, there was...

847
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:08,700
The Marx Brothers were kind of almost at the different end of the spectrum than, say, the Three Stooges,

848
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,400
who came up last week on Dr. Sinister's show.

849
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:21,360
Princess Vuy was downstairs last Sunday during that show and heard me screaming upstairs

850
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,020
and didn't know what was going on.

851
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,140
But it was because I'd been told that the owner of...

852
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:33,620
The person who's made all the money off the Three Stooges syndicated showings on television

853
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,260
for a long stretch of time was Pat Robertson,

854
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:44,380
the so-called Christian PTL guy.

855
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,300
Pat Robertson, apparently.

856
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,900
It was his station and they had the rights to all those subgenius...

857
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,080
I mean, Stooges.

858
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,120
Easy mistake, mate.

859
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,680
Three Stooges shorts.

860
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,140
So, yeah, Pat Robertson was making the money off of what, you know,

861
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,440
in a true world would go to the Horowitz estate and the fine estate.

862
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,800
Yeah.

863
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,180
That's sick. That's sick.

864
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,080
Well, that's... Hence the screaming.

865
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,180
Yeah, that's... And I was terrified.

866
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,840
I went running upstairs to see what he was yelling about and then I realized he was...

867
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,920
By the way, I didn't get a recording of any of that.

868
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,780
If somebody did...

869
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Talking to Dr. Sinister.

870
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,900
That would... I wouldn't mind getting...

871
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,880
But we can imagine... Excuse my language.

872
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:38,100
We can imagine in our minds the shock, the utter, the pure despair that ran the course through your body

873
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,920
like amazing... like a mighty river.

874
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:46,100
Hearing that the Christian Broadcasting Network owned Larry Fine's toupee.

875
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,580
Yeah, no kidding. It was... How unfair.

876
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,440
And how come I didn't know that before?

877
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,680
That was the other thing.

878
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,260
Yeah.

879
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,160
I think it was exclusionary thought. You didn't want to...

880
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,500
Right.

881
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:03,340
You knew you didn't want to know that because it would have meant an end to many, many fine things in your life.

882
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:11,040
Well, you know, I'm a libtard, so I live in an imaginary fairytale universe where everything is nice and everything's free.

883
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,480
That's me.

884
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,140
That's me too.

885
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,440
It's a world where Hillary Clinton is not going to invade the Ukraine and Syria and...

886
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,900
and what's-his-name Trump head is not going to invade Mexico.

887
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,660
We need wars, but we need them like... places like Topanga Canyon and Foxfire Reserve and Santa Cruz.

888
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,800
That's where we need them.

889
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,080
Them.

890
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,940
War. War with Walmart. War between Walmart and Target.

891
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,280
War between...

892
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,580
That's the kind of war we're talking about. Shooting war.

893
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,320
You know, because...

894
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:56,720
Hey, companies are people too. People get in fights. Companies can get in fights.

895
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,020
Exactly.

896
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:58,220
People...

897
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:06,940
You've heard of Citizens United, haven't you? If they have the right to be... have free speech and stuff like that, they also have the right to bear arms and legs too.

898
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,100
I read just today that...

899
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,240
If you're a corporation and you're a person, then you have the right to bear guns.

900
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,800
I bear a gun.

901
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,140
I bear a grudge.

902
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,420
Ha ha ha.

903
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,540
I bear a scar.

904
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:39,780
Actually, when I get back to Texas, I'm going to have to... in order to fit in, I am actually going to have to kind of refresh my gun safety course and probably buy a handgun, probably from my brother, because I can get a good deal.

905
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,880
Heck, I can barely keep up.

906
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,560
Princess Weish fired her first handgun when we were in...

907
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,160
Oh, go ahead. Tell the world. I shot a gun.

908
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,900
She shot a clown.

909
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,920
I did.

910
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,180
She did. She shot a clown. But she got him...

911
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,980
There's not a thing wrong with that. It's a happy day.

912
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,780
She shot him in the hair, though. It didn't actually kill him.

913
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,440
And it right dead square in the hair.

914
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,900
He had huge hair. It's hard to miss.

915
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:19,240
Well, if I had my druthers, I'd rather shoot a square in the hair, a clock, a chimney, a sweep, or I mean a clown.

916
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,880
Oh, a clown could shoot too.

917
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,580
Somebody in Times Square, nobody would even care.

918
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,660
He could shoot another clown in front of a stadium full of 20,000 people.

919
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:36,460
And the conspiracy of the Obamies wouldn't do anything about it, because they're prejudiced against clowns.

920
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,620
They want clowns to just shoot each other to death.

921
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,000
They don't care. They don't wear no underwear.

922
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,300
Is that true?

923
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,160
Well, I just said that.

924
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,260
Clowns don't wear underwear?

925
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,060
I don't know.

926
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,500
They are not permitted to wear underwear.

927
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,500
They leave their shiftless monogram on everything they own.

928
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,620
Can you imagine what kind of leavings, what kind of droppings are in their underpants?

929
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,400
Clownies.

930
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,680
They drop clownies?

931
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,260
Yeah, little baby clownies.

932
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,940
Skid marks from clowns.

933
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,280
Scary.

934
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,000
The worst kind.

935
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:17,960
And they even like, you know, when you look at a piece of pizza and you see the Virgin Mary, many people look at their skid marks and see they're like that.

936
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,740
That one clown in the evil clown.

937
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,380
What was the name of that movie?

938
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,600
Bozo's Little Brown Brothers.

939
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,480
Yeah.

940
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,500
I thought it was Bozo's Revenge, but that worked.

941
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,560
Ah, Bozo's Revenge.

942
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,920
It's sweet like grapes and donuts.

943
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,500
And more.

944
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:47,420
Have you spent any time thinking of the antediluvian river that we're going to have to cross once?

945
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,500
Donald Trump takes over the universe?

946
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,620
I prefer not to think about that.

947
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,700
But I do have a raft.

948
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,640
We are building a raft.

949
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:05,540
We would build an ark, but wood's really expensive.

950
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,480
Decent wood.

951
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,000
Don't propose these catastrophic things to me.

952
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,040
I can't handle it.

953
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,700
I'm not worried about that because I've got Bob in my mind.

954
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,940
I don't worry about that.

955
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,500
I don't worry about nothing.

956
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,140
I've got old Bob.

957
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,060
Don't blame me.

958
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,980
I voted for Bob.

959
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:32,640
If you look at any of the main subgenius Facebook pages, you can see that there actually is a button called,

960
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,380
Don't blame me.

961
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,320
I voted for Bob.

962
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,600
It's red, white, and blue.

963
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,620
It's out there.

964
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,500
I'm a voter for Bob too.

965
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,800
I'm a voter for Bob for you.

966
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,660
And if you're like most subgeniuses that see the picture of that button,

967
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:55,700
what they do then is they copy that little one-inch high JPEG and they blow it up as big as they can,

968
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,060
even though it looks terrible.

969
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,800
Then they print it on their inkjet printer and cut it out and put it on a piece of cardboard

970
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:09,880
because that way they don't have to, you know, buy it from you-know-who.

971
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,640
I can't say.

972
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,320
But that's what they're doing right now.

973
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:21,700
I see you out there, Mr. Face Bobby, Mr. Radio Bobby.

974
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,320
Well, I don't need to read no book of the subgenius or be a minister or nothing like that

975
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:33,320
because I can just get everything I need to know just right from the free Internet podcasties.

976
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,940
And with the Internet and with my printer, I can have anything I want.

977
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,920
I can just do anything.

978
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,160
Well, I would never do a thing like that.

979
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,940
It would be wrong.

980
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:43,540
Wrong.

981
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:44,360


982
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,720
But it would be wrong.

983
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,600
And I see so many wrong things.

984
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:04,960
Somebody said he reprinted the entirety of Revelation X on an old analog physical, a throbber they called it.

985
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,180
Dot matrix.

986
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,100
Dot matrix.

987
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,300
That's what we called it.

988
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:11,960
Yeah, it was.

989
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,380
It was.

990
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,300
Well, we hear it.

991
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:21,020
We had this bin with 100 monkeys in it and 100 dot matrix printers.

992
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,120
So that's what they printed.

993
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,540
And then they printed the book onto the head of a pin.

994
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,760
Well, it was a thumbtack, to be fair.

995
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,260
OK.

996
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,060
But that's an analog computer with 100 monkeys?

997
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,660
No, not a computer, just a printer, just a dot matrix printer and a bunch of monkeys.

998
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,740
If you throw a computer into the mix, that ruins it.

999
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,540
Or a keyboard, even.

1000
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:52,220
We hooked the dot matrix printer up to like four or five monkeys' brains at once.

1001
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:59,220
And if you mix the monkeys right, they'll transmit the word of Bob directly into that dot matrix printer.

1002
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,000
Jase.

1003
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,140
What is that in the background?

1004
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,960
It's the laughter of the evil ones.

1005
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,580
It is the derisive cacophonous sounds of the evil ones.

1006
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,140
The pointing fingers and sneering.

1007
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:24,200
I was listening to the cacophony and saying, what ye hath wrought, what ye hath wrought.

1008
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,540
Yeah, I think that was you saying that.

1009
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:25,820
That was me.

1010
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,960
Yes, and I was pointing at you.

1011
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,640
Cacophony.

1012
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:37,900
Well, the background music has been doctor music from the last X Day Drill.

1013
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,560
I already rattled off the credits of most of it.

1014
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:43,680
I mean, I think the only thing that's left to me is the music.

1015
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,520
It's the music of the people that were on that stage those nights.

1016
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,780
It sounds very juicy, I must admit.

1017
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,000
Well, it should sound like people having fun.

1018
00:51:53,140 --> 00:52:00,960
It may not sound good exactly, but it should impart a vibe of slack, actually.

1019
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:01,600
Yes.

1020
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:10,060
It's true that the first night, we had like a cardboard box instead of a drum set, I believe.

1021
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,460
But it sounded pretty good.

1022
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:11,980
Yes.

1023
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,500
Some of us drummers knew how to drum on a cardboard.

1024
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,060
You could sit on it while drumming on it.

1025
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:24,000
It was actually a wooden box that was made for drumming on, but it was indeed a box drum.

1026
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,300
They sound quite nice.

1027
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,280
Yes, they do.

1028
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,820
Just as a coffee can does.

1029
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:35,080
We heard Princess Wee on spoons much earlier.

1030
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,040
You were playing spoons, and I think Shoggoth was playing a coffee.

1031
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:40,040


1032
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:44,820
Kind of a pleasant little ditty or tune on his electric uke.

1033
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,200
Ah. Is that what that was?

1034
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:48,640
They have electric uke-o-fires?

1035
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,960
I thought that was futuristic electronic ukes.

1036
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,880
Like they have them now?

1037
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,320
Yeah, they have electronic ukes.

1038
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,720
They have electronic everything.

1039
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,860
They have electronic presidential candidates.

1040
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,600
Come on.

1041
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,280
Hillary can't die.

1042
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,900
It might break down every now and then and kind of go...

1043
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,880
Brr. Brr.

1044
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,360
Oil can. Oil can.

1045
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,500
But, you know, danger.

1046
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,320
Will Robinson.

1047
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,680
Yeah, but who doesn't go brr-brr-brr.

1048
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,780
Oil can. Oil can.

1049
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,800
Oh, that's the thing.

1050
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,960
Oil can Harry, the princess of the May Show.

1051
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,940
No one ever gets sick.

1052
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,140
Ever.

1053
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,600
Unless they're about to die.

1054
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,580
If you want them.

1055
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,800
If you want it that way.

1056
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,160
That's the important thing.

1057
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,240
No recoveries anywhere?

1058
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,320
No?

1059
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,220
No.

1060
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,060
No.

1061
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:39,460
No.

1062
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,280
Not if you're, you know, not if you're the evil one.

1063
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,160
Well, what if you're just implausible?

1064
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:51,160
Then you're probably, then you're gonna, you're gonna come dangerously close to getting elected.

1065
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,180
You might, you might even make it.

1066
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:53,840
Oh, no.

1067
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,260
You might surprise the pundits and the, them smarty pants that know how to read.

1068
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,420
Them smarty pants that think they know everything cause they, cause they went to that fancy school they call a high school or whatnot.

1069
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:08,900
No.

1070
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,600
I am.

1071
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,340
Oh, yeah.

1072
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,040
You be sure.

1073
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,420
Yeah, I think some libtards gonna get their, they're gonna have their heads explode.

1074
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,820
And we're gonna be subdued.

1075
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,600
And did you know she called us deplorable?

1076
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,340
They can't deplore me.

1077
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,140
I'm a citizen.

1078
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,500
I was born here.

1079
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,760
I stole that.

1080
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,040
I stole that.

1081
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,540
Well, no wonder.

1082
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,880
It was stolen.

1083
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:33,740
Yeah.

1084
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,760
Hot property is usually quite humorous.

1085
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,760
Or at least it's humorous.

1086
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,400
If anybody knows.

1087
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,140
If anybody gets elected this time, it was cause they cheated.

1088
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,480
Cause it was fixed.

1089
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,220
If anybody gets elected at all, it's cause it was fixed.

1090
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,160
There's no other way anyone would vote for anyone.

1091
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,720
I'd like to vote for the Green Party if I could, but I don't know if it's going to appear on my ballots.

1092
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,260
Isn't it?

1093
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,000
No comment.

1094
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,340
No comment?

1095
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,020
Mm-mm.

1096
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,380
Why, you know some Greens that you'd rather just see?

1097
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,840
Can you call them pinks or something?

1098
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:15,260
Oh, I think Greens are an important part of any subgenius's diet.

1099
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,260
Oh, yeah.

1100
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,700
Like the flying, and so is pasta, as in the flying spaghetti monster.

1101
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,400
Mm-hmm.

1102
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,880
Bob's gotta eat too.

1103
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:32,500
So he's eating these human heads just like a little cannibal baby off there on a distant star.

1104
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,520
Yes, but not for much longer, Dave.

1105
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,820
Because it's getting to be that time.

1106
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,420
Yes, it is.

1107
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,140
And what time might that be?

1108
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,920
About 10 o'clock.

1109
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,580
Oh, shoot, a clock.

1110
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,020
In Clevelandia, yeah, that's what it might be.

1111
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:52,560
It's that time.

1112
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,580
Wherever you're listening from, person, out there on the internet.

1113
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,060
It could be five miles away in Australia for a week.

1114
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:05,040
Yeah, for one thing, there is no such thing as the internet, and none of that stuff is real.

1115
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,720
You're imagining it.

1116
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,860
And everybody imagines something slightly different, but mostly pretty much the same.

1117
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,860
That's how they get away with it.

1118
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:22,360
But I've been ready to play this song at the end of every show for about five shows now,

1119
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,540
because it was a song that Fantastic Plastics did at that devotional.

1120
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:33,580
And actually, I like their live version better, but this is the studio version, as it were,

1121
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:33,960
Ah.

1122
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,700
of that delightful cover.

1123
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:42,220
Well, what does it matter as long as we're all knee-deep in excrement?

1124
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,400
You know what I mean?

1125
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,660
Oh, how well I know, Dave.

1126
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,300
It's rough.

1127
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,660
It's very rough and tough.

1128
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,840
Rough and tumble, that's what we need to make our stalwarts strong.

1129
00:56:54,260 --> 00:57:02,480
And friends, if you want to hose off those boots of excrement, why, just go to that hose at subgenius.com.

1130
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,800
It's got everything.

1131
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,460
Actually, today I posted...

1132
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:14,840
MP3s of all of the recordings broken down by song from the first three days of X Day.

1133
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,840
But the only way you can get to those links is if you're a subgenius minister, don't you see?

1134
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,320
Or were at 19X Day.

1135
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:29,700
But among the people who can't go there this time are you and the Fantastic Plastics.

1136
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,700
So, Dave, I'm going to have to let you go.

1137
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,840
Can I ask you just one more?

1138
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,440
If you happen to know...

1139
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,280
I'm going to ask you just one more.

1140
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:44,360
If you happen to know that in the 1890s in this area of northeastern Ohio, there was a company called American Fork and Hoe.

1141
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,940
Fork and Hoe?

1142
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:54,980
Yes, and I can't believe that people haven't had more fun with that because it's the real name of a real company that no longer exists.

1143
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,080
Apparently because they, you know, it's the way it sounded.

1144
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,080
Well, they can start having fun now.

1145
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,200
Praise Bob.

1146
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,880
Praise Bob and praise Dave.

1147
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,280
The beating of a drum.

1148
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:07,940
Yeah.

1149
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:29,360
Yeah, I don't think it's a tune that should be covered, if you're on a show.

1150
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,360


1151
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,360


1152
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,360


1153
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,360


1154
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,360


1155
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,360


1156
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,360


1157
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,360


1158
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,400
See you.

1159
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:29,420
Bye-bye.

1160
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:29,440
Bye-bye.

1161
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:29,460
Bye-bye.

1162
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,460


1163
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,460


1164
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,460


1165
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,460


1166
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,460


1167
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,460


1168
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,460


1169
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,460


1170
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,060
Bye-bye.

1171
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:30,440
Bye-bye.

1172
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,580
Bye-bye.

1173
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,560
Bye-bye.

1174
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,420
Bye-bye.

1175
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,980
Your rocket old blue and your nuclear boots

1176
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,040
You are a thriller

1177
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,260
You are a sight to see

1178
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,900
My own circuitry

1179
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,560
You take control of me

1180
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,740
You are a killer

1181
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,120
Electricity in your top-end jeans

1182
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,840
That spark at the seams

1183
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,900
You are a thriller

1184
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,020
Such a sight to behold

1185
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,660
To the touch you're told

1186
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,280
You had to break the mold

1187
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,360
You are a killer

1188
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,160
A troublemaker

1189
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,740
The earth shaker

1190
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,040
Troublemaker, troublemaker, earth shaker

1191
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,660
A troublemaker

1192
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,380
The heartbreaker

1193
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,120
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heartbreaker

1194
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,060
Troublemaker

1195
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,420
If love's gonna kill

1196
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,040
Then death is a thrill

1197
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,680
You improve your skill

1198
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,700
You are a thriller

1199
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,940
As you hear this song

1200
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,260
You're gonna feel the thrill

1201
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:35,260


1202
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,540
You know the code is wrong

1203
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,020
I said the code is wrong

1204
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,320
You are a killer

1205
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,940
A troublemaker

1206
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,560
The earth shaker

1207
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,920
Troublemaker, troublemaker, earth shaker

1208
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,540
A troublemaker

1209
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,180
The heartbreaker

1210
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:22,020
Troublemaker, troublemaker, earth shaker

1211
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,020
This is the way I'm gonna end my life

1212
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,340
Still one of a kind

1213
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,000
Time after time

1214
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,560
You were the best in the line

1215
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,640
You are a thriller

1216
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,820
There's not a devil in me

1217
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,460
There's a devil in you

1218
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,120
Kill the devil in YOU

1219
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,160
You are a killer

1220
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:35,260
An earth shaker

1221
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:38,480
A troublemaker, the earth shaker

1222
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,780
Troublemaker, troublemaker, earth shaker

1223
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,100
A troublemaker, the heartbreaker

1224
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,040
Do you wanna touch it?

1225
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,700
Yes, I wanna touch it

1226
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,260
Do you wanna play it?

1227
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,920
No, I'm gonna steal it

1228
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,620
Do you wanna touch it?

1229
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,200
Yes, I wanna touch it

1230
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,900
Do you wanna play it?

1231
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,480
No, I'm gonna steal it

1232
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,580
For one thing, there's no such thing as the internet

1233
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,400
And none of that stuff is real

1234
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,100
You're imagining it

1235
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,860
And everybody imagines something slightly different

1236
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,760
But mostly pretty much

1237
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:34,900
something

1238
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,300
It's the same

1239
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,260
That's how they get away with it
