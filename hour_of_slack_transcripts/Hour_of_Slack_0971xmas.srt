00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,860
The Stone King of our Love!

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,280
仲介綝 priest

3
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:42,740
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,240
Just like the ones I used to know

5
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,140
Where the treetops glisten

6
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,700
And kitties listen to the air

7
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,860
Sleigh bells in the snow

8
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,280
Ooh, oh

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:23,460
Ooh, oh

10
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,240
I'm

11
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,680
I'm

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,120


14
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,860
I's

15
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:41,860


16
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,460
I's

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:43,460


18
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,220
Diana

19
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,220
Es

20
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,240
Diana

21
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,240
Yes

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,620
Stop

23
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,420
Drop

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,700
I

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,560
I

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,600
I

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:55,920
I

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,100
I

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,100


30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,100


31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,100


32
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,120
I

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,060
Merry Christmas and be white.

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,080
Merry Christmas and be white.

35
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:11,580


36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:22,320
Merry Christmas.

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,160
Merry Christmas.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,080
Merry Christmas.

39
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,940
Merry Christmas.

40
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,060
Merry Christmas.

41
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,780
Merry Christmas.

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,120
Merry Christmas.

43
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,980
Merry Christmas.

44
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,920
Merry Christmas.

45
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,120
Merry Christmas.

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,180
Merry Christmas.

47
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:07,320
May your two days be merry and bright

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:22,580
And may all your Christmases be white

49
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:47,800
And may all your Christmases be white

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:25,940
And may all your Christmases be white

51
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:53,120
And may all your Christmases be white

52
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:26,120
And may all your Christmases be white

53
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:43,020
And may all your Christmases be white

54
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,860
And may all your Christmases be white

55
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:56,120
And may all your Christmases be white

56
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:04,680
And may all your Christmases be white

57
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,480
And may all your Christmases be white

58
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

59
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

60
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,540
And may all your Christmases be white

61
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

62
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,560
We must buy our toys!

63
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,020
We have to buy some marketing scheme for children's toys.

64
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,880
It will empower us to resist them.

65
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:17,500
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

66
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,140
It will be a lot of fun.

67
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,980
But for kids, do we understand and accept?

68
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,060
For the usual, plus expenses.

69
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,060
Good.

70
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,600
Okay, I think for the girls, we'll have the strawberry rainbow hearts.

71
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,520
And for the boys, little tiny Transformers.

72
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,860
Robots will change into dollar bills and back again.

73
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,480
Yes, but how about...

74
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,480
That will of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

75
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,940
Good at what, the muscle?

76
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,280
Good.

77
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,140
Good!

78
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,200
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.

79
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,900
Good will have free physical attributes according to human desires.

80
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,440
Sexual desires.

81
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,380
Latent in children.

82
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:29,380
Children brought out through the vehicle of this so-called...

83
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,520
So far, we're told these boys have church.

84
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
Batteries not included.

85
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,140
Yes.

86
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,420
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme.

87
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,180
Recorded there at Dockstock 1984.

88
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,340
And me and Palmer Veedies.

89
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,880
Angels we have heard on high.

90
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,140
It was by the Philistines.

91
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:02,620
The collage called All the Money You've Got is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album,

92
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
which you can get for free.

93
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,960
Get this.

94
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:12,660
Check out this website, obtuse.iuma.com.

95
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,980
That's obtuse...

96
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,920
Excuse me.

97
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,220
Some of these subgeniuses.

98
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,660
That's obtuse.iuma.

99
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,820
dot com.

100
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,220
Free.

101
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,440
The obtuse thing.

102
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,500
And before that, jingle bells from the Mill Valley Taters.

103
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,300
Oh, and this background music is Christmas Gas.

104
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,100
14 blasted holiday carols with Slim Spinkter.

105
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,040
Now, his name is not spelled Stinktor, but Spinkter.

106
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,600
www.slimspinkter.com has...

107
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,160
Or you can write to slim at...

108
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,020
Slim Spinkter.

109
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,060
But that's S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

110
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,100
Slimspinkter.com.

111
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,500
Ah, yes.

112
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,240
And next up, the real story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

113
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,180
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

114
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,380
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

115
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,780
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

116
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:13,840
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

117
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:13,840


118
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,840
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

119
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

120
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,860
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

121
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,680
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

122
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:51,660
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

123
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:18,940
S-P-I-N-C-T-E-R.

124
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,860
He wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy, but he couldn't.

125
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,880
He wanted 10s and 20s.

126
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,460
10s and 20s.

127
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,580
And he got McDonald's gift certificates and he got Zuzu's pedals.

128
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,180
And that's the real story of Christmas.

129
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,740
Dave.

130
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

131
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,260
A lot of people don't know this, but Lonesome Cowboy Dave

132
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,660
was the original producer of the album.

133
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,140
original Mr. Jingling.

134
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,540
That was so long

135
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,520
ago, Chaz. That was another

136
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,540
life, and that was another lifestyle.

137
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,580
I lived then with a very,

138
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,400
very, very dear friend of mine,

139
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,460
still to this day,

140
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Mr. Horace Joris Nobo

141
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,500
Monkey, and he and I

142
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,300
were the best.

143
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,540
Those were the days, weren't they?

144
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,560
I don't know. The sun never came

145
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,140
up, but we still called them days.

146
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,900
We were feisty

147
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,440
people then. The glass was always

148
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
half full, and we were always happy.

149
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,500
Wasn't that when you originally met Bob

150
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,540
was when you were the original Mr.

151
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,520
Jingling, and you were hanging out down

152
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,380
in the Greenwich Village? Everything had

153
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,240
tassels that year. I think it was

154
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,960
19... That's true.

155
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,700
What bar did you run into him at? Was it Santa Claus?

156
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,380
You? I think it was

157
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,340
Bob. We were looking for records at

158
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,520
Bleeker Bob's one day, and I was wearing the tutu,

159
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
and he recognized me as

160
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,580
Swingin' Sam, also better known as

161
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,480
Mr. Jingling here in Cleveland Town.

162
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,260
He could tell by my little elf

163
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,180
tassels and the fact that I had

164
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,220
the... We were on all of that.

165
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,220
How did that paternity suit ever turn out

166
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,740
between Dobbs and Santa?

167
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,040
And who? His dad.

168
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,900
Santa Dog. I don't know.

169
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,720
You know, and I don't think it was...

170
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,760
Yes, but St. Nicholas, this is fact,

171
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,540
St. Nicholas punched

172
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,320
another bishop in the nose

173
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,880
and bloodied his nose.

174
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,040
And sucked him. Really? The historical

175
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,180
St. Nicholas?

176
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,280
Over the trinity of God.

177
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,240
The original St. Nicholas?

178
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,240


179
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,400
Nicholas in Turkey?

180
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,320
I swear upon Bob.

181
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,320
Who the hell is God?

182
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,720
The heart of the country.

183
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,440
I could tell he said God.

184
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,080
Who the hell is God?

185
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,740
Who the hell is God?

186
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,720
Ask Dobbs one day.

187
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,460
That's the question we should be asking.

188
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,520
Suddenly, a lightning bolt

189
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,260
struck from nowhere on that

190
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,300
bright, sunny day.

191
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,400
Bob did a backflip, and from that day

192
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,080
on, he too was a believer.

193
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,040
And from the snow...

194
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,760
A little child bearing flowers

195
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,200
emerged.

196
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,680
Chip, what else was on the table?

197
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,640
Each one a dirty flower.

198
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,500
The historical

199
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,840
Santa Claus is

200
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,300
originally lived

201
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,200
as the caller knows

202
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,040
as a bishop in

203
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,820
was it Constantinople?

204
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,760
Yeah, like one of those

205
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,560
It was in ancient Byzantium.

206
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,220
Yeah, Asia Minor

207
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,560
in general, yeah.

208
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,580
Yes, and he was

209
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
he was known for

210
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,460
sneaking into the rooms

211
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,880
of young women and leaving

212
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,260
gifts.

213
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,420
Light-sized lumps of coal, complete with a fake beard

214
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,580
and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

215
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,520
A saint he was,

216
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,220
the girl said.

217
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,720
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.

218
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,360
You got it, brother.

219
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,280
He snuck into people's houses through the chimney.

220
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,440
You got it, brother.

221
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,740
He knew when they were awake.

222
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,640
You got it, brother.

223
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,260
But like the CIA, he was...

224
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,300
He was protecting them.

225
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,820
St. Nick was a creeping, stinking

226
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,940
spy. He knows when you've been

227
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,760
sleeping. He knows what you've been

228
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,720
eating. Hey, man, my kids still believe

229
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,780
in St. Nicholas.

230
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,280
And who keeps that belief alive in their

231
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,780
fevered, sick little brain?

232
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,000
Madison Avenue, of course.

233
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,880
No, the surveillance community

234
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,520
under your direction.

235
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,480
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

236
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,320
Miller Bear, you know.

237
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,200
If you're bad, he punishes you.

238
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,940
If you're good, he rewards you.

239
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,180
He's probably the closest...

240
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,460
closest thing to Jesus walking the Earth.

241
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,360
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.

242
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,460
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling

243
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,100
when they're awake.

244
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,960
I think, really, if you want to make a deal,

245
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,000
you have to do it with, you know...

246
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,480
Could Dr. Claus, in fact, be

247
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,120
the wandering, quote,

248
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,260
milkman rumored to have

249
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,680
fathered our savior,

250
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,520
J.R. Bob Dobbs?

251
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,220
Well, we find it a very likely possibility

252
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,180
from the falsified documents

253
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,060
we have here.

254
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,240
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob Dobbs.

255
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,340
And the sperm count

256
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,400
with the glowing red nose.

257
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,720
What could this mean?

258
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,020
Listen, if you're going to say

259
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,740
Indiana had flying saucers

260
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,000
out in Minneapolis 15,000 years ago

261
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,160
and my damn God,

262
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,580
it was for sure the beard, the fake beard.

263
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,560
And I want one of them new robots

264
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,900
with the real intestinal bacteria.

265
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,320
Yeah, what about...

266
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,800
And one of those robots

267
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,000
with a fish brain for a brain.

268
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,120
They're sold out.

269
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,720
Their Toys R Us has no more.

270
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,860
They're on the shelves.

271
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,180
Can't get them from Amazon.com.

272
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,860
Can't get them anywhere in time.

273
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,640
Too late for Christmas.

274
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,220
Have yourself

275
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,420
a merry little Christmas.

276
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,540
Have yourself

277
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,500
a merry little S igenness.

278
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,940
Have yourself a merry little s ます

279
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,920
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

280
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:10,780
Have yourself a merry little cinema Seriously,

281
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:10,780


282
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:10,780


283
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:10,780


284
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:10,780


285
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,500
Okay!

286
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:19,800
It all worked.

287
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,520
Christmas

288
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,780
Let your side

289
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,500
be light

290
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,780
From the water

291
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,740
troubles will be

292
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,380
outside

293
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,900
Have yourself

294
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,980
a merry little

295
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,620
song

296
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,060
From the

297
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,380
water

298
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,860
miles away

299
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,240
Once a day

300
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,960
as in olden

301
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,100
say

302
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,540
happy golden

303
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,080
be miles

304
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,620
away

305
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,200
Let your heart

306
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,820
be out of sight

307
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,960
light

308
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,500
miles away

309
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,440
have yourself

310
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,160
a merry little

311
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,080
Christmas

312
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:45,580
night

313
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,560
Oh, my God.

314
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:31,680
Together, if the fates allow, I'm a shining star upon the highest bough.

315
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:44,040
And have yourself a merry little Christmas.

316
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,200
Merry Christmas.

317
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:16,620
Merry Christmas, friends.

318
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,040
Merry Christmas.

319
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,280
Have yourself a merry little Christmas by No-L.

320
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,900
No-L.

321
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,340
Before that, some year-old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas

322
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,080
from the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza.

323
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,160
I'm playing a lot from that.

324
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,180
So check out www.triage.com for that one also.

325
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,780
The Tarkin Records is also on www.

326
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,520
www.triage.com.

327
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,700
And now, the Jeff Rose.

328
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,980
Go.

329
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,840
Go.

330
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,100
Go.

331
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,220
Go.

332
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,560
Go.

333
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,820
Go.

334
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,280


335
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,440
Go.

336
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,660
Go.

337
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:04,660


338
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:04,660


339
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:04,680


340
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,080
Go.

341
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,280


342
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,220
Go.

343
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,540
Go.

344
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,120
Yeah!

345
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,760
That rice is such good food.

346
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:47,760


347
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:47,760


348
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:47,760


349
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:47,760


350
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:47,760


351
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:57,660
The we're bobs and I'm those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob or that they're Santa Bob by night.

352
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,920
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.

353
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:10,320
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

354
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,560
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

355
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,060
Oh, friends, it's tough.

356
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,940
It's tough. And, you know, you just just going to church ain't enough.

357
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,420
You got to send your money to the Santa Bob.

358
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:34,540
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

359
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,500
Can you believe that?

360
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:43,320
They asked the kids were asking if their parents, if maybe Santa Claus will bring us to He-Man erector sets.

361
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,760
And the mom said, no, no, he won't, because he bills.

362
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
We can't afford that.

363
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,940
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

364
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,780
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

365
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,260
Every Christmas Eve, children nestled in their beds dream of Santa and the presents they hope he.

366
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,560
Hey, wait a second.

367
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,920
That's no kid.

368
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,300
All right, everyone, use your sideways.

369
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,540
Say.

370
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,600
All right.

371
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,680
It's not Santa's workshop.

372
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,280
It's Santa Claus.

373
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,160
Don't worry.

374
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,360
I'm almost there.

375
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,660
See, that's where Santa lives.

376
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,040
All right.

377
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,580
Jinx Jinx.

378
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,940
Is that Santa Claus?

379
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,660
What's going on?

380
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,660
Jinx is psyching and projecting his story into our minds.

381
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,440
Holy zombie Jesus.

382
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,480
Is that Santa Claus?

383
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,540
Merry Christmas, Santa Claus.

384
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,760
Merry Christmas.

385
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,360
A season for miracles.

386
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,040
Merry Christmas.

387
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,200
Oh, thanks, Wappers.

388
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,980
Don't forget Santa Claus.

389
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,240
And Jinx, too.

390
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,180
It's snowing.

391
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,800
It's snowing.

392
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
It's snowing.

393
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,300
It's snowing.

394
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,800
Looks like we're going to have a white Christmas.

395
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,020
It's not you.

396
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,540
Advanced Dogmatic Studies, dear friends.

397
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,600
Also known as Electric Elf at loop.com.

398
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,820
How the Jinx Stole Christmas.

399
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,940
From their collection, Have Yourself an Advanced Dogmatic Christmas.

400
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,640
That's Advanced Dogmatic Studies.

401
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,400
Did I say studios?

402
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,820
Studios.

403
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,620
At, um.

404
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,440
Well, you can email information about that whole album,

405
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,120
which is available, the Advanced Dogmatic Christmas Album,

406
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,080
from electricelf at loop.com.

407
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,160
Go to him.

408
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,560
But I have no gift to bring.

409
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,800
Go. Look upon the newborn king.

410
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:20,380
Go. Go. Go. GO!

411
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,300
And they told me a rum pum pum pum

412
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,840
The newborn king said see the rum pum pum

413
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,720
or a Sell the barn ado

414
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,540
Yes we may

415
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:41,700
Hey?

416
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,360
I swear to give a f***

417
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,380
A rock-a-bum-bum

418
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,720
Yeah, I'll play for you

419
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,420
A rock-a-bum-bum

420
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,100
On my drum

421
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:29,340
I swear to give a f***

422
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,020
A rock-a-bum-bum

423
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:41,560
Yeah, I'll play for you

424
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,460
I swear to give a f***

425
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,060
both

426
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,640
lee

427
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,240
I

428
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,320
I

429
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,320


430
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,780
And

431
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,380
And amazing.

432
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,960
More from Corporal Blossom.

433
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,620
I am really impressed by their editing work.

434
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:59,580
And that's on Corporal Blossom and the Mutated Christmas is on the Illegal Art label.

435
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:07,480
That's www.detritus.net slash illegal art.

436
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,020
www.detritus.net slash illegal art.

437
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,320
And now more Jethro's.

438
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,740
Jethro.

439
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
Jethro.

440
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,620
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

441
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:13,460
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?

442
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,380
Oh, my God.

443
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:22,960
whose father, Paul Bunyan, and whose mother, Big Sister, created the conspiracy.

444
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,000
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas.

445
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:34,060
Yes, there was a down-home Norman Rockwell-style, it's-a-wonderful-life type of Christmas.

446
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:43,900
It was a kite-flying, Coca-Cola-drinking Christmas, not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

447
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:55,780
It was a-when your little brother broke through the hole, fell through a hole in the ice sling, and you went and saved him.

448
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,520
You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

449
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,660
It was a wonderful life back then.

450
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,120
When Uncle Bud would come in with the candles, like most people have Christmas candles,

451
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,840
I mean, at birthday camp, why can't I just eat the little wieners all over again?

452
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,340
It was dangerous.

453
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,160
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

454
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,980
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

455
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,880
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

456
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,020
Dare I ask it?

457
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,860
Yes.

458
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:55,180
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God, but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

459
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,560
The answer?

460
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,160
Yes, definitely.

461
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,880
Take that, and shove it up the tube, mark certainty, in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

462
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,280
Friends, try to imagine.

463
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,880
God and save...

464
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:22,760
Somewhere in the snowy north, the Santibob trudging mindlessly through the Himalayan snows,

465
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,200
driven by strange forces to complete his nameless errand,

466
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:35,160
and he may show up at your house, my friend, if you've been a bad subgenius,

467
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:42,740
or a halfway subgenius, or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows and having strange microphones.

468
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,200
Oh, shit, this is a situation.

469
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,720
Down in the workshop, all the elves were making toys

470
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,720
For the good gentile girls and the good gentile boys

471
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,740
When the boss busted in, nearly scared them half to death

472
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,780
Had a rifle in his hands, and cheap whiskey on his breath

473
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,040
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo

474
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,180
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo

475
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,920
And he smiled as he said, with a twinkle in his eye

476
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,960
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!

477
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,280
The night Santa went crazy

478
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,820
The night Saint Nick went insane

479
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,820
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal

480
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,820
Something finally was still snapped in his brain

481
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,940
Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it

482
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,860
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet

483
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,800
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage

484
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,640
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage

485
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,840
He got desert Francer with an old German Luger

486
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,880
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger

487
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,600
And he picked up a flamethrower, and he barbecued Linssen

488
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,560
And he took a big bite, and said it tastes just like chicken

489
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,880
The night Santa went crazy

490
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,560
The night Kris Kringle went nuts

491
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,800
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole

492
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,240
Without stepping in reindeer guts

493
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,660
There's a National Guard and the FBI

494
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,980
There's a van from the Eyewitness News

495
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,780
And helicopters circling round in the sky

496
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,920
And the bullets are flying, the bodyguards rising

497
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,400
And everyone's dying to know who's Santa why

498
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,520
My, my, my, my, my, my

499
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,500
You used to be such a jolly guy

500
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:19,700
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time

501
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,620
In a federal prison for his infamous crime

502
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,680
Hey little friend now, don't you cry no more tears

503
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,820
He'll be out with good behavior in 700 more years

504
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,920
But now make sense in therapy!

505
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,840
And Donna's still nervous

506
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,800
And the elf all got jobs working for the local service

507
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,620
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night

508
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,520
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights they're talking about

509
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,920
The night Santa went crazy

510
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,620
The night Saint Nicholas slipped

511
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,820
Broke his back for some milk and cookies

512
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,380
Sounds to me like he was tired of getting shit, whoa-oh-oh

513
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,640
The night Santa went crazy

514
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,160
The night Saint Nick went insane

515
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,700
Realized he's been getting the wrong deal

516
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,880
Something finally must have snapped in his brain, whoa-oh-oh

517
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,540
Something finally must have snapped in his brain, tell ya

518
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,180
Something finally must have snapped

519
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,860
In his brain

520
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,640
In his brain

521
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:38,640


522
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,540
In his brain

523
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,920
You better watch out

524
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,140
You better not cry

525
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,540
You better not pout

526
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,920
I'm telling you why

527
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,880
Santa Claus is coming to town

528
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,200
He's making a list

529
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,300
He's checking it twice

530
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,680
He's going to find out who's naughty or nice

531
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,520
Santa Claus is coming to town

532
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,540
He knows when you're sleeping

533
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,740
He knows when you're awake

534
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,660
He knows when you've been found or good

535
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,840
So be good for goodness sake

536
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,660
You better watch out

537
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,980
You better not cry

538
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,420
You better not pout

539
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,540
I'm telling you why

540
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,960
Santa Claus is coming to town

541
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,460
Santa Claus is coming to town

542
00:38:50,380 --> 00:39:01,680
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas song thing called Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie and F. J. Jones.

543
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
And you can find it on the YouTube channel of the

544
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
Electric Elf at loop.com

545
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,860
Can tell you more about that

546
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,520
But now the greatest scary Christmas song ever friends from his new album

547
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,960
Don't Trust Whitey

548
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,360
James Kochalka Superstar

549
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,000
James Kochalka Superstar

550
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,180
James Kochalka Superstar

551
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,680
Jingle, jangle, jingle

552
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,260
We're on a sleigh ride to heck

553
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,120
Santa and his reindeer

554
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,500
Are really wicked

555
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,880
Wrapped in wrapping paper

556
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,220
We're gonna break our necks

557
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,220
Got a rocket in my pocket

00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,080
they go who's Bob

697
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,840
I said well

698
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,920
give me your address

699
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,900
I'll send you some information

700
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,780
or whatever you know

701
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,320
I'll give the number

702
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,200
at the end of the broadcast

703
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,560

704
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,380
and this person

705
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,080
you know I knew

706
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:46,560
there was something

707
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,620
that they weren't saying

708
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,280
and finally

709
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:48,980
he goes

710
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,120
well

711
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,000
I just hope that

712
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,880
it was something like

713
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,820
I just hope that

714
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:54,920
you know

715
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,180
you can get right with Jesus

716
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,340
or something like that

717
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,000
and just hung up

718
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,720
he hung up

719
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,960
that was the key point

720
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,420
he said he didn't want to hear

721
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,800
what I had to say back

722
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,920
about that

723
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,300
because

724
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:05,900
you know see

725
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,000
a subgenius has so much faith

726
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,140
that he not only can accept

727
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,120
somebody making fun of Bob

728
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,740
stomping on a picture of Bob

729
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,780
he'll do it himself

730
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,900
he has so much trust

731
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,200
and faith in Bob

732
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,400
Bob is such a good friend

733
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,900
that he can insult Bob

734
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,380
now we subgeni

735
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,760
I hate to get on my soap

736
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:24,900
but I hate to get on my soap

737
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,320
Bob's in the middle

738
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,560
of a bunch of entertaining tapes

739
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,700
but we subgeni

740
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,960
may be bad

741
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,340
but our way of bad

742
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,320
is holy

743
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,120
is holy

744
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,280
compared to the evil

745
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,640
of so

746
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,400
not all

747
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,520
by any means

748
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,120
but so many

749
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,920
American fundamentalists

750
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:39,960

etc.

753
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:41,740
in general

754
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,440
of course

755
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,780
they and their corresponding types

756
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,080
in Iran

757
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,720
Russia

758
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,340
Libya

759
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,520
South Africa

760
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:48,980
etc.

761
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,600
if you ask me

762
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,920
are actually the ace

763
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,480
up the devil's sleeve

764
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,900
wolves and animals

765
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,860
and sheep's clothing friends

766
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,520
just like Jesus warned about

767
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:58,880
we're

768
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,280
Jesus and Bob

769
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,060
like we say

770
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,180
our old drinking buddies

771
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,480
got nothing against Jesus

772
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,400
it's just his fan club

773
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,540
and now

774
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,660
we aren't saying that Bob

775
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,680
is the ace up God's sleeve

776
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,900
he's more like the smear

777
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,220
on God's handkerchief

778
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,140
just like you or me

779
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,480
but the uptight rival cults

780
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,160
they don't think God

781
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,180
has a handkerchief

782
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,780
uh uh no

783
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,320
cause God's perfect

784
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,060
he doesn't even sneeze

785
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,180
we're made in his image

786
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,740
except that

787
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,280
we have all these nasty parts

788
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,060
attached to us

789
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,860
and we have to go in the

790
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,300
the secret room

791
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,740
the bathroom

792
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,700
to do awful things

793
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,500
but God

794
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,900
oh he's clean and pure

795
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,220
according to them

796
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,060
oh and he's male

797
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,180
but he doesn't excrete juices

798
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:40,900
and sweat

799
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,700
and smelly stuff

800
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,740
out of him like we do

801
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,540
cause we sin

802
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,200
oh yeah

803
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:44,920
we all sin

804
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,840
we're bad

805
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,740
we're worthless

806
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,520
we're no good to God

807
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,940
unless we sign a contract

808
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,620
with his agent

809
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:52,900
well friend

810
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,200
Jesus himself

811
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:54,700
Jesus himself

812
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,280
outed just about

813
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,440
as many great punchlines

814
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,000
as Bob

815
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,700
probably more

816
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,980
but and this is true

817
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,320
this is historical fact

818
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,740
the very early

819
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,800
mainstream Christian church

820
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,400
methodically censored

821
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,080
about half

822
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,280
of the existing gospels

823
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:08,820
about Jesus

824
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,500
and this is

825
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,580
I'm not kidding

826
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,460
you can go to

827
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,120
any real bookstore

828
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,200
and pick up

829
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,820
the censored gospels

830
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,440
that they finally

831
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,060
found years later

832
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,540
they took out the parts

833
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,680
where Jesus specifically said

834
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,440
that every person

835
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,520
had equal access

836
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,520
to the Lord

837
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,520
and that you didn't need

838
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,140
no preacher

839
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,080
between you and him

840
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,840
that in fact

841
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,500
was probably his main point

842
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,080
now lost in antiquity

843
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,000
that you

844
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,580
were the son

845
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,180
or daughter

846
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:35,760
of God

847
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,400
just as much as Jesus was

848
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,460
or Bob

849
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:38,860
see

850
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,760
but that's too humanistic

851
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,220
for the conspiracy Christians

852
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:42,660
so they

853
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,760
they wiped out

854
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,120
the subgenius

855
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,160
Gnostic Christians

856
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:47,940
anyway

857
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,700
I'm gonna get off

858
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,360
my soapbox

859
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,120
we'll get into the

860
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,380
hideous theological discussions

861
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,940
coming up next week

862
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,500
as we attack

863
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,280
the bobbies

864
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,840
we interrupt this program

865
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,960
for a special promotional announcement

866
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,600
we turn

867
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,760
hey Bob

868
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,100
and the bastards of the universe

869
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,600
will be back after this message

870
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,140
thank you

871
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,020
a new young people

872
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,080
listen to me today

873
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,080
quit playing games

874
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,640
with Christmas trees

875
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,560
Silent night

876
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,480
Holy night

877
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,740
All is calm

878
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,780
All is bright

879
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,080
Round yon virgin

880
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,980
Kinder and mild

881
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,940
Holy night

882
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,440
Mother

883
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,640
Mother

884
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,180
and child

885
00:55:54,700 --> 00:56:24,700


886
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:54,700


887
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:08,800
Although they fixing out

888
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,780
on reception

889
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,380
Youay

890
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,060
Wong

891
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,060


892
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,060


893
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,060


894
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,240
Niners

895
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,120
or at least

896
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,220
a little bit today

897
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,920
I don't have any Christmas trees.

898
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:42,320
I don't have any Christmas trees.

899
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,980
I don't have any Christmas trees.

900
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,540
Quit playing games with Christmas trees.

901
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,640
I don't have any Christmas trees.

902
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:20,180
I don't have any Christmas trees.

903
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:43,900
I don't have any Christmas trees.

904
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,820
Christmas trees.

905
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,480
Christmas trees.

906
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,000
Christmas trees.

907
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,640
Christmas trees.
