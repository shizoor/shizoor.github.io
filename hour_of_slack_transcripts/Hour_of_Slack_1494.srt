1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,700
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to present Batman.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,520
Batman.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,340
Batman.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:06,860
Batman.

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,440
Batman.

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,120
Batman.

7
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,460
Batman.

8
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,300
Batman.

9
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:09,520


10
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,080
Oh, by the way, it may sound strange, but...

11
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,460
What?

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,000
Ah, okay.

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,800
Gosh, what does it mean?

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,620
The self-genius power of...

15
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,320
S.T.A.R.F.

16
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,260
I am S.T.A.R.F.

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,520
Oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

18
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:32,960
What is it?

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,280
What is it?

20
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,440
It's a laugh riot.

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,400
That grinning devil.

22
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,540
Tonight, once more, we can all sleep peacefully in our beds,

23
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,440
secure in the knowledge that there is a Batman,

24
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,240
and just eight years old.

25
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,940
The Steaming Sack of Black Part One

26
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,140
In the beginning,

27
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,480
there was only

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:05,440
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob.

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,480
Aaaaaah.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,100
For more information, visit subgenius.com.

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,060
Look at it this way. At least you didn't lose money on this accident.

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,180
Well, not as much as some.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,420
Well, because it's a continuing guarantee.

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,380
Right.

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,080
It doesn't expire until I expire.

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,480
We don't know what year this is. The next day could be tomorrow.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,160
Well, the eternal salvation or triple your money back doesn't expire until I expire.

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,220
Right. Oh, no, no, no. Until, if you don't get eternal salvation.

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,360
Eternally.

40
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,680
Right. It doesn't expire until you can prove that the eternal salvation.

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,320
Oh, no, it didn't keep you alive.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, my God.

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,120
You can die. It's just the eternal part of the salvation.

44
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,000
You have to prove you didn't get it for eternity.

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,020
Okay, so I could have got like a decent chunk of salvation, but not eternal.

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,240
Now it's like 105 bucks. Triple your money back is 105 now.

47
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,800
True enough.

48
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,940
Okay, so what's the going rate on one year of salvation?

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,200
Oh, it doesn't work. We don't break it down. It's eternal or nothing, man.

50
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,960
If it's 105 bucks.

51
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,780
It's all or nothing.

52
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,460
It's like, what's the going rate?

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,840
What's one year of salvation's worth? I mean, and so my 35 versus the one year of the market rate of salvation.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,540
Oh, I'm going to have to leave that math to you, man.

55
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
That's kind of a personal decision.

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,300
It is. That is something.

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,360
What's it worth to you?

58
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,800
Well, I mean, it depends.

59
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,240
We should work on that. Yeah, we should work on that. We'll come up with an answer by next year.

60
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,480
Like a chart of the market price of salvation.

61
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,540
Bring the chart next next day. Next day.

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,740
You know, I'm on it. I'm on it.

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,660
Yeah. I'm on the way to bed.

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,560
Yeah.

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,660
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean.

66
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,720
Here you go.

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,820
You're normally such a slacker.

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,760
It's the first time you've heard of him.

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,540
Are all four of you guys in here?

70
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,180
Is Phil in there?

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,100
He just, yeah, yeah.

72
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,520
Can we?

73
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,740
Doing with four?

74
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,400
Yeah, all four.

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,920
Okay.

76
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,500
What are we doing?

77
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:03,900
How do we?

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,040
This is, this is.

79
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,660
Oh, the others.

80
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,280
They'll do the comedy.

81
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,940
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Fireside Theater.

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:10,760
Okay.

83
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,760
This is Phil.

84
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,340
Phil.

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,840
Let's take it again.

86
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,220
Oh, Pete and Dave.

87
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,920
Okay, there we go, yeah.

88
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,080
All right, you over here?

89
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,100
You just shut up.

90
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,420
This is Phil.

91
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:20,720
Phil.

92
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,180
Pete.

93
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,500
And Dave of the Fireside Theater.

94
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,640
And we're listening to The Hour of Slack.

95
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,740
Because we're subgeniuses.

96
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,040
And we're slacking off.

97
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,940
From PR News in Washington, I'm charged with unlawful entry of animals inside the White House last night.

98
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,700
Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar says Canada remains closed to the public today after yesterday's incident in the Canadian country today.

99
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,680
Inside there.

100
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,300
Bob says that did not turn out to be the case.

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,420
There weren't more.

102
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:52,660
More.

103
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,660
Act it alone.

104
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:01,000
On Wall Street 321716, profits are soaring sky high for Ebola Airlines.

105
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,940
According to the Labor Department, you're listening to PR News in Washington.

106
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,720
Smoke gun.

107
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,900
All right, come on up out of there.

108
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,220
I'll shoot.

109
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,920
No.

110
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,300
You alone?

111
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,660
Yes.

112
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
You live around here?

113
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,900
No.

114
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,200
You've got 15 minutes to get out of Dodge.

115
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,340
No, please.

116
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,460
I just woke up.

117
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,620
All right, let's go.

118
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,260
Water.

119
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,280
Need water.

120
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,960
Why does Indian come to white man for water?

121
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,460
Young brave.

122
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,800
Hurt bad.

123
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,640
Water far.

124
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,760
Need water fast.

125
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,260
Get 15 minutes to get out of Dodge.

126
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,180
We go now.

127
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,440
Go in peace.

128
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,160
Say, you know.

129
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,280
Now, now, now here is kind of an interesting thing here.

130
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,340
Since, uh, it's, uh.

131
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,720
Get 15 minutes to get out of Dodge.

132
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,660
Well, uh.

133
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,300
Now move out.

134
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,840
You can ride out of here free or you can ride out rope to your saddle.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,160
Take your choice.

136
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,820
Get exhausted doing this.

137
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,920
Oh, yeah.

138
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:46,700
Yeah, you're doing it.

139
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:46,700


140
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,320
And then patriotic.

141
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,580
Eat for a little

142
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:49,580


143
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:49,580


144
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:49,580


145
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,360
Yeah.

146
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,520
We didn't start it, but we by His grace are going to end it.

147
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,400
Hallelujah, let's do it. Oh we love you Jesus.

148
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:00,740


149
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,040
Oh,

150
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:12,500
Let the Holy Spirit fall. He's here. Feel His power.

151
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,580
Kids, you've got to change things.

152
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,560
We've got too many Christian grown ups that are fat and lazy.

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,440
Do you know Muslims train their children from the time they're five years old?

154
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,420
We want to reclaim America for Christ.

155
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,760
How many of you know that this is a pretty sick old world?

156
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,460
This is a sick old world.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
I'm here to be trained.

158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,280
I'm here for an education.

159
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm willing to be trained.

160
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,560


161
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:45,860
I'm willing God.

162
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,380
I'll do what you want me to do.

163
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,400
I'll say what you want me to say.

164
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,560
In Jesus name.

165
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,680
Amen.

166
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,840
Dear friends, this is Dr. Gordon.

167
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:12,760
And if I can have a few minutes of your time, I'd like to think about some things aloud with you, so to speak.

168
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,560
Now, I'm just a dying old man.

169
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,160
Older than most of you.

170
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,240
And you are dying younger people.

171
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,900
Men and women, probably.

172
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:34,360
But what I want to talk to you about is this whole idea that you've got to be afraid when you die.

173
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,160
Because if you haven't done right, then you're going to go to a bad place.

174
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,120
Yeah, you've heard that all your life.

175
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,020
And I'm not just preaching to the choir.

176
00:08:45,260 --> 00:09:06,340
I know a lot of you people out there really think that Bob is a much more sensible alternative to a lot of this crap that's going around in the name of something up there that just has to tell you what to do, how to think, how to procreate, who you should kill, who you should not kill, who you should subjugate.

177
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,740
And you know, it's just been going on for so long.

178
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,960
Because it all started off when, you know, we crawled out of the mud.

179
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:28,500
And sort of stood up on two legs and were basically, unfortunately, due to the development of something called the frontal lobes, became separated from the landscape.

180
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,380
And then all of a sudden, stuff that had been natural just went on.

181
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,380
You didn't worry about it.

182
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,880
Boom!

183
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,120
It was scary.

184
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,580
Yeah, friends.

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,420
Bad stuff going on.

186
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,060
Earthquakes, thunderstorms, landslides.

187
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,720
All of that.

188
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,160
All those things.

189
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,100
Giant animals that you never saw before that came out and ate your whole family.

190
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,320
Well, stuff happens, right?

191
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:56,660
I could say another word, but in an attempt to not have this exorcised, I will say stuff happens.

192
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,460
And everybody just sort of feared it and cowed.

193
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,880
And every time stuff started happening, everybody crawled into the back end of the cave.

194
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,740
And, ah, what did we do?

195
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,180
And then somebody with a little bit more.

196
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,340
I don't know what to say.

197
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Exploitive nature or just a smart guy or a sub-smart guy said, hey, you know what?

198
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,380
I know why stuff happens.

199
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,800
Everybody said, what?

200
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,580
I know why stuff happens.

201
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,780
What do you mean you know why stuff happens?

202
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,220
I can tell you why stuff happens.

203
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,480
Up there in the sky is a great, mighty man.

204
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,060
And his name is Nobodad.

205
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,840
And he makes stuff happen.

206
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,460
And, you know, I know this is true because he has spoken to me.

207
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,520
And so I must tell you that I speak for Nobodad.

208
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,640
And Nobodad will tell you what is right and what is wrong.

209
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,780
And, well, okay, you know, you get the picture.

210
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,100
It starts off in the jungle or at the edge of the caves or on an alluvial plain.

211
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,460
It doesn't matter.

212
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,660
Next thing you know, there's a special branch of people who interpret.

213
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:21,380
Why stuff happens to people who really can't even begin to think about that because they're too busy suffering under the stuff that happens.

214
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,060
Yeah.

215
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,420
And we call it religion to tie back.

216
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:28,860
Religere.

217
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,560
To tie back.

218
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,620
To take us back to the old concepts.

219
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,640
That there is an omnipotent being who watches over us.

220
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,720
Or maybe it's beings.

221
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,960
Maybe it's three or four.

222
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,020
Maybe it's twelve.

223
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,100
But there's a bunch of them, man.

224
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,440
And you better watch out.

225
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,080
You better be good.

226
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,120
You better not turn this way.

227
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,960
You better wipe your butt that way.

228
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,400
You better not eat this.

229
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,920
You are not allowed to marry within 1 25th of your bloodline.

230
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:08,080
And, excuse me, you better shave your head, clip your hair, and have your women genetically, pardon me, genitally mutilated.

231
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,460
Yeah.

232
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,040
That's what we call religion.

233
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,080
Yeah.

234
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,000
I got a book.

235
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,800
Well, so do I.

236
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,340
Yeah, but my book's better than your book.

237
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,080
What do you mean?

238
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,560
I've got...

239
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,000
This is written by God.

240
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,260
I was the first one that used a doctor pitch.

241
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,680
And since then, it's evolved into television.

242
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:36,680
But now, they can't say that the man who is making the pitch on television that's doing the voice for the advertisement is a doctor.

243
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,740
You're not allowed to say he is a doctor.

244
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,440
Unless he really is an MD and has a license or a surgeon.

245
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,260
But in the olden days, we didn't care anything about the laws.

246
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
We just went ahead and we were doctors.

247
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,780
If you had the appearance and the ability to talk, you became a doctor.

248
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,960
In fact, my father was an eye doctor when I was born.

249
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,440
It was a business he knew nothing about.

250
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,240
But he went into the, what we call, a glimmer.

251
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,020
And he got a box when I was a young fella.

252
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,460
Set it out in front of a saloon in Montgomery, Alabama.

253
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,800
Covered it with black muslin.

254
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,380
Had four or five pairs of frames out there with different glasses.

255
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,640
You can buy the same thing in the five and ten cent store today.

256
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,660
But he used to stop customers along the street as they were on their way to the depot, as they said.

257
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,160
The depot to catch a train.

258
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,140
And he'd say, just a minute.

259
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,340
I think you need glasses.

260
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,540
Would you try these on?

261
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,060
At one time, my father sold a pair of frames to a fella.

262
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,120
He told me about this.

263
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,640
He couldn't quite get this fella to admit that he could see good through the glasses.

264
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,820
So my father took a pair of frames that had no glass in them.

265
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,960
Took out his handkerchief.

266
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,320
Wiped them off very good.

267
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,900
Put it on.

268
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,720
Said, how do you see?

269
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,860
The fella says, they are wonderful.

270
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,760
That's the best pair I've had on yet.

271
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,980
He said, now don't take these off.

272
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,000
Let your eyes get adjusted to them.

273
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,060
You wear these.

274
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,420
This pair is three dollars.

275
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,640
And the guy bought them.

276
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,660
There were no glasses in it.

277
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,380
He had a pair of empty frames.

278
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,600
And that is the truth.

279
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,320
I swear by that.

280
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,260
And you see, it's just salesmanship in anything.

281
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,580
It's just salesmanship.

282
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,020
It's just salesmanship.

283
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,360
The Steaming Sack of Slack Part 2.

284
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,240
Bob the UFO Guy.

285
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,300
fish

286
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,040
Bob the UFO Guy

288
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,360
Thank you.

289
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,320
Thank you.

290
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,000
Thank you.

291
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,940
Thank you.

292
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,080
Thank you.

293
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,020
Thank you.

294
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,360
Thank you.

295
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,400


296
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,400
Thank you.

297
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,400


298
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,380
Thank you.

299
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,280
Thank you.

300
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,420
Thank you.

301
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,100
Hello friends and welcome.

302
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,480
Hello friends and welcome.

303
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,180
Tonight's sermon is entitled

304
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,300
Free Thought.

305
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:29,600
Free Thought.

306
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,720
You get what you pay for.

307
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Now the church of the subgenius

308
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,200
has always encouraged

309
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,620
free thought, friends.

310
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Don't get me wrong.

311
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,360
We've always been behind free thought.

312
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,560
You know that. I know that. Everyone knows that.

313
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,540
It's only when you want to know

314
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,860
what you think

315
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,840
that we charge a donation.

316
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,280
And that's also why

317
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,660
the church says anything worth knowing

318
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,340
is worth paying for.

319
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,940
Now you have all these

320
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,380
so-called normals.

321
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,040
These average Joe blokes.

322
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,160
The mediocre majority.

323
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,820
The folks who have to go to school

324
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,540
to learn how to learn.

325
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,800
Oh yes.

326
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,680
They think they know how to think.

327
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,860
Because why?

328
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,440
Because they got a piece of paper.

329
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,540
A piece of paper, friends.

330
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,620
That says they know how to think.

331
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,040
A diploma, friends.

332
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,240
Created, maintained, signed, sealed,

333
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,520
and delivered by who?

334
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,920
The conspiracy.

335
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,940
Oh sure.

336
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,060
They pay good money for that piece of paper too.

337
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,560
Let me tell you.

338
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,100
You pay a whole lot of money for it.

339
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,520
More than we would ever dream of stealing from you.

340
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,580
Investing for you.

341
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,840
But does the conspiracy

342
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,540
teach you

343
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,320
what you think, friends?

344
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,580
Hell no.

345
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,380
The conspiracy teaches you

346
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,740
what they think.

347
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,380
Why they're so scared

348
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,360
that someone out there might in fact

349
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,820
trip upon the truth

350
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,920
and think a real independent thing.

351
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,840
They thought for themselves.

352
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,100
A thought funk without the guidance

353
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,120
of the conspiracy.

354
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,000
A non-conspiracy concept

355
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,120
that they force you

356
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,060
and everyone else

357
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,740
to go to their conspiracy training schools

358
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,060
for the most formative

359
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,840
and most imaginative

360
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,600
of their years.

361
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,080
And they won't let you out, friends.

362
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,260
Not until you conform

363
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,780
to their normality.

364
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,560
Or one of their carefully selected

365
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,440
alternative normalities.

366
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,220
Oh yes, you know what I'm talking about.

367
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,560
I'm talking about those hippies,

368
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,080
those punks, those skinheads

369
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,900
who wouldn't be called dead

370
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,060
thinking anything

371
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,160
but the hippest, punkish,

372
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,520
skinnest thoughts.

373
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,100
Oh sure, friends.

374
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,400
They think they're thinking.

375
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,360
They think they're rebelling.

376
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,960
But they've only joined another branch

377
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,600
of the conspiracy corps.

378
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,000
Oh, they're out of the army, alright.

379
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,920
And they're into one of the other armies.

380
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,620
The conspiracy octopus.

381
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,380
Oh, but I disobey

382
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,100
all the laws and everything

383
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,600
that they tell me to do.

384
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,740
Friends.

385
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,960
That's just reverse psychology

386
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,380
they're using on you.

387
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,260
The conspiracy is a master of reverse psychology.

388
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,780
They want you to disobey them.

389
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,780
Just say no means just say yes.

390
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,600
Why do you think they call it dope?

391
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,840
They want you to pacify

392
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,360
your brain with drugs.

393
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,920
They want you to transmit AIDS

394
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,520
via every natural orifice.

395
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,780
And every unnatural one too, friends.

396
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,400
It gives them something to waste your time with

397
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,520
to avoid getting slapped.

398
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,560
While simultaneously providing junk food

399
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,120
for thought

400
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,140
to fuel their media hype.

401
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,000
Something for them to market

402
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,560
and then take from the market

403
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,780
and then black market

404
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,680
and then ban and then regulate

405
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,340
and all the while you think

406
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,140
it's just happenstance.

407
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,660
Supply and demand.

408
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,080
Who are you fooling?

409
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,920
They do the supply and demand

410
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,420
and they do the demand too.

411
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,080
And you think you're so clever

412
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,780
because you cheated

413
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,860
on last year's income tax.

414
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,480
Oh friends.

415
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,180
So much for your free thought.

416
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,420
It was worth precisely

417
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,080
what you paid.

418
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,000
Nothing. Nothing at all.

419
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,800
And I bet you still don't know

420
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,540
what the hell I'm talking about.

421
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,720
Oh no. I pity you.

422
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,600
Wherever you may be.

423
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,800
Oh how I pity you.

424
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,680
And Bob pities you.

425
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,980
Even more friends.

426
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,540
But let us not here

427
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,040
in the church of the subgenius

428
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,940
get too smug, too self-righteous

429
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,120
too high and mighty

430
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,440
because friends we all know

431
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,040
there's plenty of what?

432
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,000
Pseudo subgenies out there

433
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,020
who just pretend

434
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,460
to think for themselves.

435
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,760
Why do they come to the church friends?

436
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,780
Because they think it's cool.

437
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,280
They can't understand what we're talking about friends.

438
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,960
It sounds like a big joke to them.

439
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,880
A riddle. Something to laugh about.

440
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,500
Well ha ha ha.

441
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,800
That's just fine and dandy.

442
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,080
We'll take your money friends.

443
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,980
But we ain't touching your soul.

444
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,660
Hell no.

445
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,660
And then again it's not like you give a lot of money anyway.

446
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,860
You're afraid to know what you think.

447
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,540
You're scared.

448
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,680
You're frightened there may not be anything.

449
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,320
Well friends there's only one way to find out.

450
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,020
And that's to put your money where your mind is.

451
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,880
And if you don't get a quick

452
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,020
prompt response in six to eight weeks

453
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,940
well friends you can just assume

454
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,780
the worst. Tell them that address.

455
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,860
And praise Bob. Amen.

456
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,420
From PR News in Washington

457
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,560
I'm not sick and therefore not contagious.

458
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,120
Meanwhile the World Health Organization

459
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,900
says I'm sick and therefore

460
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,360
contagious. Meanwhile

461
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,700
the Secretary of Defense is seeking

462
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,960
to force a nurse to order PR's reports

463
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,900
for all US troops returning from

464
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,700
Ebola frickep. Meanwhile

465
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,000
Fiat Chrysler is recalling

466
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,920
two trucks for half a million problems.

467
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,700
Meanwhile PR News

468
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,220
continues to accelerate.

469
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,160
This trend won't be sustained.

470
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,600
Meanwhile Dow

471
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,560
Dow is 1660

472
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,920
A new UNICEF report

473
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,820
shows a spike in Italy

474
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,240
across southern Europe.

475
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,260
The PR News program

476
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,900
is not likely to have much of an effect.

477
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,060
Meanwhile,

478
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,580
this is PR News in Washington.

479
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,920
PR News is having little

480
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,880
effect so ending it shouldn't

481
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,660
hurt the economy.

482
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,300
First we must get out.

483
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,300
We must get off, we must get off this place.

484
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,320
We must leave, we must get off, we must get off.

485
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,940
Now who gonna talk for you on Earth?

486
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,000
Who gonna say the words?

487
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:58,100
Who gonna pronounce the final epithet that's gonna take you off of this world?

488
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,640
Who gonna speak for you on Earth?

489
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,860
Who gonna talk for Earth?

490
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,160
We know who speaks for the nation.

491
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,900
But who speaks for the planet?

492
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,360
Who speaks for Earth?

493
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,720
Coal ganons of steel,

494
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,700
hombres without hearts,

495
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,720
human beings without minds,

496
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,180
a world of pain, no luxury,

497
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,420
no comfort, no delight,

498
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,360
suffering at every corner.

499
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,180
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself.

500
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,280
Earth, Earth, Earth.

501
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,240
Earth, Earth, Earth.

502
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,560
Earth, Earth, Earth.

503
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,120
We must get off, we must get off, we must get off this place.

504
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,340
Earth, Earth, Earth.

505
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,920
Earth, Earth, Earth.

506
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,460
Earth, Earth, Earth.

507
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,940
We shall all know, there is no future.

508
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,960
We have destroyed the land we live in.

509
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,260
We have taken the Earth, and we'll save the Earth.

510
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,620
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

511
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,860
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

512
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,780
And this is the slim, charred face of evolution.

513
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,120
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

514
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,820
This is the slow, pebbling, slumbering, lumbering face of evolution.

515
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,840
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

516
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,140
Ah, yes dear friends.

517
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,220
Ah, yes dear friends.

518
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,180
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,494.

519
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:10,020
By the way, we're going to have some internet-only shows coming up.

520
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:17,560
For those who only listen on broadcast radio, you won't be able to hear these special ones except on the internet.

521
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,940
Because they're just too naughty.

522
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,980
That'll be number 1,493.5 and 1,494.5.

523
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,080
Friends, the...

524
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,840
The music in the background is from the Psychoskeletons.

525
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,580
This tune called Some Dumb Thing.

526
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,240
If you Google the Psychoskeletons, you'll find albums on SoundClick.

527
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,980
And the background music for the next few minutes will also be by the Psychoskeletons.

528
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
And The Large sent us some music.

529
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,520
Again, recently. A whole lot of it.

530
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,740
We'll be hearing some of that. And we did hear some.

531
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,700
The guy that was singing about Bob.

532
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,740
And kind of a high voice.

533
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,380
That was The Large, believe it or not.

534
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,540
Actually singing.

535
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,620
For those who have an affinity for Finnish.

536
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,860
Yes. Yes, actually I have a description from The Large.

537
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Feel the groove. The spirit of Bob.

538
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,340
Or even, quote Bob, unquote, is strong in me.

539
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,020
It's moving on the face of the waters as well as in every corridor, passage, hallway and alley.

540
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,640
And it will eventually get everybody.

541
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,660
Everybody. That's insane.

542
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,600
Dolphins, rainbows.

543
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,760
And napalm.

544
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,980
Damn dirty hippies.

545
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,380
My mind is flowing.

546
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,580
P.S.

547
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,740
It's not me who is writing this.

548
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,020
P.P.S.

549
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,460
War is coming, man.

550
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,220
P.P.P.S.

551
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,280
I am better.

552
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,340
Better than better.

553
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,240
Better than best.

554
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,520
Do you want to bet?

555
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,280
Thank you, The Large.

556
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,060
Praise The Large.

557
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,100
Actually, there's more of that.

558
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,300
He did quite a bit of ranting.

559
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,940
But I got to do the rest of these credits.

560
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,680
The song we just heard.

561
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,560
Or whatever you want to call it.

562
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,180
Earth First.

563
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,560
That was Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

564
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,020
Recording live on the air right here in this station's studio.

565
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,120
WCSB.

566
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,220
Professor Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

567
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,860
And here's some more psycho skeletons in the background.

568
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,040
The rant on free thought was, of course, Father Joe Mama.

569
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,140
Also known as Papa Joe Mama.

570
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,480
Oh, and we're playing a new little segment.

571
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,680
A one-minute segment that Reverend Dew Eight is sending us.

572
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,520
Kind of collage crazy stuff.

573
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,860
The steaming sack of slack.

574
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,260
We played the first two of those tonight.

575
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,200
That's Reverend Dew Eight.

576
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,780
Oh, Nate Eagle is the name of the carny barker.

577
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,220
Talking about fake glasses.

578
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,120
And doctors.

579
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,560
And G. Gordon Gordon was on there very carefully saying,

580
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,960
Stuff happens.

581
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,400
The Jesus Camp mixdown from the movie Jesus Camp

582
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,200
was done by Reverend Cuttlefish.

583
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,520
Leemur, Fernand and Andy Leemur,

584
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,020
did the smoking gun and the PR news.

585
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,380
And our titles.

586
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,340
And I think that mostly covers it there.

587
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,260
Oh, let's go back to what The Large said.

588
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,340
The Large said in another email that had his music attached to it.

589
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,240
He said, Bob is speaking to me.

590
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,700
It might be the Bob.

591
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,600
Not sure.

592
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,800
We'll tell you.

593
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,140
When I do know.

594
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,240
Actually, it says, will you tell you when I do know.

595
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,340
But I think he meant, we'll tell you when I do know.

596
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,280
Not sure if it ever happens in this life.

597
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm glad I can change between the worlds of dimensions

598
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,240
and avoid the waves of probabilities ever collapsing.

599
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,580
It's quite easy when you get the hang of it.

600
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,500
People might think it's difficult, but it really isn't.

601
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,140
It's easy to grasp.

602
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,280
Just like it's very easy to understand how the whole world we live,

603
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,900
and what we live in, is a pyramid scheme.

604
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,760
Haha.

605
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,080
Praise Bob.

606
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,860
Bob equals the path.

607
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,760
I am the paver of the path.

608
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,660
The right path.

609
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,800
If you are the right person, you will walk the right path also.

610
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,780
You cannot even take the wrong path.

611
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,200
Right equals wrong.

612
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,480
Or Job 11.1 says, but now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has,

613
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,280
and he will surely curse you to your face.

614
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,420
I don't know what the hell that means, but so doesn't anybody else either.

615
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,900
There is no hell.

616
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,120
There is no hell.

617
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,840
And there, there is no hell.

618
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,740
Praise Dave.

619
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,000
I think that's Dave.

620
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,840
That was the large writing, and now it's Dave.

621
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,000
So what is frightening?

622
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,340
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

623
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,420
You said something was frightening.

624
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,800
I did?

625
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,820
Well, if I said that, then you better pick up on it, man.

626
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,980
I missed it.

627
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,020
Well, I'm scared already, but I just wondered why I should be scared.

628
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,680
Well, the large said, one plus two equals zero.

629
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:22,680


630
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:22,680


631
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:22,880
Well, the large said, one plus two equals zero.

632
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:22,880


633
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:22,880


634
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:22,880


635
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:22,880


636
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:22,880


637
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,780
And three plus two equals three.

638
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,640
And three plus two equals one.

639
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,140
Therefore, one equals five, and one equals three.

640
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,880
Therefore, Bob Dobbs.

641
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,960
End of transmission.

642
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,840
Oh, and then he said, say hi to Princess Wee.

643
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,980
That's tricky math.

644
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,460
Oh, hi, the large.

645
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,380
So there you go.

646
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,840
There we go.

647
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,620
And here we come.

648
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,960
Did you tell him to heist to Napa?

649
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,860
Another finished swear word with Nappa?

650
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


651
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


652
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


653
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


654
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


655
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


656
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


657
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


658
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


659
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


660
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


661
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


662
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:52,880


663
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,660
You said, smell my belly button.

664
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,220
Actually, I haven't.

665
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,640
Does it really?

666
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,040
It's true.

667
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,240
Smell my belly button.

668
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,180
Smell my, that was in, you know, hey, smell my belly button.

669
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,140
Say that again in Finnish.

670
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,600
That's like the cow's macky sense of humor or something.

671
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,080
How do you say it in Finnish?

672
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,120
Pardon?

673
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,180
How do you say that in Finnish?

674
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,200
Again.

675
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,680
Heista?

676
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:17,940
Heista?

677
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,280
No.

678
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,200
Nappa, belly button.

679
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,200
Heista, Nappa.

680
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,860
Heista, Nappa.

681
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,860


682
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,860


683
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,860


684
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,860


685
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,860


686
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,860


687
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,860


688
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,860


689
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,460
Heista, my Nappa, buddy.

690
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,600
You can heista my Nappa, okay?

691
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:39,640
Well, remember the large was the guy that we called Reverend Angry Lonesome Cowboy Larry.

692
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,420
Larry.

693
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,100
Larry.

694
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,840
That's one of his names.

695
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,860
Oh, that's not the Finnish one, right?

696
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,760
That is the Finnish one, yes.

697
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,840
Well, Bob isn't Finnish.

698
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,840
Well, that's when I was staring at the crayons, and I realized that Bob was Finnish.

699
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:52,840


700
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,860
I'd used up all the paper, and I'm sorry.

701
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,080
Bob isn't Finnish with him yet.

702
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,140
No, Bob's not Finnish with him yet.

703
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,420
So Dave, how's everything going over there in Ashtabula?

704
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,120
I fear to hesitate to ask.

705
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,080
Well.

706
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,940
But did anyway.

707
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm under, I'm having problem with nasal grippage.

708
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:22,420
I'm sure the collective audience doesn't want it, but individuals might want to hear it.

709
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,140
But I have various parts of my body removed.

710
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,260
No, Dave, no.

711
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,240
Removed?

712
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,140
Yep.

713
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:40,540
And given the scavenger elves who forage here in my idyllic verdant backyard, and not one

714
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,540
so far has even offered a morsel back.

715
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,960
I leave food out for them.

716
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,860
Sometimes I shoot the bunny rabbits for the horns.

717
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,240
I hope they're not-

718
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,480
It's antler season.

719
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,400
Body parts you really need to.

720
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,660
You know, like the double mean baby head.

721
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,620
Or the paras, I mean that parasitic twin hanging off the back of your head.

722
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,940
The gibbers and mumbles.

723
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,660
Well, that's a way of putting it.

724
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,520
Parasitic too.

725
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:13,460
I don't know if they compete with common dentures in like people, like 93 years plus or something

726
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,020
like that.

727
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,060
Unless they've already been previously indentured, you know, just like they did with the servants

728
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,060
and old age.

729
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,380
Yeah.

730
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,980
So you didn't have the double mean baby head removed from the back of your head, right?

731
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,880
No, I told you just kind of like, it didn't evaporate.

732
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,140
It just kind of like disappeared.

733
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,760
So I realized I had half of my face was used to be covered like for about four years.

734
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:47,460
This huge purple and a big like booze mark and stuff.

735
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,060
And I thought it was a birthmark.

736
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,380
But you know, they said if you have a baby, you can have a baby.

737
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:52,380


738
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,220
You can appear at any time, even if you're already been born for like, you know, years

739
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,120
and years and stuff.

740
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,560
You mean like a wine stain?

741
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,560
Yeah, like a wine stain.

742
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,320
Wow.

743
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,200
And you just had this appear over half of your face?

744
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:12,360
No, I gauzed and daubed myself regularly with all kinds of excrements and ointments.

745
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,660
They've procured from the farthest lands of the East.

746
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,440
And like comb Chinese on herbal stores and stuff like that.

747
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,700
And one time I got my shoe.

748
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,860
I lost my shoe in a gutter over there.

749
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,060
And I was like picking around in the gutter because I could still see it.

750
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,180
And somebody came by me.

751
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,020
I was horrible.

752
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,020
That's what it is.

753
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:45,260
If you focus on the wrong, I was going to call it religion, but I mean political philosophy.

754
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,640
If you focus on the wrong, you're going to be a bad person.

755
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:47,640


756
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,400
I'm a strong one for the long amount of time.

757
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:55,200
There are really grave collision in there.

758
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,400
Wow.

759
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,420
You know, I'm embarrassed.

760
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,260
That sounds bad.

761
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,740
This show is freaking me out.

762
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,320
Yeah.

763
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,780
But what if you were to become, you know, oh, I don't want to say it.

764
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,280
Insane.

765
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,260
Go ahead.

766
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,320
Use the word.

767
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,640
It's not a dirty word in the Church of the Holy Spirit.

768
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,400
this genius. This music

769
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,300
in the background, by the way, is by The Large.

770
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,680
Freak out, freak out, freak

771
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,840
out, freak out.

772
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,560
Far out, far out.

773
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,360
Is it going to be like this forever?

774
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,940
Far out, far out.

775
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,400
Unfortunately, it might well be.

776
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
If you talk to current

777
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,220
quasi-physicists nowadays,

778
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,940
like a sperm donor or something,

779
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,480
all these people who think

780
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,340
that they've got these little amoebic

781
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,800
tiny little brains,

782
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,020
and they can somehow get in with these

783
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,740
big government corporations

784
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,020
and stuff like that.

785
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,480
I'm not supposed to talk about that.

786
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,080
Dave's off the hook, Princess Wee.

787
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,280
I guess he is.

788
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,420
Dave's off the hook, man.

789
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,000
I think we ought to let him just keep running

790
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,540
like that.

791
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,300
Don't unplug him.

792
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,040
Go for it.

793
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,780
I tried to call my baby the other night.

794
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,580
Do-do-do-do-do.

795
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,340
Remember that song, Off the Hook?

796
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,440
No.

797
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,500
Slow-eyed salmon, reptiles.

798
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,580
I can't remember.

799
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,240
It's okay, Dave.

800
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,320
It's all right.

801
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,960
It was a long, long time ago,

802
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,560
and everything will be okay.

803
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,120
You remember back when I first got out of there,

804
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,540
don't you?

805
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,260
I mean, I helped you when we moved into,

806
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,400
I think it was Chaz's backyard

807
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,700
or something like that over on the east side.

808
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,060
You mean when you got out of the

809
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
place where they were keeping you?

810
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,540
Yeah, when they let me out of there, yeah.

811
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,860
Are you talking about the

812
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,340
time that you ate that pepper,

813
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,280
that scotch bonnet pepper in Chaz's backyard?

814
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,320
No, he's talking about when they let him out

815
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,760
of the psycho ward.

816
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,240
Oh.

817
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,820
That's what precipitated it.

818
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,940
Do you remember that?

819
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,740
Yes, you ate a raw scotch bonnet pepper,

820
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,360
a whole one.

821
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,560
You just crunched it down like it was a tomato.

822
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,980
Like you knew what you were doing.

823
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,420
And then in a few minutes,

824
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,880
your joints started to get warm and tingly.

825
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,100
Yeah.

826
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,340
It was covered in potato salad and I didn't see it.

827
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,540
I was just such a swine.

828
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,420
I just like shoved it in my mouth and stuff.

829
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
I was like, what the hell?

830
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,560
And suddenly I was transported to sunny Mexico.

831
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,660
I was like getting ready to watch an Aztec ritual murder or something like that.

832
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,980
It was pyramids and it was like that Martin Denny's music from the early 70s.

833
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,220
Like, you know, weird baboons crying in the background.

834
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,060
Who?

835
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,100
What?

836
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,580
When?

837
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,140
Where?

838
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:45,920
What?

839
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,660
And stuff.

840
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,780
Oh, man.

841
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,500
Oh, man.

842
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,680
Here comes the weather patrol.

843
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,020
That's not the patrol.

844
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,940
That's the large again in the background.

845
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,320
Actually, this is one of his many bands.

846
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,020
This is with somebody else called Naka Mafia.

847
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,880
A tune called Pokey House.

848
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,680
Have you ever been to Pokey?

849
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,340
Oh, yeah.

850
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,760
I wonder what that means.

851
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,320
I think I've probably been there.

852
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,140
Stay the time.

853
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,820
Stay the time.

854
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:16,840
Stay the time.

855
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,240
Stay the time.

856
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:17,880
Stay the time.

857
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:17,880


858
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,380
The institutional way of thought is the only way of thought that keeps you and remind you

859
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,560
of the state of mind.

860
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:32,240
Did I just hear somebody in Finnish in the background tell me to smell his belly button?

861
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:34,940
Yeah.

862
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,140
With an impairment device.

863
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,700
Well, what do you think about which...

864
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:44,840
Yeah.

865
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,220
I'm sorry.

866
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:45,500
Me.

867
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,100
I'm sorry.

868
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,420
I'm sorry.

869
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,540
I'm sorry.

870
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:46,800
I'm sorry.

871
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,340
prognosis for the future.

872
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,120
The prognosis for the future is terrible.

873
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,740
Especially if you're any of the endangered species,

874
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,620
such as human beings or subgeniuses.

875
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,900
Look out.

876
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,080
Yep.

877
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,180
Now we're even starting to have to worry about the normals.

878
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,700
Well, who cares?

879
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,360
I don't really care about the humans so much.

880
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,140
But the subgeniuses' fate until X-Day,

881
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:20,440
you know, the humans have us between a rock and a very, very, very soft place.

882
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,900
I was going to say between a rock and a marshmallow.

883
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,620
Yeah, the rock is going to win.

884
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,340
The haters always win.

885
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,220
Like in that movie, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.

886
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,560
Princess Wee and I saw that.

887
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,180
And I don't think it'll be much of a spoiler if I tell you that the haters win,

888
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,860
just like in real life.

889
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,220
Because the haters are better at hating than the peaceniks are.

890
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,020
See, here's the belly button part.

891
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,460
That's what the Internet's all about.

892
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,640
It tells you what you can find, whatever you most want to hear,

893
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:09,000
told to you over and over again by millions of other anonymous losers and cowards.

894
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,780
Over and over again, you can be told everything.

895
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,420
You can be told everything you most wanted to hear.

896
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,180
And that is why the Internet makes us stupid instead of smarter.

897
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,180
There, I said it.

898
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,460
But I wouldn't necessarily say anonymous, because people might mistake me for people who were...

899
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,620
I don't mean the group anonymous.

900
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,300
I mean the anonymous cowards that get on the Internet.

901
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,940
Oh, wait, that is the group anonymous.

902
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,520
Oh, well, no, I'm kidding.

903
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,940
I don't want them coming after me.

904
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,600
No, sir.

905
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,940
They'll out me.

906
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,520
You should be allowed to kick kids, I think.

907
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,360
I don't know.

908
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,080
I don't know either.

909
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,780
I don't know.

910
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,160
But I'm open to learning.

911
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,940
You've been a professional bowler for the last 37 years, just as I have.

912
00:43:53,240 --> 00:44:02,660
And what would you say was your very most irregular passage of, you know, what was your worst bowling match?

913
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:12,060
When I prayed to the bowling ball to win me the match and it didn't, that was when I lost my faith in God and bowling balls.

914
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,120
And bowling in general.

915
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,460
I should have known better.

916
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,160
After Santa Claus, I mean, you'd think I would have learned, but no.

917
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,520
Oh, well.

918
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,680
Could be worse.

919
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,220
At least it's this Bob religion that I'm brainwashed in.

920
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:36,540
Well, when you think of it incorrectly and you close your eyes, really, you know, like try and focus on your pineal gland,

921
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,700
you realize that Dobbs and God and banking either is very often useless.

922
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,400
Yes.

923
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,340
I mean, Dobbs or God or Dobbs or God.

924
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,820
Well, I don't know.

925
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,860
They're useful for blaming things on.

926
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,720
You can say, hey, stuff happens.

927
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,440
Praise Bob.

928
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,380
Damn Bob.

929
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,180
Whichever.

930
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,100
You can't curse Bob?

931
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,900
Yes, you have to.

932
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:05,460
Or we'll kick you out of the church if you do nothing but slavishly praise Bob and wander around on your knees.

933
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,760
You have to, with your butt up in the air.

934
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,540
With your butt facing Bob.

935
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,040
Yeah.

936
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:13,100
Yeah.

937
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,100


938
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,280
You have to pray.

939
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Eventually, you have to, you know, be snapped out of it and prove that you're not a complete dunderhead by killing Bob or symbolically doing so.

940
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,720
Of course, you can't ever catch him.

941
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,780
You can't really kill him.

942
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,640
Yeah.

943
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,680
I'd like to, like, some really feminine, really hairy, like, dancer in a tutu and stuff like that.

944
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,080
But he's not.

945
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,000
He's really rough and stuff.

946
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,320
Bob's not insecure.

947
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,660
And he will let you.

948
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,100
You're welcome to take your frustrations out.

949
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,860
You're welcome to take your frustrations out on him by hitting him and bashing him.

950
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,800
I'd challenge any other religious gurus or messiahs or saviors.

951
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,660
Oh, wait.

952
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,680
No, I guess Jesus let people beat on him.

953
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,920
Even though he was God, he just let people pick on him.

954
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,520
Yeah, or let you take the placard match home.

955
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,900
But his fan club says that he needs a lot of help.

956
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,800
Yes.

957
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,240
Because Jesus and God are not very strong anymore.

958
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:12,000
And it takes a lot of right-wing Christians to do their jobs for him.

959
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,260
Yes.

960
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:12,520
Yes.

961
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:12,920
Yes.

962
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:18,780
The kind of gods Jesus and God apparently are, according to some of their fan club members.

963
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,680
I'm not going to put down every single one of them because they occasionally get some good deeds done.

964
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,180
Yeah.

965
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,620
Like, close down all the abortion clinics in Texas.

966
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,280
You know, there's only 20 places left in Texas where you can get an abortion.

967
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,280
And most of those places are five hours away.

968
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,260
So, congratulations, humans.

969
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,140
There will be a lot more of you soon.

970
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:50,980
Mostly little water-headed po-buckers, to quote my dad and Bill Hicks.

971
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,120
People who take orders well and who do what they are told.

972
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,700
That's who will survive.

973
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:06,940
And the sub-G will probably mean the nut under those rock-and-hard, you know, granite s'mores you were making back there in the backyard.

974
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,520
Bob sold it.

975
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,080
I smoked it.

976
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,740
That settles it.

977
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,240
I'll do what Bob said.

978
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,340
Yes, that's all I'm going to do.

979
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,860
But at least...

980
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:19,200
Well, except when I can't understand what he's saying, which reminds me of this show sometimes.

981
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,440
Well, that's what tests the importance of our linguistic skills.

982
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:37,320
That's what proves that semantics and misdealings and rhetorical falsehoods and things like that, we get a chance to the miracle of radio and a bunch of...

983
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,020
To really see it.

984
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:41,960
Wait a minute.

985
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,440
I have to backstep a little bit.

986
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,320
And I have to sit down.

987
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,840
Yeah, I almost said something I shouldn't have said.

988
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,160
Just sit down carefully, Dave.

989
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Are you suddenly talking about us again with the idiot talk?

990
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,020
No.

991
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,320
No, I was...

992
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:02,580
One segment of the audience, which is exactly like 2% of the audience, I think is what the quotable figure is.

993
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:11,220
2% of the audience have nasty, mean ideas about your pro-scripture for health.

994
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:18,100
And happiness and somewhat non-causal existence from time to time.

995
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,940
And do you know these audience members personally, Dave?

996
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,920
Or are you just speculating?

997
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,580
No, I'm talking like straight from the bird's...

998
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,260
Straight through your hat.

999
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,860
No, no.

1000
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,740
From the horse's mouth.

1001
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,920
I didn't mean to call you an equestrian.

1002
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,040
Only a plasmodic vision of a horse of some kind.

1003
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,480
You know, wild and free.

1004
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,520
I'm just trying to put in my two centaurs worth.

1005
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,420
You complain about certain people.

1006
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,140
Like 2%.

1007
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,460
No, no, no.

1008
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,800
Those are the ones I'm not complaining about.

1009
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,920
I'm complaining about the 98 percenters.

1010
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,760
That's everybody but me.

1011
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:04,700
What?

1012
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,820
That's different.

1013
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,040
I don't understand when you speak.

1014
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:11,600
Russian.

1015
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,580
That is different, man.

1016
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,580
That's unusual.

1017
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,520
That's unique.

1018
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,640
It's, you know...

1019
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,140
No, I don't.

1020
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,960
You thought it was different, man.

1021
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,700
Yeah, yeah.

1022
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,440
Just like she said.

1023
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,500
Man.

1024
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,580
Man.

1025
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:39,220
Have you noticed that a toilet paper tube does not work as it likes it?

1026
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,160
1940s sounding radio show device.

1027
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,640
On a cell phone.

1028
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,420
No, it works in a radio studio, but not on a cell phone.

1029
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,360
Because there are actual liquid mics in front of your very eyes.

1030
00:49:53,620 --> 00:50:00,120
Well, because the cell phone already sounds like talking through a toilet paper tube on a regular microphone.

1031
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,060
It sounds more like talking through a sewage plant basement with all the machines on.

1032
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,100
The hydrocephalic geeks and the jumping lemurs.

1033
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:16,520
The better lemurs of our day, you know, transfer so easily that you can, you know...

1034
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,760
What were you talking about?

1035
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,920
The better lemurs of our nature, did you say?

1036
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,560
I'm not quite following this.

1037
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,460
What is...

1038
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,380
I'm trying to be a good follower, Dave.

1039
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Like battered lemur syndrome, perhaps?

1040
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,440
Maybe you've been there, I understand it from a clinical standpoint.

1041
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,680
Or maybe for, you know, from some outreach clinic, man.

1042
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,020
Yeah, man.

1043
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:48,360
I'm not saying you personally battered lemur or anything like that.

1044
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:54,540
I'm like, as if to French fry it Korean style, you know, I'm battered a bit and then, you know.

1045
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,500
I wouldn't even need a tennis shoe that way.

1046
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,720
You know what I'm saying?

1047
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,180
No temporary tennis shoe for you?

1048
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,300
Nope, not anymore.

1049
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,440
I got the word from Dr. Grossman.

1050
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:07,980
Hmm.

1051
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,120
He said, I've only got 25 and a half.

1052
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:21,440
More years to remain in the squat position left to me by my grandparents and my Uncle Poopy.

1053
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,400
So you just had to cut the temporary tennis shoes right out?

1054
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,060
Right, like straight right on out of there.

1055
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,140
No crunchy tennis shoes for Dave.

1056
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,240
No, you can't even put like leafy greens on to like spruce it up.

1057
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,800
Like, oh, he's got some boat there.

1058
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:41,920
You know.

1059
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,520
What the hell is going on in this show?

1060
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

1061
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,920
I am really, um, I'm just too brave.

1062
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,240
What happened?

1063
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,660
We went off the rails.

1064
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,160
We went, we went off the hook.

1065
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,440
And the background music stopped.

1066
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,700
I stopped it.

1067
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,460
I turned it off.

1068
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,840
Dave and I have co-opted the Hour of Slack into a cooking show.

1069
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,420
A lemur cooking show, if I'm hearing correctly.

1070
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,320
Yes, we're talking about lemur cookery.

1071
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,320
Great.

1072
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,660
And tennis shoe cookery.

1073
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,160
Well, there's so much for PR news.

1074
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:11,240


1075
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,780
And smoke guns.

1076
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,880
And all those other, and Man Rifle and all those other shows we play.

1077
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,560
No more funny titles for Hour of Slack.

1078
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,320
You guys are going to cook lemur.

1079
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,780
It was, you know, it was guilt through association.

1080
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,580
Free association ain't free, man.

1081
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,420
That guy's already half cooked anyway.

1082
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,720
Anyway, not half baked.

1083
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,260
I wouldn't say that.

1084
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,660
But certainly he's been through the oven.

1085
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,860
I know that much.

1086
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,220
Poorly cooked.

1087
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1088
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1089
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1090
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1091
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1092
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1093
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1094
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1095
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1096
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1097
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,220


1098
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,700
Poorly nuked.

1099
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,540
Poor, very poorly nuked.

1100
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,180
Left in for two seconds when 35 was what was required.

1101
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,780
Princess, we made a whole bunch of lemur this for Thanksgiving, which was two weeks

1102
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,120
ago for most of our listeners.

1103
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,720
She made lemur pudding, lemur stew, lemur bones.

1104
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,300
Lemur stuffing.

1105
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,220
Yeah, lemur.

1106
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh, the lemur stuffing was my favorite.

1107
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:05,440
Mm-hmm.

1108
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
And, uh.

1109
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:08,800
Jellied.

1110
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,120
We had jellied lemur.

1111
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,780
That's right.

1112
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,800
Cran lemur.

1113
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,420
Mm-hmm.

1114
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,440
Cran lemur?

1115
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,900
Ter lemur ducking.

1116
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,800
Oh, my.

1117
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,060
The ter lemur ducking was, I don't know.

1118
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,980
I didn't really like it.

1119
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:21,320
Really?

1120
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:30,400
Yeah, that was, well, because fowl and primates don't really, well, are lemurs primates?

1121
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,600
I think they are.

1122
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,000
They're related.

1123
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,220
No, lemurs are like, they're like little weasels or.

1124
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,480
No, no, no.

1125
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:36,800
They're not.

1126
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:37,340
Aren't they like.

1127
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,540
They're, uh.

1128
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,100
How about bad guys?

1129
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1130
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1131
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1132
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1133
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1134
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1135
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1136
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1137
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1138
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1139
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1140
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100


1141
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:40,600
They're badgers, maybe.

1142
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,120
Perhaps a form of exotic badger.

1143
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,200
Well, the prep for that was a real wolverine, so I probably won't do that again.

1144
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,080
I mean, lemurs aren't eggs and they're not monkeys.

1145
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:49,900
They're lemurs.

1146
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:50,860
If you didn't like it.

1147
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:51,480
Oh, yes.

1148
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:51,900
That's right.

1149
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,920
They're climbing trees and they're related to monkeys.

1150
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,980
And, yes, sort of.

1151
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,500
And they come from Madagascar.

1152
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:58,840
Yeah.

1153
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,760
But they're very, they're only related to monkeys like we're related to monkeys.

1154
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,180
Not very closely.

1155
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,360
Well, that, that explains your horrors.

1156
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,020
Less than picking out the weird bones.

1157
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,100
Yeah.

1158
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,100


1159
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,100


1160
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:16,540
And, you know, I thought in the first example you might have, you know, done a small hologram

1161
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:23,240
and like with a point projection of some kind, maybe a little barbecue, Texas style, you

1162
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,080
know, to get people all warmed up and plenty of free coffee.

1163
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:31,220
And then when everybody's sitting down, squeeze.

1164
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,640
I've never had barbecued hologram.

1165
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,240
Is that good?

1166
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,220
Oh, it is.

1167
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,080
That's a good one.

1168
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,300
I'm going to have to eat that.

1169
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,440
That's about all you're going to have to eat in the future.

1170
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Barbecued hologram.

1171
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,600
Yeah, roach steaks.

1172
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,260
The actual food will be roach crap steaks.

1173
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:50,860
Ew.

1174
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,480
Made from roach crap.

1175
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,080
And the holograms are what make you feel better about it.

1176
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,540
It looks like a juicy hamburger you can eat the hell out of.

1177
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,840
But really, you're just eating the hell.

1178
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,100
Man, you got a bucket?

1179
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:05,700
Ew.

1180
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,300
Bob said it.

1181
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,060
He was, he was.

1182
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:10,060


1183
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,080
His dates were a little off.

1184
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,540
Bob said you'll all be eating roach crap by the year 2000.

1185
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,800
Give him a break because he said that in 1955.

1186
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,780
But you know, they are talking about feeding the world using insects and they've been,

1187
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:29,380
I've read several news articles where they're softening us up to get us ready for mealworms

1188
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:29,760
meals.

1189
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,180
Dude, I'm about to hurl.

1190
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:32,800
You're going to have to stop that.

1191
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,300
No, I'm sorry.

1192
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,100
By the way, I'm quite serious.

1193
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,500
The time is coming.

1194
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,600
Do you remember, Kate?

1195
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,660
Do you remember the future all?

1196
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,040
I don't know.

1197
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,040


1198
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,820
I don't I don't know too well.

1199
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,880
But something's gotten so revolutionary about downloaded and updated prayer paper that

1200
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,220
's going tokeeper hundreds of thousands of children at a point the world is a little

1201
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:53,760
bit more there.

1202
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,900
And on and around and around and around and around in your background.

1203
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,900
You got to keep going and around and around.

1204
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:06,760
And there's so much to that.

1205
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,580
統ffentlich он Морозы не воткировать

1206
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,840
obrigado.

1207
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,680
they were. You know, you'd start off

1208
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,480
at a little bistro and having some great

1209
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,620
snacks, and then like one layer

1210
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,600
would wear away as the drug wore

1211
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,580
off. So in the green is

1212
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,460
lemur crap.

1213
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,240
Exactly.

1214
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,460
Well, that movie Snowpiercer

1215
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,340
actually had an interesting, now

1216
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,660
that I'm thinking about it, the people

1217
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,120
on the Snowpiercer train

1218
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,660
are faced

1219
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,840
with the rude awakening that their meals

1220
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,460
have actually been made from

1221
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:36,800
roaches.

1222
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,740
Bugs. Slurry of

1223
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,520
bug jelly.

1224
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,940
It's got a lot of protein in it.

1225
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,700
The time will come.

1226
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,440
Well, some even used to believe

1227
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,480
way back in the days of sophomoric

1228
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,920
humor that

1229
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,440
cockroaches could be called as

1230
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,160
an elegant treat for

1231
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,440
radiation sickness because they seem to show

1232
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,660
very few effects.

1233
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,320
Like, living

1234
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,420
next to a nuclear power plant doesn't seem

1235
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,400
to do anything to them, but to the

1236
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,880
73-year-old grandmother

1237
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,540
living nearby gives her cancer

1238
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,500
in about five and a half seconds.

1239
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,780
Well, therefore

1240
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,760
eat roaches to fend off

1241
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,580
cancer. There you go. There's the answer

1242
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,100
right there.

1243
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,000
Deep fried.

1244
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,100
Therefore, and that's what

1245
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,100
I love about all those syllogisms

1246
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,300
and like if three equals two,

1247
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,960
four equals five, then

1248
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,120
four equals six.

1249
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,980
Therefore, bob dogs.

1250
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,980
Yeah, exactly.

1251
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,440
It's the perfect conundrum. Is that the right word

1252
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:35,760
or is it?

1253
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,680
Condom.

1254
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,780
If three equals five, then

1255
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,440
slack.

1256
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,280
Well, it's some kind of greasy

1257
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,900
receptacle, that's for sure.

1258
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,440
Slack. Indeed.

1259
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,400
Well, and friends, you're listening

1260
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,280
to the hour of slack

1261
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,280
and

1262
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,240
meal bugs

1263
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,620
made into meals.

1264
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,460
Meals on wheels

1265
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,700
and six legs.

1266
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,280
Carried on the backs of lemurs.

1267
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,160
Your community with meals

1268
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:05,860
on wheels.

1269
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,220
With lots of buggy-woogie treats.

1270
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,660
Well,

1271
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,520
bugsters and buggies,

1272
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,760
I should give the

1273
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,880
final credits, which is

1274
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,680
that we're

1275
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,740
we've avoided once again

1276
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,760
talking about J.R. Bob Dobbs

1277
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,000
for most of the time.

1278
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,020
Bob.

1279
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,320
But you can see strange

1280
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,400
pictures of Bob on

1281
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,820
subgenius.com

1282
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,620
including the strangely

1283
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,480
formed new

1284
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,820
old original Dobbs head

1285
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,960
photograph. The photograph

1286
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,760
of a prematurely aged

1287
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,340
and jowly Dobbs

1288
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,460
from which

1289
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,080
the famous classic Dobbs head

1290
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,760
portrait that you all have

1291
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,620
tattooed on your foreheads

1292
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,140
comes.

1293
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,920
As ride theory

1294
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,720
said about the new Dobbs head,

1295
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,380
his fizz is risen.

1296
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,120
Yea, though ye walk

1297
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,640
through the uncanny valley,

1298
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,640
of the half-toned salesman.

1299
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,440
Speak and see and hear

1300
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,420
no evil, for the new Bob

1301
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,600
is with you. His odd and

1302
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,260
changed puss discomforts

1303
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,880
thee. He preparest

1304
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,620
a web page before thy

1305
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,780
frenemies. Milk flows

1306
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,940
from thy nose. Thy cup

1307
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,960
is spitaken.

1308
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,760
Goodness and mercy, it

1309
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,020
shall follow thee all the days of thy life

1310
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,700
and you shall dwell on this

1311
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,800
.jpeg forever

1312
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,780
and ever.

00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,420
Thank you Ride Theory for that

1315
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,980
little explanation for the new

1316
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,340
Dobbs head.

1317
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,520
Thank you Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1318
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,260

00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,860

1320
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,080

1329
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,740
Oh and the large. Yeah I do, I

1330
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,380
actually do have to cut to a song

1331
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,820
now by Reverend Andrew the Impaled

1332
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,880
at 17

1333
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,780
X Day on somebody else's

1334
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,600
keyboard so forgive him if he hits a

1335
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,520
rote, rote non every

1336
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,180
now and then.

1337
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,520
Hits the road Ron. Okay.

1338
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,540
At least he's not tapping cylindrical

1339
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,880
devices down his nasal area and his throat

1340
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,540
and more like he used once to did

1341
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,060
like last week.

1342
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,480
Well it happens every time.

1343
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,220
Okay, okay here it goes.

1344
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,500
Should I leave you on so you can hear it Dave?

1345
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,680
Might as well,

1346
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,400
uh, yeah. Okay.

1347
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,120
C-T-G-A

1348
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:50,460
C-T-G-A

1349
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:50,460


1350
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,240
I got some fresh DNA

1351
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,880
I got it for you

1352
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,160
C-T-G-A

1353
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,840
Why you get me? Ain't nothing better to do

1354
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,620
Oh you're C-C-T-G-A

1355
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,420
C-T-G-A-A-C would go nice

1356
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,740
With my C-C-T-G-A-G-A-G my advice

1357
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,000
Let's get down today.

1358
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,500
In a sapiosexual way

1359
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,660
What kind of girl? She's a sapiosexual

1360
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,560
Yeah I know what that means

1361
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,360
And it's not hot, at least to her

1362
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,900
Cause she digs intellectuals

1363
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,220
Yeah she likes geeks

1364
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,080
Well you're new to the scene

1365
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,320
You might be kind of keen

1366
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,580
Do you know what I mean?

1367
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,600
When I say I like them genes

1368
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,680
Oh C-T-G-A

1369
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,760
I got some fresh DNA

1370
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,240
I got it for you

1371
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,280
Oh C-T-G-A

1372
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,560
Why don't you come get with me?

1373
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,880
Ain't nothing better to do

1374
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,300
Oh you're C-C-T-G-A-C-T-G-A-A-C would go nice

1375
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,500
With my C-C-T-G-A-G-A-G my advice

1376
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,740
Let's get down today

1377
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,120
In a sapiosexual way

1378
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,940
Some cotton girls take all the time to pretty up

1379
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,200
But they're just for the day

1380
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,220
And it's gonna fade

1381
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,500
Some other girls they only wanna shake it up

1382
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,760
Get drunk and laid

1383
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,640
Well that ain't for me

1384
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,280
She might be up till three

1385
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,860
But with a book of poetry

1386
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,160
And my C-T-G-A

1387
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,200
I got some fresh DNA

1388
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,700
I got it for you

1389
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,020
A-T-C-G why don't you come get with me

1390
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,320
Ain't nothing better to do

1391
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,720
Oh C-T-G-A-C-T-G-A-A-C would go nice

1392
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,960
With my C-T-G-A-G-A-G my advice

1393
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,200
Let's get down today

1394
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,660
In a sapiosexual way

1395
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,220
You saw a woman

1396
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,240
That I caught under your subtle reference

1397
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,880
To a movie that not more than ten thousand people have seen

1398
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,260
Among there and there and there

1399
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,620
Well I know the difference

1400
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,320
So how'd you like to mix it up with me

1401
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:54,340
Yeah my C-T-G-A-G-A-G

1402
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,600
I got some fresh DNA

1403
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,040
And my C-T-G-A-G-A-G my advice

1404
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:06,040


1405
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:06,820
And my C-T-G-A-G-A-G my advice

Yeah my C-T-G-A-G-A-G my advice

1408
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:12,580
Yeah my C-T-G-A-G-A-G my advice

1409
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,820
If you want the kind of guy that makes you laugh

1410
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,920
Take you by surprise and you realize

1411
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,420
He wants you because of the mind you have

1412
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,080
Now do you empathize

1413
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,680
To be perfectly fair

1414
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,860
You should be aware

1415
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,200
We'd make a nifty pair

1416
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,440
If you have the M-C squared

1417
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,680
For my C-T-G-A

1418
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,740
I got some fresh DNA

1419
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,340
I got it for you

1420
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,560
Say T-C-G why don't you go with me

1421
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,960
Got nothing better to do

1422
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,700
Your C-C-T-G-A-G-G-A-A-C

1423
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,000
Would go nice with my C-C-T-G-A-G-A-G

1424
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,860
My advice let's get down today

01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,340
