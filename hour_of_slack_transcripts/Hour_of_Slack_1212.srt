1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
We're holding this public meeting in the Civic Auditorium tonight because of the story.

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,220
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,340
The subgenius, our old son.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,100
For juvenile delinquents?

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm happy to hear that.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,360
Well, that's very interesting.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,720
Yeah?

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,840
Mr. Dobbs purchased another radio station.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,440
Oh, okay.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,040
Assuming that radio would be in his future, Dobbs adds yet another laurel to his long list of achievements.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,260
You do take medicine for schizophrenia.

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:44,860
Hopefully.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,220
I'm sure you're not having an episode.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,880
I haven't heard this before.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,480
In the last 20 years of his life, the most dynamic industrial individual,

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,640
with 41 hours of tape, as much as 41 hours of tape,

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,140
secret conversations recorded.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,160
Therefore, simple mathematics dictated that in less than one minute of each hour,

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,820
actually, the show could penetrate the record population with little effort.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,380
And so, there were the first 20 years.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,580
Hey, calm down, Jack.

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,200
Oh, my head's too big.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,500
Wait.

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,360
I've been piping.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,100
Here, let me pull you back in.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,160
Oh, here we go.

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:36,880
Ah, yes.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
The year 2000.

29
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,120
The distant future.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,260
The year 2000.

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,100
Oh, that's better.

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,980
That was a long way back, Jack.

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,260
Smaller now.

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,340
There's no show in there.

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,320
Yeah, I didn't think so.

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,620
I can remember.

37
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,340
Show's over here, Doug.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,160
Y2K.

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,780
Here I am.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
We are robots.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,460
Okay, good.

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,320
The world is quite different.

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,660
We're the robot versions of ourselves.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's the really cool thing.

45
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,420
I love it.

46
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,460
I love it.

47
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,460


48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,560
I was trying to tell you earlier.

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,520
Yeah, we're the automatons that just keep going, even though our bodies have already

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,840
left for X.

51
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,460
You know, for the outer world.

52
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:09,780
Yeah.

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,880
For the outer world.

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,380
We already left a long time ago.

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,800
That's why we keep going about this myth of X-Day.

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,120
But still, it's good.

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,400
Everything is so automated now.

58
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,340
We actually did leave.

59
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,500
Still, it's good, right, X-Day?

60
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,120
Yeah, we actually, our real, our earthly selves actually did leave in 1998.

61
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,440
It's just our robot selves that continue.

62
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,240
It's just our robots that continue on this illusion.

63
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
And here we are.

64
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,040
And this planet is Mars.

65
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,520
The humans are dead.

66
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,740
The humans are dead.

67
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,700
The humans are dead and we're still here.

68
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,720
But we're just robots.

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,180
Michael Jackson was a human.

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
It's too soon, sorry.

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,260
Yeah, they talked about Ali, about Michael Jackson, but what about Aliak Mark-Connor?

72
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,480
They look like they're dead.

73
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,120
They're a boss and girl.

74
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,760
I'll just confirm that they're dead.

75
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,280
Okay.

76
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,740
So that we could have fun.

77
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,880
The bubbles is not dead.

78
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,420
We stopped at the end of the world.

79
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,420


80
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,420


81
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,420


82
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,420


83
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,420


84
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,420


85
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,420


86
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,420


87
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,540
We're not with nothing.

88
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,960
Okay.

89
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,440
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.

90
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,380
We start with nothing and leave everything behind.

91
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,500
No point in saving with a rainy day in mind.

92
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,100
The sun will rise in the morning, sure as every night it sets.

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,820
Maybe there'll be no warning from the men from Planet X.

94
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,820
Who knows who might be next?

95
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,640
Who knows you might be next?

96
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,700
Who knows it's anyone's guess?

97
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,040
Who knows hate it, all of it?

98
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,340
Who knows it might soon be you?

99
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,240
Who knows it could be me too?

100
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,060
Who knows when your time is time?

101
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,660
Who knows heaven is here?

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,620
It's been one hell of a ride.

103
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,800
We start with nothing and leave everything behind.

104
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,000
No point in saving with a rainy day in mind.

105
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,520
The sun will rise in the morning, sure as every night it sets.

106
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,940
Maybe there'll be no warning from the men from Planet X.

107
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:30,940
No point in saving with a rainy day in mind.

108
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


109
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


110
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


111
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


112
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


113
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


114
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


115
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


116
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,120
If heaven is here, it's been one hell of a ride

117
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,480
Leave everything behind

118
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,340
Behind, behind, behind

119
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,140
Leave everything behind

120
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,700
Behind, behind, behind

121
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,720
Leave everything behind

122
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Behind, behind, behind

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,440
Who knows?

124
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,400
Who knows?

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,700
Who knows?

126
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,140
Who knows?

127
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,940
Who knows?

128
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,180
Who knows?

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,460
Who knows?

130
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,980
unbesmirched.

131
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,740
The salsas are coming.

132
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,940
Yes, the salsa

133
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,020
dancers are indeed coming.

134
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,080
They're going to bring their frantic

135
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,420
rhythms into

136
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,220
everyone's lives. But once again,

137
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
a strange phenomenon

138
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,980
has occurred that a sleeping

139
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,940
planet knew nothing about.

140
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,580
That the Earth was

141
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,960
saved from the fate of

142
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
ultimate destruction

143
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,520
one more time

144
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,620
at a lonely, secluded

145
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,640
campground in

146
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,380
remote western

147
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,580
New York State.

148
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,160
For X Day 12

149
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,980
dawned and

150
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,700
set, with all of us

151
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,880
still here,

152
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,720
with still a little bit

153
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,300
more time given

154
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,760
to us by the grace of fate

155
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,380
to clean up

156
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,080
our mess and do

157
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,860
our laundry.

158
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,040
I've got a lot of laundry left to do, actually.

159
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,080
Yes, I know. Nobody prepared.

160
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,160
And so it will be on

161
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,800
that great day when the sea

162
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,140
gives up its dead

163
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,200
and monsters walk the Earth

164
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,000
that nobody will be prepared

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,300
and will have even bothered

166
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,580
to destroy

167
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,100
his pornography collection to

168
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,800
keep from influencing whatever

169
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,360
posterity may remain.

170
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

171
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,960
this is our special guest in the studio

172
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,020
this evening, Dr. Howell.

173
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,100
Oh, thank you. And of course, I'm

174
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,440
here with my co-conspirators

175
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,920
and fellow travelers,

176
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,220
Reverend Dr. Ivan

177
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,460
Steng and

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,880
his consort, Princess

179
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,900
We Are Doe, Queen of

180
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,020
All the Rebels. Yeah, we gotta do that laundry, because in case

181
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,880
there might be any earwigs

182
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,260
still in there. Oh, that is a distressing

183
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,920
episode she refers to, folks.

184
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,140
I have to put in a correction.

185
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,840
She's the princess.

186
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm the princess.

187
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,840
I'm the consort.

188
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,600
Well, that's, uh...

189
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,140
However, I am the sacred scribe of the Church of the

190
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,420
Subgenius, which is a...

191
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,920
You see such becoming humility, friends.

192
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,300
Surely this must be the genuine

193
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
article. Not some

194
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,060
flim-flammer, but

195
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,320
one actually

196
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,240
riddled with

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,900
holy effuvium, or darsham,

198
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,260
as it is called.

199
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,240
Yes, the

200
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,020
emanation that radiates

201
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,760
from holy men is very

202
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,820
strong in this room, as I sit across

203
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,480
the table from Ivan

204
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,640
Steng and shapely

205
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,660
Princess We Are Doe, here

206
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,680
in the center of the

207
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,300
belly of the beast.

208
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,360
I thought I felt something crawling up my spine.

209
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,400
Oh, wait a second. That's Rocknar.

210
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,260
Hello, you're on the air.

211
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,200
Good evening, Dr. Sinister.

212
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,540
Well, if it isn't Governor Rocknar.

213
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,380
Price Rocknar, it's good to hear

214
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,320
your voice. We missed you the next

215
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,340
day. We really did. We missed you, but

216
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,620
you received a special Bobby Award.

217
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,520
During the coveted Bobby Awards

218
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,920
ceremony. Well, thank you.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,300
I'm honored. I

220
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,820
just wish I could have been there in person to receive

221
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,620
it, but... We've got

222
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,780
the award for you, so don't worry.

223
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,120
You will get it.

224
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,880
Yeah, handmade

225
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,640
by Susie the Flusie and

226
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,460
Pantiera,

227
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,740
Reverend Pantiera.

228
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,820
No doubt they used their hands,

229
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,080
yes.

230
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,020
At least that much, yes.

231
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,120
And when the

232
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,580
award

233
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,700
were displayed,

234
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,700
they were displayed by those two

235
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,760
who hung them on themselves

236
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,200
as if they were living

237
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
Christmas trees.

238
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,800
Nice.

239
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,220
It's true.

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,420
I'm not making it up. That's the

241
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,640
honest-to-God gospel truth

242
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,720
about what happened out there.

243
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,480
It was a great X-Day. My baptizing

244
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,440
hands are still glowing with the

245
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,340
holy power from

246
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,620
dunking those sinners

247
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,440
into the pool and washing

248
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
their sins off. Actually, what we try

249
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
to wash away is the concept of

250
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,380
sin. We don't care about their

251
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,300
sins. It's the idea that they might

252
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,480
feel guilty about something at all

253
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,660
that we're washing away.

254
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,260
That and the filth on their

255
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,680
bodies.

256
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,120
It's only real filthy

257
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,200
sinners need to worry about that. Certainly

258
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,280
no one who associates with us

259
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,400
at the secluded Brushwood

260
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,060
campground.

261
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,500
A lot of people are still

262
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,420
out there tonight.

263
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,500
We rushed back to make it to

264
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,720
this show. Barbaric punishments

265
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,320
being administered.

266
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,420
This show

267
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,220
important. You may be the first person in

268
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,360
the history of the world to have said that. Thank you.

269
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,200
I think he meant

270
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,720
important. Yes.

271
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,860
Um.

272
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,520
Important.

273
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,480
That too.

274
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,520
Why not both? That's what we say.

275
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,820
Important and in

276
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,020
poor, terrible

277
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,580
taint.

278
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,300
But not impotent.

279
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,240
Nor impotent.

280
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,100
Neither of those.

281
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,560
The potency of the church

282
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,020
hasn't died down, friends. Sure.

283
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,320
The exes didn't come.

284
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,900
We don't know what year this is.

285
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,240
We don't know what planet this is.

286
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,760
That just means we get to do it again next year.

287
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,660
And judging by

288
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,080
the beauties in the

289
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,260
baptismal pool this

290
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,240
year, it's just

291
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,260
it might as well have been on the escape

292
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,100
vessels of the sex goddesses.

293
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Truly. But let's hope they don't catch

294
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,400
on to that one so next year there

295
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,420
can be more of the same frolic

296
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,260
some antics. Well, we

297
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,400
you know, we don't ever since we quit allowing

298
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,540
cameras in the

299
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,460
naked baptismal

300
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,360
pool, which is an actual swimming

301
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,020
pool. This isn't some mud pit

302
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,460
or playpen that we fill up with

303
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,460
water. It's the campground has a

304
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,460
nice pool. We fill it

305
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,700
up with the

306
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,480
seekers and the saved

307
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,280
and we resave them.

308
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,620
And most

309
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,380
of them take their clothes off

310
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,020
before they save me.

311
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,340
It was chubby chaser

312
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,040
heaven, friends. Well, yes,

313
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,600
not only that, but

314
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,340
I was privileged to have a

315
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,420
conversation with one of

316
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,800
the loveliest pilgrims

317
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,940
out there while she

318
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,740
removed everything.

319
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,160
I was looking into her eyes.

320
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,260
That was very

321
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,480
gentle. Well, I didn't

322
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,240
want seafoods to come down on me

323
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,720
that. Yes,

324
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,240
right. That's a good idea.

325
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,340
But still, that was a devastating

326
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,360
experience for one who

327
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,980
has an essentially romantic soul

328
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,920
and just one of the many smorgasbord

329
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,040
of sensations

330
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,340
available to one who makes

331
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,360
the pilgrimage to travel for

332
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,420
the end of the world, which we are

333
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,220
now absolutely sure must

334
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,080
take place next

335
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,120
year. The Baker's Dozen

336
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
13,

337
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,000
the clock striking one

338
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,580
stroke past midnight

339
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,420
is surely the hour

340
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,160
that the exists come.

341
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,700
Not the eleventh

342
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,660
hour or the seventh

343
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,620
hour or any of those other puny

344
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,480
theories which have been apparently

345
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,600
discredited by

346
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,800
time. But, of course, there are those

347
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,620
who say that time is as full of holes

348
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,860
as cheesecloth, and it's all

349
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,700
the fault of people who are

350
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,660
astrally projecting without

351
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,920
looking where

352
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,580
they're going. However it is,

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,800
our own concept of what

354
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,320
year it is, what time it is,

355
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,740
and what ex-day it is, even

356
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,800
as Reverend Stang suggests, what planet

357
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,640
it is, may need

358
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,260
violent and immediate

359
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,860
restructuring.

360
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, 13 ex-day,

361
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,740
the lucky number, friends. This past

362
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,720
ex-day was 12 ex-day, and

363
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,040
I

364
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,640
wasn't terribly surprised

365
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,000
out there. Was

366
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,320
that really this morning?

367
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,620
7 o'clock this morning? It was. This

368
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,540
morning, the planet Earth escaped

369
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,780
an immolation by fire

370
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,440
predicted by Jesus

371
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,480
Christ, the Son of God, who sits on the

372
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,180
right hand by the celestial

373
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,360
throne. And I wonder if the word

374
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,120
omnipotent would

375
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,360
be appropriate in this context.

376
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,460
Omnipotent? Well, we know

377
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,320
the old Jehovah One

378
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,540
is needing a lot of patchwork

379
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,600
and bodywork,

380
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,340
filling in those dings.

381
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:34,740
Senile

382
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,300
space god, I thought, was the

383
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,680
way he was described.

384
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,340
Omnipotent. Right, yeah, that's a good

385
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,240
one. Yeah.

386
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,220
Now, I have a theory. New vocabulary word

387
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,320
there, kids. I'm

388
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,240
sure Ragnar has already taken it down,

389
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,340
but he has a theory. Omnipotent, yes.

390
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,260
Or omnipotent. But

391
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,120
I have a theory why the exes

392
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,280
don't come. It's because too many of

393
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,120
us have too many places listed

394
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,220
on our do-not-destroy list.

395
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,980
Huh. Well, those are just

396
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,720
special exceptions that

397
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,320
surely don't really get in the way

398
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,540
of the operation, but that's a novel

399
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,260
theory. What's your

400
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,300
thought on that, Stang? Well, I

401
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,960
do have a pretty long list of

402
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,340
Earth places that I was

403
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,320
going to say. Yes, everyone knows about

404
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,340
all those museums that you have

405
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,540
your deep down. Right, sure. But

406
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,100
that's just a tiny fraction of the

407
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,180
I was going to, most

408
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,140
of New York City, most of all

409
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,120
big cities and everything in between would be

410
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,120
scoured of

411
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,280
pinkness. Well, isn't it the pre-release?

412
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,080
Is it prerogative of a conqueror just to

413
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,020
scoop these treasures up because

414
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,060
you can? The way Newt Gingrich

415
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,040
marched into the Smithsonian and took

416
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,820
their Tyrannosaurus head? Or

417
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,840
the way

418
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,140
many other tyrants throughout history?

419
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,860
The Nazis. Hermann Goering, who was

420
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,880
the cuddliest, chubbiest,

421
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,960
most lovable head of the Gestapo

422
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,240
you'd ever meet, took lots and lots

423
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,900
of people's art

424
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,260
because he could.

425
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,200
One of the world's great art corrections.

426
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,100
Careful about mentioning Hermann

427
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,160
Goering on this program. We might get a call from Bernie.

428
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,760
Oh, he's a Goering

429
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,140
fan or controversy list

430
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,020
or something? Well, no,

431
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,260
but Robert Byrd, the senator from West Virginia

432
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,620
is.

433
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,040
Well, he

434
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,080
talks of Goering then constantly.

435
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,180
He should get over it. That was years

436
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,140
ago. Yeah, really.

437
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,240
For real. You know, and Goering

438
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,360
himself cheated the

439
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,120
hangman with his special

440
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,900
sealed ampule of

441
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,980
cyanide, which some

442
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,020
people would slip to him by one of our

443
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,920
guys. I don't know if you've been

444
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,820
following the latest to-do about

445
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,860
World War II, but it seems like

446
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,520
it might have been an inside job.

447
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,000
Cyanide? I didn't

448
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,640
know that. I hadn't heard anything. Because

449
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,720
Goering actually was a lovable

450
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,500
guy. I mean,

451
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,940
he was hideous, evil, and so on,

452
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,000
but he had the ability to make

453
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,820
people like him, and that's how he got into

454
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,900
power, and he wasn't interested really

455
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,800
in the politics. He

456
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,600
knew Jewish people who he personally

457
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,740
saved, even while he allowed all

458
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,760
the others to be destroyed, and he

459
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,500
had one of the greatest electric train

460
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,440
collections ever.

461
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,720
His warm, cuddly nature was the very reason

462
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
he was allowed in the bunker in the last days of

463
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,680
Nazi Berlin. Well, he was not

464
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,360
allowed in the bunker after he

465
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
misunderstood the Fuhrer order, which

466
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,480
Bormann distorted,

467
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,680
suggesting that he succeed Hitler

468
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,320
if the reactionary

469
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,200
masses and Russian

470
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,720
communists and Jewish plutocrats had taken

471
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,580
over the bunker, then Goering automatically...

472
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,700
became the supreme head of the

473
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,720
state, but when Hitler saw

474
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,460
this, he thought in his paranoid

475
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,560
drug-induced rage that

476
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,400
all the... Hermann was

477
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,800
pulling a fast

478
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,500
one. Was Goerbels in the bunker?

479
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,420
Goerbels, of course, was in the bunker.

480
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,640
I was confused, I was too. Poisoning his

481
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,680
children and otherwise serving the state

482
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,100
right to the very end.

483
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
But Bormann

484
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,640
always wanted to get at Goering. This is

485
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,600
the way everyone always was trying to

486
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,580
stab or slice each other just to get them.

487
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,420
To get the Fuhrer's favor. And so

488
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,460
he spun it as

489
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,660
though Goering was

490
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,340
laughing at Hitler and taking

491
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,500
over the state. So Hitler stripped him of

492
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,340
all his offices, each

493
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,480
one for which he had an elaborate

494
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,260
uniform designed specially

495
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,400
for him, covered with tassels and medals.

496
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,480
And the most elaborate of all these

497
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,420
was his Falcon Master

498
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,400
of the Reich uniform

499
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,300
where he had little lederhosen and

500
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,400
a Tyrolean hat with a feather and

501
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,420
all this stuff as the head

502
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,200
of all falconry in the Third Reich.

503
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,440
And Hitler said, and he is even

504
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,400
stripped of his Falcon Master

505
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
title. That fat

506
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,300
drug addict will sludge no more

507
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,700
falcons into the sky.

508
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,360
Aye, the Fuhrer demands.

509
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,940
Look at the way how flings his arms around.

510
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,880
To get the right

511
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,360
Hitler thing you have to fling your arms around.

512
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,280
What drugs

513
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,320
were Hitler on?

514
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,200
Well, they would swab

515
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,540
the nostrils of the Fuhrer with cocaine

516
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,220
sometimes while he was asleep.

517
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,080
Just to bring him around because

518
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,180
it took a lot to bring him around because he had

519
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,360
this doctor who's been called a

520
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
quack, Dr. Morell,

521
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,620
who gave him all these

522
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,060
monkey gland injections and

523
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,100
other things and huge loads of

524
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,160
amphetamines and drugs

525
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,500
like that which, you know, the modern

526
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,440
understanding of them didn't

527
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,340
exist. They were commonly given to

528
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,100
pilots. It was considered a military

529
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,260
thing to do it and if

530
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,260
the German superior soldier

531
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,300
could do it, then the supreme soldier

532
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,300
could do proportionately that much

533
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,000
more. And that is what

534
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,160
kept his mustache shiny and

535
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,500
glossy and twitching.

536
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,180
JFK

537
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,500
was given injections of amphetamine.

538
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,160
Yeah, he would ask for it

539
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,060
because, you know,

540
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,940
you're the guy in charge.

541
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,220
You can't nod off in your rocking

542
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,240
chair. You've got to be crisp

543
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,300
and frosty. That calls for another one of these

544
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,480
jolt caffeine energy mints.

545
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,140
Give me two.

546
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,260
Say, I hope lonesome

547
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,400
cowboy Dave manages to make it down

548
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,560
to this studio for this historic

549
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,460
bobcast. We're expecting

550
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,500
him to make it in by wire.

551
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,820
Wire?

552
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,880
He's going to be calling.

553
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,340
Any minute now.

554
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,360
Dave did

555
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,180
make it to X Day and

556
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,520
verbally jammed

557
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,580
with us and helped with the auction.

558
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,220
He did. The bulldada auction

559
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,020
which was fabulously successful

560
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,420
this year. Right on our brushwood stage

561
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,220
while they were bidding for everything.

562
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,580
Friends, we have auctioned

563
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,480
off things like a dollar.

564
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,260
A plain, ordinary

565
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,400
dollar for like $20.

566
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,320
And don't forget the year we

567
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,360
auctioned off Wellman's front

568
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,520
teeth. The front teeth of puzzling

569
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
evidence in itself. The

570
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,060
teeth past which the wind

571
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,400
of so many strange statements

572
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,560
about Guam

573
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,500
have passed over the airwaves

574
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,040
on beautiful KPFA,

575
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,400
our sister

576
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,220
weirdo station.

577
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:05,740
There's quite enough

578
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,420
on those teeth too.

579
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,540
G Gordon Gordon auctioned

580
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,240
off the septum of his

581
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,060
nose which had been removed

582
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,020
and replaced. A hideous

583
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,340
loathsome sight. Which was

584
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,180
the subject of a velvet painting by

585
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,780
Lies.

586
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,240
Yeah, which was painted on black

587
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
velvet. This horrible chunk

588
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,220
of nasal septum which fell out

589
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,800
because of too much

590
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,620
overindulgence and certain

591
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,400
stimulants. I wonder

592
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,320
if next year I should auction off my house

593
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,240
at the Bulldada auction.

594
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
It would be rather

595
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,260
awkward, a bit of a pain to have it

596
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,220
transported all the way out there, eh?

597
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,460
What?

598
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,320
Well, no. We'd have to have an open

599
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,620
house right there on the

600
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,260
stage. They'd have to inspect it or

601
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,240
you'd have to pay for flights so that they could

602
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,200
come and troop through your living room

603
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,160
and kick over your loose under

604
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,400
drawers. I don't know, I think

605
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,380
you could always shoot a

606
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,380
video record of the interior of the

607
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,280
place. You won't need a house next

608
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,580
year. That's right, you'll be cradled

609
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,440
in arms of the sex

610
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,540
goddesses aboard those giant saucers.

611
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,060
That's right. It's a lucky number, man.

612
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,400
13, X day. And that's right.

613
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,420
Next year I'm coming to X day

614
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,000
house or no house.

615
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,540
Our faith remains unshaken.

616
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,380
Our houses may have

617
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,980
been destroyed by earthquakes, but

618
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,380
our faith is solid as

619
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,020
a rock.

620
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,300
Yes. Or a bed of

621
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,860
quicksand.

622
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,440
We'll be right back.

623
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:44,440


624
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,020
Bob? Bob? Bob?

625
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,580
Bob? Bob? Bob?

626
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


627
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


628
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


629
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


630
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,080
And welcome to the program.

631
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,340
Is this synesthesia?

632
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,520
This is synesthesia.

633
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,680
I was just wondering, I missed a part

634
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,840
about the neo-rosicrucian orbs that were

635
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,080
circling in the encampment.

636
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,140
It wasn't exactly a circle,

637
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,440
it was more of an ellipse.

638
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,940
Those did cause some confusion. Every year

639
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,900
these other

640
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,880
unidentified alien

641
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,940
craft or whatever

642
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,780
they are, swamp lightning,

643
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,000
whatever, show up. Did you see the

644
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,540
X's in the sky once again?

645
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,720
I missed that, but we did have the

646
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,160
chemtrail X's in the sky over

647
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,820
Brushwood on another X day.

648
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,560
It's almost as if they're deliberately

649
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,520
tormenting, teasing us.

650
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,920
I even saw the cadaver Bob

651
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,880
with the X's on his eyes.

652
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,080
Oh, somebody took the

653
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,020
pennies. Boy, you can't trust

654
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,760
anyone. One year

655
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,840
we spent them. In order to attract

656
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,000
the X's, we had

657
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
everyone at the campground pull down their

658
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,480
pants. We set them up in a

659
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,980
to spell out the name Bob.

660
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,960
And had them all

661
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,100
pull their pants down and bend over

662
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,120
so that their behinds

663
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,980
were facing upwards at the

664
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,980
sky, spelling out Bob in

665
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,920
buttocks, including the quotes around his

666
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,140
name. Dr. Howell had painted each

667
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,960
buttock a very nice, like, plump

668
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
like with shading and stuff, and it was really cool.

669
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,140
Not this year, although I, oh well.

670
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,860
Unfortunately,

671
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,060
we didn't have a camera up high enough

672
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,000
to prove that we were spelling out

673
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,120
Bob in butts.

674
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,780
Oh, don't worry, Google had a

675
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,780
satellite watching us anyway.

676
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,000
Not at that time.

677
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,000
This is before they had invented Google Earth.

678
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,960
In fact, Earth itself had

679
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,900
possibly not been invented. We may still

680
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,060
have been on Mars then. We still don't know.

681
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,160
Yeah, no hot air balloon

682
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,880
that year to get a picture from.

683
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,140
No camera on a balloon.

684
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,160
Hey, you know who was one of the

685
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,100
first aeronauts?

686
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,360
That was George Armstrong Custer.

687
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,160
He used to go up in a balloon.

688
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,400
Custer was a hot air balloon rider?

689
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,160
That's right. He was at first

690
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,020
terrified and he thought the basket

691
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,500
was way too small, but he got

692
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,160
good at it and enjoyed it.

693
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,980
For a spotter during the war between

694
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,780
the states, that balloon would go up and nobody

695
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,020
would shoot at it either. You could see the

696
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,040
Shenandoah Valley for miles

697
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,660
in all directions.

698
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,760
And that was how Custer escaped

699
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,940
Little Bighorn. This is a little known fact.

700
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,180
But then he was...

701
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,980
The storm came and he was wafted away

702
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,620
to a mysterious island

703
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,640
where he lived in a

704
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,760
cliff cave with an orangutan.

705
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,800
Until finally he died of

706
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,840
madness and starvation and the

707
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,420
orang skipped town.

708
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,080
Yeah, he deserved it. He was a

709
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,020
jerk. But for a while he thought

710
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,880
everything he touched

711
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,100
would turn to gold.

712
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,940
He was a great hero

713
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,560
of the Civil War.

714
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,740
He was, interestingly enough, last

715
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,640
in his graduating class at

716
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
West Point, but most of

717
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,060
the interesting soldiers of that period

718
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,960
actually were the last

719
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,260
in academic standing

720
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,100
who could just get by and not be

721
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,220
cashiered.

722
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,720
A very tough, tough crowd. This person

723
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,680
was always known as the goat at

724
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,020
West Point. And Custer was the goat.

725
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,440
Why a goat?

726
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,520
I've never understood.

727
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,740
But that question has been asked.

728
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,800
Why is the last to pass

729
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,560
in West Point called the goat?

730
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,240
And modern West Point is trying to

731
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,880
get rid of that tradition,

732
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,780
discouraging the whole goat thing.

733
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,820
Still, everybody knows who it is.

734
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,480
And when that person crosses the stage

735
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,180
to graduate, there's always applause.

736
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,240
And the goat is considered to be

737
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,380
lucky for the school, too.

738
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,240
It's all part of their ancient tradition.

739
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:30,960
It's a tradition.

740
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,100
It's like what Dave is.

741
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,640
So Dave is the goat at X-Day.

742
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,960
The X-Day goat. Well, at least he's not

743
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,040
the bellwether ram who leads

744
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,960
the bleating sheep into the mechanical

745
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,600
jaws of slashing death.

746
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,040
I've seen goats at county fairs that actually

747
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,140
fart into balloons

748
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,980
and things and blow them up for the children.

749
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,020
They actually do blow balloons up

750
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,020
with their own breath

751
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,140
and stuff. But I was just going to remind you

752
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,900
that Custer did have his ears

753
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,360
removed by many of the, um,

754
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,920
well, he was maimed only in the

755
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,220
ears because he didn't listen.

756
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,460
They did not remove his ears, actually.

757
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,900
What you're thinking of is that the

758
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,680
women took awls, long

759
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,000
awls, and drove them into his ears

760
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,500
because he just never listened.

761
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,880
If he had only listened to what they

762
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,820
said, he would not have been

763
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,100
in this pass, you know.

764
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,760
They did not mutilate his body, although they

765
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,560
mutilated just about everybody else.

766
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,540
Actually,

767
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,920
I have heard very

768
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,320
different stories from my Lakota

769
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,040
friends. Wonderful. I'd love to know

770
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,720
what they are.

771
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,020
These are all only from accounts of people

772
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,820
who were on the scene, and they did tell

773
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,200
different stories. Right.

774
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,800
How about the awl thing? Did that happen?

775
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,880
I never even heard of that.

776
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,800
However, I was

777
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,840
involved with

778
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,360
the Lakota Medicine

779
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,060
Men's Association. Yes, you see

780
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,760
we in the Church of the Subgenius

781
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,380
must often consult with our

782
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,780
brother sorcerers and magicians,

783
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,820
and so happens you do have that

784
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,580
native

785
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,760
bond. I was informed

786
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,980
by somebody I had

787
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,120
perfect no reason to distrust

788
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,400
that in fact

789
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,980
the Lakota mutilated

790
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,320
the hell out of Custer's

791
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,200
body, and

792
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,000
that his regenerative

793
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,180
organs were still in the possession

794
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,100
of the

795
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,060
have been passed down from hand to

796
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,900
hand, so to speak. That happened to almost

797
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,840
all the men, but I had heard that it

798
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,720
didn't work. They say that, yeah,

799
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,920
Custer was, they had respect

800
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,940
for him as a warrior, and so they didn't do that.

801
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,280
Well, that's a bunch of hooey.

802
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,880
Supposedly they arranged it.

803
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,840
Who are you going to believe?

804
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,060
The BIA Indian school, or the Indian?

805
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,880
Yeah, the Indians themselves have

806
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,980
their own tradition. Another thing I read

807
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,720
was that they arranged a dead guy

808
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,180
with his butt sticking up

809
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,900
to the sky, and then filled it with a thousand

810
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,740
arrows, you know, so it was like a pistol.

811
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,600
They left that as a mark

812
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,920
for the whites who were going to come and find

813
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,700
this battle scene. They were a little

814
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,000
angry at the time. They had a right

815
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,180
to be, because the entire thing

816
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,740
followed the Ouachita

817
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,000
River Massacre, which

818
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,860
was sort of like in Vietnam

819
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,840
when they burned the animals.

820
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,260
Yes. The same technique.

821
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,020
Actually, that's

822
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,960
a bunch of hooey. That is a bunch of hooey.

823
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,860
Extinctified so many

824
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,840
species on this continent, it would

825
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,980
make you sick. They were in

826
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,700
the business of killing off the

827
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,860
local animals too, but a lot

828
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,960
slower, and with a lot less

829
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,060
efficiency. Well, but the animals

830
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,760
in the New World had not evolved

831
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,020
around people, so you could

832
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,180
practically walk up to a North American

833
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,100
moose and knock it on the head with a

834
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,940
tomahawk. Not just mooses,

835
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,760
or beasts, as we call them. Indians did have dogs, though.

836
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,740
They did have them extricated. The local elephant

837
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,820
was killed, and

838
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,980
the American horse, as we were talking

839
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,580
about on the way back from

840
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,080
Ex Day, was exterminated

841
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,960
by the native population for

842
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,840
food, and never

843
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,980
was developed as a draft

844
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,980
animal, or used as one, until

845
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,060
the Europeans reintroduced it.

846
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Which they did

847
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,580
with great speed.

848
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,760
Which many people don't know,

849
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,100
the cultures blended very quickly,

850
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,820
and the Indians were doing

851
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,380
pretty well until some,

852
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,960
they were over, I even heard

853
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,580
tales of Indians

854
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,000
making their own weapons, rather than

855
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,840
the idea of weapons,

856
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,080
weapons chauvinism that we

857
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,020
have now and stuff. Sure, they made their

858
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,160
own weapons, they were very well specialized

859
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,940
things too.

860
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,880
Their own guns, I mean. They said,

861
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,800
hey, well, we can do that too, and used

862
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,940
their arch of

863
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,960
metallurgy, which were not quite

864
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,560
as advanced, but still

865
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,020
quite nice.

866
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,720
Well, as far as I know, they didn't make

867
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,000
guns, which takes a factory,

868
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,820
but they did make their own

869
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,920
ammunition, and did know all about that,

870
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,660
and were in possession of ammunition

871
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,480
molds that they had captured, and

872
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,700
Custer and his men

873
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,520
found a whole bunch in the

874
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
deserted village

875
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,580
that they attacked.

876
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,540
They would find all the treasures of the Indians

877
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,860
and set them on fire, and shoot their horses.

878
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,180
Clearly they needed more ammunition.

879
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,960
And this is all just a metaphor

880
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,620
for what's going to happen

881
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,900
when the true X-Day comes.

882
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm afraid so. Did the conspiracy think

883
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,860
it couldn't happen to them? It's just that

884
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,480
the space cavalry is

885
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,040
just as ruthless in its own way, and it's

886
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,020
a strong desire to clean out

887
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,880
the riff-raff so they can set up

888
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
what they've always wanted to have here.

889
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,020
Well, I did hear them blow charges

890
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,100
last night, but so far

891
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,860
I think we're still in the same dream that it

892
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,860
really happened, but we keep

893
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,160
going back there because we don't

894
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,080
think it happened, and so, you know,

895
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,720
every day we've been aboard the vessel

896
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,640
doing what we wanted to do.

897
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,200
Right, but our imagination is so limited

898
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
that our escape

899
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,100
vessel looks just like our grimy

900
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,060
apartment on Earth. And not only

901
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,000
that, it was a great trauma when the

902
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,760
Earth was destroyed. We

903
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,900
were all part of the Earth, and this

904
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,900
elaborate construction that we

905
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,860
actually comfortably live in

906
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,600
protects us from the

907
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,840
eternal sorrow we would otherwise

908
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,980
feel at the fate of

909
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,560
the old place, even though we ourselves

910
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,740
were canny enough to

911
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,180
escape the fate that befell

912
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,480
the helpless millions.

913
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,760
Imagine the eons of re-education

914
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,940
we had to endure. And we thought it

915
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,920
was perhaps maybe two, three, four

916
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,020
years since the last extaeon. It had been

917
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,140
millennium, millenniae.

918
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,880
No wonder we had to flee

919
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,060
to frivolous amusements to

920
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,720
console ourselves.

921
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,540
And it all became part of one fabric,

922
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,140
these frivolous amusements and constant

923
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,380
unending re-education.

924
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,660
You can view the

925
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,820
frivolous amusement tapestry

926
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,980
by invitation

927
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,220
at, uh,

928
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,700
well, I guess, you know, it's radio,

929
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,360
we can't, uh, anyway.

930
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,580
Oh, but look at some of the wonderful pieces

931
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,760
hanging below it that look like little pieces

932
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,360
of angel pubic hairs.

933
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,640
I think they are, because the

934
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,880
winged messengers of God tend to fly

935
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,040
so close to these pictures just so

936
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,940
they can see the fine detail

937
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,860
which is, uh, exceptionally

938
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,940
fine when you consider the

939
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,940
sensory, uh,

940
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,540
array that an angel possesses.

941
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,660
Quite, quite remarkable.

942
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,100
The entire spectrographic

943
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,840
array appears to be

944
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,680
emanating from the bottom there.

945
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,040
Well, they can see a huge range

946
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,220
of vision and even the devils

947
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,060
in hell can see

948
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,180
a great deal of hell.

949
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,460
As Milton says,

950
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,780
once as angels ken,

951
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,520
meaning the fallen Satan,

952
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,800
he views the dismal situation

953
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,240
waste and wild.

954
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,840
So he sees more of it than you would

955
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,960
if you were plopped down into it, which is

956
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,420
is just, uh,

957
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,760
all the more saddening and irritating

958
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,420
because the next stanzas describe

959
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,320
how awful the place is.

960
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,700
But of course, Earth, uh,

961
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,060
that was just a dream, wasn't it?

962
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,960
Yeah, yeah. I was gonna ask,

963
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,760
uh, do we know this, uh, material

964
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,620
about angels and demons from

965
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,100
fossils or from Swedenborg?

966
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,820
I thought they came from, uh,

967
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,760
mimeographed or xeroxed

968
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,780
sheets which were included

969
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,380
with the subgenius registration

970
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,960
packet. Oh, that's right.

971
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,140
We never actually got to that matter

972
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,080
on the docket, uh, this year.

973
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,080
The one gene, remember the one gene

974
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,720
that got thrown on Goddammerung?

975
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,980
The one, the crazy guy

976
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,140
that you said kept on accusing you of being a, um,

977
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,720
a Hungarian or something?

978
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,160
You mean Ragnar Rockenvold?

979
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,800
It's something similar to that, but yeah,

980
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,640
it's a sort of a low-key

981
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,740
entertainment, but boy was I Thor.

982
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,920
That's what Thor, yeah,

983
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,600
that, yeah, at least feeling very Thor.

984
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,580
Kind of, uh, a ridiculous

985
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,880
story, uh, balderlized

986
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,160
than one might expect. Speaking of, uh,

987
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,640
Ragnarok, this is WCSB Cleveland,

988
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,200
and if you want to get on the, uh,

989
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,860
air to, uh, say something

990
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,840
real quick, uh, you can call Bob. We got a

991
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,540
taker right here.

992
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,300
...gelly-like fluidy

993
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,820
orbs and rosicrucian...

994
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,060
Oh, uh, thank you.

995
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,120
...chicken down.

996
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,860
Morse code.

997
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,160
Are they speaking morse code now again?

998
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,780
Yeah, but all they said was...

999
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,220
That's the sound of their

1000
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,480
That's one dash.

1001
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,440
...buttonism.

1002
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,420
They're enduring, uh, some sort of, uh,

1003
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,280
genital, uh,

1004
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,080
rearrangement. Uh, LonesomeCowboyDave,

1005
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,380
where

1006
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,080
are you? What is it that you're looking

1007
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,940
at right now? I'm

1008
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,120
looking at, um, at some sort

1009
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,980
of bowl, and there's a glowing

1010
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,000
orb inside it. It's not like

1011
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,500
the jelly consomme, neo-rosicrucian

1012
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
orbs. Oh, yeah?

1013
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,040
Well, it's not like them, but I guess

1014
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,660
maybe it is kind of a copy.

1015
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,780
And if I look over here

1016
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,960
to the left a little bit, I can see it's

1017
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,580
shooting out little, little tiny

1018
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,280
yellow filaments of white.

1019
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,880
Wow. The rosicrucians tend to do things

1020
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,460
that are rather sub-rosa, don't they?

1021
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,600
Well, they don't. Off the cuff, as it were.

1022
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,780
Are you sure that's not your, your, uh,

1023
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,120
lucky, uh, eight ball?

1024
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,760
Yeah.

1025
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,820
I prepared your canoe with cedar

1026
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,080
boughs.

1027
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
It's time for you to leave now,

1028
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,300
William Blake.

1029
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,300
Time for you to go back to where

1030
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,900
you came from.

1031
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,020
You mean Cleveland?

1032
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,440
Back to the place where all the

1033
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,420
spirits came from.

1034
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,740
And where all the spirits

1035
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,120
return.

1036
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,060
I'm sure you've heard

1037
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,060


1038
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,100
this before.

1039
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,360
This world will no longer concern you.

1040
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,780
Hello, you're on the air.

1041
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,560
That thing is...

1042
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,200
Hey, the SELSA's coming up, huh?

1043
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,480
What's coming up?

1044
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,760
I got a tortilla chip calling up here.

1045
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,680
What's coming up?

1046
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,740
The SELSA you were talking about earlier?

1047
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,660
Yes, that is coming in a wave

1048
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,780
to inundate us all in, uh,

1049
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,480
mild, spicy, and

1050
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:02,960
hot.

1051
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,780
Oh, yeah, it's kind of like the tortilla chip of the show, you know?

1052
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,720
A tsunami of, uh,

1053
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,560
red sauce shall pour upon

1054
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,060
our terrestrial tortilla.

1055
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,300
Well, I'd love to witness

1056
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,180
Cleveland undergoing one of those

1057
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,780
once-in-an-eon Great Lakes, um,

1058
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,160
tidal things.

1059
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,320
Well, it feels like we were spared

1060
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,600
this year, but of course we've been saying we

1061
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,620
don't know whether that really happened

1062
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,740
or not, and our listeners may have to

1063
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,680
make up their own, quote, minds,

1064
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,760
unquote. Me being a listener? I got my own

1065
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,780
opinion. Oh, yeah, well, good for you,

1066
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,720
buddy. I'm glad. It's people like

1067
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,640
you who make me satisfied that we've

1068
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,600
got a future. Who's gonna fight the next war?

1069
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,720
Uh, put her there, pal. Yeah, who's the next

1070
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,600
hero? I was thinking about fighting you, not at

1071
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,640
war, man. Oh, yeah?

1072
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,880
Do you want to do it?

1073
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,820
Do you want to do it? Yep, yep. His parents

1074
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
were monsters. I don't mean that in a mean

1075
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,380
sociographic way. That's all right.

1076
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,520
I mean, they were on feet for the feet. One was a werewolf.

1077
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,660
One was a werewolf.

1078
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,580
R.C., don't even bother saying your prayers. You're already gone.

1079
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
And the fell witch of Glokheron, whose long

1080
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,980
strong hair hung down over her

1081
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,700
jagged teeth and pendulous

1082
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,620
breasts. He puts cadavers in the wagon.

1083
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,840
Cannot stand up against this mighty

1084
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,740
juggernaut here. Excuse me, I didn't

1085
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,600
realize you were in the

1086
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,180
studio. Is my countenance

1087
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,600
crimson? Are we going to be planting

1088
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,620
any cadavers along with us when we

1089
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,020
take the rest of the wagon? Well, that's up to you.

1090
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,740
Pardon? That's up to

1091
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,720
you if you want to plant cadavers

1092
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,640
That corpse you planted

1093
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,500
in your garden, has he yet began

1094
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,720
to sprout? Make sure that friend

1095
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,680
to man, the dog, does not dig

1096
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,000
him up again with his nails.

1097
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,460
Or good lord, Tion Grandma. We'll be launching a

1098
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,560
space shuttle from Cape Cadaveral.

1099
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,640
Hey, we've been kind of out of touch

1100
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,740
with events in space. Was the moon

1101
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,660
bombarded during this last

1102
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,500
epicycle? Well,

1103
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,500
this X-Day was quite lunar as

1104
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,460
the size of the moon was enormous in

1105
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,480
Shermansville. Sure, but I'm talking about

1106
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,300
NASA's plan to smack

1107
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,660
the lunar ice into space

1108
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,080
so it can get spectrographically

1109
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,580
analogized

1110
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,040
by orbiting space.

1111
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,440
I didn't hear about that. Wow, me neither.

1112
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,620
They were going to blow a chunk off the moon so they

1113
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,600
could get a kind of a good look at it. Incredible violence

1114
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,740
has been done or is about to

1115
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,500
be done to our satellite

1116
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,660
by NASA. You see, they want

1117
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,600
to find the water that is supposedly

1118
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,780
on the moon, but the only way they can find it is by

1119
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,440
blasting it into space

1120
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,840
high enough so that it can be spectrographically

1121
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,680
analyzed. You know, in honor of our

1122
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,240
Independence Day, I want to show my

1123
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,740
true patriotism by demanding that

1124
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,620
NASA launch a series of nuclear

1125
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,620
missiles onto the moon

1126
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,260
such that the

1127
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,480
face of the moon will say, America

1128
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,740
F yeah. Why not just

1129
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,340
a first strike for an ancient

1130
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,280
case? There

1131
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,660
may be a war on the moon at some day

1132
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,560
in the future and we don't even know if there

1133
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,440
are lunar beings who

1134
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,320
could pose some capable

1135
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,780
threat to us. Well, they're not threatening

1136
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,720
us. They are... But they're

1137
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,140
flying on the Earth. They could. They could and

1138
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,220
very often their leaders are very despotic.

1139
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,620
No, you see, we project our behavior on them. I'm not afraid

1140
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,780
of... I'm not afraid of the... The lunarites.

1141
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,980
The selenites are no... No, not a threat to them,

1142
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,600
are you? They are obviously an enlightened

1143
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,680
race because they had the good sense

1144
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,260
to get off Earth millions of years ago.

1145
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,460
Well, I suppose you guys aren't afraid of Martians

1146
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,600
either unless maybe one or two or three of you

1147
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,480
in that studio there are Martians. Oh, those bone-dead, dry monsters

1148
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,120
from another world will

1149
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,360
never affect me. Now, on

1150
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,040
the other hand, the horrible, squishy,

1151
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,020
incredibly super hot

1152
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,580
Venusians are a different matter.

1153
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,940
Hey, watch your lip, buddy. We're not incredibly

1154
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,660
horribly sausagey. It all depends

1155
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,580
on your point of view and, uh,

1156
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,700
just to be near a body that's

1157
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,460
so radiant that it can roast

1158
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,600
you and... And I have to say,

1159
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,620
most of you guys are clumsy and, uh,

1160
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,880
you don't understand that humans

1161
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,820
exist in a delicate

1162
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,180
range of life

1163
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,020
that you can't suddenly be

1164
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,740
broiled and barbecued because

1165
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,580
one of you guys forgets to

1166
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,820
zip up his uniform.

1167
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,520
Well, the uniform's like

1168
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,120
And if you think I'm gonna live in a neighborhood

1169
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,500
after all the time I've lived on this Earth and have

1170
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,620
the nukes moving in next to me,

1171
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,440
you've got another think

1172
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,680
coming with that supplementary brain

1173
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,520
of yours. And I don't mean any offense.

1174
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,720
Don't you hate when the nuclear family moves

1175
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,960
in right next door to you?

1176
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,860
Well, as long as I have my own, uh,

1177
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,560
uh, detector, I'll

1178
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,780
feel a little bit better.

1179
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,500
One proton, one neutron, one

1180
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,360
electron, some orbits

1181
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,600
going on. Yes. And then two kids

1182
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,620
and a car of some kind.

1183
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,700
Forty acres and a mule.

1184
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,600
Maybe next year we should launch one of those nuclear missiles

1185
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,720
at Jupiter in honor of, like,

1186
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,560
2010 and just

1187
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,380
turn it into, like, a mini sun.

1188
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,060
No, that was a bad, uh,

1189
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,340
science fiction movie,

1190
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,680
Roknar. It would not be a good idea

1191
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,640
to have another sun in our solar

1192
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,680
system. I thought this had been firmly

1193
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,120
decided. Um,

1194
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,320
the one we have is quite sufficient

1195
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,620
and our position as an inner solid

1196
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,620
planet would not be improved by being

1197
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,680
between two suns.

1198
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,520
So you'd never get any sleep?

1199
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,500
No, it would never be dark.

1200
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,820
It would never be night. I suspect

1201
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,740
the motives of anyone

1202
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,020
who suggested this.

1203
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,860
Sun going up, sun going down.

1204
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,540
It was a dark morning. It was a gray morning.

1205
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,480
There was no morning. There was nothing like that.

1206
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,920
It was eternal noon.

1207
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,020
Noon lay heavy on flower and tree.

1208
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,640
They would sure cut

1209
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,460
down on vampirism, though.

1210
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,420
Oh, it would be, uh, coitins for them.

1211
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,720
Just coitins. At least on one.

1212
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,080
That is the...

1213
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,480
There's always the, uh, no, there's no way you could

1214
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,620
escape except maybe in those, uh, lunar

1215
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,680
craters where the ice, uh,

1216
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,680
was or is or

1217
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,740
used to be before we blasted it, uh,

1218
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,320
out to see if it was there.

1219
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,760
That's, we'll find out too late that that

1220
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,200
was the temple of the grand lunar.

1221
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,880
The only ice. I don't see why they have

1222
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,080
to destroy the ice

1223
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,980
they're looking for.

1224
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,500
The archives of the civilization that had

1225
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,180
grown on the moon were

1226
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,660
right in that spot that we blew

1227
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,980
through, uh, past through their books. You know, there is...

1228
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,240
It sounds goofy to say it, but the

1229
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,740
idea that there might be lunar vegetation

1230
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,340
or even lunar life,

1231
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,660
something like that described by H.G.

1232
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,720
Wells, is not too far off.

1233
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,640
I have a very interesting British

1234
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,680
book written by a very

1235
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,620
learned astronomer called The Strange

1236
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,800
World of the Moon. No, it's not

1237
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,620
Schwa, although we did

1238
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,220
offer Schwa's book, uh,

1239
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,500
at our Bulldada auction,

1240
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,540
and it was snapped right up

1241
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,320
as a shark snaps of a tooth. A clavicle.

1242
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,720
Eleven ducks. Eleven ducks?

1243
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,580
But, uh, are you talking about

1244
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,980
underground, um,

1245
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,580
lunar... Yes, he's talking about underground life

1246
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,640
and he shows how it could be so

1247
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,480
and how the, the, uh,

1248
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,720
underground wind caused by

1249
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,700
the heat of the outside would blow through

1250
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,500
it and so on. And interestingly enough,

1251
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,720
recently it was discovered that the moon is hollow.

1252
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,680
When it was hit, it

1253
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,800
rang like a bell.

1254
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,660
It's not solid like the Earth is.

1255
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,820
The moon is very light. No one can hear your bell ring.

1256
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,580
And, uh, does not, uh,

1257
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,540
it's not volcanic at all.

1258
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,900
The moon is completely, uh,

1259
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,460
non-tectonic. Um,

1260
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,380
but of course, constantly

1261
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,740
being whacked and banged by everything that comes

1262
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,580
along is enough for

1263
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,480
geological change. And its orbital

1264
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,680
movement itself is enough to keep it

1265
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,960
going just like Tekel Brahe knows.

1266
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,400
The Earth also cracks the

1267
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,680
lunar regolith, just as

1268
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,220
in a far greater way the

1269
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,500
moons of Saturn, like

1270
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,620
Enceladus or the Jovian moons,

1271
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,560
are tremendously stressed by the

1272
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,740
gigantic, uh, tidal drag.

1273
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,140
But the moon is small.

1274
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,680
If you took the disk of the moon

1275
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,640
as seen from the Earth and put it as

1276
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,720
a flat disk on the Earth, it would

1277
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,820
just about, but not quite,

1278
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,260
uh, cover the, uh,

1279
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,580
North American continent. That's

1280
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,680
the size, uh, if you can,

1281
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,540
uh, consider.

1282
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,680
Well, and people call you a kook

1283
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,500
if you point out the obvious fact

1284
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
that the moon is just the skull

1285
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,700
of a gigantic space monster

1286
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,480
that once threatened the Earth.

1287
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,520
I remember after...

1288
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,420
A comic book.

1289
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,560
One of the comics that

1290
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,660
we were discussing had the idea that

1291
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,700
the moon was a giant egg of some

1292
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,180
incubating creature.

1293
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,360
And of course it hatches in

1294
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,680
the comic, uh, I think

1295
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,320
it was a Jack Kirby, uh, comic.

1296
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,420
Well, no, no, this goes back to the

1297
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,500
ancients, the idea of the cosmos being

1298
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,800
an egg. This is almost Aristotelian.

1299
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,480
Yeah, that's

1300
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,520
true. Or Salvador Dali, who

1301
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,400
drew that egg, uh, in

1302
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,340
its first moment of hatching. Also,

1303
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,600
a drop of blood to show that

1304
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,920
with birth, there is pain.

1305
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,580
I just

1306
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,560
wanted to tell you guys something really important.

1307
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,120
Yes? My ex-wife

1308
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,560
found a huge dinosaur head in

1309
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,660
their backyard, and this is kind of true. It was like

1310
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,540
a fish. Oh, really? It was a fish.

1311
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,660
And it's, even the

1312
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,560
mandible thing area

1313
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,480
where the teeth came out were

1314
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,300
still, um, intact

1315
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,580
enough so it didn't fall apart, and they gave it to the

1316
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,380
Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

1317
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,480
Because I guess the Great Lakes were

1318
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,580
at one time at the bottom of the Atlantic

1319
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,700
Ocean before something real bad happened.

1320
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,560
Was it a member of the species

1321
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,740
Xiphactinus?

1322
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,680
I don't know. It was a, it was a fishy-like

1323
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,060
dinosaur. How big? You guys are the dinosaur experts.

1324
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,320
How big was this, was this dude?

1325
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,480
How big? I would say that what

1326
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,580
this jaw thing that they discovered

1327
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,980
was almost a foot

1328
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,740
in length. Okay. At least

1329
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,080
a foot in length. It could be.

1330
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,620
There might be the Dunkleosteus. Immature, juvenile.

1331
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,720
A small Dunkleosteus.

1332
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,240
Perhaps. If this was in a...

1333
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,820
That name rings a bell. Is that a real name?

1334
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,680
Yes. Dunkleosteus

1335
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,540
is a name. It's one of the

1336
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,760
neo-paleontological names.

1337
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,760
Those who are classically trained

1338
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,700
will think of the same creature but give

1339
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,680
it the name Dynichthys,

1340
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,120
or terrible fish.

1341
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,100
But like many of the cool

1342
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,940
paleo names that's since been changed

1343
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,380
to a boring one by modern

1344
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,140
science, and now it's called Dunkleosteus.

1345
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,660
Well, it was discovered by

1346
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,160
Professor Dunkle.

1347
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,360
And quite properly,

1348
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,740
he has the discoverer's

1349
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,640
privilege of naming the

1350
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,680
specimen. Incidentally, only the

1351
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,080
jaws and teeth are known.

1352
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,840
No one knows anything about the rest of the body,

1353
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,640
but judging from the enormous

1354
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,480
size of the head, that

1355
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,680
must have been one mosh-headed lunker down

1356
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,600
there, I gotta tell you. Well, if this

1357
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
was an infant, then the

1358
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,480
mother would be over 400

1359
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,400
feet tall. And

1360
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,500
she knows where you live.

1361
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,680
That was the Gorgon.

1362
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,500
The Gorgosaurus. Yes, I remember

1363
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,460
how Ackerman wrote in

1364
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,720
Famous Monsters, the poetic

1365
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,460
line,

1366
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,180
When Gorgon's mama comes to town,

1367
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,420
London Bridge is falling down.

1368
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,440
Oh, that's great. It's true.

1369
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,560
That is sweet. At least

1370
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,660
in that movie, the monsters trash everything

1371
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,840
and then don't get killed and just walk off,

1372
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,380
you know, together into the sunset.

1373
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,620
And the little boy gets tears

1374
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,740
in his eyes. I sure got tears in my

1375
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,620
eyes. He got tears in his eyes, but what about

1376
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,420
those other little boys who ran down

1377
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,680
the docks to see the excitement and got

1378
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,940
seared and burned by the flamethrowers

1379
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,700
of the military while they were trying to dispose

1380
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,740
of Gorgon's mom? Well, now,

1381
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,660
you can't drag a movie down

1382
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,420
with those kind of little details.

1383
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,360
Oh, it's necessary to have those

1384
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,660
deaths. And as Stalin said,

1385
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,440
the death of a million is a

1386
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,300
statistic, but the death of a single

1387
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,500
person creates sympathy

1388
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,680
and pity, so it's

1389
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,600
best to kill as many as

1390
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,700
possible at once. Well, that's

1391
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,600
a rule of thumb. If you could

1392
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,540
get out of the entire process by just

1393
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,460
killing everything, that,

1394
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,180
I don't know if that would really,

1395
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,220
would that improve anything?

1396
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,680
According to a tyrant, didn't Caligula

1397
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,740
once say, oh, that the Roman

1398
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,520
people had only one neck?

1399
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,460
That's a wise leader.

1400
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,740
I've been listening to a few since Caligula

1401
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,620
that said that. Yeah, it's

1402
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,260
funny how this show we've been

1403
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,440
talking about tyrants and

1404
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,620
dictators and bullies and

1405
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,360
there's something

1406
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,640
that makes us realize

1407
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,900
that we've escaped a great calamity,

1408
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,060
or have we,

1409
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,360
from 12X day,

1410
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,640
but it was

1411
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,140
not without certain scars

1412
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,300
of passage.

1413
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,320
Boy, that one guy showed me the scar,

1414
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,520
you know, this scar here.

1415
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,640
Well, he had tried to leave the campground

1416
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,620
the year before without getting his

1417
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,680
electrostimulonegative reinforcement

1418
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,600
wristband neutralized.

1419
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,160
Yeah, he had a little hand growing out of that scar

1420
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,720
by now. I blew his hand right off.

1421
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,420
And it had to be replaced. That was

1422
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,860
Reverend Brain Leak.

1423
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,640
Well, you know, a chick's dead scars

1424
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,620
becomes necrotic immediately.

1425
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,780
And you have to reconnect everything.

1426
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,480
But these days, that's a snap.

1427
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,460
In today's hygienic, modernized

1428
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,460
hospitals and reattachment centers,

1429
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,700
your wayward limbs can be

1430
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,660
on as an outpatient procedure.

1431
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,420
Yeah, in Dobbs Town,

1432
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,600
thousands and thousands of patients

1433
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,240
are being retreated and

1434
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,460
reexamined by having all

1435
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,680
of their molecules rearranged.

1436
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,320
Well, but did you hear about that poor

1437
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,160
guy in Germany who got a

1438
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,420
foot sewed onto

1439
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,640
his arm and a hand,

1440
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,380
his hand,

1441
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,220
under his foot because of

1442
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,060
bad paperwork?

1443
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,500
Well, uh,

1444
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,700
I don't know.

1445
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,320
...as a cosmetic kind of a design thing

1446
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,360
as a statement. Oh, someday all the kids

1447
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,440
will be doing it. Just because we said it

1448
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,260
on this show. Maybe with that

1449
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,340
one ought to be run through Snopes, uh,

1450
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,000
dot com. But I have to say,

1451
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,300
it's a common surgical procedure to do this

1452
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,300
for a temporary period of time because that

1453
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,240
gives a blood supply

1454
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,320
to the, uh, part

1455
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,400
which is ultimately to be surgically

1456
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,080
put in the right place.

1457
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,440
And you have to, you know, you can't

1458
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,320
deal with dead tissue

1459
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,140
when you can keep tissue alive,

1460
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,440
as Victor Frankenstein always used to say.

1461
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,560
You mean you have to keep on

1462
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,000
a different body part?

1463
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,020
They do it.

1464
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,400
How about this technique where they

1465
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,660
have a human ear attached to a mouse's

1466
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,480
back? In this case, our little

1467
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,360
mouse friend gives a blood supply to

1468
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,300
this human ear before it

1469
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,500
can be reattached to a human

1470
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,420
door. But once again, that's a social statement

1471
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,120
right there. A rodent with a human

1472
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,040
ear on its back. I mean, think of that as a

1473
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,280
logo for some kind of new business. Well, you know there are some collectors who have the

1474
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,300
mice with the ear on its back

1475
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,380
just for that, you know, and that ear isn't going to be

1476
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,040
attached to anybody, realistically,

1477
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,980
given human nature. There's some

1478
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,900
one out there with a whole terrarium full of, uh...

1479
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,440
And it may be

1480
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,340
it makes you feel a certain way when you look at a

1481
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,960
rodent with an ear on its back.

1482
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,420
And speaking of ears, now that I've got

1483
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,220
your ears, real quick

1484
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,240
I have to remind everyone, portions of the following

1485
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,200
broadcast may be found objectionable by some

1486
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,440
listeners in the audience. Therefore, listener discretion is advised.

1487
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,360
And the views and opinions expressed

1488
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,680
on this program are not those of WCSB

1489
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,000
or Cleveland State University.

1490
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,420
That having been said, uh, we want

1491
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,380
to continue in just a moment here, but first we want

1492
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,420
to pause real quick. Guys, I

1493
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,000
hope you'll stay on the line for a moment.

1494
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,380
Thank you for your time. We'll be back in

1495
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,880
just a couple of minutes here.

1496
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,420
Should be back in less than

1497
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:58,900
five minutes.

1498
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,120
No, Dr. Sinister, we won't be back for exactly

1499
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,220
one week, and hopefully by then I will have

1500
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,560
had time to pour through, compare, and edit

1501
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,520
into a proper documentary the actual

1502
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,380
location recordings from

1503
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,380
12X Day, and the

1504
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,280
rest of this post-drill show.

1505
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,260
Uh, we had just returned from the

1506
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,660
grueling, gruel-fueled tomfoolery

1507
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,280
of the five-day camp out in Special

1508
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,300
Olympics, so we were a bit exhausted

1509
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,140
from the crazed mood that

1510
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,220
shall be evident in the future

1511
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,520
episodes made increasingly

1512
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,280
from actual location recordings

1513
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,260
as they happen.

1514
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,440
Meanwhile, this is Hour

1515
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,540
of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1516
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,820
For more about the church, see

1517
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,340

1518
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,440

00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,880
WCSB.org.

1520
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,580
But

1521
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,380
for sheer tear-jerking

1522
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,300
slack, listen to this breathtaking

1523
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,340
new version of the Phineas

1524
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,000
Narco version of the song,

1525
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,520
Bob's Way.

1526
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,420
...

1527
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,400
...

1528
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,380
...

1529
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:03,040
And now

1530
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,160
the end is

1531
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,520
near

1532
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,760
We sit and face

1533
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,220
the final

1534
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:12,900
curtain

1535
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,760
Bob Dobbs

1536
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,140
will kick

1537
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,500
their rears

1538
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,960
their pink bright butts

1539
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,360
...

1540
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:24,820
...

1541
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,760
...

1542
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,700
...

1543
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,320
a life that's full

1544
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,300
we

1545
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,540
didn't go

1546
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,080
the pink boy

1547
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,800
job way

1548
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,820
but more

1549
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,680
much more than

1550
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,060
this

1551
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,540
we did it

1552
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,940
Bob's

1553
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,240
way

1554
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,400
regrets

1555
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,800
we had

1556
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,120
a few

1557
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,180
but then again

1558
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,420
too few to mention

1559
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,680
cleave

1560
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,600
their world into

1561
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,580
and blast

1562
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,280
off to

1563
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,360
the X

1564
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:15,960
dimension

1565
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,500
Bob's

1566
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,660
pipe is stiff

1567
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,340
and hard

1568
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,300
and it will smite

1569
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,100
them

1570
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,020
here on

1571
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,020
X day

1572
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,360
he'll

1573
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,460
pulverize

1574
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,100
their little

1575
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:34,700
world

1576
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,200
he'll do it

1577
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,520
Bob's

1578
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:40,740
way

1579
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,820
yes there were times

1580
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,340
you often knew

1581
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,520
the pink boys

1582
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:51,920
beat us

1583
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,740
black and blue

1584
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,700
but through it all

1585
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,960
we

1586
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,900
we didn't stop

1587
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,340
we took the pills

1588
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,600
and smoked

1589
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:06,860
the frog

1590
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,160
we faced the car

1591
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,140
and we moved

1592
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:12,640
on

1593
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,160
and did it

1594
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,500
Bob's

1595
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:18,920
way

1596
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,220
oh sure

1597
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,760
at times we cry

1598
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,500
but we

1599
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:27,820
we cry

1600
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:27,820


1601
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:27,820


1602
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:27,840
we cry

1603
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,000
we cry

1604
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,000


1605
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,160
we cry

1606
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,000
but they'll be the ones

1607
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,520
we'll be abusing

1608
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,420
until the last

1609
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,640
pink boy has died

1610
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,600
I'm sure we'll find

1611
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,080
it quite amusing

1612
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,400
to think

1613
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,760
we'll do all that

1614
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,800
from Bangor, Maine

1615
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,540
down to Zimbabwe

1616
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,920
oh no

1617
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,160
oh no not us

1618
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,500
we'll do it

1619
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,340
Bob's

1620
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,200
way

1621
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,380
for what is

1622
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,600
a sub

1623
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,460
what has he got

1624
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,240
if not some

1625
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:18,800
slap

1626
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,980
then he has not

1627
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,060
to say

1628
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,180
the things

1629
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,520
he tries to say

1630
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,260
truly feels

1631
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,880
and not the words

1632
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,180
of those who kneel

1633
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,620
the record shows

1634
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,420
we dealt the blows

1635
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,900
and did it

1636
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,220
Bob's

1637
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:50,600
way

1638
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,260
thank you

1639
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,520
Bob's way

1640
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,880
brothers and sisters

1641
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,840
for coming to the end of the world

1642
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,260
and beyond

1643
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:12,860
and for doing it

1644
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,740
Bob's way

1645
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,040
Bob's way

1646
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,040
Bob's way

1647
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,780
Bob's way

1648
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,980
Bob's way

1649
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,280
Bob's way

1650
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,520
Bob's way

1651
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:27,520


1652
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:27,520


1653
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:27,520


1654
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:27,520


1655
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,840
I'm going to be

1656
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:32,840


1657
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,100
Does my idea

1658
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:34,900
sound real?

1659
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,880
Have I slipped

1660
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,460
you locked?

1661
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:41,060
compost day

1662
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,980
Then I took

1663
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,080
彣�

1664
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:57,520
the

1665
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,360
gun

1666
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,340
to

1667
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,540
раф

1668
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:57,980
Bob.

1669
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:04,720
When you lift up this ruby block, instead of the penny, there on the table is a white king soap box top.

1670
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:13,060
The terrified natives believe its curious, hypnotic actions are caused by an evil spirit.

1671
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:13,940
My mother.

1672
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,100
What's the matter, Dick?

1673
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:15,660
It's Bob.

1674
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,620
Thank goodness.

1675
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,400
It's not Bob.

1676
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,560
Look at the collar.

1677
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:20,340
Oh.

1678
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,480
Thank goodness.

1679
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,920
If it would make a difference, Bob can come with me.

1680
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,700
Captain, here he comes.

1681
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,440
Yes, Bob.

1682
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:27,980
Come along.

1683
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:28,740
Well.

1684
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,400
Give them a hand with the luggage, Bob.

1685
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:30,800
Go on.

1686
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,160
Hurry.
