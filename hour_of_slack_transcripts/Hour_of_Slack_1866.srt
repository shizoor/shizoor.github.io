1
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,100
A subgenius

2
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,700
Our Hour of Slack.

3
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,640
Hour of Slack.

4
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,280
Hour of Slack.

5
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,720
The Hour of Slack.

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,060
Sister Genies.

7
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,120
The Hour of Slack.

8
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,120
Bob.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,160
Oh yes, dear friends.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,860
And welcome to the first Live Hour of Slack in about a hundred weeks.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,780
And this is, we had a good excuse for it.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,320
For one thing, I can walk and wear a shirt and no bandages and all that.

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,560
But the other thing is, we have a special guest here at Stang Ranch at Tarzan's radio station.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,340
And my friends, it's none other than the overman himself, Dr. Philo Drummond.

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,020
Yay!

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,140
Well, I'm glad to be here.

17
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,920
I'm awful glad you're here.

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,120
When was the last time you were on the Puzzling Evidence show?

19
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,600
It was like three or four years ago, right?

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:33,900
It was, let's see, the 19th of June, 2017.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,420
Yep.

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,220
The 19th of June, 2017.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,980
Goodness.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,260
My swan song.

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,360
In public radio.

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,120
This can be your new pirate flag.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,720
Congratulations.

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,440
My re-entry back into the mainstream of the non-mainstream.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,300
The mainstream of the backside of reality.

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,020
Now, you guys remember to talk sort of close to the microphones.

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,140
Don't do a Susie on me, okay?

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:05,840
All right.

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,000
Or a Hal.

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,420
I won't.

35
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,700
Actually, doing a Hal is when you fall asleep with your forehead leaning against the wind.

36
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,940
You know, Hal would, he was like, at one point, he was,

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,340
would like anchor himself with his nose touching the windscreen.

38
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:23,760
Right.

39
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,280
And then he could kind of doze off a bit.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,360
He'd sort of meditate for a little while.

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,140
It's really easy.

42
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,700
Nobody would realize that until they try to be on a radio show,

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,120
that simply touching your nose to the windscreen on a microphone has a,

44
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,240
I'm going to try that.

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
It has a hypnotic effect.

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,200
Hmm.

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,600
Ha ha ha.

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,800
See what I, see what I mean?

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,720
Hal was on, Hal was on to something.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,460
It turns you into shimp.

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,280
Right.

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
It's a shimp.

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,480
Yes, friends.

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,260
It's, it's the, the first new hour of Slack in months and months, and it's a new year.

55
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,360
It's the conspiracy says it's 2022.

56
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,920
Personally, you know, I mean, obviously,

57
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,000
it's that's silly because the excess haven't arrived.

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,140
It's 1997 all over.

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,520
Right.

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:24,740
Yeah.

61
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,120
Yeah.

62
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,000
It might as well be.

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,640
I mean, we don't know who cares.

64
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,220
We don't even know what planet it's on.

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,280
Yeah.

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,780
All that old stuff.

67
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,640
I really, I'm kind of going for the, uh, the, that one theory of, uh, it's 1998 was upside

68
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,720
down all the time.

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,740
86, 61.

70
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,160
Yeah.

71
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,980
So we've got a lot.

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,020
We've got a lot of time.

73
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,820
A lot of time.

74
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,560
And that's proof that the world isn't really going to end anytime soon.

75
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,640
Well,

76
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,760
because we know it.

77
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,980
X day is going to happen.

78
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,960
And so how could the world end before X day?

79
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,000
We need X day to bring about the end of the world.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,360
Right.

81
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,300
So, well, you know, the other, some of the rival cults feel like they have to have war

82
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,120
in the middle East in order to bring about the proper end of the world with Jesus.

83
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,980
That won't be the proper end of the world.

84
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,080
That will be like a sub sub.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,060
That's just some one of the precursors of the world.

86
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,320
That's a precursor to the true X day.

87
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:16,780
Yeah.

88
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,580
We've got to wait.

89
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,720
Until 86, 61.

90
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
And some of us probably won't make it.

91
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,380
Right.

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,840
That red, that red calf and the, the, and the white Buffalo and all those different special

93
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,220
creatures have to come.

94
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,580
Yeah.

95
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,540
And be born.

96
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,500
The red heifer.

97
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,420
The red heifer.

98
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,820
That's right.

99
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,400
Yeah.

100
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,180
The red heifer.

101
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,240
And the black, the black, the black Yeti.

102
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,760
Yeah.

103
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,700
The black Yeti has to be born.

104
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,000
I was thinking about the black Yeti.

105
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,140
We cut that from Revelation X.

106
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,640
The blue bull.

107
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,500
Because the black.

108
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,900
The black Yeti had the biggest.

109
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,860
No, the blue.

110
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,020
Of all the Yetis, the black Yeti, of course, had the biggest feet.

111
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,060
Yeah.

112
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,540
Feet.

113
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:56,880
Yeah.

114
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,660
And you know what big feet mean?

115
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,640
Big shoes.

116
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,300
Big shoes and big nose.

117
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,340
Big shoes.

118
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,300
Yeah.

119
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,940
That's P-O-P-Y.

120
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,880
But we do had.

121
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,780
We did have.

122
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,320
Peewee and Lawrence Fishburne, in fact.

123
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
We had a blue ox.

124
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,720
It was Peewee and Lawrence Fishburne.

125
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,620
Lawrence Fishburne had the line, I think.

126
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,920
You know what big feet means?

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,760
Big shoes.

128
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,580
Big boots.

129
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,640
He was Cowboy Bob.

130
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,540
Yeah.

131
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,400
That was Morpheus.

132
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,120
Yep.

133
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,520
God, man.

134
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:24,960
Old Morpheus.

135
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,820
I guess acting is a thing where they act like something.

136
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,640
But you remember Lawrence Fishburne was in Apocalypse Now.

137
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,480
He was.

138
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,020
Oh, that's right.

139
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,000
He was a skinny kid.

140
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,420
One of the guys on the boat.

141
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,980
He was a real skinny kid that went surfing to Rolling Stones.

142
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
He got all shot up.

143
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,580
Yeah.

144
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,720
That's right.

145
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,240
That baby Lawrence Fishburne.

146
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,540
Wow.

147
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,360
Just never.

148
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,040
He was 17 or 18 or something in that movie.

149
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,260
Man.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,500
Man.

151
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,940
These actors can play somebody of any age.

152
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,040
How could the pock-faced, giant, fat guy, Lawrence Fishburne, play that skinny 18-year-old?

153
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,180
Seems like one of those death-

154
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,560
Time control.

155
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,180
Time control.

156
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,680
One of those Death Wish movies had Jeff Goldblum or what's his name?

157
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,200
Goldberg.

158
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,120
Goldblum.

159
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,680
Goldberg.

160
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:07,920
Yeah.

161
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,580
Jeff Goldblum.

162
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,660
The girls love him.

163
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,360
No.

164
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,020
Is it Goldblum or Goldberg?

165
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:13,840
Goldblum.

166
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,640
Goldblum.

167
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:14,780
Goldblum.

168
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,600
He's tall and skinny.

169
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,060
That's why the girls like him.

170
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,600
Anyway, he was in, I think, Death Wish II or maybe some ... He played on those evil guys

171
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,820
that were trying to kill Paul Kersey after ... Or take advantage of the neighborhood.

172
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,980
He was like just ... He was probably the most nervous.

173
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,680
He was like a teenager.

174
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,420
The nervous evil guy.

175
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,360
Because he's always nervous.

176
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,940
Oh no.

177
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,620
What was that?

178
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,740
That was the automatic volume override.

179
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,760
That's what it was.

180
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:44,760


181
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:44,760


182
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:44,760


183
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,220
I don't know what that was.

184
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,500
If you make a big noise, everything goes down for a second.

185
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,240
It's on automatic.

186
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,220
Yeah.

187
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,440
That's the easiest way to do it.

188
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,160
How about this music in the background?

189
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,680
It's really soft.

190
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,860
It's French swing.

191
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,560
French swing.

192
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,760
By different bands that St. Byron Warner sent to Princess Waite.

193
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,160
Not me.

194
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,920
He sent it to her.

195
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,960
Well, he knows that she still has her hearing.

196
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,200
Something's wrong.

197
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,740
Well, we had a little bit of a conversation.

198
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:14,740


199
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,900
We had a conversation about music that he'd been seeking out.

200
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,320
And she can actually hear the notes and things.

201
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:22,760
Right.

202
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,180
Hey, speaking of music, now this.

203
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,420
Now see, that's where I could cut in a swing in Love Corpses.

204
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,280
Right.

205
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,700
Thing.

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,660
Yeah.

207
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,720
Yeah.

208
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,020
Yeah.

209
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:36,920
Yeah.

210
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:38,720
Yeah.

211
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,120
Yeah.

212
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,460
Yeah.

213
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:39,780
Yeah.

214
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,420
Yeah.

215
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah.

216
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,660
Yeah.

217
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,020
Yeah.

218
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,440
Yeah.

219
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,240
Yeah.

220
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,420
Yeah.

221
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,840
Yeah.

222
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,760
Yeah.

223
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,460
Yeah.

224
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,180
Yeah.

225
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,420
She drove me out of something.

226
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,420


227
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,420


228
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,420


229
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,420


230
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,300
Don't you go dancing with your blue jeans on

231
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,960
You better wear leather or maybe nylon

232
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,060
You won't have to wonder if you just got a stamp

233
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,880
You're looking at the bulbs in your underwear

234
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,960
Excuse me, mama's really big and small

235
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,080
And I get a lot of room cause I'm dancing with my heart

236
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,720
I need some place where I can hide

237
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,620
Cause it's a growing and a pushing and a pushing from inside

238
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,540
Feel it getting bigger, it's about to rip

239
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,180
I'm getting bigger, it's about to rip

240
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,460
I'm getting bigger, it's about to rip

241
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,020
My jeans are my jeans, I'm growing a bit

242
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,200
Excuse me, mama's really big and small

243
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,180
And I get a lot of room cause I'm dancing with my heart

244
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,060
Hey, kitty boy

245
00:09:47,320 --> 00:10:00,780
Hey, kitty boy

246
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,980
Hey, kitty boy

247
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,940
I need a better place where I can hide

248
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,280
That's right, I'll tell you why

249
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,640
Cause it's a growing and a pushing and a pushing from inside

250
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,860
I need a better place where I can hide

251
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,640
It's about to rip

252
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,940
Dreams are my dreams

253
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,200
I throw with a thrill

254
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,460
She's a man

255
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,400
One that's really

256
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,140
Thank you, Paul

257
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,520
And I need a lot of room

258
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,400
Cause I'm dancing

259
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,380
With a hard-on

260
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,280
Dancing with a hard-on

261
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,280
Dancing with a hard-on

262
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Dancing with a hard-on

263
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,600
I'm dancing

264
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,880
Dancing with a hard-on

265
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,840
I got a diamond cutter

266
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,920
Dancing with a hard-on

267
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,020
It's a blue fader

268
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,920
Dancing with a hard-on

269
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,940
The hard-dropping

270
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,540
Muscle of love

271
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,020
Dancing with a hard-on

272
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,060
Make way for the

273
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,500
I'm dancing

274
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,860
Dancing with a hard-on

275
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,120
Yeah, that's right

276
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,000
They know how it feels

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,680
When you've been

278
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,260
Dancing with a hard-on

279
00:11:36,120 --> 00:12:04,560
Dancing with a hard-on

280
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:34,480
Dancing with a hard-on

281
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,020
I must really

282
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,140
Beg your pardon

283
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,020
I need a lot of room

284
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,800
When I'm dancing

285
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,100
With my hard-on

286
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,240
Yeah, it's about a guy

287
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
With a purple heart

288
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,640
Right

289
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,020
Proud of his purple heart

290
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,000
And it's

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,720
That was the way

292
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,920
I explained it

293
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,320
And it's stuck right

294
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,740
To the front of his pants

295
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,120
Yeah

296
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,700
Right on his zipper

297
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,840
Yeah

298
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,380
See my heart on

299
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,720
Yeah

300
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,600
You guys were so ahead

301
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,080
Of your time

302
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,180
The Swinging Love Corpses

303
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,500
People may not understand this

304
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,580
But there was no spinal cord

305
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:04,800
Tap

306
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,300
At the time that

307
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,360
The Swinging Love Corpses

308
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,140
Were doing their

309
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,220
Commentary on the

310
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,320
Tropes of

311
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,800
Modern rock and roll bands

312
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
I think that we were

313
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,860
Co-temporaneous

314
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,180
At one point there

315
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,760
Because I remember

316
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,800
We got free tickets

317
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,080
To go see Spinal Tap

318
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,320
When they were filming it

319
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,260
But you

320
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, when they were

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,480
Filming it

322
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,520
But you guys were already

323
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,400
Doing it

324
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,700
Yeah

325
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,760
You know, I always had

326
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,880
This favorite band

327
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,100
Festival lineup

328
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,960
That was like

329
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,120
It would open

330
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,760
Tenacious D would open

331
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,160
And

332
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,580
It was

333
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:34,920
It would have

334
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
A mighty wind

335
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,480
And Spinal Tap

336
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,820
And then the

337
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,900
Swinging Love Corpses

338
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,120
And then the final finale

339
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,920
Would be Frank Marino

340
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,940
And Mahogany Rush

341
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,480
Because he's serious

342
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,940
And he's a

343
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,840
He was a classic example

344
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,740
Of one of those

345
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,440
Over the top

346
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,700
Stadium bands

347
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,880
That had to have

348
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,180
The hour long

349
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,960
Bass solo

350
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,540
And then the hour long

351
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,220
Drum solo

352
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,000
I went to see him

353
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,460
In Cleveland

354
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,620
About ten years ago

355
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,480
He was still playing

356
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,980
And I made it

357
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,860
Through the drum solo

358
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,740
But then he said

359
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,920
Here comes the bass solo

360
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,940
I had to leave

361
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,460
I couldn't stay to hear him

362
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,860
The Swinging Love Corpses

363
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,600
We used to have

364
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,640
Our drummer was

365
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,200
Demanded his

366
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,260
His solo, of course

367
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,260
And so he was

368
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,840
Fairly self-indulgent

369
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,320
Which we promoted

370
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,200
Skippy Mojo Butcher

371
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,260
Mojo Skippy Butcher

372
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,480
Oh

373
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,060
And so he would go

374
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,180
Into his drum solo

375
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,960
And we would

376
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,120
Drag out the

377
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,460
Drum solo

378
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:34,700
And we would

379
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,200
Lounge chairs

380
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,620
And turn on the TV

381
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,760
And read the newspaper

382
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,820
While he did his

383
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,420
Drum solo

384
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,920
And finally

385
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,780
He'd be finished

386
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,520
And we'd put everything

387
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,340
Away and get back

388
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,060
Into the song

389
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,120
I liked the

390
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,600
Swinging Love Corpses

391
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,400
Songs that would

392
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,360
End for like

393
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,140
Five minutes

394
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,300
We had one

395
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,900
That was like

396
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,020
A minute long

397
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,000
And then would end

398
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,480
For like

399
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,560
Five or six minutes

400
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeah

401
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,640
Ever more

402
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,860
Triumphant

403
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,440
You know

404
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,260
Buildups

405
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:03,600
To a

406
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,120
Trash

407
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,340
And then

408
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,100
The drummer would

409
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,340
But then they couldn't

410
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,980
Quite quit

411
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,340
You know

412
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,100
Just when you thought

413
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,680
It was over

414
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,780
Like the monster

415
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,880
That keeps coming back

416
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,940
When you think he's dead

417
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,420
Yeah

418
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,180
That was

419
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,580
There was

420
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,360
I remember there was

421
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,280
A band that had a song

422
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,880
Like that

423
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,160
I think it was the

424
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,600
It was the Outlaws

425
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,080
They had that

426
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,000
One of those

427
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,020
Takeoff endings

428
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,740
That goes on

429
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,500
That just goes on

430
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:29,760
Forever

431
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,640
And it's got like

432
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Three guitars

433
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,860
Going at the same time

434
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,000
But you guys were

435
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,520
A very visually

436
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,820
Interesting band

437
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,020
Because you wore

438
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,480
Really cool

439
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,100
Hippie costumes

440
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,680
And

441
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,280
Back then you had

442
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,880
Long hair

443
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,120
Yeah they looked

444
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,280
Like something out

445
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,120
Of a quick silver

446
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,080
Messenger service

447
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,100
Crossed with

448
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,800
Country Joe

449
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,340
And the fish

450
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:51,880
Or something

451
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,680
And

452
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,340
That's the look

453
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,980
We were going for

454
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,440
Yeah

455
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,200
And it was sort of

456
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,120
Defined by the fact

457
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,740
That we had

458
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,000
Gotten all of our clothes

459
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,800
At the same rag merchant

460
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,300
I didn't know that

461
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,620
We went there

462
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,580
And dug through the

463
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:03,840
Popsicle box

464
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:03,840


465
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:03,840


466
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,460
And found our

467
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,120
Best outfits that way

468
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,500
Wow

469
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,060
Huh

470
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,320
Yeah

471
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,640
And then we

472
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,260
Had to wear wigs

473
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,360
And that was one of the

474
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,460
Cardinal sins in the band

475
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,220
Is that you couldn't

476
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Take your wig off

477
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,680
Right

478
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,600
Well that'd be

479
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,920
You'd be breaking character

480
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Well what happened

481
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,960
We did have that time

482
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,560
In Chicago

483
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,780
Where we were playing

484
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,320
In that club

485
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,000
That was about

486
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
150 degrees

487
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,420
On the inside

488
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,820
Oh my god

489
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,500
And it was like

490
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,820
Playing inside of an oven

491
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,120
Yeah

492
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,580
And you couldn't play

493
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,840
With a wig on

494
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,000
We had to take

495
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,760
Our wigs off

496
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,940
Or die

497
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,980
Flip your wigs

498
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,420
Yeah

499
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,380
It was really sad

500
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:41,960
Because

501
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,200
Yeah

502
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,700
Because they

503
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,520
Because they need

504
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,080
To just look like

505
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,820
Businessmen

506
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,680
And then our fans

507
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,080
You look like

508
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,100
Cable repair guys

509
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,440
And our fans realized

510
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,260
That that wasn't

511
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,960
Our real hair

512
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,420
You look like

513
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,600
Xerox repairmen

514
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,540
And AT

515
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,860
And yellow page salesmen

516
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,240
Yeah

517
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,680
And

518
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,900
Conveyor belt

519
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,300
Manufacturers

520
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,840
And things

521
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,740
So

522
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,760
Pharmaceutical salesmen

523
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,460
It was crazy

524
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,300
Our buddies on the show

525
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,320
And some of our fans

526
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,080
Were so sad

527
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,000
Because they realized

528
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,820
That we really

529
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,760
That really wasn't

530
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,480
Our hair

531
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,060
That wasn't

532
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,680
Our real hair

533
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,700
And that some of us

534
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,420
Were actually bald

535
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,080
Underneath

536
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,840
That's sad

537
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,480
Well you know

538
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,300
Now I can

539
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,120
I'd do both

540
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,540
I have real long hair

541
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,360
And I'm bald

542
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,960
Yeah

543
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,180
I'm bald on top

544
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,840
Yeah

545
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,140
But I have long brown hair

546
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,380
It's all white in the front

547
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,960
Look coming

548
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,180
Coming towards somebody

549
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,480
I look like a little old man

550
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,800
Walking away

551
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,460
I look like

552
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,620
Some kind of pirate

553
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,420
Or barker

554
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,100
Or biker

555
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,860
Or a pirate

556
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,560
Who mated with an angel

557
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,320
I would keep

558
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,100
I would keep

559
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,660
Reminding myself of that

560
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,440
If I were you

561
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,060
Yeah

562
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,020
Well I

563
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,600
Ladies

564
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
Ladies like my punk

565
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,980
How angelic

566
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,040
And yet piratical

567
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,620
You look

568
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,700
I have horny

569
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:00,980
From behind

570
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,560
Horny divorcees

571
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,200
Come up to me

572
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,700
From behind

573
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,420
All the time

574
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,620
I can't go on that

575
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,640
But then when I turn around

576
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,400
And look at them

577
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,820
And smile

578
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,460
They kind of

579
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,180
Their face drops

580
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,380
I'm so hopeful

581
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,340
Now I'm so let down

582
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,880
He had such a cute butt

583
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,740
And nice long hair

584
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,580
Yeah

585
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,160
But he's much older

586
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,020
Than my husband

587
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
He's much older

588
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,500
Than my dad

589
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,040
Goodness

590
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,780
The dogs are here

591
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,980
My goodness

592
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,680
It must be

593
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,520
It must be chilly outside

594
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,100
Yeti's here

595
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,620
Chupacabra is here

596
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,860
Oh there's an article

597
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,820
About chupacabras

598
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,460
My new skeptic

599
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,080
Oh really

600
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,800
Inquirer newsletter

601
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,000
I get in the email

602
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,280
I read a lot of

603
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,000
Skeptical stuff

604
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,940
Because I like monsters

605
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,060
And they cover monsters

606
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,180
And spooks

607
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,120
And I'm bad

608
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm pretty skeptical

609
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,140
About most everything

610
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,400
Well you know

611
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,380
Robert Anton Wilson

612
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,260
Was skeptical about

613
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,340
Everything

614
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,580
And skepticism

615
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,520
And I'm not skeptical

616
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,160
About anything

617
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,160


618
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,920
He had kind of a

619
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,000
Why not both approach

620
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,900
Although he hadn't

621
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,180
He called it

622
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,880
Maybe logic

623
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,520
I've boiled it down

624
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,660
To why not both

625
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,980
Or in some cases

626
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
Why not all three

627
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,780
I think it's like

628
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,400
An extension of your concept

629
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,520
That I've applied

630
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,960
To disagreeing

631
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,500
And it's really

632
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,000
We just agree differently

633
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,760
Right

634
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,180
Right

635
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,600
You never have to be

636
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,700
Disagreeing with anyone

637
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,100
The whole world

638
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,060
Can just realize

639
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,460
That they agree differently

640
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,880
Now see this is when

641
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,480
I should have

642
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,500
I copy stuff

643
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:33,500


644
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:33,500


645
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:33,500


646
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
Off of our secret news group

647
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,940
And there's a whole thing

648
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,960
About the differently

649
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,480
The differently everything

650
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,160
It was like you know

651
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,320
The differently moral

652
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,000
The differently sane

653
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,600
Of course

654
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,560
The differently sane

655
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,000
Was the first one

656
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,480
But we just

657
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,720
God

658
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,280
We've

659
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,740
Well that group

660
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,960
Really extends itself

661
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,020
To be more of a

662
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,780
Philosophical discussion group

663
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,440
Well I know

664
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,540
But I like

665
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,240
I've got a whole

666
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,740
Six pages of stuff up there

667
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,420
Just from the last three days

668
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,960
Of you

669
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,240
Me and Onan

670
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,880
And Sterno

671
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,140
Just

672
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,000
And Marty going back and forth

673
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,760
I mean Sphinx

674
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Colonel

675
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,840
Sphinx

676
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,160
Yeah

677
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,460
We're part of a very

678
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:14,980
August

679
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,380
And elite

680
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,180
Assemblage

681
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,000
You talk about

682
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,960
Illuminati

683
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,660
And elites

684
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,660
And lizard people

685
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,280
And stuff

686
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,320
We've got

687
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,720
We've got it boiled down

688
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,540
To the five

689
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,380
Or six

690
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,660
It's only really five

691
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,520
Controllers

692
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,060
Of the universe

693
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,020
It's

694
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,460
You've heard of

695
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,200
Semi-sweet

696
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,400
Channels

697
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:33,680
And chocolates

698
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,480
We're like a

699
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,040
Semi-secret society

700
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,000
We're semi-secret

701
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,900
Semi

702
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,680
Semi

703
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,460
Semi

704
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:41,720
Semi

705
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,800
I didn't mean to say

706
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,140
Semi

707
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,600
Edit that part

708
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,420
Semi-semi

709
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,600
Edit that part

710
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,380
Out in the mix

711
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,040
Later okay

712
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,020
Semi-seemly thing

713
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,300
That part I was dumb

714
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,040
See my semen maker

715
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,620
No

716
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,300
See that part

717
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,040
Where I was dumb

718
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,360
Edit that out

719
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,720
And make me sound

720
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,420
Smart again

721
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,260
Okay

722
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,120
That's easy

723
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,580
Okay

724
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,400
Okay

725
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


726
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


727
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


728
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


729
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


730
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


731
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


732
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


733
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


734
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


735
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


736
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


737
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,400


738
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,040
I'll just turn it

739
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,400
Or turn it around backwards

740
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,900
Or something

741
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,680
That's really clever

742
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,740
No that means

743
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,200
You're giving the KPFA

744
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,840
Phone number

745
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,400
Yeah

746
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,100
Or the WCSB

747
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,700
Phone number

748
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,560
Come on

749
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,020
Call in

750
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,940
Why aren't you

751
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,440
Calling in

752
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,160
Because I have the problem

753
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,100
This show actually

754
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,760
Plays on

755
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Several different

756
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,400
Actors

757
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:33,420


758
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,120
Actual broadcast

759
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,140
Radio stations

760
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,380
Not many

761
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,220
But they're the best ones

762
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,200
And people want to call in

763
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,100
And talk to us

764
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,940
And they can't

765
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,260
Right

766
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,480
They would end up

767
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,200
Getting somebody at KPFA

768
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,360
Or somebody in Cleveland

769
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,940
And

770
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,280
Why don't you just give them

771
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,520
Just right now

772
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,760
Give them your phone number

773
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
And have them call us now

774
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,380
Sure

775
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,460
216-320-9528

776
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,140
That's the

00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,760
Call us now

778
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,540
We're waiting for your call

Yeah

781
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,720
Yeah

782
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,940
If you get straight

783
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,380
What's the problem

784
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:03,400
Call us now

785
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,400

It's on the website

787
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,700
We're standing by

788
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,780

789
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,860
People go

790
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,620
Well Stang

791
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,040
I didn't know how to get hold of you

792
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,580
Why didn't you try

793
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,540
Googling Ivan Stang email

794
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,480
Or Subgenius phone number

795
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,920
That's the phone

796
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,160
That rings in my pocket

797
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,180
Nobody ever calls it though

798
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,780
Except Bernard

799
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,400
That psycho guy

800
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,020
Well I call it once in a while

801
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,620
Hardly ever

802
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,480
In fact you had to ask me

803
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,540
What my phone number was

804
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,560
Not that long ago

805
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,400
That's the thing

806
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:33,880
That wasn't me

807
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,840
Yeah

808
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,520
Well you had to ask

809
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,620
Yeah you've had

810
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,360
No you were asking

811
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,280
The address

812
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,340
Like what

813
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,900
What's your mailing address

814
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,400
It's like

815
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,340
He doesn't even know

816
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,860
The sacred P.O. box

817
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,160
Yeah well I was in a position

818
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,500
Where I couldn't look it up

819
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,440
But you were more accessible to me

820
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,000
Than other addresses

821
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,360
Here's how you remember

822
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,600
The P.O. box

823
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,400
It's like 808

824
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,440
It has eights

825
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,380
It has eights in it

826
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:58,740
But it's

827
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,380
We couldn't quite get up to

828
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,620
808 for Bob

829
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,740
So it's 807

830
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,180
Yeah

831
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,840
Mr. Yarborough has 808

832
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,080
And I'm waiting for him to die

833
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,000
I didn't say that

834
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,140
But your street address

835
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,740
Is different

836
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,680
Well yeah yeah

837
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,300
My street address

838
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,760
Yeah but the mail

839
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,500
Won't come here

840
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,080
This is too remote

841
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,800
And deadly

842
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,760
What do they do

843
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,400
With that box out there

844
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,180
That's for U.S. mail

845
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,740
Yeah some mail goes

846
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,600
So your junk mail

847
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,360
Goes in there

848
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,560
Yeah

849
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,760
But we use the P.O. box

850
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,420
807 Glen Rose, Texas

851
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,220
760

852
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,860
Come offers

853
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,220
And

854
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,400
P.O. box

855
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,560
But if he's like us

856
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,480
His children

857
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,080
Will then use the box

858
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,800
After him

859
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,720
They'll get 808

860
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,740
Maybe you can just steal

861
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,020
The box when he dies

862
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,760
And swap it out with yours

863
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,560
You know actually I could

864
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,140
I have thought about

865
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,980
Writing the guy a letter

866
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,600
And saying

867
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,180
Would you be open

868
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,040
To swapping post office boxes

869
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,480
And explain to him

870
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,060
That 808 ties into my business

871
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,900
Logo

872
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,460
Right

873
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,620
And probably he's going to go

874
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,380
No I should wait a minute

875
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:03,380


876
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:03,380


877
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,420
I don't want to be

878
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,060
Too much trouble

879
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,760
I don't need to

880
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,360
I've got all my

881
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,920
My business cards

882
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,640
And everything printed with that

883
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,060
I just don't think

884
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,800
I can do that

885
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,200
You want me to change the street

886
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,220
To Martin Luther King

887
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,820
Boy you nailed Mr. Yarbrough

888
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,060
And we don't even know

889
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,100
Anything about him

890
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,260
That's him alright

891
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,840
This is Garden Grove

892
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,900
You will not

893
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,160
You do a pretty good

894
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,960
Texas accent

895
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,380
Talk about that

896
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
I've been known to live

897
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,440
In this state from time to time

898
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,480
It's not

899
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,360
It's not a lot different

900
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,560
From a Kentucky accent

901
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,460
They kind of drag it out

902
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,420
A little bit flatter

903
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,760
Actually there's so many

904
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,700
Texas accents

905
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,560
It's ridiculous

906
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,220
Yours is a little bit

907
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,080
More Houston-y

908
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,300
I like to use a classic

909
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,360
A classic Houston accent

910
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,060
To most

911
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,300
To the average human

912
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,600
You and me sound

913
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,320
Almost alike

914
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,800
The people that told me

915
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,260
They had trouble

916
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,080
Telling us apart

917
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,960
Although I don't understand

918
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,580
That's true

919
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,820
I don't get that

920
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,780
The accent anyway

921
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,000
But not the voice

922
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,680
Timber

923
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,780
Dr. Drummond has the loudest

924
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,740
Most piercing voice

925
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,440
In the whole world

926
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,080
Next to yours

927
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,920
Princess Marie

928
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,280
Oh I didn't know that

929
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,880
Yeah that's why

930
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
You're the only two people

931
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,580
I can understand

932
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,760
I see

933
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,400
The speech

934
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,980
Everyone else just sounds

935
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,100
Like they're mumbling

936
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,000
I've been guessing

937
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,420
What Dr. Howell says

938
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,580
For 20 years

939
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,980
Because I get tired

940
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,260
Of going

941
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,900
Sorry

942
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,260
Sorry Howell

943
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,160
Can you say that again

944
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,040
Okay I'll say it again

945
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,940
They always overdo it

946
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,240
You know

947
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,420
Yeah

948
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,220
They get it

949
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,020
It's almost like

950
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,380
They're angry

951
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:40,780
They're angry

952
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,040
Because you didn't hear

953
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,980
Yeah so they

954
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,060
So they say it like

955
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,880
Way louder than anyone

956
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,020
Would ever need it to be

957
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm just differently

958
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,180
Hearinged

959
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,600
You're different

960
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,440
I can hear you guys

961
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:52,780
Fine

962
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,960
Of course I'm in headphones

963
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,640
They're cranked

964
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,560
All the way up

965
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,500
You know our TV

966
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,320
Is set on

967
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,080
A hundred

968
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,980
All the time

969
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,260
My grandsons

970
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,960
Came in

971
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,800
And literally

972
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,840
Like screamed

973
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,940
When I turned on

974
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,780
The Wii or something

975
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,260
They were like

976
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,960
Turn it off

977
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,100
Where's the volume

978
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,680
Please

979
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,460
Where's the remote

980
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,500
Please grandfather

981
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,880
Don't hurt us

982
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,760
That's my sister's TV

983
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,560
We never found

984
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,400
The remote for it

985
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,740
No

986
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,240
Stop hurting

987
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,020
His grandfather

988
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,680
Yeah

989
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,900
It was like that

990
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,260
They were going

991
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,460
Alexander goes

992
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,240
It's turned up

993
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,000
To a hundred

994
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,380
And I said

995
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,940
Welcome to the world

996
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,980
Of the hard of hearing

997
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,420
Boys

998
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,880
And I said

999
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,860
They just

1000
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,920
Couldn't grok it

1001
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,940
They've been forgetting

1002
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,820
That their entire lives

1003
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,680
Those poor sons of

1004
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Grandsons

1005
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,660
Those poor sons

1006
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,180
Of your

1007
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,040
Sons of our sons

1008
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,500
Sons of the pioneers

1009
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,060
Those poor sons

1010
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,980
Of your daughter

1011
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,700
Those guys

1012
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,740
Have it pretty good

1013
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,020
Let me tell you

1014
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,820
They really do

1015
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,120
Yeah

1016
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,520
These kids

1017
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,200
These days

1018
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,360
They don't have to

1019
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,960
Try anymore

1020
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,700
They don't

1021
00:26:59,700 --> 00:26:59,980
They don't

1022
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,420
We can't do that

1023
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,240
We can't do that

1024
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,880
They don't try

1025
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,420
They do

1026
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,260
These zombies

1027
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,380
These days

1028
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:05,940
They don't have to try

1029
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,700
These zombies

1030
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,180
These days

1031
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,040
They don't try

1032
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,840
Now when I was a zombie

1033
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,320
We got up at

1034
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,000
Five o'clock in the morning

1035
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,880
To eat the face

1036
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,300
Of a

1037
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,400
Of a grandma

1038
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,200
Of a grandma

1039
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,260
Yeah but see

1040
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,940
We're ripping off

1041
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,020
Jane or Hyperclits

1042
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,300
And

1043
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,280
No no

1044
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,720
And that means

1045
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,580
We owe him a million

1046
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,700
More dollars now

1047
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:22,720
That's right

1048
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,760
That's exactly right

1049
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,240
Just for those

1050
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,280
Five or ten words

1051
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,860
Just for mentioning

1052
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,320
His name

1053
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,760
He's gonna

1054
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,460
He's gonna

1055
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,000
Stange me

1056
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,700
Ripping me off

1057
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,680
He sold thousands

1058
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,940
Of Jane or device tapes

1059
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,340
I know

1060
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,140
Cause I've met

1061
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,800
Three people

1062
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,140
Who just

1063
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,500
Memorized parts of it

1064
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,460
Yeah

1065
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
That means

1066
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:37,960
He sold

1067
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,440
Probably

1068
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,920
Two or three thousand

1069
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,820
Hundred thousand

1070
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,000
We sold nine a year

1071
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,620
Like we sold

1072
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,460
Of all the media

1073
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,360
Barrage tapes

1074
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,920
Till we pulled it

1075
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,420
That's about how many

1076
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,260
Tapes we sold

1077
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,340
Back then

1078
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,140
Oddly enough

1079
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,860
We're doing a little

1080
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,520
Better now

1081
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,000
Although whenever

1082
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,280
Somebody buys a CD

1083
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,880
I know they're old

1084
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,780
I know it's a really

1085
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,480
Old person

1086
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:57,860
You know

1087
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,060
I think the

1088
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,040
Church is starting

1089
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,960
To hit its stride

1090
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,000
We're really

1091
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,640
Kind of now

1092
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,300
Finally

1093
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,120
Starting to

1094
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,940
Take off a little bit

1095
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,360
After

1096
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:08,960
We are

1097
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,900
Well maybe in the next

1098
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,460
I can

1099
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,400
We've been saying that

1100
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,080
For forty years

1101
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,020
I think I'm seeing

1102
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,820
A little rise

1103
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,640
In the trajectory

1104
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,040
In these numbers here

1105
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,560
Well

1106
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,100
Sandy Boone's

1107
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,580
Seems like

1108
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,400
Award winning

1109
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,320
Documentary

1110
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:23,900
Maybe the world

1111
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,740
Is tilting

1112
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,420
And the church

1113
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,380
Of the subgenius

1114
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,160
Available on

1115
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,860
Apple TV

1116
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,100
And Fandango

1117
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,680
And others

1118
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,940
Can you buy that DVD

1119
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,320
On Amazon

1120
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:32,840
Or anything

1121
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,460
You can't buy the DVD

1122
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,940
Period

1123
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,900
I can

1124
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,240
But I mean

1125
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,120
Are they

1126
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,940
Do they have plans

1127
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,760
On producing

1128
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,440
DVD

1129
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,420
No

1130
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,060
Really

1131
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,420
Nobody

1132
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,980
Put optical

1133
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,740
Here's the last

1134
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,460
My son said this to me

1135
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,260
Dad

1136
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,400
I think you're the last

1137
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,040
Person I know

1138
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,680
That still uses

1139
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,740
Optical media

1140
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,700
It took me a minute

1141
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,140
To realize

1142
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,180
He meant DVDs

1143
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,580
And CDs

1144
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,980
Here's what I say

1145
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,580
We're using

1146
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,820
Offline media

1147
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,060
Really

1148
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,140
Yeah

1149
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,080
Offline media

1150
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,900
Offline media

1151
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,420
Yeah

1152
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,780
Optical media

1153
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,660
Is a type of

1154
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,820
Offline media son

1155
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,080
Someday

1156
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,000
We won't all be

1157
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,080
Connected to the internet

1158
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,640
Anymore

1159
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,380
And I'll still be

1160
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,200
Watching a movie

1161
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,640
I've been thinking

1162
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,320
About teaching

1163
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,120
I've been thinking

1164
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,580
About teaching

1165
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,560
Workshops

1166
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,060
At places like

1167
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,740
Starwood

1168
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,220
Or Harvard University

1169
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,980
About

1170
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
Data

1171
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,740
Capture

1172
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,380
Post

1173
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
Internet

1174
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,920
You know

1175
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,560
Post electricity

1176
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,720
Data capture

1177
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,520
Right

1178
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,720
I would introduce

1179
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,300
Them to

1180
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,260
The pencil

1181
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,820
And the

1182
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,660
Sheet

1183
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,500
Of paper

1184
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,220
Right

1185
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,180
Which a lot of people

1186
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,900
Don't even

1187
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,980
You know

1188
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,680
It's like they don't

1189
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,100
You know what else

1190
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,560
You can do

1191
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,340
You can teach them

1192
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,040
The code of

1193
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,800
Cursive handwriting

1194
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,640
It's a special code

1195
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,040
Oh yeah

1196
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,940
That only some people

1197
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,480
Can read

1198
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,680
Yeah it's a secret

1199
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,500
That's secret

1200
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,740
It's a secret type of

1201
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,620
Code now

1202
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,960
Yeah

1203
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,200
Right

1204
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,040
That's why they wrote

1205
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,100
The Declaration of Independence

1206
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,700
That way

1207
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,140
So nobody

1208
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,200
So no one could read it

1209
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,540
Yeah

1210
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
They don't even know

1211
00:29:59,540 --> 00:29:59,880
What language

1212
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,980
They don't want to read it

1213
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,280
Yeah

1214
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
It would hurt their eyes

1215
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,100
To learn to read it

1216
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,660
And their brains

1217
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,680
Trump had trouble

1218
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,440
Reading it

1219
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,140
In a

1220
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,940
You know

1221
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,600
Typed up

1222
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,820
Printed script form

1223
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,540
And he goes

1224
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,220
It's almost like

1225
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,040
A foreign language

1226
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,520
Isn't it

1227
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,700
No

1228
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,020
It's actually

1229
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,880
Modern English

1230
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,440
Who was this

1231
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,760
Trump

1232
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,640
Yeah

1233
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:18,920
He was

1234
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,660
They were recording

1235
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,560
They had all the

1236
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,100
Presidents that were alive

1237
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,260
And a bunch of other people

1238
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,180
Reading parts of

1239
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,440
The Declaration of Independence

1240
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,800
The Constitution

1241
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah

1242
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,340
Or the

1243
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,680
Maybe it's the Constitution

1244
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,640
And

1245
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,700
Each one had a different paragraph

1246
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,160
And apparently

1247
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,180
The tape of Trump

1248
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,920
Trying to do it

1249
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,420
Is like the

1250
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,900
Colonel Sanders

1251
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,260
Tape

1252
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,560
You know

1253
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:40,920
He's like

1254
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,660
He couldn't

1255
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,040
He never got a good take of it

1256
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,760
And he just

1257
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,880
He didn't really understand

1258
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,900
Some of the words

1259
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,820
Do you remember that

1260
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,200
That one where

1261
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,600
It had Orson Welles

1262
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,180
The peas

1263
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,680
Yeah

1264
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,320
The peas

1265
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,400
That's so classic

1266
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,380
I love that

1267
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,320
See those aren't prank calls

1268
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,360
We could cut to those

1269
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,040
He's taken apart

1270
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,620
He's taken apart

1271
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:01,620


1272
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:01,620


1273
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,500
The whole

1274
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,840
Telling them what a

1275
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,460
Poor job

1276
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:05,760
Right

1277
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,020
The writer's bad

1278
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,220
The director's bad

1279
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,200
He's just

1280
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,360
Tearing them apart

1281
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,340
Because they're telling him

1282
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,380
To read it a certain way

1283
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,780
You know

1284
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,260
Yeah

1285
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,580
It's just hilarious

1286
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,020
There's a whole bunch

1287
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,360
Of those

1288
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,740
Seems like

1289
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,520
Celebrity

1290
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,700
Celebrities

1291
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,360
At their worst

1292
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,420
That's what it was

1293
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,320
Celebrities at their worst

1294
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,920
I bet

1295
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,500
And they have like

1296
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,200
John Wayne

1297
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,860
And he's drunk

1298
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,880
And he's doing

1299
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
Something on stage

1300
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,140
Yeah he's talking

1301
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,540
To a cop

1302
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:31,900
To a college

1303
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,180
Yeah

1304
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,080
A college

1305
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,120
Graduation

1306
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,040
And just a whole bunch

1307
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,880
Of people that were

1308
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,520
Really

1309
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,300
Used to play that

1310
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,900
Yeah

1311
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,040
Chaz played that

1312
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,300
John Wayne won a lot

1313
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,800
Yeah

1314
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,340
The drunken celebrities

1315
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,440
I like that stuff

1316
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,060
Trump will be on

1317
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,860
One of those someday

1318
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,760
Oh god

1319
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,440
I can't even

1320
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:50,560
Imagine

1321
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,000
Remember that idiot

1322
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,780
George Bush

1323
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,680
All the things he would say

1324
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,380
We're putting

1325
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,980
We're trying to put

1326
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,100
Food on

1327
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,500
What did he say

1328
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,860
I'm putting

1329
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,420
Putting

1330
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,020
You're trying

1331
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,880
It's tough for you

1332
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,620
To put food on

1333
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,180
Your family

1334
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,820
Yeah and you know

1335
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,760
Fool me once

1336
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,400
Fool me twice

1337
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,100
You know

1338
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,440
Yeah

1339
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,600
Frankly I totally

1340
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,000
It's like

1341
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,700
Bush had so many gaffes

1342
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,360
But that's the way

1343
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,080
People talk

1344
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,240
I mean come on

1345
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,940
That's actually

1346
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,180
If you cherry pick

1347
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,380
Anybody talking in public

1348
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,660
You're gonna

1349
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,480
You can easily

1350
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,540
Pull up all kinds

1351
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:23,980
Of embarrassing

1352
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,640
And now

1353
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,480
Nobody can

1354
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,080
And there's no

1355
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,500
Private

1356
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,620
Privacy anymore

1357
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,100
So

1358
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,280
And everybody has

1359
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,600
Everybody's a reporter

1360
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,500
With a cell phone

1361
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,340
You know

1362
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,680
So you can't escape

1363
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,380
The gaffe anymore

1364
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,160
Somebody's gonna get it

1365
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,940
Well it's perfectly

1366
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,340
Normal

1367
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,820
And of course

1368
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,500
Any gaffe

1369
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,100
By anybody

1370
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,440
Of any importance

1371
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,600
Or anybody

1372
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,440
You don't like

1373
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,280
If it's somebody

1374
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,820
You don't like

1375
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,920
It's the stupidest

1376
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,180
It's proof of senility

1377
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,780
It's whatever

1378
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,040
It doesn't matter

1379
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,800
It's well hey

1380
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,460
Anybody can

1381
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,080
You know

1382
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,560
Stutter

1383
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,420
But it all gets

1384
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,520
Transformed into

1385
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,460
It transformed into

1386
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,140
Clicks eventually

1387
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,260
You know

1388
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,440
Yeah

1389
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,520
Cause it's all about

1390
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,860
Traffic and you know

1391
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,480
Selling average

1392
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,140
Advertising

1393
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,720
That's

1394
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,600
What rhymes the world

1395
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,580
I used to think

1396
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,620
That algorithm stuff

1397
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,860
Was sort of sci-fi

1398
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,020
But now I've realized

1399
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,980
It's real

1400
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,560
It's real

1401
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,380
Very real

1402
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,020
It's super real

1403
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,480
It's

1404
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,640
Neil Stevenson's

1405
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,960
Novel Fall

1406
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,900
You still didn't

1407
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,560
Watch that movie

1408
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,500
I wanted you to watch

1409
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:19,940
Did you

1410
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,260
The documentary

1411
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,940
Social network

1412
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,260
Social dilemma

1413
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,040
Yeah I did

1414
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,360
You did

1415
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,780
I sure did

1416
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,320
I watched the hell

1417
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,840
Out of it

1418
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,300
Scared the pee water

1419
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,760
Out of me

1420
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:28,940
Yeah

1421
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,180
When I first saw that

1422
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,920
That's when I decided

1423
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,340
To quit

1424
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,580
Facebook

1425
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,840
It was the guys

1426
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,860
Who invented the internet

1427
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,380
Going man this stuff

1428
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,020
Is dangerous

1429
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,900
I don't want my kids

1430
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,280
On this

1431
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,900
People that worked

1432
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,080
For Facebook and Google

1433
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,360
And different

1434
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,820
And Twitter

1435
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,480
Yeah were higher ups

1436
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,420
I mean these were like

1437
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,080
People in high

1438
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,480
Responsibility

1439
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,180
And talking about

1440
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,840
Those algorithms

1441
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,240
And how they're designed

1442
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,820
To

1443
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,760
To

1444
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,880
To inflame you

1445
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,200
Yeah

1446
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,280
Because that's

1447
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,500
That's what you click on

1448
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:52,800
The most

1449
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,480
You're more active

1450
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,680
You do more scrolling

1451
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,480
And more liking

1452
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,380
And more reading

1453
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,480
And posting

1454
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,360
Now see the next

1455
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,400
Generation of phones

1456
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,960
Will track your eye movements

1457
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,580
Yeah

1458
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,260
So you won't even

1459
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,920
Have to click

1460
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
It'll know exactly

1461
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,180
What words

1462
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:05,980
And what images

1463
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,840
You're looking at

1464
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,080
In my case

1465
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,800
That's not a problem

1466
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,200
Because

1467
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,120
When you want to post

1468
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,400
You'll just blink your eyes

1469
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,220
No

1470
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,520
Yeah

1471
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,300
Right

1472
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,240
Oh well you won't

1473
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,760
Even have to

1474
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,820
When you want to like something

1475
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,020
You blink your left eye twice

1476
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,900
It's just automatically

1477
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,200
Saying what it thinks

1478
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,880
You would say

1479
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,500
Yeah

1480
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,600
You don't even have to

1481
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:23,940
It says

1482
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,760
Oh I know this guy so well

1483
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,960
He's looking at the like button

1484
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,680
That's all I need

1485
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,620
Is to indicate

1486
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,680
The like button now

1487
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:30,960
Well

1488
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,120
We all three noticed

1489
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,860
That all of a sudden

1490
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,780
Our phones were making

1491
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,740
These little movies

1492
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,180
And

1493
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,760
Which they've always done

1494
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,380
But they were really

1495
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,220
Pushing them at us

1496
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,820
This morning

1497
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,380
I was

1498
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,420
Typing

1499
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,360
Keystrokes

1500
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,760
That said

1501
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,660
Philo's coming

1502
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,100
Actually

1503
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,000
Philo's coming

1504
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,940
Hide your frock girls

1505
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,420
Philo's coming

1506
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,000
Hide yourselves cats

1507
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,200
And so forth

1508
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,440
But

1509
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,840
The

1510
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,080
My phone went

1511
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,180
Oh Philo's coming

1512
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:55,960
So it made

1513
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,320
A Philo collage

1514
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,080
Of all the pictures

1515
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,060
In my phone

1516
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,520
Of Dr. Philo Drummond

1517
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:00,960
Which were

1518
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,820
Of course

1519
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,880
Hilarious

1520
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,480
And it put this

1521
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,420
Inappropriate

1522
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,840
Sappy music with it

1523
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,900
And made it even funnier

1524
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,080
Don't you think

1525
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,640
I look better

1526
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,780
Cutting off that nasty

1527
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,820
Big old beard though

1528
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,840
Well

1529
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,640
It got pretty big

1530
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,920
You did look like

1531
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,040
A cartoon character

1532
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,540
Yeah

1533
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,200
And

1534
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,040
Now you just look like

1535
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,640
Any old

1536
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,480
Very

1537
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,500
Very old

1538
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:26,780
Cable

1539
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,180
Old cable splicer

1540
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,620
Yeah

1541
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,220
Cable

1542
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,440
Old cable guy

1543
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:30,720
Yeah

1544
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,900
Old pharmaceutical salesman

1545
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,320
Well

1546
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,380
You looked more like

1547
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,740
A farmer with that beard

1548
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,540
You know

1549
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:39,880
Yeah

1550
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,080
Particularly with my

1551
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
Overalls on

1552
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,440
Yeah

1553
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,020
The funny thing is

1554
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,120
Dr. Drummond

1555
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,180
Is a farmer

1556
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,000
That's true

1557
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,620
He is

1558
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,620
He's a real farmer

1559
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,580
He's an actual farmer

1560
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,480
I'm not

1561
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,380
I live in a ranch

1562
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,340
You're a rancher

1563
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,920
And I'm a farmer

1564
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,080
No I'm not

1565
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,500
My brother is a rancher

1566
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,360
You are a rancher

1567
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,260
You have all kinds of

1568
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,320
Livestock around here

1569
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,100
I see them

1570
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,500
Canine livestock

1571
00:35:59,500 --> 00:35:59,780
I really like

1572
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,520
Ranch dogs and cats

1573
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,360
Canine and feline livestock

1574
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,160
But nonetheless

1575
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,420
They require a lot of

1576
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,700
Kibble and food

1577
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,540
And walking

1578
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,060
And cleaning up after

1579
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,200
Canine livestock

1580
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,040
And key lime livestock

1581
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,760
Feline

1582
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,560
Oh feline

1583
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,180
Okay

1584
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,440
Generally what's referred to

1585
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,980
As livestock

1586
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,880
Doesn't live in your house

1587
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,920
Or sleep on your bed

1588
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,720
Not anymore

1589
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,160
But back in the olden times

1590
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,660
When they first started

1591
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,880
They had the livestock

1592
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,120
Right in the house with them

1593
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,960
They only had one room

1594
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,500
And they were keeping them

1595
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,480
Warm in bed

1596
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,920
What about that red goat

1597
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,340
Up there

1598
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,020
Didn't that goat

1599
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,900
Live in your house

1600
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,900
Reverend Stang

1601
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,720
That was the

1602
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,920
The first or second goat

1603
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,440
That my

1604
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,880
My parents got

1605
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,040
Before it was ever

1606
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,760
A goat ranch

1607
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,500
And I don't know what

1608
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,520
Possessed them

1609
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,240
To get a goat

1610
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,120
But they

1611
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,280
They kept it

1612
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,740
They took it back and forth

1613
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,620
Between Richardson

1614
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,700
Near Dallas

1615
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,940
And out here

1616
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,220
At the newly built ranch

1617
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,420
That particular goat

1618
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,460
Old Big Red

1619
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,140
Is his name

1620
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,500
Big Red

1621
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,680
Princess Wee

1622
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,500
Is referring to it

1623
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,200
A mounted goat head

1624
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,040
A huge goat

1625
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,500
Domestic goat head

1626
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,140
That's mounted

1627
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,440
Up on the wall

1628
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,100
With Dr. Seuss like horns

1629
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,160
Like a wild animal

1630
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,460
Yeah

1631
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,680
Like as if it was

1632
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,520
Some wild animal

1633
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,140
That had been shot

1634
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,380
That was actually a pet

1635
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,960
But it went wild

1636
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,700
It went feral

1637
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Like Boo Boo did

1638
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,580
That one time

1639
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,740
And Boo Boo went

1640
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,900
Boo Boo runs wild

1641
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,160
Yeah

1642
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,980
And the goat was running around

1643
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,940
Actually this happened

1644
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,280
In Trailer Park Boys game

1645
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,340
Willie Goat did the same thing

1646
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:30,480
He was running around

1647
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,420
And became a rapist

1648
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,020
It was a male goat

1649
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,680
A billy goat

1650
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,140
And it started raping

1651
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,080
It went off the hook

1652
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,500
It was off the hook

1653
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,020
And it was causing

1654
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,320
Total mayhem

1655
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,940
And destruction

1656
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,680
To other goats

1657
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,740
We didn't have

1658
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,980
Was it having its way

1659
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,040
With the female goats

1660
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,880
Yes but they weren't our goats

1661
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,080
They were other people's goats

1662
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,040
Were they bearing the young

1663
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,220
Of this crazy goat

1664
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,880
I don't know

1665
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,680
I don't know

1666
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,500
But there he is

1667
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,400
That's what happens

1668
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,580
If you start raping

1669
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,880
You start raping

1670
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,480
If you're raping

1671
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:00,660
You're a

1672
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,800
You end up on a wall

1673
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,320
Pet

1674
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,220
And you start raping

1675
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,620
Your head might end up

1676
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,580
On the wall like that

1677
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,060
That's not people don't

1678
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,880
Goats don't like that

1679
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,900
Any more than people do

1680
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,920
There's a big old

1681
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,780
Bighorn sheep

1682
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,140
My dad shot that

1683
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,060
Bighorn sheep

1684
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,840
And that bear

1685
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,400
And that jackalope

1686
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:18,840
Up there

1687
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,640
Yeah

1688
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,500
He shot that jackalope

1689
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,200
There is in fact

1690
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,080
A jackalope

1691
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Mounted head

1692
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,260
On the wall

1693
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,940
It's been

1694
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,460
It was here

1695
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,440
When we moved in

1696
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,520
Oh so you can say

1697
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:29,960
That these

1698
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,460
You didn't

1699
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,040
You didn't actually kill

1700
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,300
Any of these creatures yourself

1701
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:32,560
Me?

1702
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:32,900
No

1703
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,240
I only shoot

1704
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,920
I hunt

1705
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,440
Dr. Drummond

1706
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,500
I'm an avid hunter

1707
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,160
But I hunt with a camera

1708
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,620
Don't you see?

1709
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,400
Oh yeah I know

1710
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:41,860
I know

1711
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,420
The dogs and I hunt too

1712
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,360
Are you going to have

1713
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,460
A big year this year?

1714
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,320
Oh

1715
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,020
I don't

1716
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,960
Probably not

1717
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,300
Did you watch

1718
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,160
See that movie?

1719
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,300
Everything's going extinct

1720
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,120
No

1721
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,400
That was kind of

1722
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,080
Jack Black and

1723
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,340
Jack Black and

1724
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,460
Steve Martin

1725
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
Are both

1726
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,080
Bird watchers

1727
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,940
Oh no

1728
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,000
I meant to

1729
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,900
Check that out

1730
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,340
I thought that might be fun

1731
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,780
You could tell

1732
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,420
You know like

1733
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,440
Probably Jack Black

1734
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,360
Wanted to work with

1735
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,780
Steve Martin

1736
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,400
You know

1737
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,740
I would

1738
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,860
Sure

1739
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,080
I'd like to work

1740
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,140
With either one of those guys

1741
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,560
What is this thing?

1742
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,160
It's another spaceship

1743
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,960
But it requires

1744
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,340
A cord

1745
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,940
You feed a cord into it

1746
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,640
And you pull it out

1747
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,240
And it flashes

1748
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,340
And makes noises

1749
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,860
Friends

1750
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,120
But I don't have the cord

1751
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,680
Tarzan's radio station

1752
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,200
Is loaded

1753
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,460
Is all powered by

1754
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:30,580
A cordless radio

1755
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:30,580


1756
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,920
On a fairly small table

1757
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,200
But it's really decorated

1758
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,500
There's a

1759
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,860
A replica 3D model

1760
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,580
Of the moon

1761
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,680
Up there

1762
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,400
And a giant

1763
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,460
Cabbage worm

1764
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,780
Rubber toy

1765
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
On top of a

1766
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,440
Reel-to-reel

1767
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,820
Four track recorder

1768
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
That hasn't worked

1769
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,280
For years

1770
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,400
It just looks cool

1771
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,620
And this spaceship

1772
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,560
And there's

1773
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,600
Three spaceships

1774
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,920
Princess Wee has one

1775
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,540
You've got one

1776
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,020
And here's

1777
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,200
Here's the good one

1778
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,760
Man

1779
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:55,920
Oh my gosh

1780
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,120
Oh my gosh

1781
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,200
That's a classic

1782
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,080
Spaceship sound

1783
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,540
Yeah

1784
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,460
Who sent us this?

1785
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,560
Uh

1786
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,340
Uh

1787
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,620
Cosmic Layla

1788
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,260
Layla

1789
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,140
That's right

1790
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,000
Cosmic Layla

1791
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,360
Cosmic Layla

1792
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,660
Yeah

1793
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,320
What a character

1794
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,920
Yeah

1795
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,900
Wee Ma Ma

1796
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,500
The 92 year old

1797
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,180
That lives here

1798
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,600
She sat

1799
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,860
And played this thing

1800
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,660
Over and over

1801
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,780
And over again

1802
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,160
One

1803
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,120
When she first

1804
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,200
We first got it

1805
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,960
She just

1806
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,600
She couldn't

1807
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,280
She was fascinated

1808
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,020
Off of it

1809
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,300
Yeah

1810
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,040
She played that

1811
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,540
Like over and over and over

1812
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,720
It's a very haunting melody

1813
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,260
It's kind of Mars Attacks

1814
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,260
And it's a Mars Attacks

1815
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,240
Looking plastic spaceship

1816
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,180
Yeah it's obviously

1817
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,260
Someone taking advantage of

1818
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:45,620
Friends listen

1819
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,480
The environment we're in

1820
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,200
Is a

1821
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,060
Kind of across

1822
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,180
The decor is

1823
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,920
Crossed between

1824
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,960
Western

1825
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,000
A fairly tasteful

1826
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,860
Western style

1827
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,240
With landscape paintings

1828
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,700
And

1829
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,000
Uh

1830
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,020
You know

1831
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,020


1832
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,880
Subgenius

1833
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,900
Slack altar

1834
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,540
Archie McPhee

1835
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,440
Susie the floozy

1836
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,040
Bull daughter

1837
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,340
Like many subgenius houses

1838
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,100
Every

1839
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,540
Bit of

1840
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,520
Horizontal surface

1841
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,020
Okay enough of that

1842
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,620
Taken up with

1843
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,140
Enough of that

1844
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,020
Knick knacks

1845
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,880
Toy dinosaurs

1846
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,400
Skulls

1847
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,580
Real skulls

1848
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,040
Fake skulls

1849
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,180
There's a

1850
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,360
Up just over our

1851
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,820
Mantelpiece

1852
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,540
It is quite the collection

1853
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,040
There's

1854
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,680
There's a

1855
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,440
A

1856
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:29,720
A

1857
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:29,800
A

1858
00:41:30,020 --> 00:42:00,020


1859
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:30,020


1860
00:42:30,020 --> 00:43:00,020


1861
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:30,020


1862
00:43:30,020 --> 00:44:00,020


1863
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:30,020


1864
00:44:30,020 --> 00:45:00,020


1865
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:30,020


1866
00:45:30,020 --> 00:46:00,020


1867
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:30,020


1868
00:46:30,020 --> 00:47:00,020


1869
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:30,020


1870
00:47:30,020 --> 00:48:00,020


1871
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:30,020


1872
00:48:30,020 --> 00:49:00,020


1873
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:30,020


1874
00:49:30,020 --> 00:50:00,020


1875
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:30,020


1876
00:50:30,020 --> 00:51:00,020


1877
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:30,020


1878
00:51:30,020 --> 00:52:00,020


1879
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:30,020


1880
00:52:30,020 --> 00:53:00,020


1881
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:30,020

00:57:30,020 --> 00:58:00,020

00:58:30,020 --> 00:59:00,020


1893
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:26,400
