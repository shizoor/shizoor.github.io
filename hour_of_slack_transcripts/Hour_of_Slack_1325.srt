1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
Are you crazy?

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,140
Yeah, why not?

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:02,880
Okay.

4
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,280
Okay.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,260
Within five years, the United States, as we know it, will cease to exist.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,480
We're living in terrible, fearless, chaotic times.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,880
Praise the Lord.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,040
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,380
Amen.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,880
They're going to get worse and worse.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,480
Okay, I know you all think you want to know what's going on.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,680
That's okay.

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,140
So I saw this thing coming.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,060
I saw this thing coming to me.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,340
I didn't know what it was, but...

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,420
It looked funny.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,280
There were deceptions which have surrounded our space program.

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,200
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants,

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,320
it must have been very disconcerting for them to cross millions of miles of space

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,180
only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,780
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects

22
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,980
as those which were found in the space of space,

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,260
the first called flying saucers,

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,440
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,720
who let their imaginations run away with their veracity.

26
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,720
By 1950, some of these characters were beginning to spin their stories

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,580
of fantastic conversations with alleged space people.

28
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,740
Some of them expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,000
Suddenly, everything went black and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little tiny room

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,320
where nobody was listening to me.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,960
And I was talking to this hot guy.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,980
I was talking to this hot little plush felt red rubber-tipped microphone.

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,740
Not hearing a thing and seeing only little tiny lights.

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,800
And wondering why I was strapped to this chair and put into this studio

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,460
that seemed to be rotating very rapidly with lights flashing off rhythmically.

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,280
And it was a small man with a swollen head and hideously deformed eyes

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,760
sitting behind the console pushing the buttons

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,080
while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body.

39
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,320
And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me.

40
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,740
And I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there.

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,100
And they didn't say anything.

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,620
They just kept flashing those lights at me and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

43
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,680
And the man with the funny head, the leader, the man with the strange grin and the pipe.

44
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,720
Well, I just want to know, do you want to be in the church or out of the church?

45
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,880
And where's your wallet?

46
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,000
The DC9 pushing the buttons.

47
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,300
Yeah.

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,340
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up and it wasn't really a dream

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,040
until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

50
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,760
And suddenly it all came back to me.

51
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,440
All the pencils were gone.

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,340
They'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life

53
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,960
when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,700
and made me talk and talk and talk and talk.

55
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,960
Well, it's only an hour and a half tonight, mister.

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,300
And talk.

57
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,620
And talk.

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,480
Because you only paid for an hour and a half.

59
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,020
Of all the worlds that the intelligences on Mars could see and study,

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,840
only our own warm Earth,

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,520
where there are titanic drifts of lava and ice with hydrogen flaming at the tops,

62
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,420
where the atmospheric temperature is at its highest,

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
where the atmospheric pressure is terrible,

64
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,860
it has no air,

65
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,300
it's green with the methane gas,

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,820
pneumonia vapor.

67
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,340
Spacecraft entered the moon's gravitational field in the sixth segment of the flight.

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,520
The gravity of the moon is one sixth of that on Earth.

69
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:55,320
The orbit around the moon was flown 66 miles above the moon's surface at 6,000 miles an hour.

70
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,440
At 10 after 9, the beeping began.

71
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,680
We went down to the reserve fence, watched through binoculars, and we did see this thing.

72
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,940
It's about the size of the moon, with a small crescent at the bottom that's well lit like starlight.

73
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,020
The top is a dark gray mass.

74
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,360
It came down through the trees, whatever it was.

75
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,840
Have you ever heard of one?

76
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,240
Have you ever been in one?

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,220
Have you ever seen one?

78
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,880
Have you by television ever seen one?

79
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,420
If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this side of the moon has ever seen.

80
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,440
The people from this Earth have already seen some of their spacecraft,

81
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,720
which they call flying saucers,

82
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,480
and other flying objects which they cannot describe.

83
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,920
These objects are real and are spacecraft.

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,180
Total collapse of world civilization.

85
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,460
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,

86
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,340
the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,340
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses, the true believer subgeniuses,

88
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,980
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

89
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,020
...to carry a few picked survivors of our doomed civilization

90
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,420
to a new life on another world.

91
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,440
For a minute there, it was almost just like the real hour of slack,

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,920
with nobody but me and the cassette machine.

93
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,940
With the ancient collages from X days past,

94
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,720
when we waited and waited for them to come.

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,000
What happened to Princess Wei?

96
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,580
She and I had a little ditty to open the show with.

97
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,340
Ah, well, if you want me to stand clear, I will.

98
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,340
As soon as she appears.

99
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,160
And I ran into Papa Joe.

100
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,860
Oh, there she is.

101
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,000
The Bobby Awards are later on today, I think it's 7 o'clock.

102
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,840
That's right.

103
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,640
The coveted Bobby Awards.

104
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,540
And isn't there supposed to be a pile of documents here

105
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,860
that I'm supposed to be signing or calligraphing or something?

106
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,120
Princess Wei indicated that I'd be...

107
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,760
Can you hand them over?

108
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,180
I need to start doing that while we perform our Bobcast here.

109
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,720
It is an example of multitasking.

110
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,860
Dr. Hal is able to do a painting and play chess

111
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,000
while ranting on a radio show and eating dinner.

112
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,940
Oh, are we in the middle of a broadcast?

113
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,420
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.

114
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,920
We got a little bit confused there.

115
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,080
Actually, there will be the Bobby Awards,

116
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,920
and you do get, if you happen to be a recipient,

117
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,700
which I think we have more awards than we actually have people here.

118
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,640
And this year we're...

119
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,860
We're going to be at the main stage rather than here.

120
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,520
We're going to cut the acceptance.

121
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,320
The acceptance speech is down to 30 seconds time this year.

122
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,120
And, yes, friends, welcome to Subgenius Hour of Slack,

123
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,000
number 1,300 and something, something, something.

124
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,280
That's how many there have actually been,

125
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:19,460
although we do rerun something every now and then, don't we, Miss Volume Test?

126
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,380
Yes, we rerun things from time to time.

127
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,920
Let's see.

128
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,240
So we can turn down the mole people, I think.

129
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,900
Oh.

130
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,180
Well, this tune doesn't go with it.

131
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,280
We have a special tune for Wisteria.

132
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:43,460
This is a little ditty that Princess We wrote mostly, I think.

133
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,960
And you have a copy of it right here.

134
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,760
Oh, how nice.

135
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,060
That you doodled all over.

136
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,160
Okay.

137
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,720
Okay.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,540
Um...

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,260
I'm letting a pregnant pause go by.

140
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,360
I also need to clear my throat.

141
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,280
I'm a little bit...

142
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,300
I don't know about the rest of you all,

143
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,300
but I'm starting to get a bit crispy around the edges

144
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,220
after a few days of camping out and roughing it.

145
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,000
Of course, we're staying in a mansion downtown, but...

146
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
Still, for us, that's roughing it.

147
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
This story is better than better, Baaahbabbahbabbaahab.

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,180
That's much better.

149
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,500
What are you doing?

150
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,480
I'm multitasking again.

151
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,600
Yes, multitasking again, dear.

152
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,080
Okay.

153
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,180
You start us off, because you know keys and things.

154
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,080
The old place in Sherman is taint.

155
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,460
It's the one place that Ex Day just ain't!

156
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,780
We thought of Vegas and more

157
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,480
But none of them made the score

158
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,960
There's St. Fulton's Yard in New Jersey

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,340
And there's the Stang Ranch in Texarkersey

160
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,460
But things being how they are

161
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,500
A new place to play, you can bet we did scout

162
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,340
But the big bucks we need we ain't got

163
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,880
So wisteria's where it plays out

164
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:26,380
Why, it's good old reliable J.R.J.R.J.R.J.R. Bob Dobbs

165
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,140
If you're looking for weirdos, this here is the spot

166
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,380
Lookie here what we have found, it's pretty damn hot

167
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:39,740
Not for good old reliable J.R.J.R.J.R.J.R. Bob Dobbs

168
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,100
It's the youngest established permanent

169
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,100


170
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,480
Floating ex-day now in Ohio

171
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,500
There are weird abnormals everywhere, everywhere

172
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,140
There are bizzare cuties everywhere

173
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,540
And an awful lot of slackin' for the subs to get a packin' there

174
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,620
If we only had that bastard J.R. Bob, we could be a millionaire

175
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,920
That's a good old reliable J.R.J.R.J.R.J.R. Bob Dobbs

176
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,200
If you're looking for mutants

177
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,580
This here is the club

178
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,920
You know you ain't no genius, you're only a sub

179
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,280
At the end of the world we call ex-day

180
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,060
Ex-day, ex-day, ex-day, 14th

181
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,600
It's the youngest established permanent

182
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,360
Floating ex-day now in Ohio

183
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,520
Where's the party? Where's the day?

184
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,520
Gotta have ex-day so we all get saved

185
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,020
It's the youngest established permanent

186
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,440
Floating ex-day now in Ohio

187
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,200
They're so charitable.

188
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,560
I know that must have been kind of painful.

189
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,320
Princess Wee is a professional singer, and I am not.

190
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,660
Sort of.

191
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,360
But I do have a good vocabulary.

192
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,440
Ha ha ha.

193
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,900
Hey, when was the pancake ritual?

194
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,260
Has that happened already?

195
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,940
I don't know.

196
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,280
I saw there were...

197
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:23,980
Huh?

198
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:34,520
Tomorrow at 11, at the main stage, free pancakes for all true subgeniuses.

199
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:41,520
And probably a few bums who will get in line, sneak in line anyway without their tags.

200
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,200
In the oldie tradition.

201
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,500
Of Reverend B and Annie.

202
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:55,300
In fact, there is a rant here that was posted by Reverend Sweetness McGee of the Ministry of Slack

203
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,240
about the pancake ritual.

204
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,160
As I had been saying, I'm so tired of all these traditions that we had.

205
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,340
Everything was getting so old at Brushwood.

206
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,300
It was always the same old thing every ex-day.

207
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,180
But then I realized...

208
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,080
Now we're trying to make them continue.

209
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,300
We thought that Reverend V, who usually supplies the sacred pancakes,

210
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,520
and any...

211
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,160
Reverend V was injured.

212
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,260
I assume that he wouldn't be able to make it.

213
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,360
I assume that he wouldn't be able to sit on the ground for hours on end flipping pancakes.

214
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,020
As Reverend McGee put it,

215
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,020
attired old traditions are one thing, but pancakes, sir, are a true staple.

216
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,160
Pancakes kept the ancients...

217
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,900
The ancient yetis fed on the cold hard trail during that long-ass trek out of the ruins of ancient Atlantis.

218
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,180
When proto-subgenius miners were attacked by loathsome subterranean splorch worms,

219
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,120
they slapped pancakes over the creature's eyes, rendering them blind.

220
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:08,860
Many a pancake has provided friendship and succor for a lonely alt-dot slack kook who can't get a friend or a date.

221
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,080
Pancakes are that marvelous thing that you get a craving for,

222
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,860
at 2 a.m. in the middle of the desert,

223
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:23,820
and can rest assured that there is a 24-hour diner ready to provide you with a tall stack dripping with butter and syrup.

224
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:30,580
Pancakes are not merely an alchemical delivery system for grains and Dobbs-needed energy.

225
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,800
Nay, they are the nearest thing to ambrosia that we have.

226
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:42,420
Was it not a pancake that was given to Mr. Simonton by the occupants of a landed UFO?

227
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,000
In Eagle River, Wisconsin in 1961?

228
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,560
A pancake given to him as payment?

229
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,920
Is this not a glimpse into the true place that pancakes have in the greater excess scheme?

230
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,800
Dobbs has said to use up those Euros, Yen, and Dollars, while we still got them.

231
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:10,020
Because after the rupture, it's strange, wriggling, twelfth-dimensional currencies that we cannot even begin to fathom.

232
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,960
Could it be...

233
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,160
that pancakes await us in...

234
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,500
in the great galactic bank vaults?

235
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,660
Trade them or eat them.

236
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Who gives a...

237
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,020
a shit?

238
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,280
What does that word mean?

239
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,300
Either way, you gain slack.

240
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,680
Wow.

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,560
That came out of nowhere, said Sweetness.

242
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,980
And that is truly, friends,

243
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,360
I never knew myself how holy and important the pancakes were

244
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,200
until they were gone.

245
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,540
And isn't that the way of slack?

246
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,960
Certainly is.

247
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,660
You don't appreciate it until it's taken away,

248
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,400
and then you realize how much slack you had all along.

249
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,920
Indeed, it's true.

250
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,140
It's only when it's suddenly taken away from you

251
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:03,100
that you realize, oh, it was great having lungs or teeth.

252
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,080
A liver.

253
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,280
A brain cell.

254
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,560
Being an air-breathing vertebrated animal.

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,240
Yes.

256
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,420
Feet.

257
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,700
We did at one point.

258
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,800
We did at one point.

259
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:12,800


260
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:12,800


261
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:12,800


262
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,160
Figure out the priorities in life,

263
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,540
and I believe there's a poster around here.

264
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,920
Don't you have the priorities in life diagram close to hand?

265
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,340
Always time for a little educational lesson.

266
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,220
Education?

267
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,580
This is Bob's keys to magic, isn't it?

268
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,340
They left, pancakes was left off of this.

269
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,760
Oh, we did that lesson yesterday.

270
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,180
We did that.

271
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,180


272
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,180


273
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,180


274
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,180


275
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,180


276
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,180


277
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,180


278
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,180


279
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,180


280
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:52,120
is the list of priorities. I trust some of you can read them. And we left off, number

281
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,940
zero actually should be, the very first thing you need is a physical universe in which to

282
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:05,740
exist, atoms and all of that business that goes with it. But, come on, let's face it,

283
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:12,440
you're going to need air first. Then you're going to need water pretty soon. And even

284
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:20,340
before you have to eat, you will have to pee. You can go without food for days, but you

285
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:27,080
can't go without peeing for very long. Believe you me, I tried to quit. I must have tried

286
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:34,180
to quit 150 times. But even the patches didn't help. Then you get food. You'll find that

287
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,720
you can't.

288
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:42,320
You can't go without sleep forever. Some of us are learning that for the first time this

289
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:53,560
very week. But you can wait until after you've slept to take an extra meditation. Notice

290
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:00,960
that slack itself is only number seven on the list of priorities. Money is only number

291
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,120
eight. Frop is way down there at nine.

292
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,560
Now, most people, you know, most kids, you go, what's the most important thing in your

293
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:19,060
life? Oh, sex, man, sex. Well, take it from me, kids. Your back not hurting is far more

294
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:27,440
important than sex. There are a few people here that know the truth of that. And Bob

295
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,460
is way down there at number 12.

296
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,380
Poor Bob.

297
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,000
You actually can live without Bob for a while.

298
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,860
And Bob is then followed, of course, by taxes. And then I think we left out room for number

299
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,620
14, which would have been death. Or pancakes, one or the other.

300
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,720
Hot pastrami sandwich.

301
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,500
One of those two.

302
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,320
Ooh, yeah. I'm liking this.

303
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,660
Now, Princess, we have to translate any heckling.

304
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:04,540
What?

305
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:04,940
What?

306
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,100


307
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,960
I'm rather deaf in both eyes.

308
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, Mandy was just mentioning the hot pastrami pancakes.

309
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,220
That's a reason to live.

310
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,180
Was that on? Was that not on?

311
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,700
It was off.

312
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,740
It was off? All that time?

313
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,380
Well, I'll, whatever.

314
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,760
Well, he'll eat his hat.

315
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,600
Yeah.

316
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,900
Actually, there was somebody.

317
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,140
He said they would eat their hat if there were over 111 subgeniuses here this week.

318
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,500
And I don't know what the exact count is, but I know I'm going to say that there were 112.

319
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,700
How's that? Let's all stick to that number.

320
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,280
Oh, man. I saw the list. There was 112 subgeniuses.

321
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,940
The 111 nut will have to eat his hat. He said he would.

322
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,380
He'll probably cheat.

323
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,400
And use a little candy hat or something.

324
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,020
Now, Dr. Hal, I don't see you multitasking like you guys just bragged about.

325
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,260
I'm doing, I'm going as fast as I can.

326
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
The work is getting done.

327
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:29,460
Dr. Hal is filling out the special Bobby Awards that were channeled by Bob himself through Teeters La Verge.

328
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,360
Teeters is the author.

329
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:41,320
He's the author of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, which I'm sure you've all been following in installments on Hour of Slack and Script Genius.

330
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:55,020
And he had special awards that he printed out and he requested the Dr. Hal label because he can, he writes real pretty.

331
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,480
You know, he talks real pretty. He can draw real pretty, too.

332
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,060
Deadly, deadly drawing talent.

333
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,340
Papa Joe Mama over here we see is writing his...

334
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,320
Furiously crafting his rant.

335
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,360
He's collating his notes.

336
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,900
I'll be writing my special rant for X Day on the way to Starwood.

337
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,500
That's, in fact, I've already used up about half of it here.

338
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,980
Well, here's a...

339
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, here's one I'll read.

340
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,740
Do we have an extra mic?

341
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,980
There should be.

342
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,280
There should be at least four of them up here.

343
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,840
Well, mine is hardly being used, but we have three.

344
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,120
Well, I will...

345
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,240
Oh, wait, that's not the one I want.

346
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,760
Although it's not too bad.

347
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,880
Sure, why not? I'll do this.

348
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,580
And I don't know who put this together.

349
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,980
It was mailed to me by Reverend Zaphod, but it just came from the internet.

350
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,000
You remember in the words of Martin Niemöller,

351
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,540
if that's how his name is pronounced,

352
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,440
first they came for the communists, he wrote,

353
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,200
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.

354
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,720
Then they came for the trade unionists,

355
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,400
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.

356
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,080
Then they came for the Jews,

357
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,960
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.

358
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,300
Then they came for me,

359
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,420
and there was no one left to speak out for me.

360
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,100
I always like to add,

361
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,220
then they came for the mute.

362
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,380
But here's the latest declaration.

363
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,960
Mr. Niemöller,

364
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,120
wrote this poem decades ago.

365
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,320
It might read like this today.

366
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,020
First, they declared the corporations were people,

367
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,380
and I didn't complain because I'm already a person.

368
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,400
Then they made unlimited money speech,

369
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,200
and I didn't complain because the American dream says I'll be rich someday too.

370
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,860
Then they commandeered the means of production by shipping our greatest strength,

371
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,120
manufacturing overseas,

372
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,960
because we don't have money.

373
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,740
They bought the bothersome unions over there,

374
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,300
and I didn't complain because Walmart has cheap stuff.

375
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,020
Then they bought Congress so they could write the laws,

376
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,120
and I didn't complain because I can't be bothered to vote.

377
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,960
Then they bought the Supreme Court so they could cement their rule,

378
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,100
and I didn't complain because I don't have time to pay attention.

379
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,880
Then they bought the news so they could convince everyone it's always been this way,

380
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,820
and I didn't complain because...

381
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,880
it's always been this way.

382
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,000
Then they manhandled an election,

383
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,400
and I didn't complain because I'm not from Florida.

384
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,020
Then they lied us into wars,

385
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,340
and I didn't complain because I'm not a soldier,

386
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,240
or an Iraqi,

387
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,520
or an Afghani,

388
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,200
or I guess we could, you know, add new war here.

389
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,180
Then millions died for profit,

390
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,080
and I didn't complain because the graphics on the news were totally awesome.

391
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,240
Then they started locking people up because they said they could,

392
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,140
and I didn't complain because nobody locked me up.

393
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,760
Then they started spying on everyone because they said they could,

394
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,500
and I didn't complain because I'm a real American.

395
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,920
Then they came for the worker,

396
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,540
but thanks to supply-side trickle-down economics, I don't have a job.

397
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,720
The truth is self-evident.

398
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,320
They are coming for you, and they are relentless.

399
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,880
Stand up for your country, for your family, for yourself.

400
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,060
Stand up.

401
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,080
Be hard.

402
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,140
Oh, no, heard.

403
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,260
Be heard.

404
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,500
Actually, I suggest being hard as well if you possibly can.

405
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,020
And if you really, really, really, really need the special little pills, I have those too.

406
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,360
Do you really?

407
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,900
Now, while...

408
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,400
What else is...

409
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,340
Are things coming along on your end there?

410
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,840
I can do another one here.

411
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,200
I'll keep ranting.

412
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,060
Are we waiting for the next one?

413
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,280
Do you want me?

414
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,760
Do you want...

415
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,080
No, no, go ahead and do whatever's easiest for you, Dr. Howell.

416
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,720
Slack comes first in the life of every initiate, you know, friends.

417
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,780
My idea of Slack happens to be working myself to death.

418
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,420
However, I didn't have to work on this one because Reverend Onan Canobite,

419
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,480
actually Uncle Dr. Onan Canobite, is kind of like my ghost writer,

420
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,300
or speech writer.

421
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:38,820
Every month or so, he sends something that I get to take credit for, just because I have

422
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,180
a radio show and he doesn't.

423
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,780
He's one of the many brains behind and inside this brain.

424
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,120
As Onan said, enjoy.

425
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,040
There's a good reason we call this the church of the subgenius.

426
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,560
Believe me, we've all known the guy or gal who was smart, too smart for their own good.

427
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,760
Yeah, they're savants.

428
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,500
That's why everything they do is an act of savantage.

429
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:14,000
No, sir, no, ma'am, we instead do wander as media overlords in the blabberinth of media overload,

430
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,160
resplendent in resentistentialism.

431
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,780
It's the uncannibals versus the pretty-ots.

432
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,600
The church of the subgenius renders the conspiracy bobsolete.

433
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,740
The subgenius puts the err in the law.

434
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,100
They can't do anything.

435
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,100


436
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,100


437
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,260
What we are, the subgenius, is an uncannibalized subgenian nerd.

438
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,940
We are the politically correct.

439
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,560
Where the pinks would be but sited, we say, hail Saiten.

440
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,640
Saiten spelled with an E.

441
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,140
For our enemies, we have a bouquet of forgive-me-nots.

442
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:55,140
Their golden age that never was fills us only with nostalgia.

443
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,060
Nostalgia.

444
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,220
A worldly will give you world beat music.

445
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:07,320
And as I said, like an old limp radio show, it can't be beat.

446
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,500
Oh, no, it wasn't originally a radio show, but that works that way anyway.

447
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,120
It sure does.

448
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,460
Oh, where's lonesome cowboy Dave?

449
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,420
Oh, he's home with his dog, taking care of his dog.

450
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,820
Dave would not leave his dog.

451
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:28,500
There were quite a few subgeniuses who preferred their animals to Bob.

452
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,160
A fourth mic is by Dr. Hal Live.

453
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,920
Oh, I see.

454
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,520
Sure enough.

455
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,840
It's pointing off into the distance.

456
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,880
Ah, it's the mysterious virtual microphone that was right there in front of us.

457
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,760
We just didn't see.

458
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,700
Papa Joe has been writing the great American novel over there on the side.

459
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,240
Yeah.

460
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,680
You know, there'll be rant-a-thons between bands tonight and after bands.

461
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,480
In fact, some of the bands are almost rants unto themselves.

462
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:10,540
I'm really looking forward to Monkey Hive, which will apparently destroy all of your favorite songs forever.

463
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,680
And you thought Evolution Control Committee had done that already.

464
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,220
But no, there's still a few more songs left to kill.

465
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,600
There's only one song you can't kill.

466
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:33,040
That's the song that refused to die, which literally went on for hours and hours and hours at a dock stock.

467
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,840
No way to mortalize it.

468
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,300
Yeah.

469
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,100
Before there were expedites, there were dock stocks, but they were too dangerous.

470
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,860
They really were.

471
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:46,040
You think this place is hard to get to and full of bugs?

472
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,780
Well, dock stocks were usually in Arkansas or Bolivia.

473
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,660
And that got pretty tricky.

474
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,860
Bigger bugs in both places.

475
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,600
Big bugs that live under the potty seats all around here.

476
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,040
Actually, we pointed out that that's the one place that's probably you will not find bugs.

477
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,980
It's on the underside of the chem toilets.

478
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,080
Well, I have an ass that disagrees with that theory.

479
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,440
It's a little bit too...

480
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,800
No, I can't hear you.

481
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,160
I can't hear anything.

482
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,100
I have the scars to prove that's not necessarily correct.

483
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,060
They won't breed down there, but they'll fly down there and wait.

484
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:36,400
I encountered several such mosquitoes waiting for just the right buttocks to descend upon the heavenly throne.

485
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,000
Ooh!

486
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,560
But you could sometimes fool them by holding your flashlight above the seat,

487
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:47,920
letting them, luring them out, and then whisking them away and planting yourself safely upon that porcelain altar.

488
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,540
That's another kind of butthurt, friends.

489
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,880
This has been a special butthurt X-Day, I think.

490
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,300
In fact, we have a Bobby...

491
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,840
We were going to give Bobby awards for butthurt, but they were too numerous to mention.

492
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,340
Honestly.

493
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:12,880
As Leguim pointed out the other day, some people get both cheeks hurt so badly that they have to grow a third butt cheek.

494
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,340
Just to survive.

495
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,540
Sometimes you can grow that underneath your jowls.

496
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,180
It could be underneath the other orifice.

497
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,400
Where a lot of people have excrement come out of that orifice as well, so it's only appropriate.

498
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,720
And of course, there's always the third nostril, so between that you're getting so many orifices in your face,

499
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,840
it's almost unfair to the rest of your body.

500
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,060
By the way, if...

501
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,820
We can't hear whether you can hear us.

502
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
So if some... everything is okay.

503
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,560
The music's not too loud.

504
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,320
The... good.

505
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,040
I'm used to doing this in headphones, you see.

506
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,800
Thanks for the sound check, folks.

507
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,300
Which I can turn up real, real loud.

508
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,480
When I do that, then I can hear, say, Papa Joe over there.

509
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:15,980
On the other hand, it's kind of good being deaf because most of what comes out of most people's mouths is not worth hearing anyway.

510
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,500
And you can sleep better from 2 a.m. to 3 p.m.

511
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:19,500


512
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,360
to 10 a.m. when the rave is continuing on all night long.

513
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,520
Oh, did that happen?

514
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,140
Did the rave continue all night long?

515
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,340
Until just before 6 a.m.

516
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,320
All right.

517
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,400
Well, that was the idea.

518
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,180
Oh, no, wait.

519
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,480
It wasn't a rave, was it?

520
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:44,120
Well, some people out there are a little agitated because they feel, you know, they wake up grumpy and put out because they didn't get a good night's sleep.

521
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,180
But that's all by design.

522
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,640
We're actually trying to put them in the proper mindset for X day.

523
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,880
Because when the excess saucers come, there's going to be a few people left behind to help clean up the mess.

524
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,840
And, you know, you don't want to be in a touchy-feely mood.

525
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,060
You need to be grumpy.

526
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,840
You need to be in a bad place in order to do what needs to be done at that time.

527
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,940
That won't be difficult for me if I know my X day history.

528
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:18,020
Well, you know, along a similar vein, Reverend Stang, perhaps now is a good time to make a public service announcement that the first and last annual

529
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:25,920
Wisteria Excess Executioners for Bob run will be occurring tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.

530
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,160
Oh, good Lord.

531
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,340
Yes, this is the first time I've heard of anything happening before.

532
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,460
Well, we have to keep this off the official schedule because it's very hush-hush, you understand.

533
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,240
We don't want to attract attention from ATF and other authorities.

534
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,680
But the general idea is that on X day, we can't just lay back and expect the excess to do all the heavy lifting.

535
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,240
Somebody has to roll up their sleeves.

536
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,000
And, you know, we're going to have to do it.

537
00:31:48,020 --> 00:32:01,260
And help cart the cordwood and all the extra bodies and clear a way for the excess saucers to land and to root out those pinks and perhaps even your own boss, who was always getting on your nerves.

538
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:15,120
Show them his special hiding place and, you know, make sure that him and his family have a special place in the storage compartments of the excess saucers where the food and other rations will be held.

539
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,000
So the excess executioners for Bob need to be in a good place.

540
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:29,420
And they need to be properly toned and exercised so that they can help run down and track down like a good hunter, perhaps the Native Americans chasing after deer, on July 4th at 7 a.m.

541
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,560
Somebody has to do it.

542
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,640
It might as well be us.

543
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,260
So if you're up to it and want to do your little three-mile practice run, we'll commence there at 10 a.m. at Stalag 13.

544
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,160
That's Camp Death Site S13.

545
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,260
We'll take off there.

546
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,980
Go three miles and wind up at the death pool at the end of the course.

547
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:47,980


548
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,160
We'll go to the driveway.

549
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,680
Do a little dunk in that and see how many leeches we can collect.

550
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,000
And then hopefully come on back.

551
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:05,540
We'll provide breakfast for them and maybe we'll get a little breakfast ourselves with a pancake passing out a, what is it, manta from heaven?

552
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,400
Manta.

553
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,280
Yes, manta.

554
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,180
Manta from heaven.

555
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,380
In our case, praying manta from heaven.

556
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,080
And we'll enjoy that along with the rest.

557
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,380
Praying mantas from heaven.

558
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,420
We should be back at that time.

559
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:22,500
And we'll have our wet leeches to dangle from us like medals of pride to show that we completed the run.

560
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,780
And then 24 hours, we would have had our practice and we'll go for the real thing.

561
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:37,240
Speaking of leeches dangling from your skin, I must remind everyone the baptism is tomorrow at 3.30 in the pond.

562
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:44,420
Which if, I suspect, knowing my subgeniuses, most of you haven't walked that far.

563
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,540
Ever.

564
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,620
In your whole lives.

565
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,640
And we will try to provide a shuttle service down to the baptism.

566
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,820
And of course the 7 a.m.

567
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:06,780
Now I know that a whole lot of you, this is the one time in your year that you don't have to get up at 7 o'clock in the morning.

568
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,960
For me, it's just the opposite.

569
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,520
It's the one time I do have to get up at 7.

570
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,400
But we're going to do that down at 7.00.

571
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,400


572
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,640
We're going to do that down at the stone circle.

573
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,520
It's not called that because everybody is stoned.

574
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,980
It is a circle made of stones and it's very picturesque and makes a good target shape.

575
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,560
As seen from above.

576
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,920
Dr. Howe seemed to think that you were confusing days and hours and getting folks confused.

577
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,240
So let's go over those times.

578
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,900
Well, the baptism is tomorrow afternoon.

579
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,400
The meeting with the exes is at 7 on July 5th.

580
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,400


581
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,560
Dr. That's Tuesday.

582
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,420
You want to be baptized before.

583
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,040
Dr. The rupture or rupture as some call it.

584
00:34:51,920 --> 00:35:02,500
Of course there may be some sort of baptism after 7 a.m. briefly when those who erupt into flame need to be tossed into the water in order to extinguish the flames.

585
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,520
So the spontaneous combustion of sorts.

586
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,860
It's total ecstasy.

587
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,860
You're going to enjoy it.

588
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,380
But just for fire marshal rules and regulations, fully flaming subgeniuses are not allowed on the fire.

589
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,780
They must be extinguished first before they enter the chute.

590
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,160
Dr. It's a formality.

591
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,420
It's just a safety precaution.

592
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,740
Dr. You don't know who didn't send the money in.

593
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:32,980
Dr. And of course they'll x-ray you with those new fancy x-ray machines where you look like a cheap computer animation to the security people.

594
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:44,000
But they can see where you've stashed your frop or your special mechanical brain implants.

595
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,360
Dr. It's a little sad.

596
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,460
I don't know.

597
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:44,460


598
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:44,460


599
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:44,460


600
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:44,460


601
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:44,460


602
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:44,460


603
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:44,460


604
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:44,800
And the rules and regulations and so forth.

605
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,120
Dr. Even on the saucers we have to observe certain rules and regulations.

606
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,740
And the fire marshal limitations on how many members can be on board is one of them.

607
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,500
So if you have been putting off getting your membership, you don't want to be that one person over capacity.

608
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,140
Dr. Right.

609
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,220
Only 144,000 are promised seats on the saucers.

610
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:14,340
Now fortunately I think we're only at 143,950 seats.

611
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,340


612
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,340


613
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,060
97. So there's three memberships left.

614
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,980
Three open seats.

615
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:29,800
Now, don't get us wrong. We talk about the world ending. The planet Earth will probably not be completely destroyed at all.

616
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:45,560
In fact, if you look at our book, Revelation X, there is a map of the United States, or what was once the United States, divvied up by certain control freaks, Dr. Drummond and myself.

617
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:57,020
And there's a special reservation for the remaining few thousand humans, I think, in the middle of Kansas or some really interesting place like that.

618
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,780
Did I mention that I have dibs?

619
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,640
Did I mention that I have dibs on the Grand Canyon?

620
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,320
Yes, I think you have gone over that.

621
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:11,020
I don't want to get in a fight over the Grand Canyon with any of your pleasure saucers.

622
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:17,420
Because, you know, we call them pleasure saucers, but they're also death stars, if that's what you want them to be.

623
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,200
You claim the Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon.

624
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,200
Oh, you're right.

625
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,400
And I'll have a nice-looking death star.

626
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,780
I'll have a nice paint job.

627
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,380
I'll have a nice paint job on it.

628
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,660
If you're on the inside, it's a pleasure saucer.

629
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,460
If you're on the outside, it's a death star.

630
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,120
Exactly.

631
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:41,540
And, you know, some of you may look around and say, you know, 144,000 participants allowed on the saucer.

632
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,840
I don't have anything to worry about.

633
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,520
There's only 100 or so people here.

634
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,780
Well, you're not taking into account the multiple personalities, the people around you.

635
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,840
We may already be at capacity, and you don't even know it.

636
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,620
So if you haven't gotten that membership, don't wait.

637
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,040
Go ahead and get it today.

638
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,660
You don't want to be there and be that number.

639
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,820
144,000.

640
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,480
What a pain.

641
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
You'd be that close, that close.

642
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,500
And what's that money going to be worth?

643
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,660
These $30 is going to be worthless in any way.

644
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,200
So what are you holding on to it for?

645
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,220
It doesn't make any sense.

646
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,880
I think you're preaching to the saved.

647
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,740
Everybody here has their electrostimulo wristband.

648
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,460
Yes, but, again, do you have a membership for every one of those personalities?

649
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,820
You have to, you know, each personality needs its.

650
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,160
All your different personalities.

651
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,540
We don't write the rules.

652
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,520
We just follow them.

653
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,740
And, unfortunately, you know, it only makes sense.

654
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,700
It depends on which personality you're reporting to the saucer in.

655
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,200
But if you got it under one personality and your report is another, how are you going to be let in?

656
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,060
That doesn't make any sense.

657
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,340
Yeah, they're going to kick one of those personalities off.

658
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,280
They're going to inject it into space.

659
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,440
So you just think about that, Tommy Amoeba.

660
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,140
You may need to buy several memberships to keep up with all those.

661
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,220
And I know at $30 it's a lot.

662
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,780
But, you know, if this isn't the day, we're going to have to do it.

663
00:38:59,780 --> 00:38:59,780


664
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,580
We're going to raise the price to $33.33.

665
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,080
There you go.

666
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,920
The golden mean.

667
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,020
Because that's how mean we are.

668
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,240
Inflation.

669
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,340
What can one do about it?

670
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:24,380
But as the 7 a.m. approaches, I mean, people are going to start having to use wheelbarrows just to haul the equivalent of $30 around.

671
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,840
It's going to be pointless.

672
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,160
People will use money for wallpaper, except they won't have walls anymore.

673
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,880
How many subgeniuses here joined up when it was only $20?

674
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,200
Raise your limb.

675
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:36,980
Oh, my God.

676
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,680
Fatman D.

677
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,220
She was only like seven years old back then.

678
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,800
And Nikki.

679
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,180
Yeah, Nikki was in Dr. Dark.

680
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,980
Yeah, that figures.

681
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,680
See, they got on board now while rates were low.

682
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,480
Biggie Mistoffelees.

683
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,300
Yeah.

684
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:54,780
Yeah.

685
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,220
Then anybody here joined it when it was $10?

686
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,740
See, most of those have already beat us to the saucers.

687
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:16,620
Actually, the funny thing is, the very first guy that sent us $10, Dr. Snavely Eklund, who founded the band Doctors for Bob.

688
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,780
I'm looking to see if he's here.

689
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:25,520
His employees, Sterno, Janer, and the people who became that band, all urged him not to.

690
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,320
They were going, no, man, that's just what they want you to do.

691
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,420
Don't send them $10.

692
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:39,160
Max, Snavely is now so rich that he has better things to do than be at X Day.

693
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,760
Think how rich you'd have to be for that, my friends.

694
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,400
He sold, he ran the only health food store in Little Rock, Arkansas.

695
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:55,640
And after a few decades, Whole Foods wanted it real, real bad.

696
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,240
But it takes more than just money to be able to afford to do that.

697
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,760
It also takes money.

698
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,240
It takes time.

699
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:06,380
Because the only reason Snavely's not going to be there is because he's actually built his own saucer.

700
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,520
And you can't do that at the last minute.

701
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,540
So you have to have the money.

702
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,360
You have to have the time.

703
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,140
It's much cheaper.

704
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,080
It's much more efficient.

705
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,280
It just makes more sense to put in the $30 and take the taxi.

706
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,820
Why go solo when you can go in a carpool?

707
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,200
I mean, it only makes sense.

708
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,680
That's how I got here.

709
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,500
It's more environmentally friendly, too.

710
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,000
Well, see, this is the problem with people with money.

711
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,380
They're not content.

712
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,620
They're not content to just have the money.

713
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,400
They also have to spend all the resources.

714
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,180
So you can't just have one SUV.

715
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,680
You have to have three of them.

716
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,640
And then if there's three of you going to the store, each one of you needs to drive one of the SUVs.

717
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,820
And you form a convoy.

718
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,020
It's a mindset.

719
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,960
You can't have one house.

720
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,340
You have to have seven of them.

721
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,720
You know, follow the climate.

722
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,740
Part of the whole point of being rich is to deny someone else something that you have.

723
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,340
It's not just you getting what you need.

724
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,740
It's stopping someone else from getting what they need.

725
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,300
That's the fun of it.

726
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:09,020
The hurting of the butts is part of the slack for many subgeniuses, I guess.

727
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:21,120
Some of us have had our butts hurt by our best friends so many times that we've built up a horny carapace, a sort of a shell on our butts.

728
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:29,620
I'd say I've got a pretty hard ass at this point after 30 years.

729
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:29,740
I'm not sure.

730
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,100
There seems to be a simple question, but I'll admit I don't believe in it.

731

Who hj alleine excombinato lato met uno dei abit neuvolo da mumo.

00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,140
I don't even know.

734
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,640
Purely out of our search.

735
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,020
But there's still still us that seems like a joke.

736

things. I don't know.

747
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,820
You don't need any.

748
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:11,940
No.

749
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,340
Well, I wanted to be able to lend them out.

750
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,580
I feel so sorry for the one-penis.

751
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,080
You know,

752
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,760
I know if there's anybody here,

753
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,400
I don't mean to offend you or anything.

754
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,600
We don't look down on you just for

755
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,420
having one penis, especially

756
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,420
if you're a female. I mean, that's understood.

757
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,000
I remember

758
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,320
the day

759
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,740
somebody prophesied

760
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,120
that the sex goddesses

761
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,240
would all have

762
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,280
23 vaginas.

763
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,500
And Dr. Legume broke down

764
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,880
in tears, crying,

765
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,180
because he said,

766
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,240
I have 24

767
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,380
nicks!

768
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,640
But we don't know. We really don't

769
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,620
know these things for sure. There's a certain

770
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,840
amount of... Mystery is fine.

771
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,540
I don't have to have a stuffed

772
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,760
Loch Ness monster or

773
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,880
Bigfoot in my local museum

774
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,100
in order to believe in those things,

775
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,900
which I don't, by the way.

776
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,820
The Bigfoot

777
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,640
obviously is not

778
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,940
a stinky animal, they like to

779
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,360
claim, but

780
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,460
are immediate ancestors

781
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,140
in many cases.

782
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,620
Well, it's important to preserve a certain amount of the

783
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,040
shock and awe that is necessary

784
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,980
at that last moment. You don't

785
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,520
want everything revealed until then.

786
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,480
It's like someone giving you the

787
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,840
full synopsis of the movie before you

788
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,940
go and see the premiere.

789
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,580
You want to walk in there and have just the

790
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,000
expectation, but the uncertainty

791
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,940
that is about to... When you walk

792
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,940
up that chute

793
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,280
and through those saucer doors,

794
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,720
you don't really want to know

795
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,580
what you're going to see

796
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,880
until that very moment of divine ecstasy

797
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,000
strikes you, and oh, what a thrill

798
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,040
it's going to be. I can't wait, brothers and sisters.

799
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,760
I can't either.

800
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,200
I can just feel it in my bones.

801
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,960
Actually, I hate to remind you,

802
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,600
but we've been waiting for

803
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,780
what, 14 years

804
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,920
now? Yes, but we're finally in the right

805
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,940
place now. That could be it.

806
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,840
Well, but it doesn't matter where you are.

807
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:12,380
The

808
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,060
7 a.m. July 5th

809
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,980
starts at the International Date Line

810
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,520
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,

811
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,940
and the first subgeniuses

812
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,380
to get ruptured will be the

813
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,140
subgeniuses on the island of Tonga.

814
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,940
There's only

815
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,560
two or three of them, so we

816
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,980
may not hear about it then,

817
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,920
but in theory, we should be able to watch

818
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,720
the rupture happening in

819
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,040
Australia and Japan

820
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,680
almost a day before it gets

821
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,620
to us here. I think they have

822
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,300
a time delay, though. The conspiracy

823
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,700
runs it through there. It's just an effort

824
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,160
to try to throw people off,

825
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,540
so I wouldn't be too depressed

826
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,380
if we don't see anything on

827
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,500
television. I mean, the revolution will not

828
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,300
be televised.

829
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,620
And another thing to remember is, what is

830
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,500
14 years away? I mean, most

831
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,460
of us waited that long before we had

832
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,500
sex. I waited a lot longer than

833
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,480
that. Well, you mean sex with

834
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,740
somebody else? Well,

835
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,600
the real sex, the pretend

836
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,920
sex, that of course

837
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,220
was much more lively

838
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,420
in the days when the imagination was more

839
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,060
active at a younger age. My

840
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,460
third grade teacher had to give me that lecture

841
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,180
when, yeah, that was

842
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,460
I think I've told that story too many times.

843
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,960
I got an award for it once.

844
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,300
From Wankers for Bob.

845
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,540
I got the special Wankers award.

846
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,660
For best wanking

847
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,140
story.

848
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,580
Took place so long ago, and it was so cute.

849
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,780
You know, since little kids.

850
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,400
Sex with little children, that's so funny.

851
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,760
And yet that's the only type of sex

852
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,620
that's illegal. It's cute when

853
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,600
the kids talk about it, think about it,

854
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,300
do it, but it's illegal when

855
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,660
the adults enjoy that.

856
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,640
And then when the older adults

857
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,940
do it, oh, it's disgusting.

858
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,480
I hear doctors for Bob

859
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,600
from thousands of

860
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,160
years ago.

861
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,780
How are you doing on this?

862
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,900
They're coming, Stang. What is the source

863
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,580
of your impatience? The Bobby Awards

864
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,260
aren't scheduled to begin yet.

865
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,800
No, it's just that

866
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,240
we'd love to hear you talk.

867
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,580
I didn't really expect to

868
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,880
Well, I don't have my glasses. It's difficult

869
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,640
for me to do this type of

870
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,440
work. And there are

871
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,260
a huge pile of them to do.

872
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,720
I'm just working my way through the

873
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,420
pile, but

874
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,540
There should be only ten.

875
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,380
A number were added.

876
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,420
Oh, I see.

877
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,980
So Bob's been channeling

878
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,060
through you too, huh?

879
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,800
And Dr. Howell doesn't just fill them out.

880
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,940
It's a work of art.

881
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,060
Each letter is delicately

882
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,460
and tenderly rendered

883
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,480
in his trademark style.

884
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,680
Just below the rainbow,

885
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,800
which is also on the

886
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,160
certificate,

887
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,620
somewhere under the rainbow

888
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,840
lies the subgenius.

889
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,480
We can all see this

890
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,140
little world down in the night.

891
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,100
Yeah.

892
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,140
I can scoot down here.

893
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,060
Now, there's this

894
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,860
Remember that I promised Nenslo

895
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,780
that I was going to see his poem

896
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,240
destroyed if I possibly

897
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:09,620
could.

898
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,720
Well, are we going to sing it?

899
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,220
You and Princess, we could if this would be

900
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,060
a good time for it.

901
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,220
Well, we'll try. Here comes another one of these

902
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,160
a cappella renditions.

903
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,060
But Nenslo's song is

904
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,300
so good that maybe it will survive

905
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,660
even that treatment.

906
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:27,800
Let's see.

907
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,480
Ready?

908
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,320
Ready.

909
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,800
The world ends tomorrow

910
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,180
they say and you may die

911
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,200
or maybe off to

912
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,080
Planet X in saucers you

913
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,940
shall fly. But only

914
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,800
if you first have sent your

915
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,280
thirty bucks to Bob.

916
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,700
And then you must repent, repent,

917
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,640
slack off and quit your job.

918
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,960
There was a day so long

919
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,220
ago when Yeti ruled the world

920
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,080
and heaven was a

921
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,160
Yeti boy in love with Yeti

922
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,100
girl. Or Yeti boy

923
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,940
with Yeti boy or Yeti

924
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,920
girls in pairs. Until

925
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,000
the tiny pink ones came and

926
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,520
filled the world with cares.

927
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,880
A devil came from outer

928
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
space to spread his misery

929
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,960
and subjugate the

930
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,040
Yeti race in wretched slavery.

931
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,220
He brought with him

932
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,940
a race of drones all dressed

933
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,120
in suit and tie and sent

934
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,020
them down to interbreed with

935
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,500
Yeti girl and guy.

936
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,780
Now the Yeti's pride and joy

937
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,820
their flowing fur is

938
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,760
gone. They work in office

939
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,820
cubicles and drive to work

940
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,720
at dawn. They know not

941
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,760
of the prairie squid, the pee

942
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,580
and poop dog hats or

943
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,640
pudding antidote for sperm

944
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,320
of those face fucking bats.

945
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,800
The human race's heritage

946
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,640
is only to obey.

947
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,960
To watch TV, to breed

948
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,680
more slaves, to go to work

949
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,040
each day. The human race's

950
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,680
history to which they

951
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,720
point with pride is just

952
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,640
a hundred thousand years of

953
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,820
brutal genocide.

954
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,620
For Yeti

955
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,420
though the day's too short to

956
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,840
spend it stacking stones,

957
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,740
licking piles of envelopes

958
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,280
or classifying bones.

959
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,660
We shall not spend our lives

960
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,300
as servants to machinery.

961
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,580
There rises in the

962
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,380
Yeti breast a yearning to

963
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,540
be free. Repent, repent,

964
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,480
repent, repent, slack off and

965
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,460
quit your job. Cash

966
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,460
your final paycheck and send

967
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,520
it all to Bob. Once

968
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,380
you break your shackles, there

969
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,100
is no turning back.

970
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,620
Now you surf

971
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,420
the luck plane. The sub

972
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,200
genius must

973
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,520
have slack.

974
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,180
Slack.

975
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,540
Written by

976
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,700
Nenslow and destroyed

977
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,320
at Hex Day.

978
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,720
The author of The Immortal

979
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,020
Take Me Off to Space.

980
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,380
Oh and many

981
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,640
other songs. Speaking

982
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,360
of songs, the Bob

983
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,540
Songs collections are

984
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,620
now up to numbers.

985
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:10,560
Well

986
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,020
there are more on the way.

987
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,500
Yes, they're actually

988
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,440
whatever happened to Bob Songs 7?

989
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,640
I turned Bob

990
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,560
Songs 8 into an hour of slack.

991
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,700
But 7

992
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,720
escaped. Somewhere

993
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,680
out in the world there's an album that we

994
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,800
never heard or

995
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,000
released or recorded or anything.

996
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,560
So if you happen to see

997
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,740
Bob Songs 7

998
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,180
collection creeping through the

999
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,320
woods, chase it down.

1000
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,280
A must have

1001
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,380
double bag item.

1002
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,640
Hang it up and lynch it.

1003
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,280
The rest of them

1004
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,040
however you can simply buy at the

1005
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,780
swag shack

1006
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,400
there from our fine

1007
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,200
swaggerts, the artists

1008
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,200
of selling swag we call them there.

1009
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,700
Well Bob feels the only thing

1010
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,100
more holy than singing his

1011
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,620
songs is to actually write and

1012
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,280
sing one of his songs. So

1013
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,600
perhaps you will be that latest

1014
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,820
songwriter. Something, what

1015
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,660
could be more holy than to write a Bob song

1016
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,940
just before X day when you know

1017
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,840
there's only one more day

1018
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,560
to sing it. I've done that. When my

1019
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,740
plane was endlessly circling and it

1020
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,040
seemed it would never come down

1021
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,160
I wrote a

1022
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,540
Bobbly hymn.

1023
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,360
Let's hear it.

1024
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,920
Yeah, let's hear it.

1025
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:25,760
Yes.

1026
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,100
All right, let me do this.

1027
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,880
I've sung it an earlier

1028
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,980
X day and we tried to get

1029
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,940
lonesome cowboy Dave to accompany

1030
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,860
us but he got confused

1031
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,520
or something. Anyway, it goes

1032
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,080
like this.

1033
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,700
X day

1034
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,080
is here.

1035
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,940
The mountains fall.

1036
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,700
I cringe

1037
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,800
and hide my

1038
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,760
head.

1039
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,740
I never sent

1040
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,340
in.

1041
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,820
My thirty

1042
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,500
bucks. My soul

1043
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,660
is filled with

1044
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,120
dread.

1045
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,120
Oh Bob,

1046
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,360
won't you let me

1047
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,380
live and all

1048
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,280
that is mine I

1049
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,180
John surely will

1050
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,240
give. Oh lift

1051
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,280
me away in your

1052
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,000
great saucership

1053
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,700
to my subgenius

1054
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,000
home.

1055
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,140
Oh

1056
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,840
bear me away in your

1057
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,660
great shining ship

1058
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,160
to my subgenius

1059
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:35,760
home.

1060
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,040
I saw the pinks

1061
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,300
and normals flee

1062
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,540
the dreadful harvest

1063
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,760
from the sky.

1064
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,880
They run like chickens

1065
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,320
to their doom

1066
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,100
and none of them

1067
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:56,940
knows

1068
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,980
why.

1069
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,480
Oh Bob,

1070
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,920
please let me

1071
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,860
live and all

1072
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,680
that is mine I

1073
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,540
John surely will

1074
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,500
give. Oh lift

1075
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,420
me away in your

1076
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,080
great saucership

1077
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,440
to my subgenius

1078
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,140
home.

1079
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,080
Oh bear me

1080
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,120
away in your great

1081
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,420
shining ship

1082
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,120
to my subgenius home.

1083
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,120


1084
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:33,600
The towers of the proud

1085
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,940
did fall.

1086
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,800
There was no shelter

1087
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,160
from that storm.

1088
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,700
While from far above

1089
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,640
the subgeniuses watched

1090
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,780
in comfort safe and warm.

1091
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,460
Oh Bob,

1092
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,520
won't you let me

1093
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,420
live and all

1094
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,100
that is mine I

1095
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1096
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1097
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1098
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1099
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1100
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1101
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1102
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1103
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1104
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1105
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1106
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1107
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,100


1108
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,460
John surely will give.

1109
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,940
Oh bear me away in your

1110
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,660
great saucership

1111
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,440
to my subgenius home.

1112
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,900
Oh lift me away in your

1113
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,640
great shining ship

1114
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,640
to my subgenius home.

1115
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,320
Then I awoke

1116
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,920
and twas a dream.

1117
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,160
My thirst for

1118
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,080
flack's not in vain.

1119
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,520
I'm fine.

1120
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,100
I wrote out a check

1121
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,720
to Ivan Stang

1122
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,720
and signed the bottom

1123
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:40,700
line.

1124
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,300
Oh Bob,

1125
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,440
won't you let me

1126
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,780
live for now in

1127
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,540
true slack I most

1128
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,500
surely will give.

1129
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,800
Oh lift me away

1130
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,840
in your great shining

1131
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,800
ship to my subgenius home.

1132
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,600
Oh bear me away in your

1133
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,520
great silvership

1134
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,480
to my subgenius home.

1135
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,720
There.

1136
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,200
There.

1137
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,200
It's all right.

1138
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,400
It's all right.

1139
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,680
I have to write this too.

1140
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:25,780
I'm going to give you

1141
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,580
for my honor.

1142
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,380
Don't cry.

1143
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,460
It'll all be better soon.

1144
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:34,140
Has Piss Baptist John Shirley heard that song?

1145
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,620
Yeah, he approved that.

1146
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,100
Because if you invite him, you're going to give all your money to John Shirley.

1147
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,320
No, no, no, no.

1148
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,080
All that is mine I, John Shirley, will give.

1149
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,560
He's going to give all his money to you.

1150
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1151
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,320
So John Shirley's singing the song.

1152
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:54,180
Yeah, well, John Shirley is just a name, you know, like John Barleycorn, John Henry, just

1153
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,340
a given name.

1154
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,760
Or any John Doe will surely give his money to Ivan and the Church.

1155
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,220
Yeah.

1156
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,680
Take me off to space.

1157
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,380
Take me off to space.

00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,980

with white and clammy paws.

1174
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,420
