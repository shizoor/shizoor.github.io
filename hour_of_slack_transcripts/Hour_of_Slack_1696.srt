1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,160
Shall we pray?

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,660
Lord, I'm afraid that there are those who make no sense, and they don't have to be.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,080
Now comes the part where we say,

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,320
The subgenius, our own Slick.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,340
This might be a good place to do a transition.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,560
My father-

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,260
Yes, let's change into a vampire or whatever.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:29,120
When Pappy was in Alaska, he had the chance to go out on the ice with Eskimos.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,580
Real Eskimos with sleds and huskies.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,160
And he did it.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,820
And two hours into that trip, he knew he had made a serious, serious mistake.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,840
But he was with those Eskimos for a couple of days at least.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,420
What was the matter with the idea?

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,920
He just couldn't take the Arctic horrors?

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,240
There were many, many interesting details which grew every time he told the story.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,100
And I'll tell you.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,260
I recorded it twice.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,580
And I've been holding onto my dad's tale of his stay among the Eskimos for some time when

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,460
I'm too busy to do an hour of Slack.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,920
And now I have done the intro for that recording, surreptitiously made, of my father who didn't

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,340
know what one of these things was.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,580
You actually have him recorded telling the story?

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,040
I recorded my father twice telling the story.

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,180
That's so great.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,100
And he was a great storyteller.

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,280
Never recorded any of my dad's stories.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,860
My time with the Eskimos.

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,480
My dad's story.

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,760
My dad's story.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:30,800
My dad's story.

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,580
My dad's story.

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:31,900
My dad's story.

33
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:31,900


34
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:31,900


35
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:31,900


36
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,920
Oh, yes, dear friends.

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,940
And this is probably the least typical hour of Slack I've ever assembled.

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,680
There's no weird cut-ups.

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,220
No Rudy Schwartz project.

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,460
No psycho skeletons or rainmakers or lonesome cowboy Dave or even me after this part.

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,620
The whole rest of the show is one old subgenius talking.

42
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,160
My pappy.

43
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,160
Now, maybe someday we'll do a mammy show.

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,840
Maybe.

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,380
Maybe.

46
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,100
But the pappy show is really easy because pappy was a show.

47
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:12,740
He was a real colorful personality and a raconteur who had been a captain in the Naval

48
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,180
Reserve in intelligence and a 32 degree mason.

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,800
He was a lawyer specializing in legal disputes.

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,040
And after he retired, he ran half, well, most of the charities.

51
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,960
In this little town.

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,720
And he was from way out in the country and grew up shooting rabbits.

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,040
But his job and the Navy took him all over the place and he had some real adventures

54
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,320
in his spare time.

55
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,960
Such as this one with the Eskimos, which may not technically be Eskimos.

56
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,620
I know there's a lot of different native groups up there.

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,900
I'm not sure which one this is.

58
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,020
And this recording, which was from about 2008.

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,560
2010.

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,900
He was telling the story to my son and my daughter and her family.

61
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,360
And sometimes you can hear my grandkids in the background.

62
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,900
Pappy was about 83 years old when this was recorded.

63
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,560
Captain Hugh M. Smith, or Pappy, among the Eskimos.

64
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,620
Pappy, are you going to tell those ladies the story of the...

65
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,640
They want to hear it.

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,780
They've asked.

67
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,520
Go through the year about 1970.

68
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,800
That was about 40 years ago.

69
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,320
I was about 40.

70
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,460
I was up in Alaska while the pipeline was going on.

71
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,600
I was representing Tesoro Petroleum.

72
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,760
Tesoro is a small oil company.

73
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,720
They may not know the name.

74
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,280
They're doing a small development project on conservation activities and this is not

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,340
just ins figuring out how to get the achimals out there.

76
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,720
That's multiple process.

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:13,880
We didn't actually do anything.

78
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:13,880


79
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:13,880


80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:13,880


81
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:13,880


82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:13,880


83
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,080
So we found out what Chesaulete might be doing, and we were not there.

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,420
He couldn't tell them when we got there.

85
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,920
So his daughter died.

86
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:32,900
come in for supplies every once in a while and they've arranged that the Eskimos will

87
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:43,440
take you out on a five day journey over the ice. This is up above the Arctic Circle. I

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:51,700
forget the name of the little town, but it was on the Canadian side and the company's

89
00:04:51,700 --> 00:05:06,260
airplane, a Cessna, was available so they flew me over there and I had taken a goose down mummy

90
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:21,480
type sleeping bag. I had taken some warm clothes, change of socks, change of underwear, some

91
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,680
tissues, and some gloves. I had taken a pair of socks, changed my underwear, some tees, some

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:21,680


93
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:33,740
toothpaste, toothbrush, and other stuff and made the arrangements with the Canadian Indian agent

94
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:44,440
there. This is an Indian post, not Eskimo post, Indian trading post, but the Eskimos came in there

95
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:51,400
to get supplies and they would take these people out on trips five days with the family.

96
00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:00,340
And I had the one who was taking me out, I never understood his name or her name, but he referred

97
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:11,840
out on the trail, he referred to himself as Ikak, which means human. He was a Chugach, his family

98
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:21,200
was Chugach tribe, and there was him, he looked like he was about 60, I think he was close to

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:31,500
maybe 37, but he looked like he was about 60, and Mama looked like she was about 160, she was

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:42,300
probably 40. There was a 14 year old boy, and I was guessing at this age, and a 12 year old girl.

101
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:50,900
Now the girl was alive only because she was the second child.

102
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,660
Because if she had been the first one, they would have killed her at birth

103
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,160
because girl babies cost time and troublesome.

104
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,440
The agent said, you won't need this, you won't need this, you won't need this.

105
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,180
He left me with my sleeping left wrap, we left the tekrar came in the future they staged a

106
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,180


107
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:32,960
bag. He said you can take the change of drawers but you'll never use them. And

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,560
when he said that I should have caught on to something. But it didn't occur to me.

109
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:51,940
But I kept them anyway. He said what you got on is enough. I had on the pants and a shirt

110
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:59,600
like I got on now. It was a khaki shirt. And I had insulated coveralls that the company

111
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,160
had supplied because every time people go up there they have to give them the stuff.

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,420
And I had felt packs on. That was boots that were lined with.

113
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,760
Pieces of felt about that thick. About a half inch thick in all directions. And the

114
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:24,320
reason I found out why they used felt is because if your feet sweated it would absorb the sweat

115
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:34,200
and it wouldn't freeze. The truth of the matter is I never. Oh and I had a thermometer. He

116
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,540
said you can keep that but it's only a matter of interest. And it didn't put me in the

117
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:46,960
room. It didn't take up much room. And I stuck it up in here. And he said I wouldn't

118
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,920
leave it exposed too much. I said why not. He said it might break. I should have opened

119
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,560
my eyes. But I thought he was talking about the glass being so cold it would be brittle.

120
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:08,500
I didn't think about the fact he was talking about the mercury freezing. He he he he. Anyway

121
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:17,660
we got started. The little girl was about as ugly as that. The little boy was about

122
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:26,380
as ugly as one of them little weenies. Mama and Papa were ugly beyond belief. And we started

123
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:35,860
out. We hadn't gone I would say two miles. I looked back at the shore and it was just

124
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,360
kind of sliced.

125
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,740
Now keep in mind.

126
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:46,700
I was out over the ocean. This is a perma. Wasn't permafrost of course it was. But the

127
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,520
ocean had frozen. Salt water. And everybody thinks if the ocean freezes over it's great

128
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,940
big flat little plane. Well it ain't nothing like that. It's tumbled up pieces of ice and

129
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:08,020
it frozen and frozen thawed and then jumbled back up. And so the dogs have to fight to

130
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,320
pull the sled up over these little ridges and they're sharp pieces of ice everywhere.

131
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:23,900
He had eight dogs and this sled about as big as this table. About as wide maybe a little

132
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:33,260
narrower running on these two things and it was piled up high. I would have never thought

133
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,940
that eight dogs could ever pull the damn thing. I would have thought it would require about

134
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,920
a team of horses. But those dogs just pulled it right along. Except when they got to a

135
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,540
ridge he had to help push it over. Lift up the front end and push the back end. He and

136
00:10:51,540 --> 00:11:04,160
the boy. And when we hadn't been gone two miles the agent had let me keep two Hershey

137
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,660
bars with almonds.

138
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:16,820
And I had nylon gloves on. The reason I had nylon gloves on that fit fairly firm was because

139
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,120
the military and I didn't have anything to do with the military required you to have

140
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,960
gloves in case you took your mittens off you touched something that you wouldn't stick

141
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:36,240
to it. Because I promise you if you took your warm fingers and touched something up there

142
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,900
you would stick to it.

143
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,160
Because the moisture in your fingers would instantly freeze. And it would require a lot

144
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,940
of effort to take it off. So it's a court martial offense among the military mostly

145
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:57,980
air force not to have gloves. So I had my gloves and I'm not stupid. I knew that little

146
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:05,100
kids mamas made their little kindergarten kids tie ribbons on their gloves and run it

147
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,000
up through their sleeve over their shoulders down to the top of their sleeves. And they

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,000


149
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,000


150
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,000


151
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,980
would tie them to the other one so they wouldn't lose them. Because little kids take their

152
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,020
mittens off and lose them.

153
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:21,580
And I knew if I lost a mitten or a glove I'd be in trouble. So I took the time to sew them

154
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,240
on. My mittens were loose I couldn't do that.

155
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:35,000
And I got out there and I reached into my pocket, pulled a mitten off, stuck it down

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,220
in one of the holes in the cover.

157
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:37,980


158
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,620
all and coveralls had zippers everywhere. There was a zipper on the arm and zipper on the leg,

159
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,320
zipper down the front, zipper down the back, just zipper the cover those with zippers everywhere.

160
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:59,860
And I put my mitten down in my and started unwrapping that Hershey bar and through this

161
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:09,460
brown paper and the silver wrapping down on the ice. And they stopped and they marveled at it,

162
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:19,860
at the paper and they tipped their sled up on the side and Mama San brought out this little clay,

163
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:28,640
looked like clay, could have been a rock bowl and went to pull back a flap of skin and chipped off

164
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,840
some ice and put it on the ground. And I put my mitten down and I put my zippers on and I put

165
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,160
in this little thing and put it on top of a primer stove they pulled out, a little primer stove.

166
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,000
They got some modern equipment you know. I was like, oh boy, look at that. Click click,

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,660
and that fire just went up. And it wasn't two minutes before that water was sizzling,

168
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,360
about that much water, and the thing about that big. And I said, that's not going to be a cup

169
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:59,520
of tea. They put a great wob of shredded tea in it. Oh they loved that tea.

170
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:07,560
And we had a ceremony. Poured out that stuff after it boiled and put it in a little cup and

171
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,640
handed it to me because I was the guest. And I sipped it and it looked down, it was just filled

172
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:22,500
with shredded tea leaves and it was thick as syrup. And I tasted it like that and it tasted

173
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,740
like just the essence of tea. I blew the top of your head off and it was hot. And I sipped it,

174
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:35,400
and I realized I was supposed to pass it around, and everybody took a sip. They were grinning and

175
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:44,940
you know, celebrating and pointing to the paper. And I was getting quite impatient.

176
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:57,000
Because we were going to be out there five days, I had no idea where we were going,

177
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,820
I had no idea where we were going, I had no idea where we were going, I had no idea where we were going,

178
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,680
I had no idea where we were going, I had no idea where we were going, I had no idea where we were going,

179
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,280
I hadn't got there. I had asked the agent where we were going. He said out there they'd turn around and

180
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:18,360
come back. Take a big leap. What were we going to do out there? He said whatever they do did

181
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:29,800
it along. And when they stopped within two miles I was already impatient. I wanted to hurt them, and I thought I did it, but I wasn't going.

182
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,580
and get where we were going. We were wasting a bunch of time. Well I wasn't

183
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:42,440
really upset about it but kind of curious and I had been told that the

184
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:51,040
mama would not or papa would not offer his wife up as an offering to a friend

185
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:59,500
for sexual engagement as they normally do because we white folks were barbaric

186
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,580
you know and didn't understand that kind of arrangement of treatment and being

187
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:13,120
nice to people. And there was good reason why I'll tell you about it in a minute.

188
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:22,120
But they also said now don't watch with real interest intensely whatever he's

189
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,200
doing with his tools because if he gets the notion that you are watching

190
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,480
kids and you're not watching kids and you're not watching kids and you're not

191
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,440
watching kids and you're not watching kids and you're not watching kids and you're not watching kids with envy he will not turn

192
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,900
around you say what don't you have one of those or don't you know anything

193
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,700
about things what do you do is throw it down kind of in a disdainful way like he

194
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:51,360
doesn't need it so you can pick it up and have one because he wants to be

195
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,940
polite to you and if you don't pick it up you think that you so smart you don't

196
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,380
need one.

197
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,260
Well you may die out there because he has thrown away a tool and you were too

198
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:12,780
stupid to not pick it up so don't put him in a situation where he will think

199
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,140
he's doing you a service by throwing it away where you can pick it up because if

200
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,840
you don't you may die. Well now that's like telling somebody don't stick your

201
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,460
tongue down in the hole in your tooth. Well you have a cavity have you ever tried to do that?

202
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,680
Keep your tongue away from that hole? I can't do it. My tongue just go right straight through.

203
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:43,700
Well I couldn't keep my damn eye off of what mama-son was doing. Anyway they put

204
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,020
everything back in straighten it up told the dogs to get moving mush-mush and

205
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:54,140
they didn't say mush-mush only it didn't come out like mush it was more like a

206
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,040
mosh you know something and they went on and

207
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,840
they were going to get me out of there.

208
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:18,340
I had a little piece of chocolate bar and I had enjoyed my little piece of chocolate bar and I'd stuck the other half down in my pocket and I was getting bored just walking along you know kind of trotting half walking half trotting nothing to do and there's nothing to see.

209
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:28,800
Oh I got to tell you as we were going out there was a Scotchman a red-headed guy with kind of bristly hair kind of curly and bristly.

210
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,000
who was going out with another family but they had started out about 15 minutes

211
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,020
before my family started so I knew they were out there somewhere but I didn't

212
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:49,880
see him anything. He comes into it later and we went along and this is January

213
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:58,780
the 3rd and there's no Sun up in the sky but we could see that the sun was going to come out of the sky.

214
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:11,480
And it was easy enough I could read a newspaper if I had one because there's enough reflection from the stars to be and all that white to see it was like twilight.

215
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:25,340
But there's no sun. Never did see the sun. I would see a faint way to the south a faint little arc you know but no sun just faint little arc of light.

216
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,680
And the aurora borealis.

217
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:38,920
You never saw such a sight. I was felt like I was under it. I had seen it from Massachusetts and I'd seen it from Maine.

218
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,440
It looked like great sheets of big curtains swirling around like that and would flicker.

219
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And it reminded me of the curtains over a stage you know as it goes back and forth with the swirls.

220
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,780
Only this was right under it and it wasn't just a light green like it usually is.

221
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:58,780


222
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,640
It had yellows and oranges in it. God it was the most spectacular thing.

223
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,800
And I thought to myself Father Boris of the North Wind, God of the North.

224
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,620
I thought Boris you're not too bad.

225
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,140
Now what do they do you know they have those things at the South Pole?

226
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,020
And what do they call the ones the lights at the South Pole?

227
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,620
You don't know did you? You never thought about it did you?

228
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,780
You think just because we got a North Pole.

229
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,700
There's no such thing as a South Pole.

230
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,780
Well there is.

231
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,960
And it's called the Aurora Australis.

232
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,160
Which means southern lights.

233
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,440
Anyway Father Boris gave the display that first time I saw it.

234
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,500
And it occurred to me that it's night.

235
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,640
Because you normally didn't see the aurora during the day.

236
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,340
But I found out later on you don't know whether it's day or night.

237
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,860
I had my watch but I never looked at it that I recall.

238
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,520
But I didn't know I just assumed that it was night time because the aurora was there.

239
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,360
It could have been day.

240
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,260
And that was I was amazed.

241
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,580
I was really fascinated by it.

242
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,200
And they stopped.

243
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,620
They'd seen it so damn many times they didn't pay much attention to it.

244
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,500
And I kept pointing at it.

245
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,380
Mama saw it and kept on tinkering.

246
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,360
And we went on and it wasn't something they found.

247
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:52,120
Digging in the ice there was a catch where they had some salmon buried for the dogs to eat.

248
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,020
It was frozen.

249
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,120
And chunks of salmon about that thick and about that big around.

250
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,660
And they pulled all this stuff out and whacked it and busted it.

251
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,700
And threw these chunks of salmon to these dogs.

252
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,820
They'd staked them down.

253
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,020
And these dogs

254
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,120
And the damn salmon was gone.

255
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,620
I never saw such a thing in my

256
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,180
Gone.

257
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,360
Eat.

258
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,300
Eat.

259
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,240
And the next morning.

260
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,440
They tipped the thing over.

261
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,740
The sled over.

262
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,040
And spread out a rug for me.

263
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,380
And I laid down on top of it.

264
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,880
And they kind of pulled down another piece of skin.

265
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,080
Kind of make a cover on it.

266
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,120
And they laid down.

267
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,080
Lengthwise.

268
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,200
We were perpendicular.

269
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,000
Only they let me kind of stay lateral up to the sled.

270
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,400
And they laid down on these in the same clothes on these skins.

271
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,120
And pulled a skin up over all of them.

272
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,820
Big skins.

273
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,360
And they were black skins.

274
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,420
And it would cover all of them.

275
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,340
All four.

276
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,980
I didn't sleep much.

277
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,620
Because I was in this cocoon thing.

278
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
You know when I say cocoon sleeping bag.

279
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,320
I'm talking about one that fits right this and kind of goes right down to your feet.

280
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,140
And it's not much wider than that.

281
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,160
Your feet are warm in it.

282
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,040
But you can't get any movement.

283
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,340
You can't spread out.

284
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,740
You can bend up.

285
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,700
But it's very uncomfortable.

286
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,720
And with my clothes on.

287
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,000
And I realized right then and there.

288
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,900
I had carried along a set of underclothes.

289
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,900
That I was going to change.

290
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,500
And I realized right then and there.

291
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,460
That first night.

292
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,960
That I would never change my underclothes.

293
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,460
There was no way I was going to get undressed.

294
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,720
And that kind of cold.

295
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,760
The temperature I looked at was about 80 below.

296
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,840
Later it broke.

297
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,140
80 below is hard to imagine.

298
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,040
If you spit.

299
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,800
It cracks.

300
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,580
It freezes.

301
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,940
And goes crack, crack, crack.

302
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,440
On the wall.

303
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,200
On the way to the ground.

304
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,940
Because it freezes so fast.

305
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,320
Anyway.

306
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,760
I didn't get much sleep.

307
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,000
But we had some tea.

308
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,060
And Mama pulled out some meat.

309
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,680
That was.

310
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,020
Seemed to be.

311
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,400
Fairly soft.

312
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,520
And I pulled my mittens off.

313
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,600
So I could.

314
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,660
And it was strips of seal.

315
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,700
That had a kind of a film on it.

316
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
A kind of a slick slime.

317
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,000
It was not frozen.

318
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,020
But they were eating it.

319
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,480
And had fat white stuff all around it.

320
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:07,900
You know.

321
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,600
Blubber.

322
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,540
It was stiff.

323
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,320
The blubber was.

324
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:14,760
Like.

325
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,240
Not like lard.

326
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,840
You know.

327
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,500
What.

328
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,840
Fat.

329
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,940
Pork fat looks when it's cold.

330
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,780
How it's stiff.

331
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,720
Well that's what it was.

332
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,440
It was stiff.

333
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,140
Like eating fudge.

334
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,780
White fudge.

335
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,280
Only it tasted like.

336
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,440
Whale blubber.

337
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,860
Or seal blubber.

338
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,800
And this meat was.

339
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,720
Red.

340
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,660
But it had a kind of.

341
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,240
Slime on it.

342
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,120
But it was fairly tender.

343
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:44,840
You could.

344
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,260
Bite off a piece.

345
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,300
And it would come off.

346
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,280
And it tasted salty.

347
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:49,820
And it was.

348
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,820


349
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,820


350
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,820


351
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,820


352
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,820


353
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,820


354
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,820


355
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,820


356
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:49,820


357
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,160
And kind of smoky.

358
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,440
And vile.

359
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,400
And I thought to myself.

360
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,840
Is this what my diet's going to be.

361
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,880
And about two days later.

362
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,500
It had never occurred to me.

363
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,200
That I didn't have any toilet tissues.

364
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,200
And it didn't occur to me that there were no bushes out there.

365
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,280
There were no trees that I could escape.

366
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,200
To go behind.

367
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,680
There was not a damn thing.

368
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,300
Maybe a piece of snow.

369
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,660
Or a sheet of ice.

370
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,520
That was built up.

371
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,620
That I could go behind.

372
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,660
But every time I started to go over.

373
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,100
Behind something like that.

374
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,060
Here would come this boy.

375
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,080
I found out later.

376
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,440
His job was to keep me from walking.

377
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,580
On thin ice.

378
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,700
There's a lot of ice.

379
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,700
Where warm currents come up.

380
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,120
And warm the ice.

381
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,180
And it gets thin.

382
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,220
I learned to detect it.

383
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,100
About three days later.

384
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,820
When it has a kind of a gray tinge to it.

385
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,280
You know.

386
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,040
That's not white or crystal.

387
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,720
It looks smoky.

388
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,500
And he wanted to keep me from walking into it.

389
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,980
Because the guide.

390
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,180
This trading post man said.

391
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,920
Now Mr. Smith.

392
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,160
If you fall in.

393
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,800
They are not going to pull you out.

394
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,340
And I said.

395
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,900
Well as long as you stay in the water.

396
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,800
You will live approximately eight minutes.

397
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,500
Before you expire.

398
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,900
And go down.

399
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,700
If they pull you out.

400
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,760
You will be dead.

401
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,780
In probably thirty seconds.

402
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
And I said.

403
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,780
Well that's a wonderful thing.

404
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,760
I ain't going to fall in.

405
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,360
Well that's what that little boy followed me around for.

406
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,560
Because he pulled me away.

407
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,740
A couple of times.

408
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,740
And I said.

409
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:47,920
Well.

410
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,100


411
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,180


412
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,000
And so.

413
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,820
Three days went by.

414
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,360
And I had yet to pass water.

415
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,160
They saved their water.

416
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,340
They.

417
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,960
Mama.

418
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,020
And that little girl would squat down.

419
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,440
And they would gather it in one of these little.

420
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,560
Looked like clay pots.

421
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,620
And stick it down into the sled.

422
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,800
Because this was the only liquid they had.

423
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,520
Now.

424
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,860
Papa and that boy was doing the same thing.

425
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,980
But I didn't see them.

426
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,900
Because they would be off.

427
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,340
Way out ahead of the.

428
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,800
Of the dogs.

429
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,560
You know.

430
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:27,960
Or.

431
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,300
Off to the side somewhere.

432
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,380
I never saw them.

433
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,120
But they.

434
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,820
I know that's what they saved.

435
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,660
Because.

436
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,440
That's the only liquid they had.

437
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,860
And I saw them use it.

438
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,560
They spent one.

439
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,100
One whole day.

440
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,320
I guess it was a day.

441
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,500
They.

442
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,500


443
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,500


444
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,500


445
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,500


446
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,500


447
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,500


448
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,500


449
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,500


450
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,360
Papa had chopped a hole in the ice.

451
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,620
Apparently he had been there before.

452
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,280
Where it's not too deep.

453
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,920
And he put a polar bear skin down.

454
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,780
Folded it up.

455
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,220
So it was about as big as this section right here.

456
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,320
And he squatted down on it.

457
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,840
And he had a harpoon right beside him.

458
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,120
And he stayed there.

459
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,560
Must have been eight hours.

460
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,660
And never moved.

461
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,000
Because we were about a quarter of a mile off.

462
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,480
Sitting and waiting until the water was gone.

463
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480


464
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480


465
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480


466
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480


467
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480


468
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480


469
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480


470
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480


471
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480


472
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,720
And he was talking.

473
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,440
And I wanted to tell you something.

474
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,740
It was boring.

475
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,940
It was boring.

476
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,600
And all I could think of was where can I go and pee pee.

477
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,260
Because I was getting into desperate straits.

478
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,020
Desperate.

479
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,580
Well I ultimately asked them for a cup.

480
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,440
And I went off and the boy went with me.

481
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,520
And I pee peed into a cup.

482
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,400
I had a lot more.

483
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,460
And anyway I got that ordeal behind me.

484
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:59,840
And I heard a and looked over and Daddy-O had pitched his harpoon down in the water.

485
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,140
A seal had come up to get air.

486
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,960
And a blow hole.

487
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,240
He didn't chop a hole in it.

488
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,820
I think it was a hole already there.

489
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,100
Because it wasn't very long.

490
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,000
He had a kind of a pole and an axe with him.

491
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,380
Anyway a seal had come up to get air.

492
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,480
And he had plunged the harpoon in it.

493
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,760
And the harpoon was tied with seal skin that had been braided.

494
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,980
It was made oh a hundred yards long.

495
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:33,580
And had it the bitter end a rod about that big around and about that long.

496
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,420
Tied in the middle.

497
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,260
And when that seal dove down it pulled all that line and it would have gone in except

498
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,360
that pole across the hole.

499
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,360


500
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,480
And the pole kept it from going a whop and hit that.

501
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,560
I thought it was going to break.

502
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:55,540
The seal kept pulling and pulling and would come up this and pull about thirty minutes.

503
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:02,260
And finally old man hauled him in and pulled the seal up and laid him out on the ice.

504
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,840
And the first thing he did was put his knife at the tail end.

505
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,560
This is a metal knife.

506
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,200
Up at the tail end of his fins back where his equipment was.

507
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,080
And he skinned it right up with that knife.

508
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,460
Right up his belly.

509
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,360
Right on up past his throat into the mouth.

510
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,220
And as soon as he did that this big belly down in the seal said boop as the skin pulled

511
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,380
out you know.

512
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:38,680
And he stuck that knife into that big belly and you could hear the gas smell it.

513
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,560
And he cut it open and he looked up at me.

514
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:43,900
He said.

515
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


516
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


517
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


518
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


519
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


520
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


521
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


522
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


523
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


524
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,040


525
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,100
He said.

526
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,460
He said.

527
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:45,980
And I was.

528
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,380
And he took his mittens off and reached down into the seal's belly and came up and showed

529
00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:01,500
me this juice and he drank it like that and then offered me to go down and I wasn't going

530
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,780
to risk him killing me by insulting me.

531
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,160
You understand?

532
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,720
When he offered me something like that I was going to take it and be nice.

533
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,440
And so I took my mittens off in my little glove.

534
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,020
And I stuck my hand down in there and it felt like it was on fire.

535
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,300
It was hot.

536
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,200
And I don't mean warm.

537
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,720
It was hot.

538
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,520
About a hundred degrees.

539
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,640
Not much is it.

540
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:39,000
Except that when you take your mittens off anything, anything that's above zero feels

541
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,580
warm.

542
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,840
And it was hot.

543
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,280
And I came up with that.

544
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,180
Juice.

545
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,100
And it had little lumps in it and a touch of green.

546
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,000
And I did like that.

547
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,580
And I was like ooooh.

548
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,980
And then mama and the boy did it and the girls did it last.

549
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,900
And you know what it tasted like?

550
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,540
It tasted exactly like seal vomit.

551
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,380
Little pieces of fish.

552
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,540
And they enjoyed that and they began to.

553
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,260
Daddy took the skin.

554
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,180
He cut along the long side all the way down.

555
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,340
Strips about like that.

556
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,800
And would hold it up in the air and pull it.

557
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,200
And as he pulled it, it would kind of curl.

558
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,860
And freeze.

559
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,340
And he would kind of mold it a little bit.

560
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,120
And.

561
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,240
And I guess within forty minutes he had made me a sled.

562
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,220
A little short sled.

563
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,260
It was a little longer than this.

564
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,800
About half as long as his table.

565
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,600
About this wide.

566
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,780
Nothing to put on it.

567
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,200
He could put some stuff on it.

568
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,240
And two dogs to pull it.

569
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,680
Now he made the runners off of the first strips he did.

570
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,120
And then tied some other cross pieces on it.

571
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,100
And I found out when he was done.

572
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,100


573
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,740
He had tied it.

574
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,140
He would tie a knot before it froze.

575
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,960
And would hold it like that.

576
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,340
And then he would get some of this liquid pee pee.

577
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,060
And he would pour on the knot.

578
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,780
And it would freeze.

579
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,140
And the ice would keep that knot from coming loose.

580
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,420
Because it was frozen.

581
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,260
Like using welding.

582
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,900
And he had me a little nap.

583
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,060
And they put two dogs on it.

584
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,040
With some harnessing.

585
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,080
And.

586
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,360
And indicated to me I was not supposed to ride on it.

587
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,260
Because the back end had.

588
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,000
He had put a kind of a criss cross of skin.

589
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,280
Of strips.

590
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,700
But don't ride on it.

591
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,860
Because two dogs couldn't pull it.

592
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,340
When he wasn't looking I jumped on it.

593
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,240
That was about the third day I guess.

594
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,020
Because I had lost track.

595
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,000
We left there.

596
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,080
I was in the back.

597
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,720
I had to eat.

598
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:11,820
Piling.

599
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,120
They cut the seal all up.

600
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,740
Oh.

601
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,960
The first thing he did.

602
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,140
I made a mistake.

603
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,920
He didn't cut the stomach.

604
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,680
He cut the liver out.

605
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,280
And held it up to God.

606
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,000
As an offering.

607
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,760
And praised to God.

608
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,700
Because the liver.

609
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,080
To the Eskimo is the seat of life.

610
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Not the heart.

611
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,380
We say I love you from the bottom of my heart.

612
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:37,920
They would say.

613
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,080
I love you from the bottom of my heart.

614
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,080


615
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:49,060
liver but they held it up to thank God and they all took a bite out of it and I took a bite out

616
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:58,040
of it and it tasted like raw liver which I hate raw or cooked and then that's when he cut that

617
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:06,500
belly open and they cut the meat up did it pretty quick and stuffed it back into the among the skins

618
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,920
on his sled and he put some of the stuff on the sled that they made for me I thought they'd made

619
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:19,960
it for me I think probably was these indicated you know you have it I didn't know how to run

620
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:30,700
the dogs anything else that boy did so we started off and about I guess 12 hours later seemed like

621
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:36,360
a long time this little boy pointed off mean like that and I look and I look

622
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:44,580
at quite now you know is glaring by but its dark and he point and I couldn't see anything

623
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:57,020
and we kept on going and lady kind of jerky point and Oliver and I saw a little dot little dot and I

624
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:02,300
could tell that there's a little dot look like it was moving but I couldn't really tell about

625
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,480
15 minutes later I looked over in this dot I could tell I sat and I thought hey Mr. Levinson

626
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:14,000
was moving it was something it was moving it turned out to be later the

627
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,360
Scotchman and when he saw me and I saw him we hugged each other like we were

628
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,720
long-lost brethren I had never seen him before in my life and he had never seen

629
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:38,040
me but we both spontaneously hugged each other oh we could talk how is it all is

630
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:48,180
grotesque and I told him well he even I was failed wrote this it was a great

631
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:57,340
reunion he gave me a copy of a Time magazine and I

632
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,700
could choose between reading it and I could choose between reading it and I

633
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,900
cherished it because I thought maybe I'd be able

634
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:08,560
reading anything to break them or not me or what I've been going through we

635
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:17,580
stayed there about four hours at night or we acting like we were sleeping well

636
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,660
I started back off and he started back over his family in the other direction

637
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,120
and the meantime now I head nor this is where this

638
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,680
raising honesty and truth from the buddhical heritage as the preceding

639
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:36,340
indelicate. I had not done number two in about four days and I was really

640
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:42,420
desperate. That didn't bother them one minute because when they had to go they

641
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:48,780
just kind of stood up and threw one leg out in front of them and went in their

642
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:55,720
pants and they seemed to me to be without any regard as to which leg it

643
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,600
will roll down. But they would push their leg out and their toes that would

644
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,900
throw their mukluk, that's the boot, up against the back of the leg so these

645
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,380
things wouldn't roll down into their boot. It would come out at the bottom of

646
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,380
the pants and they would leave these little things that look like they would

647
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:24,820
make into a nice little poop man because they were just pellets. And I realized

648
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,520
well what?

649
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:25,700
What?

650
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:25,700


651
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:25,700


652
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:32,660
What in the world kind of diet they must have that because that's what all of them left

653
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,120
these pellets and I think that's what made them so mean because they were a

654
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,840
courageous bunch. They ain't scared of nothing because they were obviously

655
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:50,640
constipated most of their life but that's what they left behind and with no

656
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,600
real concern. And there I was you know on a good old

657
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,940
healthy American diet and I would have to pull my pants down and so forth and I

658
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:07,380
knew they were gonna watch. Well it was the fifth day I could not stand it

659
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:17,440
anymore. I said modesty gone to hell I am going to move my bowels and so I kind

660
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:25,400
of went off and sure enough they followed. Mama the girl boy and I started zipping down

661
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,020
I told you about all these zippers I got everything down and had more trouble

662
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:35,660
with my pants underneath and I didn't have any paper. All I had was a

663
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,280
handkerchief.

664
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,060
That Time magazine.

665
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:46,860
I didn't know that wasn't that didn't even occur to me but I didn't have any kind of tissue or anything.

666
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:55,220
Anyway there I was and they went round behind me all four of them and squatted down and

667
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:05,620
watched. You talking about embarrassment now? By this time I had gone beyond it. I

668
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:12,760
didn't care anymore. Anyway all I had was my handkerchief and I used it and I left

669
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,620
it and obviously we had to stop and have tea.

670
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,820
To celebrate.

671
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,980
Yeah I guess whatever they had tea more and

672
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:35,460
I never knew where I was going but I wanted to get there. And finally I could tell we were

673
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:44,260
starting back because the stars that I could see changed the direction because

674
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:49,980
we've been going that we went in the big circle and then I began to see I never

675
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,200
did see the North Pole I want to tell you that I was up there close but I

676
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,760
didn't know.

677
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,600
North pole. I couldn't tell which it was.

678
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,280
I could see Orion way down...

679
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,460
You want more?

680
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,240
It was I mean it really went low and that was when I thought were we're heading

681
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,100
back and we got back and oh we did?

682
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,960
After we killed the Sega the wind came up and they stopped and they didn't

683
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:24,960


684
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:24,960


685
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:24,960


686
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:24,960


687
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:24,960


688
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,400
and to make a shelter, igloo.

689
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,640
And that's when I found out how they used that liquid.

690
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,580
They had a kind of a wooden, looked like a wooden shingle

691
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,120
that had a kind of a handle on it.

692
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,420
It was on the wood itself.

693
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,360
And it was sawed down in.

694
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,000
This snow is not ice.

695
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,820
And it's not like ice cube, because it wouldn't.

696
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:02,620
It was like fairly firm snow, but not fluffy.

697
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,900
It never snowed while I was there.

698
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,380
The most I saw was a fog, a ground fog about this high.

699
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,920
You stick your hand in, you couldn't see a damn thing.

700
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:20,060
But it kind of, it's so dry that you can't get

701
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,960
over the Eskimos.

702
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:21,980
Those Eskimos are the best.

703
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,220
They were always constantly touching their gloves

704
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,340
to the ground or to something and touching that way,

705
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:28,920
getting water.

706
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,460
It was constant.

707
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,600
It was just kind of like that.

708
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,900
Because I didn't have any water,

709
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,700
and I started doing the same thing.

710
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,540
But it's so dry.

711
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,080
Some sourdoughs back at the camp is talking to me

712
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,700
about how dry it was and that 4% humidity.

713
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,160
And that you couldn't get water out of the snow.

714
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:51,980
I said, of course you couldn't.

715
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,360
You can get water out of the snow.

716
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,540
Oh, no you can't, Mr. Smiley.

717
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,320
You can't do it.

718
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,480
There's not enough water in it.

719
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,280
And I said, well, I'll show you how to do it.

720
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,520
All right.

721
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,600
So I got a coffee can about that size, and I packed it with snow.

722
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,960
I mean, I packed it hard.

723
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,880
You know, I didn't just fool around.

724
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,520
I packed it in there, and I got a stove, a gas stove,

725
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,980
the camp stove, and set that thing and put a seal on it.

726
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,480
And I put a seal on top of it so it would hold it in there.

727
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,840
And I could hear that thing just down there sizzling,

728
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,300
just melting that snow.

729
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,460
And about five minutes later, I took the top off,

730
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,360
and that can was bone dry.

731
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,620
There wasn't a drop of water in it.

732
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,100
Not a drop of moisture.

733
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,140
I paid them the money.

734
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,320
I learned not to bet them anything,

735
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,800
no matter how foolish it sounded.

736
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,140
But anyway.

737
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:51,960
I got a coffee can.

738
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,580
There we were.

739
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,560
And I had been pounding this water like they did.

740
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:13,240
I got back, and I gave the camp, the Indian agent.

741
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,580
I bought a couple.

742
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,100
I said, what should I give them?

743
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,480
Something.

744
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,560
He said, a knife.

745
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:21,960
I said, what?

746
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:21,960


747
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,800
I said, I don't have any.

748
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,640
He said, that's generally what we want.

749
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,520
An axe is always good.

750
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,420
The only thing.

751
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,780
But the ladies will want a blanket more than anything else.

752
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,440
I bought two blankets, and I presented them with a blanket.

753
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,140
Oh, they were so gracious.

754
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:41,180
In the igloo, they cut the snow out,

755
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,480
and they cut it kind of down about as deep as this table.

756
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,820
And then spread it around the hole.

757
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,900
Take another.

758
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:59,940
And left the surface of the ice part of inside the circle.

759
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,320
In other words, they'd take the snow around and put it around

760
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:08,040
so that the ground, so to speak, became the platform inside

761
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,460
the igloo.

762
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,720
The hole was for the cold air to go in.

763
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,020
And the ledge that they left inside

764
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,200
was about as big as this table, maybe a little smaller.

765
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:29,380
And Mama took a bowl, and it had oil in it.

766
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,660
It was congealed with a wick.

767
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,980
And lit it.

768
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,560
And inside the igloo, my temperature

769
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:46,960
showed it was about 50 below when I

770
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,500
occurred to take the temperature inside.

771
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,960
And 30 minutes later.

772
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,960
It was up to zero.

773
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,880
And 30 minutes after that, it was up to 30.

774
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,360
And I noticed that they were sitting there on their skin,

775
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,960
and they were beginning to pant.

776
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,460
And they took their parka off.

777
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,380
I was still not anywhere near getting warm.

778
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:20,160
But they took their parka off, and they had underneath a kind

779
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,960
of transducer.

780
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,480
And they had a little thing that was called a

781
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:22,480


782
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:22,480


783
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:22,480


784
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,160
It looked like parchment.

785
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,120
You know what I'm talking about?

786
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,960
It was the lining of caribou skin.

787
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:37,420
It was almost transparent, but it was white and cloudy.

788
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,380
But they wore it like a body stocking.

789
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,600
Long arms, long legs, not tight-fitting, but loose.

790
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,620
And it was sewed very loosely with leather thongs.

791
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,940
And they had that in the back, and they had a little thing

792
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:51,940


793
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:51,940


794
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:51,940


795
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:51,940


796
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,900
that was called a

797
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,960
And I thought, well, thank goodness, that's about as far as they're going to go.

798
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:02,440
And next thing I know, it was about 30 degrees, as warm as it got inside.

799
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,740
And they took that off.

800
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:15,120
And I do want to tell you that you never saw such ugly people and bodies in all your life.

801
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,140
There was nothing sexy about it in this.

802
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,080
You just can't imagine.

803
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:32,240
Mama's son had breasts that if she'd have tried to commit suicide, because she had heard

804
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,160
that the heart was directly under the breast, she would have stabbed herself in her knees.

805
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,860
Because they were, what would you call it?

806
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:44,300
Pendulous.

807
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,880
Pendulous.

808
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,120
The little girl just was more like a baby.

809
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,120


810
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,120


811
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,120


812
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:50,380
Like, like buds.

813
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,680
But you could see that it was not.

814
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,420
They had bones up there, collar bones that looked like this.

815
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,240
Their chest came out like that.

816
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,100
They all had rickets.

817
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:10,320
The bones here were bowed, like bowed legs.

818
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,660
Just short arms and bowed.

819
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:20,040
And this thing, the chest was worse than anything because it kind of poked out like that from

820
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,580
the rickets.

821
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,820
Their diet was bad.

822
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,420
And they all went to sleep.

823
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,000
I went to sleep because I was tired.

824
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,680
I had been walking all day long trying to ride on my little sled.

825
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,680
And we got back and that was the end of it.

826
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:48,020
And I want to tell you folks right now that if you ever, ever have the opportunity to

827
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,980
do that, don't.

828
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,120


829
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,040
Because it is no fun.

830
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,520
It's very educational in a very useless way.

831
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:09,400
Never had the opportunity to learn anything that was of use to me later on.

832
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:18,780
Everything they do, everything they do is designed for survival.

833
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,280
Okay?

834
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,040
Everything.

835
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,820
In sub-zero temperatures.

836
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,380
Oh, and the harsh conditions.

837
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:38,780
I would say, were I a sociologist, I would say that the natural environment is of so

838
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:46,800
stringency that they had no time for leisure or other either philosophical thought.

839
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,260
I mean, I don't know.

840
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:49,260


841
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,240
No, no music.

842
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,880
Even like drumming and stuff.

843
00:50:53,220 --> 00:51:02,280
Doug, I heard and later read that when they have their great rendezvous in the spring,

844
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:09,560
when all of the tribes get together and the fishing is, the thaw comes and the fishing

845
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,560
is done, they all gather and they have big fun.

846
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,360
Not much music.

847
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,960
Not any kind that you would call.

848
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,580
recordings of Eskimo music. It's pretty strange.

849
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:30,640
It's strange. Mostly it's noise. But they do have a lot of...

850
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:30,880
You said about modern rock.

851
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:42,840
They circle, they have a big circle and they get a seal skin and pack it with bird's feathers and bird skins until it's fairly hard.

852
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:53,220
And then they'll kick it around for each other. And they always make sure that everybody has a chance to kick it while they are kicking it around inside this big circle.

853
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,680
Oh, they're having fun. Oh, kick.

854
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:11,520
And they get the little children, they get a skin and the men get in a circle and they put the little child in it and they start flipping the child up and down like a trampoline.

855
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,820
Little child gets in the circle.

856
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:17,460
And they're just laughing and giggling and all the men laughing and having a good time.

857
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:30,180
Sandy, did you ever hear of a movie called something like Ara Rajarat the Fast Runner? It's a movie made by Eskimos.

858
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,160
That's been in my story.

859
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,920
Of an Eskimo legend.

860
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,980
It's a great story, Pappy.

861
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,520
Oh, yeah.

862
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:40,580
It does say that your experience was of no purpose because it served to entertain us.

863
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,800
It's one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen.

864
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:42,800


865
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:58,640
This some white Canadian guy who was really in with them and an Eskimo guy who's connected to a university somewhere way northern Canada.

866
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:10,860
They managed to make a 35 millimeter feature film, all Eskimo cast of this weird ass legend.

867
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,800
It's basically a movie.

868
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,160
It's the same old story.

869
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:26,020
Guy, boy meets girl, girl cheats on boy, bad guy comes and steals stuff, kills dad, tries to kill boy.

870
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:32,200
Boy runs across the ice naked for five years and kills bad guy.

871
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,480
Gets girl.

872
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,560
That kind of thing.

873
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,600
It's self defense.

874
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,900
Oh yeah.

875
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,620
Because there's nothing evil about him.

876
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,980
He has to do it.

877
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,760
Sounds like revenge.

878
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:50,960
Sounds like it, but no it's not revenge. Revenge is a bad virtue, and so they don't allow it.

879
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,700
I want to tell you something, the Eskimos ain't scared of nothing.

880
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,140
You know how they kill polar bears?

881
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:13,920
They get, save up the baleen from whales. You know what the baleen is?

882
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,940
Yeah, the stoker and the teak.

883
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:19,320
The gills, and they soak it in water.

884
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,460
Baleen's the teeth that they use to filter out plankton, right?

885
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:30,060
Yes, yes, like gills. Great levels of it. It's filters.

886
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,260
It's not the lungs.

887
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,580
But they look like gills.

888
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,000
Okay.

889
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,580
And as the water goes through, they catch the plankton.

890
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:49,440
And it, well they get that baleen, and when they clean it off, they roll it up into, very tightly,

891
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:55,900
into things about that big around, and tie it with leather cords so that it's in a coil.

892
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,620
And it's about that long when they coil it.

893
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,000
And they put it out on the ice where they,

894
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:02,640
where they,

895
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,340
they know polar bears are, and foxes.

896
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:14,160
They also will stick a knife down into the snow and pack it around so that it's frozen,

897
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:21,540
and put blood all over the blade so that when the fox comes up and licks the blood, he's caught.

898
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,240
And if he pulls away, he pulls his tongue off and his skin off so they can follow the trail of the blood,

899
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,380
and catch them fox.

900
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:41,360
And when the bear eats the, swallows this meat with the big baleen coil inside,

901
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,180
it's frozen, of course.

902
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,060
But when it gets in his belly, it begins to thaw.

903
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:54,680
And as that acid eats through the thong around the baleen thing and releases,

904
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:55,320
it says,

905
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,860
and pops out through his guts in all directions.

906
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,080
And it hurts him pretty bad.

907
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,980
And then they follow him.

908
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:08,680
As soon as they know that he's eaten, they follow him until he perishes.

909
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,080
And when, sometimes he ain't totally perished.

910
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:21,620
When they get to him, and he'll fight, and they'll stand there with their spear or harpoon and stick him.

911
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,640
I wouldn't get anywhere near a polar bear.

912
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,400
But they don't seem to care.

913
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,260
They get hurt a lot, according to what I heard.

914
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,920
But that's the way they kill the polar bear.

915
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,980
That's a good way to do it.

916
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,200
It seems a lot safer than other places.

917
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:42,520
Oh yeah.

918
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,660
They don't have guns.

919
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,100
They're sort of poisoning it in a way.

920
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,340
They don't have guns.

921
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,620
And guns wouldn't do much good up there.

922
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,100
I was over in Alaska.

923
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,380
We were up in the mountains.

924
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,360
And we were up there.

925
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,300
Everybody had little 22 rifles.

926
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,960
I had to buy one.

927
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:09,420
In fact, this, Pinckney's got my 22 rifle that I bought to shoot these ptarmigan.

928
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,420
That's the wintertime.

929
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,260
They turn white.

930
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,200
And they don't fly very good.

931
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,360
And so they run along on the ground.

932
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,000
And if you see them, you can shoot them.

933
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,620
And I asked them.

934
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,240
We were at the camp on this lake.

935
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,720
The lake was out there frozen over.

936
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,760
And I asked one of the guys why they didn't.

937
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,560
Why they use rifles at the ptarmigan instead of shotguns.

938
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,020
It seemed to me it would be a lot better.

939
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,860
And he said, no, no, no.

940
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,680
Shotguns not so good.

941
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,600
And I said, why not?

942
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:47,140
And he said, well, take one of those rifles or shotguns there and go out on the porch.

943
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,620
And so I got one of their shotguns.

944
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,160
And I went out there.

945
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,700
And I pulled the trigger.

946
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,020
And not like a 22 says, pow.

947
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:56,980
You know like that?

948
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,240
Well, this shotgun says, boo.

949
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:07,080
And all of a sudden, about 15 seconds later, you could hear the echo coming from down those

950
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,600
corridors where the water was going.

951
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:16,000
And down these canyons, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

952
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,420
And then you could hear it coming back.

953
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,600
Crash, bang, boom.

954
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,080
That was echoing.

955
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,180
Crash, bang, boom.

956
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,060
Avalanches.

957
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:29,620
All of that noise and vibration started the avalanches.

958
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,720
And he said, that's why we don't use shotguns.

959
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,680
And I said, well, you know, that makes sense to me.

960
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,780
How about if I go out on this lake tonight with a little rabbit call?

961
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,700
I had a rabbit call, you know, a squeal like that.

962
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,360
And he said, who are you going to take with you?

963
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,820
And I said, what do you mean?

964
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,880
He said, well, if you go out there, you better have somebody sitting at your back.

965
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,280
And I said, why?

966
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,600
He said, well, you blow that out.

967
00:58:59,600 --> 00:58:59,600


968
00:58:59,600 --> 00:58:59,600


969
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,260
If you think that rats and rabbits or bears will come out of that thing, I want to tell you something.

970
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:11,580
That lynxes like wounded rabbits and wolverines like wounded rabbits and bears like wounded rabbits and they don't much care whether you're human or not.

971
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,420
If they don't know you are.

972
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,560
And I said, you know, you've just made a lot of sense to me.

973
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:30,760
because a wolverine would come up and fight you for that rabbit. They are kind of mean. Anyway,

974
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:43,540
I didn't go out on the lake, but that's why they used little rifles. Boom. It was double sounding,

975
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:55,980
boom. And it's cold up there. I've heard that it was cold up there. If you ever see that movie,

976
00:59:56,180 --> 01:00:02,520
Big Fish, that's my dad. Isn't that kind of a trippy, visually stunning film that people should

977
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:10,280
see? Big Fish? It's a weird Tim Burton movie. It's really strange. I haven't seen it yet. I kind of

978
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,160
liked it, but partly for personal reasons.

979
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:20,700
Because the bragging and lying dad who turns out not to have been lying,

980
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,120
reminds me a lot of my dad. And he's a southern guy. My father's from South Carolina.

981
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,580
Well, there you go.

982
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,200
Had a funny accent.

983
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:33,280
I always wondered about that movie. I haven't seen it, but I'll make an effort to see it now.

984
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,340
You've been listening to the Hour of Slack.

985
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,040
More than an hour.

986
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:42,380
On this station. For more information about Church of the Subgenius, feel free to check

987
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,520
out Subgenius.com.

988
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:43,520


989
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,520
Thank you, Dr. Howell and Reverend Mother Miller.

990
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,220
Thank you. The sacred scribe himself. Beautiful, beautiful. Thank you.

991
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:57,920
Okay, okay. I'm fading it out. Okay, that's all. Okay, I'm really fading it out. I'm fading it out

992
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:06,980
all the way now. Okay, now we can talk about the really important stuff that we can't talk about on

993
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:12,900
the air, on broadcast radio, because the Hour of Slack is almost always played

994
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:13,880
live.

995
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:13,880


996
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:19,240
College and public supported stations that are noncommercial, that means we can't be commercial.

997
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,300
But on the internet we can do anything. And we can tell.

998
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,760
We can take as crashed as possible, as available.

999
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:33,400
We can—this is the—this is our one chance to let you know that we know that you're

1000
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:40,420
tired of that old begging recording that I stuck at the end of all those shows. And this

1001
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:43,500
is the new one. And we're not even begging. We're just gonna immersing ourselves is what

1002
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:43,500


1003
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:43,500


1004
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:52,760
selling you the ordainment kit, the subgenius ministers kit or membership kit. It's $35 plus

1005
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:59,960
375 postage, I think, unless you're overseas, in which case it's like 150 bucks postage, but

1006
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:07,640
you'll see when you get on subgenius.com, right at the top, it says become an ordained minister.

1007
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,780
You click on that and you'll see a picture of all the cool stuff. The package that you get

1008
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,520
aside from the fact that you're now a damn minister, okay, you could really can perform

1009
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:26,980
weddings. In fact, I did one tonight. I signed the papers for my niece, Jessica, and that lucky

1010
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:35,920
son bitch Guillermo. And I did it for them for free because they're relatives. He's my nephew

1011
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,820
in law now. But anyway, friends, you can do that too. You can perform weddings and I usually get

1012
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,760
about 200 bucks.

1013
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,000
Well I were just going to let you know some of the you know, really good books here

1014
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,080
are free at audience carriers. Have you heard that one, that was apparently a typo?

1015
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,580
Absolutely, but I've never heard of those.

1016
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,600
This is Christine Bates on birthday.

1017
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,160
I know Kristin and we also yeah I mean, I'm looking for her on

1018
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,200
her birthday.

1019
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,720
Oh, of course, on gay cruise vacation too.

1020
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,880
Congratulations on that.

1021
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:09,960
Thank you, thanks for having me.

1022
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:10,240
Thank you.

1023
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,760
All right.

1024
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:20,280
you'd expect from a fan club such as a decoder ring that only we can decode you won't be able

1025
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:25,620
to do it looks like a little metal button with bob on it or actually divine intervention

1026
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:34,400
you get eternal salvation or triple your money back right of course or yeah um two really

1027
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:40,960
really fancy looking documents the all-inclusive excuse and the doctorate of the forbidden sciences

1028
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:50,660
which both look fantastic framed on your law office wall hint hint all those lawyers out there

1029
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:56,980
who haven't joined yet but the main thing about membership is the feeling you get but you finally

1030
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:02,280
really did support the hour of slack and the subgenius facebook pages and all the other stuff

1031
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:10,480
that's free and you helped reverend stang pay his half of the mortgage so uh

1032
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:19,480
and and it allows us to keep doing this and so forth so friends send that 35 bucks actually make

anger

1052
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,900
Anyone I want.

1053
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,140
And I've never kicked anyone out.

1054
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,760
Because Susie the floozy always does it and stays.

1055
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,220
Reverend Susie the floozy is on Scrub Genius Friends.

1056
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:24,200
And that's the only way you can be Reverend Susie the floozy's friend.

1057
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:28,680
And I know you want to be friends with Reverend Susie the floozy.

1058
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:31,920
With a name like that, she must be purdy and sexy.

1059
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,440
And just ready to jump in bed with anybody.

1060
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,660
Well, some of those things are true.

1061
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,080
She is really purdy and sexy.

1062
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,640
And she's really, really funny.

1063
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:48,420
And friends, that's why you must join the Church of the Subgenius.

1064
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,560
Get slack. The real thing.

1065
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,760
Yeah, exactly.

1066
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,740
How invaluable of a trick-or-treat bag is this?

1067
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,480
When you think of all the things you've gone through in your subservient lives out there.

1068
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,720
Waiting for one day or the next for something to change or happen.

1069
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,840
This will actually change your life, friends.

1070
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,700
And I don't mean to call you friends.

1071
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,220
I'm not saying it in a very formal way.

1072
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:12,440
I'm not saying it in a very formal way.

1073
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,100
I'm a nice person.

1074
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:18,780
I could just easily say something very vicarious and argumentative about you.

1075
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,540
But I don't know you.

1076
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,820
And that's the problem.

1077
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:28,200
So to solve that problem, vote for the Church of the Subgenius by becoming a preordained ministry.

1078
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:32,320
Because ministration is a very important part of our existence.

1079
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,840
If we didn't have it, we wouldn't have it.

1080
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:37,980
Price Bob.

1081
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:38,500
Yeah.

1082
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:44,160
And with that, friends, thank you and good night.

1083
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,740
Okay, but we're still on the phone, Dave.

1084
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,100
Buenas noches.

1085
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:49,540
Buenas noches.

1086
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:50,660
Buenas, buenas.

1087
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,740
Are we done?

1088
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,180
Well, yeah.

1089
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,000
Yeah, we're done.

1090
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,700
I'm afraid.

1091
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,120
Okay, I'm going to actually turn the recorder off.

1092
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,160
And that means we really are done.
