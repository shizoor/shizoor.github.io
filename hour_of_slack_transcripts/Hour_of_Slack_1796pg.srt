1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
From PR News in Washington, I'm drinking alcohol, including whiskey.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,000
PR's report reports that I'm not dangerous.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,120
They can drink up without fear.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:17,080
A rescue ship carrying inappropriate government officials and alcohol industry executives say they were PR News, Washington.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,400
What's it going to be, eh?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,640
Is it going to be in and out of institutions like this?

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,680
Or are you going to attend to the divine word?

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,280
The So Genius.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
The Power of...

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,140
What?

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,620
This is some new form of torture.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,100
Say it, brother, sir.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,120
I hope to God it'll torture you to madness.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,040
What the hell do you think you're doing?

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,500
Dragging your butt through the day.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,800
Selling your body and your soul to a bunch of bland normals.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,420
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,980
I'm tired of getting up.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm tired of all the guilt.

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,160
But none of the sex.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,880
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,940
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,720
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master at his church of the So Genius.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,520
Praise Bob.

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,980
Bob brings a new destiny to the abnormal.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,860
Bob comes to Just a Bob.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
He's the one who's gonna destroy our sins.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,360
To unmask the conspiracy.

29
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,220
And to get us back the slack they stole away.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,440
It's us, sir, says them.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,300
Are you going to fry in hell alongside the pink boys?

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,140
Or are you going to pull the wheel over your own eyes?

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,220
And accept Bob into your mind?

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,400
And repent?

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,620
And go in your nab?

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,760
Slack off and...

37
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,980
Praise Bob.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
The church of the So Genius.

39
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,900
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh yes, dear friends.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,060
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1796.

42
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,860
Thank you, Leemur, for the opening credits.

43
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,920
And the piece we started off with was by Santiago Trejo.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,660
Probably Reverend Santiago Trejo.

45
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,620
I'm not sure I got that off of one of the Facebook...

46
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,980
One of the sub-genius Facebook pages.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,540
The number of which is too damn high.

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,960
Our music in the background right now is the Swingin' Love Corpses from the Bay Mixes tape.

49
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,740
And on and off during this show, we're going to be reading from the Dobbstown Mirror.

50
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:08,000
That's a kind of a newspaper that you get if you get anything in the mail from sub-genius.

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,580
All the membership packs have them.

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:21,620
And basically, anybody who gets a face mask or book or anything at all from us gets the Dobbstown Mirror.

53
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,060
And some cool stickers.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,740
All of which are courtesy of Mayor Uncle...

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,220
Uncle Onan Canobite and Dr. Philodrumon.

56
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,560
But Mayor Canobite is the mayor of Dobbstown,

57
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,560
which is a forum on the internet for sub-genius members only.

58
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,960
But the Dobbstown Mirror is a printed thing.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,460
This one's from August of 2020.

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,720
And what you find in the Dobbstown Mirror is that...

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:57,720


62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,460
The Dobbstown Mirror are things to see, say, do, and buy.

63
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,440
Oh, no. Things to see, say, do, think, know, and buy.

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm sorry. I looked away for a minute to check my volumes.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,200
Things to see, say, do, think, know, and buy.

66
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,300
From the Dobbstown Mirror, greatest offer yet.

67
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,180
Friends, the church of the sub-genius is happening now.

68
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,920
You probably missed Dada, Surrealism, and Fluxus.

69
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,400
You probably missed Hippie, Punk, and Rave.

70
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,540
You probably missed Jonestown, Waco, and Heaven's Gate.

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,500
But the church of the sub-genius is happening now, and you haven't missed it!

72
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,940
The best mail-order mind-control cult at this price range is yours to join and mutate to your own ends today.

73
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,720
If you will.

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,360
We'll but decide you're not going to put your slack off any further.

75
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,020
X-Day approaches.

76
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,940
The church of the sub-genius, friends, taking the boar out of being born.

77
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:13,100
What other mind-control cults put you in the driver's seat with two steering wheels?

78
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,300
Who's that other guy?

79
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


80
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


81
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,100
incongruous

82
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,100


83
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,100


84
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,700
and

85
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:53,700


86
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:53,700


87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,640
It keeps us safe from the light.

88
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,480
Why would anyone open their eyes?

89
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,300
Tonight, I'm a thousand miles away.

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,700
None of us chose to be born.

91
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,760
None of us chose who we are.

92
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,640
Seven suns.

93
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,140
Money and war.

94
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,220
Humanity from the start.

95
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,500
Tonight, I'm a thousand miles away.

96
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,660
Tonight, I'm a thousand miles away.

97
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,140
Tonight, I'm a thousand miles away.

98
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,120
Tonight.

99
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,700
Insects grow

100
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,160
Eat their shit

101
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,680
Where they bleed

102
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,300
Just like us

103
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,380
Persuaded to

104
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,160
Fly in the wind

105
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,300
A bright strap

106
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,540
And legs drag too

107
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,960
Insects grow

108
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,380
Eat their shit

109
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,880
Where they bleed

110
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,460
Just like us

111
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,560
Persuaded to

112
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,180
Fly in the wind

113
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,480
A bright strap

114
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,680
And legs drag too

115
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,100
That was the song by Soma for Savages of Lawrence, Kansas

116
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,120
from their album Body of Light called World on Fire.

117
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,740
How appropriate for this week's hot current events.

118
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,920
From the Dobstown Mirror, a rare occasion.

119
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:08,880
It's difficult to know the details, but it is known there are subgenius operatives acting

120
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,480
in complete Dobbs-approved secrecy at every level of society.

121
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,360
Each has private and personal reasons for their subdued slack stances.

122
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,860
All dare vital in the resistance to conspiracy hegemony.

123
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:39,140
What can be known is that subgenii are everywhere, including, especially, among people you don't

124
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,740
care for.

125
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,660
Are you among them?

126
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,260
May I never know, even if we meet.

127
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,000
May it be a mystery to me, even if we've been friends for decades.

128
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,080
It's not my business to correct others.

129
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,360
It's not my business to correct others.

130
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,360


131
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,420
And I don't always appreciate their co-rectal examinations.

132
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,940
Next up is a song by Cult of Zere from the album Better Living Through Confirmation Bias

133
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,160
called Scorch the Earth.

134
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,560
Cult of Zere, incidentally, like Mayor Onan, lives in Portland, Oregon,

135
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,060
the most apocalyptically beset city in the whole USA lately.

136
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,160
And that's...

137
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,800
Laying a Lock.

138
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,120
Huh.

139
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:31,400
Could there be some reason we have this particular fire and stupidity-based theme developing?

140
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,940
waiting line

141
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,480
our

142
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,020
fantastic

143
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,380
confections will blow

144
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,420
your mind

145
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,480
wait for dark

146
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,800
will

147
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,580
greet our new

148
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,960
neighbors with spears

149
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,820
and knives

150
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,180
in the

151
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,620
fire

152
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,340
hall

153
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,200
today's suicide

154
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,400
will be filmed

155
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,020
by

156
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,040
film

157
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,400
by

158
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,740
that

159
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,520
fire

160
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:32,880
it all

161
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,140
is a

162
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,460
violent

163
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,720
carnival

164
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,080
engineered

165
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,220
by

166
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,040
fools

167
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,180
and

168
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,580
to

169
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,700
pray

170
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,480
I will

171
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,040
slip away

172
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
mutually

173
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,860
assured

174
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,840
oh

175
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,800
hope

176
00:11:59,800 --> 00:11:59,920
hope

177
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,200
hope

178
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,760
oh

179
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,400
oh

180
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,740
hope

181
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,440
hope

182
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,700
hope

183
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,340
hope

184
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,400
bu

185
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,440
wow

186
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,840
my

187
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,100

188
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,540
We're gonna drown

189
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,520
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?

190
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,720
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?

191
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,260
Yeah, we're gonna drown

192
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,120
Drown, drown, drown

193
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,100
Slash and burn and scorch the earth

194
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,540
Every time

195
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,900
Can't we get it right?

196
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,920
We're really fine

197
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,660
And as the tides make up your mind

198
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,320
Can't we get it right?

199
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,040
Strange art and magnifying

200
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,880
An ancient mind

201
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,580
Be kind, rewind

202
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,080
Don't go to the light

203
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,300
Anyhow

204
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,420
It's a violent convo

205
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,700
The buttons and the food

206
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
Dreaming

207
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,040
Driftless and childish

208
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,300
Crash the game

209
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,300
The best ultra

210
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,220
Not good

211
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,800
Good

212
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,780
All good and

213
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,020
No

214
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,840
But this is not

215
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,240
A pretty white world

216
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,700
And this is not

217
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,860
A coke and a smile

218
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,100
And this is not

219
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,100


220
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,100


221
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,100


222
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,100


223
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,100


224
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,100


225
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,100


226
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,500
A dope-flaky lie

227
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,700
Dude, we're gonna drown

228
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,540
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?

229
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,780
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?

230
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,620
Yeah, we're gonna drown

231
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,500
Drown, drown

232
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,760
Drown, drown, drown

233
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,560
Drown, drown, drown

234
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:46,560


235
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:46,660
Yeah, wow

236
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,360
Can you go home

237
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,540
Can't we get it right?

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,660
businesses

239
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,500
Can we drive

240
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:03,960
Can we play

241
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,120
Go back home

242
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,120


243
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,120


244
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,120


245
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,120


246
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,280
Oh you college

247
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,320
scars

248
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,700
Nyfye

249
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:12,860
All these secrets

250
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:12,860


251
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,600
Down below

252
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,140
From the Dobbs Docktown Mirror,

253
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,220
here is our combination.

254
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,460
What makes you an individual?

255
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,620
Having fingerprints?

256
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:55,180
It could be that individuality is much broader, more dangerous, more rewarding than you have

257
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,380
considered until now.

258
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,900
And even until now!

259
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,220
The Church of the Subgenius is a club for non-joiners.

260
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:11,300
Bob and the Exists have access to the Book of Life, listing all paid members.

261
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:18,700
The likes of you and I, however, may never know if a kindness or cruelty was unknowingly

262
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,020
wasted on a fellow subgenius.

263
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,140
This is the

264
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:52,500
The Unusual Swingin' Love Corps version of Purple Haze.

265
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,480
This dark star will never shine.

266
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,280
I take your light and I make it mine.

267
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,240
And I ain't trying to be bragging.

268
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm not trying to be bragging.

269
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,280


270
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,280


271
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,280


272
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,280


273
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,800
But I'm flying on a sub-dragon.

274
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,940
All I do is set the world on fire.

275
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,660
To watch the light bounce off your eyes is my desire.

276
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,660
Lost love through a space rift.

277
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,960
And now I'm just negative.

278
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,400
I've gotta 300 pounds longer, 야

279
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,400


280
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,220
How about that, yet another flaming and burning song arabic

281
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,220


282
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,100
toward the end of Anh Muôn Dung

283
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,240
How about that?

284
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,460
Yet another flaming and burning song, O Lê Nério, islands at dusk I'm

285
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,280
I want to set the world on fire 花 Buy by Sunstone Sade, The Sun全世界堪炮

286
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,280


287
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:49,640
negative. So very strange that in September of 2020 in the USA there would be this outbreak

288
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,740
of songs about the world burning up with fire and sickness. Jeepers, I wonder what that's about.

289
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:07,420
From the Dobbs Dock Town Mirror. Psychic Research. The so-called problem of evil

290
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:15,780
asks why a benevolent God would allow suffering. This is only a problem for mainstream religions.

291
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,900
The Church of the Subgenius knows that suffering feeds the Elder Gods and it's as simple as that.

292
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:30,520
What is frustrating to the Subgenius is not that suffering happens, but that it happens to the

293
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:37,140
wrong people. Namely, anyone who ever bothered us to any degree at any time, including other

294
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,400
men. And so, the Church of the Subgenius is not the only one who is suffering. The Church of the

295
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,400


296
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,260
Subgenius is one of the most important members of the Church of the Subgenius. We welcome suffering

297
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:53,460
when it happens to them. Time for a story now from the mysterious Sheridan of Cleveland. He

298
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:00,620
has a double CD of these stories, all of which had to adhere to three strict rules. One, the two main

299
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,440
characters must be opposing, nearsighted versus farsighted. Two,

300
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,360
there must be at least one crass commercial and unpaid for reference to some product. And three,

301
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:19,940
there must be a gnat in every story. This one is Adam and Eve.

302
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,900
It was a gleefully, unabashedly,

303
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:43,860
unashamed morning, and the sun shone like an overexposed tanned yellow butt in the sky

304
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:55,840
with a crack in it. Gnats circled Adam's yucky umbrella drink and took turns diving down the

305
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:05,660
suction straw like poor travelers on a Price's Right vacation in their first and last tube ride.

306
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,820
Reaching for his alcoholic pleasure,

307
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:24,420
he promptly plunged the straw into his eye yet again and again. Eve curled her straight hair

308
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:33,280
around her finger and didn't bother to look. She's been here more times than she's used the finger.

309
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,880
B했lle Knapp where Edmundsolem in theenderaker follows. It's simply a implementation of where he

310
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:35,880


311
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:35,880


312
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:35,880


313
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,260
Her, always the thinking, responsible one.

314
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,720
Him, always the drunken drinker.

315
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,080
She, always looks to the potential ahead of them.

316
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,920
And he, no further than the drink before him.

317
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,440
What's the blend today, dear?

318
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,020
She casually asks.

319
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,740
She asks.

320
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,000
Yerk, puss, and pomegranate pulpy.

321
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,660
He burps and scratches his neck mole.

322
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,900
Want some?

323
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:23,800
She nods and holds out her hand to accept the foul-smelling mixture.

324
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,380
She grimaces and stomps the ground once

325
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,300
from her generic dollar store lounger

326
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,000
with scabies.

327
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,940
She kicks up dust covering her tan bare foot,

328
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,600
including the custom salon toenail paintings

329
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,360
of butterflies and birds

330
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,860
with a specially mixed magenta background blend.

331
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,860
Not bad!

332
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,340
She shrieked at the top of her now-destroyed vocal cords.

333
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,400
Not bad!

334
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,820
But needs more bumblebee anus.

335
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,000
Not bad!

336
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,300
Really as good as your used chewed tobacco jar

337
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,920
swamp puddle juice mixture.

338
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,160
Well, it's not like I'm trying.

339
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,480
It's not like I'm not trying.

340
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,080
But I'll kill you yet.

341
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,260
And no, I did not just say that out loud.

342
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,660
What's that, dear?

343
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,960
What's that, dear?

344
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,000
What's that, dear?

345
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,180
What's that, dear?

346
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:42,160
Adam, who is nearsighted, lethargically reaches for his drink three times before tumbling

347
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:51,720
it off the 100% solid wood, a key of mahogany stained, custom cat-like end table in a drunken

348
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,320
grunt.

349
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:03,000
Farsighted Eve chuckles to herself as she rises, adjusts her matted hair, and then,

350
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,400
and announces that she is going for a walk.

351
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,860
Farsighted Eve says,

352
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:09,860


353
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:17,060
They blurry-eyed gazed upon each other, both cursing the fact that corrective lenses had

354
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,500
not yet been invented.

355
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,720
Farsighted Eve says,

356
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:29,940
Eve disappeared with a rustling of tree branches and an inviting sideways glance into the thick

357
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,000
forest not yet protected by damp, damp grass.

358
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,000


359
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,640
Eve, clueless, tree-hugging, bleeding-hard environmentalists that are way over their

360
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,780
damp, save-the-earth, bloated heads.

361
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:52,620
Farsighted Eve leaves the trail of ouches as she makes her way through the woods, leaving

362
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,080
a path that would later become the Cleveland Metropolitan Park's memorial bike trail.

363
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,980
Farsighted Eve says,

364
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:02,980


365
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,940
She walks, tree roots stinging the soft pulp of her feet.

366
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,240
She mulls over her relationship with Adam.

367
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:24,140
In her first intimate encounter, she remembers laughing at the tiny blurry thing between

368
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,900
his legs.

369
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,140
What's this thing do?

370
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,400
She snickers.

371
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,960
Farsighted Eve says,

372
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,760
Hmm, sad.

373
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,340
An adam bootless piglet.

374
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,380
Farsighted Eve closes her mouth wide, recover her

375
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,080
legs, uprooted fleece, eso familieshome, the

376
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,080


377
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,480
Excuse me.

378
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,060
Farsighted Eve screwed her in.

379
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,940
Farsighted Eve finally leaves the trail of ouches.

380
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,340
with his mighty male dominant middle finger.

381
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Eve refused to give in to modesty

382
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,260
until she scored her victorious secret links.

383
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,160
And besides, if she had it, she was going to show it

384
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,100
before age would surely blow it.

385
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,060
Adam turned, disheartened,

386
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,800
and made his way back through the woods,

387
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,420
leaving Eve behind because, well, because he's stupid.

388
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,120
Hungry and thirsty from her travels,

389
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,540
Eve tries to train her vision on the objects

390
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,820
hanging from the trees closest to her.

391
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,340
She reaches out for food,

392
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,820
but grasps a slimy, coiled snake

393
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,780
lying on the ground.

394
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,580
Instead.

395
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,940
I shall be a tattoo on your lower back,

396
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,900
coiling around your round buttocks,

397
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,400
reaching down your left leg

398
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,680
and ending at the soft tendon in your ankle,

399
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,740
the snake said.

400
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,780
The hell you say?

401
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:31,780


402
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:31,780


403
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:31,780


404
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,500
yells Eve.

405
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,360
I have allergies!

406
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,400
And squeezed the snake's head

407
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,940
until its eyes popped out like BBs

408
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,800
and put the eyes out of the nearest budding potato.

409
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,900
Gonna need to readjust your vision plan now,

410
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,700
she said as she fashioned the snake skin

411
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,780
into a new pair of boots.

412
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:01,780


413
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,760
Walking boots.

414
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,980
And that was Sheridan.

415
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,480
Sheridan from old Cleveland.

416
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,720
Oh, Sheridan tells some funny, funny stories.

417
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,100
And now this.

418
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,240
From the Dobbs Dot Town Mirror.

419
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,760
Rational List.

420
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,020
Living.

421
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,160
If nature doesn't make a great deal of something,

422
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,600
then that something is usually neither cost effective

423
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,660
nor quite bothersome enough to breed out entirely.

424
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,260
Like some rare diseases.

425
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,640
Like being left-handed.

426
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,680
Like high intelligence.

427
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,080
The Church of the Subgenius offers the first ray of hope

428
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,460
that there is a cure for the IQ problem.

429
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,200
Beyond alcohol.

430
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,660
Beyond traumatic brain injury.

431
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,700
Humans are the missing link between earlier primates and AI.

432
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,460
The Church of the Subgenius is the missing link between earlier primates and humans.

433
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,840
And between humans and AI.

434
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Meet enough subgenii and you'll see what I mean.

435
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,860
Many are both.

436
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,020
And so can you.

Hi, Ed, improve, help, and connect,

442
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,420
listen, and move.

443
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,340
Im

444
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:22,700
Mike.

445
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:30,180
So, how can you do so much for today?

446
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,500
hell that some of you here know about slack but the other thing you need to know about is

447
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:51,520
you know every church has got some kind of rules and laws we only have one and i think some of you

448
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:59,940
know what it is it is if they can't take a joke and believe it or not as cynical as that may sound

449
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:07,440
that is indeed a philosophy that you can live by the church of saturn was founded in 1953 by this

450
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,700
salesman this incredibly magically talented salesman jr bob dobbs when he was seized up in

451
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:21,620
the spirit by an alien space monster called jehovah one which has disguised itself as god

452
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:28,260
for numerous religions over the centuries and he told bob that throughout history there has been

453
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,460
a conspiracy

454
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:37,800
of normal people stealing away the slack of the weirdos the abnormals the misfits the

455
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,380
disbelievers and most important of all those who will believe anything can i get a break bob

456
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:51,340
so he founded his church not on a rock but on a sandy shifting beach of hypocrisy

457
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:56,420
because where's any relation without its hypocrisy i ask you it's not that we love

458
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,480
bob that much it's that we love the idea everybody else

459
00:31:59,480 --> 00:31:59,860
burning

460
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,360
in hell

461
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,600
it's like any other religion you know that's what it's all about but it is a doing yourself

462
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:13,580
religion it is a disorganized religion a non-organization for non-joiners which makes

463
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:20,260
it hard to make a buck off this thing all subgeniuses by definition are different if any

464
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:28,600
two are alike one must die so check your neighbor out make that decision quick the only thing that

465
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,920
we as subgeniuses are different is that we are not the only thing that we are not the only thing

466
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:29,920


467
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:35,220
that we have in common is that we have nothing in common with the normal people look at the

468
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:42,780
word subgenius we didn't call it church of the genes okay almost anybody can qualify what we're

469
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:49,140
saying is that conspiracy has been misdefining intelligence all this time it's not intelligence

470
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,940
that we're talking about that's not what counts what counts is sense common sense sense of humor

471
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,580
and dollars and steps and uh

472
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:08,080
the thing is bob is not smart when being smart ever gets you a date well actually in this crowd

473
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:15,940
maybe you can but what he has is luck he is lucky isn't the reason that bob can do magic and you can

474
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:22,980
is he doesn't know any better he walks the path of least resistance friends that is his path to

475
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,000
slack and it can be yours too but here's the thing about slack we're not going to tell you what it

476
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,280
is because we can't

477
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:36,540
only you know what slack is for you now for some some people slack is sitting in front of the tv set

478
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:43,280
and smoking a beer or whatever uh for other people like me slack is working your ass off at what you

479
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:52,760
wanted to be working your ass off at we're not here to forgive your sins bob dogs is not the kind

480
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:59,740
of uh messiah that is he's not that well connected and on top of that he does not actually give one

481
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:07,400
flip of a about your sins he doesn't care about your sins he comes not to forgive your sins he

482
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:15,960
brings not forgiveness but an excuse that's all you really needed was an excuse and that is what

483
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:22,980
he is for now and he is here to bring to bring a reminder of slack now slack is as i said it's

484
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,960
indefinable you might call it something for nothing now a lot of people think all of this

485
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,640
church is just all about

486
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:29,920
me

487
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:39,320
Well that too slack is connected to money slack is connected to sex but bob is slack bob is money

488
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:47,240
bob is sex and bob is coming for boys girls and everybody in between ask not what bob is smoking

489
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:53,820
in his pipe for he is smoking you you throw yourself into that damn pipe bob is a short

490
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,760
duration personal savior after a while you get tired of bob and move on to the next person

491
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,400
everything goes sideways lo Anthony

492
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,520
it has

493
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,280
a crime

494
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,000
to make me

495
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,480
camper

496
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:12,480


497
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:12,760
scared

498
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


499
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


500
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,060
Dolan

501
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,660
dough

502
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,840
Folks know about the, there's a lot of conspiracies.

503
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,720
There's going to be one for everybody.

504
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:26,720
There's the JFK conspiracy, the UFOs crashing at Roswell, the 9-11 truther conspiracy.

505
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,300
Worst of all, the fashion conspiracy.

506
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,080
Friends, don't worry about a one world government or a one world religion.

507
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,200
You should be worried about a one world advertiser.

508
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,380
That's who's going to bend you over and not even have the common decency to give you a reach around.

509
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,580
Friends, we're not asking for love because this is a war.

510
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,060
It's really us versus them and this time we're us.

511
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,760
For once.

512
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,920
Friends, we're trying to lead a return to decadence.

513
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,820
Not trendiness, but decadence.

514
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,980
Luckily I will be followed by two hot chicks and one other of the old men.

515
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,500
And then by an architect who will return.

516
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,760
In the meantime, friends.

517
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,080
Yeah, this is a.

518
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,660
Free country, all right.

519
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,440
You're free to work your ass off, right?

520
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,620
They even have a machine now that can tell when you're thinking.

521
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,740
It's called a television.

522
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,180
And if it's off, you're guilty.

523
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,820
Friends, all we're trying to do is tempt sinners away from the devil.

524
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,560
We don't give a head where you go after that.

525
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,620
We believe in the God that doesn't want us to believe in him.

526
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,200
That's how ordinary we are.

527
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,980
We are.

528
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,480
So.

529
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,200
So.

530
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,240
Brilliant.

531
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,720
I said.

532
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,940
In fact,

533
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,660
right how everything is one of the two dictates.

534
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,880
I am not a person.

535
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Since Bob said.

536
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,760
And I could go on and.

537
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,060
Yeah,

538
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:11,360
Yeah,

539
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:19,320
the sex cult and the deviation and the special x-ray drills and so forth, mind control that

540
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,880
we tend to do on you.

541
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,880
But I have to confess something to y'all.

542
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,660
There have been times when I used to look out on what's normally a pretty small audience

543
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,220
of subgeniuses and I think, some of these people are real nerds.

544
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:41,620
I would get frustrated at the sheer nerdliness of half of the subgeniuses.

545
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:47,120
But then one day I suddenly went, dog, that's what this is all about.

546
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,100
It finally sunk in.

547
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:56,380
Yes, they are f***ed up because there really is a conspiracy of normals stealing away their

548
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,700
slack.

549
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,260
They are f***ed up and that's why J.R. Bob Gobs is their god.

550
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,880
And that is why you.

551
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:10,980
You, my friend, you must repent, quit your job and slack off while you still know how.

552
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,700
Question authority.

553
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,020
I see a few people out there have been reading their prescriptions.

554
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,820
Bob is not.

555
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,380
Now, believe it or not, some of you Bobbies are going to be surprised by this.

556
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,700
Bob is not the answer.

557
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,900
But neither Christ Bob is anything.

558
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,620
Else.

559
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,120
But there's one thing I want to leave you with.

560
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,080
And that is that one rule of Bob, the one rule of the church of the subgenius.

561
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,480
F*** them if they can't take a chump.

562
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,140
Praise Bob.

563
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,800
Praise Bob.

564
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,860
Praise Bob.

565
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,300
Praise Bob.

566
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,020
Praise Bob.

567
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,920
Praise Bob.

568
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:54,920


569
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,820
Praise Bob.

570
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,400
Man, we did some serious ranting back in those days.

571
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,840
That was a mix by Она viendo то Shlānder Bob

572
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,240
From a revival recording of me preaching.

573
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,000
He calls it ranta-mania

574
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,360
from 2010.

575
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:28,520
Boy!

576
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,560
I guess I was working harder back then.

577
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,120
kingsmore's house in life

578
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,200
which she had reset because he said when i really was ready there's too many roads there can always be some modes available at that time aroundها

579
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,500
20 years younger.

580
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:39,940
Hmm.

581
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,360
Crazy.

582
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,720
And now this.

583
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,180
From the Dobbs.town mirror.

584
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,860
New way to health.

585
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,700
Slack is the force that causes people to ask,

586
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,460
what is Slack?

587
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,020
Blessed necessity.

588
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:01,880
Immoral?

589
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,560
Read this twice.

590
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,740
There are many moral systems and they often contradict each other.

591
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,760
Even if you pick one and only one and adhere to it faithfully,

592
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,920
it is you who decided that one was the correct one.

593
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,560
That makes you the arbitrator of morals and immorality.

594
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,800
Diversify your ethical portfolio with the church of the subgenius.

595
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,880
Keep your existing beliefs.

596
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,780
Add and subtract beliefs as you already do.

597
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,000
Accept.

598
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,500
Now.

599
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,400
Openly.

600
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,320
With Slack.

601
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,440
And with J.R. Bob Dobbs at your side.

602
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,400
This music is the Swingin' Love Corpses.

603
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,880
Coming from a darkness reaches a place of dismantle and murder by nature's enrages.

604
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,260
And dust and rubble traces of the beast.

605
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,800
By a law to the right.

606
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,180
This world is a place of justice.

607
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,340
But you're not going into your fate.

608
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,320
Rowing backrages of drama, murder, sorrow, or fate.

609
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,100
Submit to us your brand new, most contagious people unrest.

610
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,840
And you are the apostate.

611
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,380
The old ways of your world, evil, and fate.

612
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,820
Who has the capacity to die unseen?

613
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,040
Never as good as me.

614
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,960
Subversive weakness, become free.

615
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,400
The Nintendo 4, your history.

616
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,980
Summon the Dark Genie with the last chance.

617
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,380
Advancing evolution is our feat.

618
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,260
Who's empathetic attempt to preserve your romance.

619
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,260
Without the destruction you're locked in a trance.

620
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,040
Who's calling zombies into your risk of escape?

621
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,840
Shivering monkeys obsessed with murder might.

622
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,660
We are the mystery wiped off magnetic tape.

623
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,980
The last chance for your future philosophy.

624
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,800
Shaped and planted by a sea.

625
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,920
Never as good as me.

626
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,840
Subversive weakness, become free.

627
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,340
Time to forge your history.

628
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,640
And you are the apostate.

629
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,660
The old ways of your world, evil, and fate.

630
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:14,660


631
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,000
Never as good as me.

632
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:21,020
The old ways of your world, evil, and fate.

633
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,020


634
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,020


635
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,160
Time to forge your history.

636
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,520
Shaped and planted by a sea.

637
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,520
Who's empathetic attempt to preserve your romance.

638
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,360
Without the destruction you're locked in a trance.

639
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,360


640
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,360


641
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,360


642
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,360
Destruction, you're locked in a trance

643
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,160
Coming armies of doom, there is no escape

644
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,120
Shivering monkeys, obsessed with murder rape

645
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,880
The arms of the string wipe from magnetic tape

646
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,020
One last chance for your future, far to reshape

647
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,680
That was better

648
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,280
I am Thee, who's never as good as me

649
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,140
As the curse of weakness, become free

650
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,580
It's time to forge your history

651
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,140
I am Thee, who's never as good as me

652
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:13,140
As the curse of weakness, become free

653
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,520
It's time to forge your history

654
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,940
I am Thee, who's never as good as me

655
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:21,940


656
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:21,940


657
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:21,940


658
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,540
Apophatic

659
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,340
Apophatic

660
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,060
Apophatic

661
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,240
Apophatic

662
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,360
I am Thee, who's never as good as me

663
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,280
As the curse of weakness, become free

664
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,720
It's time to forge your destiny

665
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:57,040
TNN did that. TNN is one of the projects that Dr. Argus Fox is involved with.

666
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:02,180
And their new album is called Standarization.

667
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,580
Standarization is a project that has been

668
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:06,580


669
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:06,640
Association of Musician and Musician of the World.

670
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:12,460
The swinging love corpses have been helping us in the background music.

671
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,920
And from Dobbs.Town Mirror, a cure for magic.

672
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,240
Years ago, I was entering a building with someone I worked with.

673
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,580
She pulled some change out of her pocket and threw it on the steps.

674
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,300
I asked why.

675
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,060
She said to her it was some change, but if a child found it, they'd feel lucky.

676
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,100
Think about how good it feels to feel lucky.

677
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,660
You don't even have to have a lucky experience to have that feeling.

678
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,920
Seek it out. Pretend if that gets you started.

679
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,220
Think, I'm lucky and today is a lucky day.

680
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,540
Try it for three days running and see what happens.

681
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,960
Now, the Rudy Schwartz Project.

682
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:13,720
A song called Bunkum Doubly Damned from Delicious Ass Frenzy.

683
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,720
I'm editing a nature video to go with that music.

684
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,280
Stefanie Reuberg in a

685
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,280


686
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,280


687
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,280


688
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,280


689
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,200
The Wimbledon

690
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,200


691
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,200


692
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,260
Thank you.

693
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:30,780
Thank you.

694
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,100
Thank you.

695
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,160
Thank you.

696
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,220
Thank you.

697
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,820
Thank you.

698
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,360
Thank you.

699
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,060
Thank you.

700
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,420
Thank you.

701
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:28,440
Thank you.

702
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,380
Thank you.

703
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:31,380
Thank you.

704
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,040
Thank you.

705
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:32,980
Thank you.

706
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,220
Thank you.

707
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:32,980
Thank you.

708
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,400
Thank you.

709
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:27,940
Thank you.

710

Thank you.

711
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:25,860
Thank you.

712
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,400
Thank you.

713
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,400
Thank you.

714
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,420
Thank you.

numerous radio stations all over the country.
