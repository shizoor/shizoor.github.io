You're normally such a slacker.
It's the first time you've heard of him.
Are all four of you guys in here?
Is Phil in there?
He just, yeah, yeah.
Can we?
Doing with four?
Yeah, all four.
Okay.
What are we doing?
How do we?
This is, this is.
Oh, yeah.
They'll do the comedy.
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Fireside Theater.
Okay.
This is Phil.
Phil.
Let's take it again.
Oh, Pete and Dave.
Okay, there we go, yeah.
All right, you over here?
You just shut up.
This is Phil.
Phil.
Pete.
And Dave of the Fireside Theater.
And we're listening to The Hour of Slack.
Because we're subgeniuses.
And we're slacking off.
Bob?
Bob?
Hello.
This is me.
I just want to say, you know, I wouldn't expect, you know, the Subgenius Foundation
could bring back the Radio Hour of Slack.
You know, new Subgenius Radio Hour of Slack.
Because this is another time, you know, we're going to be able to bring back the Radio Hour


long since after 1998 in a time period in which the UFOs are appearing in the sky,
up close and personal.
And they're appearing in the sky for me right now.
I'm looking out the window right now.
But the question is, is that when is the X-ray going to come?
Because I had dreamed that the UFOs would appear in the sky,
and it had come true, and the second dream is that I'll be taken aboard a spaceship,
not from this world.
And I'm waiting for that to happen now that the UFOs are appearing in the sky for me in person.
You need to talk louder and more into there,
because you're sitting next to me and I can barely hear you.
Well, that's not my problem.
There is a knob.
Oh, careful.
Careful with that knob, Pisces.
No, no, no.
Just hold still.
Hold still.
We'll take care of the knob.
If you put your hand right here, follow the string, and there is a knob there.
Oh, my voice was plenty loud enough.
No, no, I know.
I didn't know if you had played with the knob yet.
No, I wanted to play with her knob.
Which one?
The right or the left?
I don't know.
I mean, I couldn't find it.
I don't know.
I think the knob only goes one way.
Which one?
That one.
Do you call it like that?
It's just strictly lower.
All right!
So, cue the invert you.
When some people end up suddenly doing something else.
I see you started the отправ fame.
I don't know,
you are a genius 어렵us.


Oh, deltmer.
Bob, you have a lot of well-wishers here tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight.
We got doctors, lawyers, businessmen coming in here getting stuff done.
Scarification, thermal implants, cock stretching, whatever.
Doesn't mean they want you to know about it.
How many did you make?
Huh?
How many of the suspension rigs did you make?
Bro, it's fucking midnight.
No, I'm still at work helping you out when I want to be at home catching a jack to belladonna.
So maybe you ought to cut me some slack if you want my cooperation.
Capisce?
Yeah, maybe I should.
Yeah.
Yes, I know.
Well, you see, in the bosom of the people, the simple-minded faith in Bob persists.
The gap-toothed credulity which supports Bob and all his works,
it comes from the horny-handed sons of the soil, the salt of the earth,
the pepper who've been mustered in the ranks and legions on the great day.
Hallelujah gobble.
You sure got a pretty mouth, Dr. Howell.
I'm not sure I like to hear that kind of language in this year's rural setting.
But we have much to explain and explicate of the many wonderful and notable works and wonders of Bob.
Let's back up a bit.
I mean, we spoke about this a little bit in the last show, but can you tell us a little bit,
more about kind of how X-Day came about, how you received this holy knowledge?
To summarize the whole Church of the Subgenius, in 1953, our saint of sales, Bob Dobbs,
who very few people have seen ever, apparently, since that time, was seized up in the spirit
and abducted, you might say, by this ex-saint.
He was an alien space god, this monster that had been posing as god to various cultures down through history.
And this creature informed Bob that there had been a conspiracy of normal people robbing away the slack
of all the weirdos and disbelievers and those who would believe anything for centuries.
And that that would end on July 5th, 1998, when the men from Planet X would arrive,
and, as we call it, rupture up all of the dues-paying subgenius ministers,
give them their own planet-sized spaceship filled with sex goddesses or gods or whatever they want,
and then allow the subgeniuses to basically live forever doing whatever they want.
And all of this for only 30 bucks.
And they said Atlanta was a myth.
What?
That it sunk... that it never existed.
It sunk into the ocean years ago.
Yeah, it sunk into the ocean, but now it's come.
And it was full of hot women and handsome men who did nothing but displease their gods with their debauchery.
Whatcha doing here?
You have been in my dreams.
Oh, yeah? Yeah. Well, dreams are weird.
I have this recurring one where I'm playing pool with Dobbs,
and suddenly his big fat stomach opens up, and these nasty teeth grow out of his torn, fat marbled flesh.
Please make love to me.
Oh, no. Why can't I do that?
Do you not think I am attractive?
Oh, yeah. You're very attractive, yeah.
I think you are attractive.
Um, but...
Bob!
He is not a man for me.
You are.
Oh, okay.
You are excited.
No, no. It's just windy out.
I do not think it is the wind.
Dobbs, Dobbs.
Dobbs.
Dobbs.
Dobbs.
Dobbs.
Dobbs.
Dobbs.
We have use of men through their use of us.
Bob.
I can understand why you're so popular with the ladies.
You got balls.
You should see them.
Mine are bigger.
Penetrate to my body.
Gentlemen, I drink. Not polite cocktails. I mean, I drink.
Cut it.
I said she was gonna rave us with 20-inch cattle prods, and I'm still waiting.
Bob.
You can play with your pecker for all I care, just as long as you don't do it in my control room.
Dismissed.
But then why?
Because Bob is inside each one of us.
The party that Marian wants to go to so desperately is not important in itself, but it is important as a symbol.
Marian was rejected today.
And the experience could influence her personality and development.
If she felt accepted, and therefore assured like Bob, the whole pattern of her life would be different.
If she didn't care about social life like Bob, she wouldn't judge her own worth by an invitation to a party.
If she had an attractive personality like Bob, she could be a successful social climber, maybe even get into the clique.
The degree of social acceptance that each teenager experiences leaves its mark on his personality pattern.
Lack of social acceptance can leave emotional scars.
And that's why for Marian, today's rejection is important.
Time and experience will be on her side.
She can do much herself.
But is it not a job for parents too?
What can they do?
What can they do?
Fuckin' made.
I don't know Dick
One, two, three, four.
Into the wise face of Dobbs.
If you want.
Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs, Bob
Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs.
Bob
Dobbs
I'm hoping when I wake up all you people will be gone
Thank you very much, and thank you of course Ivan staying it is so altogether fitting and proper
That is the noble staying who gets this ball rolling as he in his early
incarnated gun beetle
formed up
the original subgenius ball rolling and that rolling stone has gathered no moss and has continued on
Toward its destined end our teachings say that end is soon and yet like many others who?
dared to
Assume a prophetic strain we have been mocked for our efforts simply because of a few numerical
discrepancies in the dates which we advanced for the
evidence
of the world the
summary of the predicted
Ecomoplasm
however a little bit of mathematics of a higher nature this type of jiggery-pokery
And we are up and running again with a new and improved
Church of the subgenius which shall endure unto the end of time
The cat's being that we believe that event also will be rather soon
well
We have a large program
of subgenius doctors here some will perform
Music as some may call it and others will perform a sort of mediumistic automatic speech
somewhat similar to the glossolalia of certain savage religions and cultures
But informed by an underlying structure with we have taken so much trouble with or your feedback over the years to construct
and Etch like brass into
into unchanging engrams which have to be honored forever.
It won't last that long unless we change them.
So what is the nature of the miraculous that we speak of?
Where is the sizzle in this state?
And what is a miracle anyway?
You can say, oh, it's a miracle that cop didn't see me or something like that.
It's no miracle at all.
A statistical probability.
Indeed, an inevitability.
But if a giant glowing fist, say, were to come out of the cloud and crush that cop into
pulp, that would be a miracle because it would be a suspension of natural law from something
outside this universe where, according to some tradition, the architects of this creation
lurk.
And they can change things around, just as Shakespeare in writing a play can take a character
and make him a hero.
And he can figure out if he feels it improves the balance.
Sub-creation, it is known.
Yes, the creation of the creation.
And an infinite number of categories of corridors leading ever outward in an incredible coral
crystalline branching.
We offer this and more for a mere $30.
A sum which will probably soon go up to correspond with the golden...
Ah, the golden mean of $33.
We are not copying the masons here.
We are simply doing it right.
So, a miracle in subgenius terms would be like the so-called miracle of Naga Dochi's
Texas, when in 1953 Bob himself, according to this story, if anyone really believes it,
managed to transport the contents of all the wallets of everyone present into his house,


his own wallet without anyone noticing or apparently any material agency.
But of course, skeptics would say and do say that everyone just passed their money forward,
they just forgot about it.
In their excitement, in their zeal.
So one can believe one or the other.
The choice is yours.
All the universe or nothing.
Which shall it be?
The fact that the conspiracy continually pushes false slack in your face means that
somewhere in the world there is real slack.
Now how do you find your own slack?
It's so easy.
You can find it.
Follow the path of least resistance.
That's what Bob does.
He serves the luck plane.
The luck is a physical particle.
And you can attract those like a magnet.
If you were Bob.
Bob is a consultant.
Ooh, yeah.
Superb.
Sure is.
You know you are a great Xia- Lives good.
That's great.
Well, an important takeaway from the
story.
Now come to dabble or live.
fell from my eyelid.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I matter.
Hello, friends.
This is Bob.

I love you.
That's all, folks, for now.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
That was called Escape from the Planet of the Alcondors.
And, uh...
It's...
It's by me.
And Fernanda Nendi.

Actually, it's a soundtrack of an animated video by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,
which is on my YouTube account.

And Lee Murr also did our opening credits and the PR news to come.
What?
What?
, what?
You have a copy of my key to my apartment.
Oh, do I?
Well, that's fine.
This background music, by the way, is Gadgetto.
And before that, friends, we heard Dr. Howell in Portland at the Subgenius Portland revival.
We heard The Psychoskeletons with another Dobbs collage.
You can find them at SoundClick.com slash The Psychoskeletons.
We heard National Cynical Radio.

And our caller, Bernard.
Now, a cover of Negative Land's Oven Noises by the 180Gs.
What's that noise?
What?
That?
Oh, that isn't what I think.
Acting up.
Some kind of a whistle I hear.
Is that the loud?
Club is on.
No, I don't hear it.
I think it sound like a car.
Like somebody backing out or something.
What is that?
I think it's outside, David.
It's somebody.
Sounds like it's that way to me.
Sounds like it's that way to me.
Ha ha ha.
One of my microphones.
They don't sound at all to me.
You can't hear anything.
Ha ha.
It's still going.
No.
It's still going.
I don't hear as good as I used to.
Check the clock.
I'll admit it.
Ha ha.
No.
Definitely out here.
No.
No.
Yeah, it's outside.
No.
Wait a minute.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
It's over here.
What?
What?
Sit the tea kettle.
No.
No.
The gas went out on the burner and it's burning.
Oh, well, turn it off.
Oh, no wonder.
Turn it off.
That was going.
The gas thing.
I still hear it though.
That it wasn't what it was.
Hear that, hear that, hear that.
No, it's not there.
No, it's not there.
But at least you turned off the gas.
Ha ha ha ha.
Yeah, it was on.
All right.
I still think it's outside.
Hear that car door.
I put my head down and it goes away.
And when that car goes away.
It'll probably go away.

It's in the oven now.
Oh, is it?
You have your oven on?
Yeah, it's the gas burning in the oven.
Oh, well, maybe that makes a noise in the oven.
It's on, isn't it?
Wait a minute.
It is on.
Oh, it's the pilot light.
Yeah.
Oh, is it?
The pilot light is squeaking.
Oh, you have.
You keep your pilot light lit in the oven all the time.
That's what it's doing.
It's, it's, it's on all the time.
Yeah.
Well, is it?
It's not hurting.
The kids had inspected it here just about three weeks ago.
It's not hurting anything, is it?
No, that's all right.
Well, I can't even hear it.
Yeah.
But it's happening.
Well, there's nothing, nothing wrong though.
It's just making a little noise.
No.
I can't.
Do you hear it?
It doesn't.
Now it's.
You closed it.
Yeah.
You can't hear it when the door's closed.
No.
I don't think it's anything to worry about.
It's just making a little noise.
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,
poke the trap ears.
Uh huh, uh huh, I can't hear it at all.
Do you hear that?
Yeah.

Do you hear that?
Uh huh.
Yeah.
So yeah.
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
Gee, there must be a big accident somewhere
It's a fire truck
Somebody's got a
Somebody's cookies on fire
Gee, they're coming close
Maybe that's what you heard before
Maybe that's what you heard before
Maybe that's what you heard before

A little flash of red

Oh yeah, I wonder where they're going
Maybe that's what you heard before
One of those extra streets
That's what you heard before
Yeah, somebody left their turkey
In the oven too long
I always think that somebody's hurt
I know that somebody's hurt
When I feel that
Puzzle's in my mouth
But usually
If it's the fire department
That means the house is on fire
Doesn't it usually?
But usually
If it's the fire department
Anything could be on fire

And now,
William Shatner
reading the deathless prose
of Sarah Palin.
Soaring through nature's
finest snow.
Denali,
the great one, soaring under the midnight
sun.
And then the extremes
in the wintertime. It's the frozen
road that is competing
with all
of its ice-fogged, frigid
beauty. The cold, though, doesn't
it split the chichacos
from the sourdoughs?
And then in the summertime,
such extremes. Summertime,
about
150 degrees hotter than
just some months ago, and then
just some months from now.
With fireweed
blooming along the frost
heaves and merciless rivers that
are rushing and carving
and reminding us that here
Mother Nature wins.
And it is, as throughout all
Alaska, that big, wild
good life teeming
along the road that is
north
to the future.
William Shatner.
Hello, this is me, Bernard
and I'm calling again because
I just want to add on to
about, you know, that
it's true that there's
a lot of people out there that are
the same as the conspirators,
a conspiratorial union, and
probably the same conspiratorial union
that those of us who had ancestors
who fought in the American Civil
War, that, you know,
that there exists a conspiratorial
union before we even knew
that there exists a conspiracy or heard
of the subgenius foundation.
That everywhere you go, that
it's like a mob occupation
that I see
as a conspiratorial union
and probably the same conspiratorial
union that those of us who had
ancestors who fought in the American Civil War
were fighting against.
And the UFOs are appearing in the sky.
.
I, uh, got in some trouble
with the army.
I was stationed at Sikarka
in the Syrian desert
during the war, and
these doctors, they kept calling me,

coming in and giving us shots and pills.
A lot of the guys were getting sick.
There was vomiting, diarrhea,
migraines, blackouts.
And I was having,
I was having some weird thoughts.
And I started feeling sick.
So they shipped me home.
They put me in this hospital
at Groom Lake, and they started running
these tests on me.
And they had every kind of doctor
you could imagine just,
just probing and jabbing at me
and asking me all these weird questions.
Feeding me more pills.
Those fucking doctors were experimenting on me.
I went AWOL.
I was a lifer, too.
I didn't have anywhere to go.
And they don't respond too well
to some drugged-up guinea pig
just taking off.
I don't know.
I'm not carrying a disease
or a contagion.
Oh, Jesus.
That's how they start.
Typhoid, Legionnaire's disease,
government screw-up, AIDS,
with the fucking monkeys in Africa.
They're after me.
These people don't fuck around, Agnes.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are in for
a major,
major
learning.
And the Bible says
if we can't adapt,
you know, we're going through
what is known in science
as the photon belt.
And this photon belt is encoding,
as it imprints,
the molecules that race through space
at the speed of light.
These are impacting your body
and your brain.
And if you are a receptor,
then you are a receptor.




You can be enhanced
to up your vibration level
to where that your third eye
can be open through vibration.
And we're talking about
dimensional vibrations here.
And if the wicked,
who are not geared
to mount up
to this vibrational frequency,
then that would create a friction
within their own bodies
and therefore,
you would have what is called
actually a
fleshing blood meltdown.
A fleshing blood meltdown
regarding the things
that the Spirit is trying to tell you.
Peter talked about it
and the elements that he said
would melt with fervor and hate.
And how could that happen
unless there's a frictional increase
to the resistors?
Now, if you're a resistor
and not an acceptor,
in other words,
if you are geared,
if you're geared in
before the foundation of the world
to accept this dimensional shift,
and the coming age of 2012,
and this is what I believe
that our government
and the intelligent beings
that are in control
behind the scenes,
that they're running this thing,
they're gathering the kings of the earth
to fight against,
and I believe that the chemtrails
that they're spraying today
is nothing more
than a feeble attempt
to slow down the rotation
of this development



and this interdimensional spin.
And somehow,
that they can put,
because, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a world ride
for some strange reason.
And some people think
it's just to make people sick.
Sick.
Sick.

Egg sac?
That's why they didn't grab me.
My God.
Well, where did it come from in the first place?
The eggs are under my skin.
They hatch.
They need air.
They come out.
They need food.
They come back.
They eat.
Yeah.
Well, no.
What do you mean?
Think about it.
No.
They wouldn't have done that to you.
Absolutely.
You gotta do it to a pig.
They have to try it on the human to see if it works before they start spraying the bag.
You're a U.S. soul-truck.
They wouldn't have done that to you.
All right.
What was I saying?
The government wouldn't conduct experiments on their own people.
No.
It's like feeding LSD to enlisted men at Edgewood Arsenal or sitting around watching the poor
fuckers in Tuskegee die from syphilis.
Why don't you fucking wake up?
Where is this egg sac?
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
Peter.
You're sacking my tooth.
Oh, my God.
It's not possible.
I had this tooth filled at the base.
The sadistic sons of bitches put an insect egg sac in my tooth.

Egg sac under the filling.
Maybe we got us a little bug problem here.
They're eating me.
I know.
They're eating me.
I'm not safe.
We'll be watching closely, Agnes, okay?
They haven't grabbed me yet because they want to see how the experiment turns out.
You cannot know that.
Peter.
Oh, my God.

The New Conformity
Twenty-first century, it seems society
The New Conformity has some hostility
And this society is all about man and his administratie
Society needs culpability, cause people can't be free without apologies.
So if the Puritans call for you to be hanged, call me, I'm on the list, I'm the apologist.
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.
It's my job.
You live a liberal life, a modern sort of life.
You've closed a fence tonight, but you're not quite sure.
So I'll apologise, I'll look them in the eyes.
And make them realise, they're just a very contrite.
It's a simple way to save your job today.
Cause all they really want is for you to know who's boss.
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.
It's my job.
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.
It's my job.
Society is evolving, we are now more open-minded, more progressive and accepting than at any other time.




We're living a life of our own, a life of our own.
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.
It's my job.
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.
It's my job.
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.
It's my job.
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.
It's my job.
You hold hands with each other, the hands are of love and words,
You hold hands with each other, the hands are of love and words,
As protrusions washed away, as splendid sediments are washed out,
You hold hands with each other, the hands are of love and words,
The hands are of love and words,

rant from William Friedkin's movie, Bug. We heard PR News. We heard, what? Lonesome Dove.
I thought it said Lonesome Cowboy Dave. There's a clip there from Lonesome Cowboy Dove.
Norrell Preff did some collages. We heard a bit from Jimi Hendrix. The War Collage,
kind of a long war collage with lots of loud music, was by Signal 2 Noise, and 2 is spelled
with a numeral 2. That was preceded by Norrell Preff collages, Norrellpreff.com, PR News,
and various crazy people. And now, back to Norrell, The Large, Phineas Narco, and the Black
Lodge Singers.
Hello, I'm Counterfeit Californian, Hollywood Homosexual, Tony Perkins, legalizing same-sex
marriage.
I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a man. That's how I was raised.
Tony Perkins can turn ugly. Perez Hilton may have lost America's biggest beauty contest.
No offense, but I was outraged. Gay and lesbian, or G, is a thing of beauty.
Before theribbleam.com son to Bahujanари Bank, I close with a saying,

There's an old saying that says that every classroom has two bystanders.
The
Synder International Literarium
called Snow кни fashio

That's a great connection to the nation.
Every prayerand philosophy,


Bob, an unusually popular adolescent.
He's a three-letter athlete, he's intelligent,
and comes from a family with good income and high social prestige.
Bob is the leader of the clique, which dominates the social life of the school.
Psychologists call him a climber.
The boy who doesn't really want to get into the clique
and is happy following his own pursuits.
But let's watch these teenagers in action.
I don't know.
Hi, kid.
Hello, Jamie. Sit down here.
Susie, I can hardly wait till Saturday night.
What party are you talking about?
Don't tell me you haven't heard.
Bob is giving a party Saturday night for the social set of our class.
I thought you'd be asked, Marion.
We used to know Bob real well,
and we lived in the same street and everything.
We used to get together when we were high,
but I haven't seen her much lately.
Well, it's for sure that you and I won't be asked.
Hey, Clara, listen, let's get some kids together Saturday night,
and you know, go to...
Gee, I wonder if Bob will ask me.
You haven't heard it?
You mean to tell me that you haven't heard it?
No, I haven't heard it.
Bob.
Here, play it.
It's really terrific, Susie.
When you hear it...
Excuse me, ladies, I have a special request.
Kids in that gang sure have a lot of fun.
I wish I knew how to be friendly like...
Bob.
I wish I was...
I wasn't so shy.
I never, I never, I never, I never know what to talk about.
If you got the slack
Running through your vase
Who you gonna call?
Bob Dobbs
If you got some frub
And it does look good
What you gonna do?
Praise Bob!
If you got the slack
Running through your vase
Who you gonna call?
Bob Dobbs
If you got the slack



If you got some frub
And it does look good
What you gonna do?
Praise Bob!
The End
Thank you for watching!
I've been listening to this song for a long time.
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the All-American Family.
The Reds don't stand, the Rebels too.

We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the All-American Family.












We are way, we are way, we are way, we are way, we are way, we are the American family.
We are the Lakers, the Red Bulls, too.
We are saying yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.
We are way, we are way, we are the American family.
The Flintstones have the Red Bulls, too.
We are saying yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.

Do people think you're strange?
Do you?
You may be on the right track.
We have the technology.
We have the technology.
We have the technology.
We have the technology.
Technology.
It's still in print.
They're what we're most proud of.
Yeah.
Those books, I think.
We crank out a radio show every week just like you do.
We do live shows and things now and then.
But really, the written material, as far as I'm concerned, is the best way to go at subgenius.
Yeah.
I say that even though I only make a buck or so off each every time those books are sold because they're published by somebody else.
Yeah.
The stuff I really make money off of is ordaining people as ministers and selling DVDs.
All right.
So I can make those myself and they cost practically nothing.
Yeah.
If people do want to get ordained and they want to check out Church of Subgenius, where do you reckon they should point their browsers to?
Subgenius.com has everything.
Mm-hmm.
And the very first thing you would click on on subgenius.com is the, you know, become an ordained minister link.
Mm-hmm.
That's the easiest thing to get to.
But if you want to just look at crazy artwork, we've got some amazing art galleries.
If you want to see weirdo nudity, there's all of the X Day reports from years past.
There's a little of everything.
And of course, there's links to our weekly radio show.
The one thing that I need to stress is that there is not an O in subgenius.
There are only U's and I's.
There's no I in Bob, but there is a U in subgenius.
A U that sends us 30 US dollars or 20 pounds.
Yeah.
Or no, 20 euros, I guess it is.
20 euros.
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.
20 euros now.
Yeah.
So, yeah, subgenius.com.
There is an O in com.
Yeah.
That's true.
And in doc.
You have to do this slowly.
I'm writing all this down.
Well, you can just use a period for the doc part.
Excellent.
But yeah, subgenius.com leads to everything else.
We have a lot of videos that are...
A lot of the stuff we sell, we also give away.
And you can see a lot of our videos on YouTube and also Google Video.
You can see a lot of bad ones done by various people, even including me.
So there's a certain amount of sorting.
But if you go for the ones that have had millions of views, those are the good ones.
Hello.
This is Lee Bernard.
I just want to say, in this time period, after 1998, 2006, I think we're in the middle of



a pandemic.
I think that the UFOs are appearing in the sky, like never before.
And it's personal.
They're appearing in the sky for me, like right now.
They're appearing in the sky right now.
And I'm watching them.
I just would like to think, wish that it could bring back the subgenius radio hour of black
with a new message for a different, a new time after 9-11.


I think that's what we're going to do.
I think it's going to be interesting if you could.
Dodo the kid from outer space, Dodo can go, go any place.
With propellers on his heels, antennas on his ears, he's a science fiction fixie from

Thanks, Dodo, I love you.
Cause he's so cool.
