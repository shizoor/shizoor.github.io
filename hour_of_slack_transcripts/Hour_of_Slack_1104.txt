Yes, there are many good things here for your pleasure. Enjoy them!
And he said, uh, it's healthy for them.
And he said, it's a wonderful thing if they continue to all through their lives to get that enthusiastic about anything.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
The Self-Genius Power of Satan!
Bob!
What I want to tell them is how much we've enjoyed having them going to be on our show once again.
Bob!
One dollar for salvation! One dollar!
Bob is...
Salesman.
Yeah, Bob is a salesman. He's everything and he's nothing.
He is a man. Bob is a man.
And he is the saint of sales.
Right. He was gifted with mystic sales ability when he was visited by Jehovah One or Wotan.
The, um, uh...
Wotan the Magnificent, Doug?
The evil and or good space god from some corporate sin galaxy.
That's right.
Or so he tells us.
And I quote,
We'll all be eating roach crap by the turn of the century.
We've never actually, uh, talked to him ourselves.
Yeah, I, I'd have to admit that I have never met the fabled J.R. Bob Dobbs, but I have, shall we say, been touched by Bob.
Yes. Don't just eat a hamburger, eat the hell out of it.
Bob!
But let's leave things of this world to the future.
Leave behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.
Oh, yes, praise Bob, friend.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.
Come to tell you the truth.
The truth about the path to slack.
Through hyperventilation.
Yes, my friend.
You can get high from hyperventilation.
And it's legal.
And it's an exercise we're preaching.
And if you can learn to talk like me and talk this way all the time,
then everybody you meet will be your friend.
And you will get so high, you will get so high, you will meet Bob.
You will not be able to stop seeing Bob.
Because you will have so much slack in your brain, there won't be any more room for thought.
And when your mind is free of, free of thought, then you will have the slack, the slack you need in your life.
Praise Bob.
Help me, somebody.
Do I hear a praise Bob?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let there be slack.
See www.subgenius.com
That moment has now arrived.
Once each night, during the cycle of the full moon, you will dissolve three Tana leaves and give the liquid to Karras.
Three leaves will keep him alive.
Nine leaves will give him motivation.
Now swear by the sacred gods of Egypt that you will never rest until the last remaining member of the Banning family is destroyed.
Until they all have suffered the fate of those who dare to defile the tomb of our royal dead.
Swear that you will never betray your trust.
I swear by the mighty power of Amun-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world.
And by the dread horror of Set, I shall never forsake my trust as a high priest of Karnak.
And where are those doughnuts today?
Yeah, now that's a really good question.
Remember, spud nuts?
Spud right here.
What happened to spud nuts?
I'd rather not say it, but...
No, they were made from taters, you know.
In the Midwest, by...
Oh, oh, alright.
By crafty cooks in gleaming chromium kitchens.
These cargo are morgue shipments from Aspen.
They were shipped from Aspen?
Yeah.
That's very odd, I wouldn't have thought that.
Let's get out of here.
Okay, let's split. Let's blow this popsicle split up.
Oh, there we go.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.







Mr. Dobbs, can David beep in my beep today?
Sure, just make sure he doesn't have any beep on his beep.
Yeah, the show's kind of dense tonight, have you noticed that?
Oh yeah.
It's like fog set in or something.
Ah, we're creeping along.
I don't know.
I'm just trying to show subscape.
And that aroma, like freshly baking loaves.
Yeah, it's like the workers left, all the bread was still in the oven, the cigarettes
were still in the ashtrays, it was just like they were here a minute ago and then all the
people are gone.
Like the Marie Celeste.
Gross show.
What happened?
What happened to them?
Where could they have gone?
Why is the bacon still frying?
Yeah, the bacon was still frying.
The refrigerator door was still halfway open.
Oh, I did that.
The car was still open.








The carton of milk was just leaking out onto the floor.
Oops.
I don't understand what happened.
Well, there's some things beyond people to understand.
You know, we were here one minute and then the next minute we were gone.
I'd like you to recall the events on the day in question.
A black hole, an abyss, a chasm.
When did you first notice that something was well out of your head?
Missing?
Missing?
Well, you see, if you look at chart one.
There's an orbital flight path that the trajectory of which is impossible to obtain by the
horsepower of the engines that were on the vehicle.
How could this happen?
What about the potentiality of a geosynchronous...
We populate this abyss with any other presentation material that you might find totally dogmatic
as well as thematic templates which can be used.

Over and over again.
The initial investment can be realized as well as the return on investment completely
obliterates any need for further discussion.
I agree.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
That was Philo, Hal and Doug on puzzling evidence of KPFA Berkeley.
As they said.
Everyone is gone.
Everyone's gone because they've been ruptured.
Yes.
X Day happened and that's why I had to prepare this show number 1104 before X Day.
And by the time you hear this, if you're not ordained and bobbed, it'll probably be too
late.
We're already on the saucers and you're not.
Tough luck.
Shouldn't have put it off.
Not much to do now, I guess, but get blind inebriated on whatever horrible drug you use
to hide from reality.
Might be booze, might be bugs, might be the boob tube.
And that's what this episode of Hour of Slack is about, friends.
Your disgusting drug habits.
And if you're not on drugs by the time you finish listening to this show, you'll feel
like you are.
Uh, yes, we've heard the Leimerd and we'll now redress the pref because we like to be
near naughty experiences.
I'm Melvin.
You know, when I first started interviewing people, I interviewed a woman and she explained
in detail what the near naughty experience was.
And she said, you know, there may be some consciousness after all.
Well, a week after she told us she would just go home and die, we went to visit her and

see if she maybe got another dose of that brain eff我不 úm
We went to see her and she took the baby to a doctor.
We've been having theseOOOO getting you fighter behaviors andیا

introduce Bob. Now that I think about it, finally we've got this thing off. I thought it would never
get off, friends, but now that it is, let's let Philo and Dr. Howell answer a caller's question
about Bob and the famous artist Andy Warhol and their relationship at the factory in New York.
It's as if it was on its own platform, praising itself forever.
And it might have been that they objected to the fact he was anatomically corrected.
Not only anatomically corrected, but massively endowed.
That's what they say. Did Bob ever meet Andy Warhol at the factory in New York City?
Yeah.
Bob.
Yeah.
At the Dobbs factory?
What happened at the Dobbs factory in New York City at that time?
What happened?
Yeah, let's fill that in.
What happened at that time? Well, maybe I should mention that they were both into playing
anti-music back then. For two reasons primarily. One, because it's the best kind of music there is,
first of all. And they were, too, they were both slightly ahead of their time.
Mostly ahead of their time.
Back then.
You know, Bob had a lot of hair in his ears. This was the only way he could get...
Did they enjoy a parasitical relationship or a dialectical relationship with one another?
I'll pass that question to Dr. Howe.
Or a dialectical relationship with one another?
Their relationship is shrouded in the mists of mystery.
But one thing I...
Is it true that Bob Dobbs slept with Miko?
Yeah.
It was in 19, what, like 57?
56. When Dobbs was famous that year for bringing this famous quote,
I came not to bring peace, but instead, just this obnoxious radio show.
And he was right, by God.
Self-indulgent, less than an hour, more than a show.
And delay.
Total improv horror still going strong after 30 years.
With puzzling evidence...
Dr. Howe.
Everything gets so distorted in time.
As well as your new, most favorite, special, permanent guest star.
Dr. Philodromo.
No longer will you hear Michael Pepe on the show, though.
He's too sleepy now.
No more.
No more.
No more.
No more.
No more.
He's too sleepy now.
What?
No more little Michael Pepe ever?
Because he's too sleepy now?
That Bob was sleeping with the...

He was beaten up by the Grateful Dead.
Well, yes, he was.
That was the unknown story of...
Yeah, he beat the crap out of him.
But he's a real resilient guru.
He springs back from the most heinous crimes.
I think, ultimately, he sued the Grateful Dead
and was able to put them into financial misfortune in their old age
so that most of them are having...
I think, ultimately, he sued the Grateful Dead and was able to put them into financial misfortune in their old age

to go back on the road now
to get some money
just to be able to pay their lawyers.
Because Bob just wrecked them so bad.
He gets it.
You know, he gets back.
He may not win the first round,
but he always wins round two.
Bob was the one that coined that bumper sticker.
You know, I don't...
I don't...
What was the one?
I don't...
Something about what he doesn't do.
I don't...
I don't...








He doesn't practice what he preaches.
You know, he doesn't get mad.
He gets even.
He doesn't do late-night radio shows like this.
I guess I just have one last question.
Yes?
Is it true that Bob Dobbs is in every labor mural in San Francisco, around the city?
If you look carefully, you can find his face?
I don't know.
Is that...
Have you looked?
Well, I've heard this.
Hmm.
Interesting.
Good night, gentlemen.
Good night.
Good night.
How can you be listening to us now?
Good night.
Oh, I'm not.
Oh, I'm still...
Okay.
Get more out of life.
Come often.
Get more out of life.
Come often.
Please.
Please replace the speaker on its rack when you're ready to leave.
Failure to do so will damage both the speaker and your car.
We'll be grateful.
And so will the patrons who follow you.
Follow you.
Follow you.
Get more out of life.
Come often.
Great.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

And.
Ah.

Follow you.

Where's his DG equipment?
He's just standing there with a conductor's baton.
Did anyone else hear that?
I think it's back masking.
I don't think that growth is supposed to hum like that.
Is that a gun?

It's a gun.
Someone just stabbed me with a needle and now I feel kind of funny.
Shit.
This happened at Woodstock too.
Hello.
Just sort of shot right out of my throat.
Started rolling around on the kitchen floor.
A wiggling and a squiggling around.
Became a three-legged transsexual dog.
Started growling low and lonely.
Been louder and louder until the little yellow was howling.
That's better than them big water bugs we got out there in Arizona.
Found out through the sink of a nightingale in the sky.
Sure glided.
That's a good.
Come home all wood just a little bit.




We're right up through the drooling.
Where did we go?
About all the hobbling drooling.
Well, I always have to say.
Over the last few weeks of no show.
Glad you came back.
Yeah, we hit.
I'm glad we came back too because for a while there we were gone.
Well, I missed you.
Oh, nothing about my dreams.
Oh, that's the most.
Yeah, we missed you too.
We're talking about dreams tonight on the show.
Eight, four, eight, we'll get back to five minutes ago.
Now we're a whole happy family again.
Yeah.
The hap-hap-happiest family.
Me and you and.
You and Toddling.
And all of Northern Central California.
Punchling and.


And Hal and Tracy Lord.
And the whole world on the internet dot com.
I know you have to take time off occasionally.
What?
To practice the slack by what you preach.
Slack practice.
You probably went through that.
Yeah, we had to take off to do, you know, we had to do maintenance on the truck.
Maintenance.
Back the truck out.
The truck was getting pretty, pretty rag-tagged there.
Lots of parts were.
Hanging off.
A lot of them were even missing.
But we had the freedom it takes being on vacation to take the bottom of the truck off and put
it where the top used to be.
We took the side of the truck off and put it in the front.
We have the front and the back now and the other sides on the bottom.
Oh, the front.
Wow.
In the bottom of the side.
But it's okay.
It looks better than it used to look.
It's stupider than it was.
You can go back and forth.




You can do a lot of things.
And we started making tapes again.
We found a box of old tape decks.
A big box of tape decks that we didn't know we still had that we'd be importing thinking
one day they'll be worth a lot of money.
And I just stood on the back porch and I said, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, and a giant
chap fell from the sky for $47.37.
My name is Bob the cab driver.
Bob.
You're Bob the cab driver?
Bob.
That's right.
I have a lot of no-shows, too.
Yeah, that's true.
Don't you hate those?
When they call you and then they don't arrive.
Did you remember that one time when you showed up and that guy was supposed to be there but
he was hiding behind the bush like you weren't going to see him?
Was that the son or the father of the bush?
Can you believe that?
Next time, I think you should take somebody with you so that they can see you.

So that when somebody does that, you can send the other guy out there to grab him, just
throttle him.
And then you can measure which strategy works best.
I have thoughts like that, but I try to control them.
Okay, that's good to control that because that doesn't sound like a good idea, does
it?
Not the best one I've heard.
No.
And you're used to turning on this radio station to find good ideas.
I understand that.
Particularly this show.
Well, I'm just so glad you're back.
Somebody feed the baby.
Things are back to normal.
Yeah, they're definitely back to normal now that...
Now I have a bottle.
Now I have a firm connection.
I don't know.
In the refrigerator.
That's it.
Wait a second, baby.
Goodbye and stay listening to the show.
Yeah, okay.
And remember...
Guys, we're doing the show.
Look at him drink.
I will.
It's true.
What is it?
Amazing.
It's the show.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.





I know.
And among other things, Bog, I'm doing pretty well with those pills you sent.
Pretty well, but I can always use more and it's because of Ohio and red trucks and they're
all gone, Bog.
I know.
I know.
Ok.
But that's okay.
I don't believe it at all, anymore.
There's just nothing you can do now.
You know how it is.
You said these débutants are eating.

Ah, I understand.

Now I've met your mother, yours good mother.

Ah, dear herm� is okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A Bad Bananas by Kevin Meredith, friends.
And before that,
Reverend David Boone as Roberto de la Rosa talking about the pills.
And after this, this.
Truth is fiction.
This is Be Orbit, Be Not.
Some of the world's greatest marksmen live in Hungary.
Be Orbit, Be Not.
In a moment, I'll tell you about a small fish.
A fish less than a foot long.
Be Orbit, Be Not.
How long would it take you to make change for five dollars?
It would take you 147 years.
Be Orbit, Be Not.
In a moment, I'll tell you about some clams.
Sarah had eaten clams for a long time.
But did you know that these huge Malaysian clams weigh nearly five pounds?
Be Orbit, Be Not.
Nero did not live underwater.
Be Orbit, Be Not.
In a moment, I'll tell you just how long true love can go on.
103 years.

Each individual universe is comprised of the potential for a limitless quantity of sub-universes.
Each fully co-existent with all others.
And you are not in this world to live up to my expectations.
And if we get...
together, baby, it's beautiful.
I am here to do my thing.
And you are here to do your thing.
I am in this world to give up your expectations.
Yeah, that's what's easy for you to say.
Hello?
You're not actually having to stuff your intestines back into your ripped open...
abdomen.
Well, you have to stuff them back.
I mean, that's where they go, back into your abdomen.
You just try not to get too many leaves and pieces of bark and bugs and things in there with them.
I heard a terrible conspiracy that the Republicans made hippies take drugs back in the 60s.
Oh, yeah.
Just so they would be thinking dumber now.
What?
So they couldn't make...
Well, uh...
So they could be more easily duped by the Republicans.


It's the Republicans that we fear.
We know the Democrats are gonna help us.
The Republicans we fear.
The Democrats have forgotten how.
Forgotten how to do anything.
But they care. That's the important thing.
Even if they have forgotten how, we know they care.
And the caring is the important thing.
The knowing how is less important than the caring.
Stephen King's The Knowing.
If you had just put...
A UFO in the back of their car...
They would know now, and they would care too.
And it wouldn't be like they forgot how, what they were supposed to know.
Stephen King's The Caring.
And after his death...
No, not his death.
What?
No, not his death.
No, which guy?
Oh, Bob. Yeah, after Bob's death.
You'll have to put them back up in line.
They all look alike to me now.
America's best-selling author, Stephen King, brings new fear and horror to the suspense...
What? Now they're doing Stephen King on the show?
...in The Caring.
Stephen King's latest 6,000-page novel, a New York Times bestseller for several months, is about a small Kansas farm girl, Mindy Diddleton of Dubsville, Kansas.
And she becomes the vessel of a malignant and ancient evil.
Bob?
Bob.
Bob, as she calls him, orders her to commit a Columbine-style massacre.
Kill.
Kill.
Poor Bob.
As trenchant as today's headlines, The Caring is Stephen King's greatest novel.
Hey, did you hear you could pay money to be...
...soon to be a major motion picture featuring...
...to get inside the confession booth and hear people tell their stories?
...their sins now? The Catholic Church will let you do that?
I thought that was you guys.
To actually pay money to sit in the confession booth and hear kids say things like,
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
How many times, my son?
...said the good-looking, nubile teenager in the confession booth.
Yes, daughter, you may...
Tell me about it, said Father Damien Morbidius, the secret Jesuit, idly fiddling with his ornate signet ring.
I've been having evil, incarnal thoughts about Jesus, said the girl.
His graven image upon the cross, bleeding and suffering.
It's so sexy.
I just wanted to have sex with the bleeding, tormented Jesus.
Is there more, said Father Morbidius, in unctuous, papist tones?
Why, I oughta...
And that's where it stops.
That's a unctuous tone.
I mean, it's just getting good.
Yeah.
Of the papists.
Just unburden yourself, my child.
Oh yeah, that was pretty good there.
That was pretty good.
Springtime for Hitler.
Hi, hello?
I've...
Hm.
I've...

Yeah.
But smoking was so sexy.
Two cigarettes smoking one another.
Two beautiful cigarettes are sexy.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, well, there must be a staff member with the guest at all times, because of the security problems that we have here at the, insert your name here, headquarters.
At first, Connie relaxed.
Oh, she's usually relaxed.
But then she, uh, let it go.
Too late.
Man, why did you show me that?
Uh, you get used to it.
What happens, what I'm referring to, folks, is two little collars just appeared.
They did.
Uh, that was a little two-stone order.
They were blasted by the...
Bipolar disorder.
Oh, sorry.
Divine radiation.
Oh, now he's reading the things that are wrong with us.
You know, that's one thing about this church, is we don't like doing anything like the other
churches do, so we call it tripolar disorder here.
That's right.











It's a very obsessive panic...
It feels like this.
...like the Trinity in reverse.
Right.
Tri-polar.
Especially when you say...
There's three poles on our planet.
The state of the Father...
The North Pole, the South Pole, and the Mid Pole.
...the government will let, uh, somatoform and eating disorders that haven't happened yet.
Well...
Well, they will, though.
You know that for sure.

Can you tell me what your...

...the state of the direction...
It's always difficult to peg anything in time.
I'm sorry, suicide man.

I was hoping you could help.
...watching YouTube.
I must admit, I'm all at sea in these...
Uh, what...
No, I'm sorry.
Watching YouTube.
...if I don't have the strict recording of the chronometric reading.
Ah, look at that bulb.
Ah, yeah.
Time control must be a constant process.
Tell me what you think I should think.
I mean, do.
Lighten up, guys.
Come on.
King's just immortal.
He's...
It doesn't...
It doesn't...
It comes out again.
Hey, wait.
Wait.
Well, wake up.
We're driving.
No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Geez.
Wow.
This is great.
This is like being in a...
...Felina show.
...all in veering all over the road.
No!
What are you doing?
Just keep it steady.
Let go.
Let go of the wheel.
Follow the...
Jeez.
What's going on?
Hey, uh, now, a minute ago, if I heard correctly, you guys were talking, uh, about the cosmic
continuation of the soul and so forth, and then trying not to.
Well, I was talking more about...
We always try to have it both ways here on Synesthesia.
We always try to have it both ways.
When I was...
...going to evolve into ectomorphic creatures who do not die but just kind of, like, slow
down a real lot.
Well, I had a, um, a vision when I was a teenager on drugs.
You were never a teenager on drugs?
Well, must I be a teenager on drugs?
You remember that song, too?
Me too.
Yeah.
Anyway, uh, I...
I was, uh...
I came up with this notion that, uh, that we all really had a fishbowl for a head...
Okay, so far...
...that had an opening at the back end of it that kind of joined up with all the other
fishbowl heads of every other thinking entity.
And even things that we don't normally think of as entities.
I figured the animals and plants all had their own type of fishbowl head that opened up in
to this other, uh, reality where all the fishbowl contents were conjoined.
It's the kind of thing that you come up with when you're a 16-year-old on drugs.
It certainly is.
Um...
I think...
I think you were reading Carlos Castaneda and, uh, Wilhelm Reich at the same time.
No, I had merely been looking at...
At that age, all I'd done really is look at a few album covers.
But that's all it took.
You know, there was some pretty good artwork in the...
in the...
back in them days.
This is Dr. Manhood.
Bewildered and confused.
Be bewildered and confused.
It is essential that sex be satisfied.
Not easy.
Sex is perfectly normal.
Use fear and punishment to stop it.
In this matter of sex or your son, sex is a dirty thing.
Bad, impure, or dirty.
Use fables, vagueness, or untruth.
This wonderful thing called sex.
Penis, vagina, and so forth.
Do not hesitate to use pet names, or vulgar names, or names that are not true.






Use names that are vague, inaccurate, or meaningless.
The church, the doctor, or the nurse, or meaningless.
Erection.
Follow this natural impulse.
This is all quite normal.
Sex is perfectly normal.
Use fear and punishment to discourage it.
It is recommended that you show him a sanitary napkin, wet dreams, or the nurse.
Again, research has shown that this is not good psychologically.
Talk about venereal disease, unwed mothers, birth control, or abortion.
Make references or comparisons to the same.
The sex life of animals.
This is very good.
Your warm love tool.
Animal sex again.
Just act normally.
Good.
Everything's going fine.
Excellent.
We're recording.
We're recording.
A-okay.
But have you ever considered tire safety?
Yes.
I think about it a lot every time I get in the car.
Actually, doctor, I didn't mean you.
I know you did.
You always rotate your tire.













You rotate your tires and participate in proper inflation techniques.
But I thought maybe the collar was not hip to tire rotation.
Why?
You can improve your fuel economy by up to 25% by simply keeping your tires properly
inflated.
So don't be fuel-ish.
Time to re-tire.
A lot of people don't know that.
And that's why we think it's important to get that message out.
And that's why we're here.




It may...
A public service from KPFA and the sub-genius radio ministry.
It could be heard by the enemies of Dobbs, and yet we bode them no ill will other than
the hopeful...
Yes, the terrorists are welcome to that information.
...the hopeful painful death that they will participate in very shortly.
Because even if the terrorists rotate their tires and gain fuel...
Nothing other than that.

Nothing other than that.
No.
No.
These guys do not...
...save fuel efficiency.
...do not think about lopping the heads off of other religious figures.
That would be passed down the line to us all.
Probably not at all.
We wouldn't ever think about what we would do to other religious figures were they in
our clutches.
We'll think of that when it happens.
Now we must consolidate our power.
We must embrace the dark side of the Force.
Feel the power of the dark side of the Force.
That's that old helmet guy.
This helmet is stifling.
Look!
Look!
Look!
Look!
Look!

Word right, quiveringbrain.com.
Well, all these things are kind of like, okay, if you're asking me for something,
you really want something to do, I'll give you a list.
I would promote kidney stones, certain toxic drugs, concentrated urine.
I would take huge amounts of drugs.
A lot of people are eating people three times a day.
You know, that's too much to be peeled off and dealt with.
You'd want to make sure you form stones and problems.
I would take huge amounts of nitrogen.
The odds are your kidney will do fine, but get a list from your doctor.
I think that would be the best thing, all right?
That is the program.
Please join us for the next one.
Until then, as always, take huge amounts of drugs.
Just chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing.
Scratching and biting and scratching and biting.
Like a dog.
She was itching.
She was licking.
She was suffering like a dog.
That was so desperate.
Scratching.
Scratching and biting.
Like itching problems.
Because he keeps me up at night.
Because he keeps me up at night.
Because he keeps me up at night.
Scratching and scratching and.
The digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dogs.
I stopped licking at night, which got both of us to sleep.
Scratching and biting and scratching and biting and scratching and biting.
Thanks to Reverend Maynard Reynard for that.
And to Leigh Murr and Radio Synesthesia.
And to Radio Synesthesia.
Before that also.
And now, Rell.
Now, Rell Pref.
And now, a cop calls the cops.
Because he did some weed and freaked out.
Overdose of what?
Overdose of what?
I think I'm having an overdose.
I think I'm having an overdose.
My wife.
I don't know if it had something in it.
Do you guys have fever or anything?
Do you guys have fever or anything?
I think we're dying.
I think we're dying.
How much did you guys get?
How much did you guys get?
I don't know.
I don't know, we made brownies.
I think we're dying.
We're not here.
And I think we're dead.
Time is going by really, really, really, really, really, really slow.
Now how do you follow a story like that?
I tell you, it's a new world, Philo. I'm not sure I fit in it anymore.
I used to be a wry young sprat, but you could hardly think that you could now.
Hal studies slowly with drawing on the screen, lit by candlelight.
As the new world envelops him.
There's a new world somewhere, we call the Promised Land.
Back when we were just like proto-subgeniuses,
and we are like,
our brains were much smaller,
and our skulls went straight, pretty much straight back above our prognathous brows.
Our brains hadn't turned to mush either.
We hadn't, we hadn't actually, we didn't have a bicameral brain at that point.
It was simply, well we did,
but there was no interconnectivity between the two.
So one side of the brain just sort of talked to itself all the time,
and every now and then, the other side of the brain,
which is the one that was connected to,
the voluntary and involuntary nervous system,
was actually hearing the other voice in such a way that made it think it was actually hearing those voices from God.
Had I not been drinking, I would have thought this was something that was just too wacky to believe.
And yet, they laughed at my methods.
My acquisition skills were,
Acquisitions, mergers, and, um,
the object of humorous discourse.
And yet,
my money problems had simply disappeared.
It was as if I had tapped into a vein of electricity straight from Planet X.
And yet, I could still enjoy a cool, clean smoke.
The milk,
never went sour.
Oh yeah?
And amongst these handball players,
I found my rosy red skull of intent.
Well, you can kiss my rosy red-
And the cough button stood,
stood alone, untouched,
by psychobabble,
or any other brilliant new concept,
as exposed on the show,
by ancient practitioners of subgenius confidence acquisition methods and techniques.
I will soon view when I travel to X-Day.
I hope your calculations are correct.
Our calculations are always correct, for we are gigantic brains.
Initiate space-time transfer!
Hey!
Oh, ma'am.
Because we are
in a funeral service attended by nearly ten people,
same thing as a bomb, homemade bomb,
don't know the bombs, the photos of it.
From PR News in Washington, I'm 2% higher than a year ago.
Radical Shiite cleric Muftada al-Sadr shows more weakness in the roadside bombing market,
but a trade group expects a downturn in sales of bombs to be only temporary.
On Wall Street 14253, reports from Nigeria say PR is bad.
This is PR.
More than 32 million people in the U.S.
are killed by small arms fire this Memorial Day weekend,
despite the hike in small arms prices.
Most were killed yesterday in separate attacks.
The auto industry group AAA died in roadside bombings that also killed PR News.
Come on, smokers, why don't you try?
Well, gang, here are the rest of the questions that will tell you if you know the score.
Question number three.
Would you stick up for kids smaller than you who are picked on by tough guys?
No.
Okay, here's question number two.
Do you respect the right of any boy or girl to worship in whatever church or synagogue he chooses?
No.
Question number five.
Do you speak up for the things you believe in?
Never.
No.
Question number four.
Are you up on what's happening in the world?
No.
Question number seven.
Do you insist on fair play at all times?
No.
Never.
Question number six.
Do you choose your friends only because they're regular Joes without caring what side of the track they live on?
No.
Well, boys and girls, there you have it.
The questions that are the key to popularity.
The key to slack is Lemur.
Disconnect your brain stem.
Open up your skull cap.
And soak it in a coffee of Bob Dobbs.
Enjoy the slack that this in-sieger will bring you.
The key to slack is Lemur.





The key to slack is Lemur.
Do you listen to what they're saying?
No.
No, Bolt.
No, Bolt.
Remember more.
Never.
A UFO! A UFO! A UFO!
Help me, teammate! He's dead, dead, dead, dead!
Hurting everyone out!
Horrors at Black High. Takeoff in there.
And in other news, thousands of landmines have been found.
It's true in about Houston.
Authorities are blaming the subject, yes.
A hyper-crunched-up mix there by Reverend Graves, called Sub-Sayings, and now,
Sub-Sayings, and now,
let's go to beautiful Cleveland for WCSB's Radio Synesthesia with host, Dr. Sinister.
I saw a website that was spreading panic about the, what was it, the Y5B bug.
The Earth only has, I mean, the Sun only has 5 billion more years.
So these guys were starting to sell you software that would help prevent problems when the 5B bug arrived.
You know what's really funny?
When you said Y5B,

I could've sworn I heard you say, uh, Y5B bug.
And, like, uh, the fact that like 25% of the honeybees in America have died in the past few years.
I did say bee bug.
Or disappeared.
Right, but you said Y5B, like, your 5 billion.
Right.
And I'm talking about Wi-Fi, like wireless internet.
Oh.
Wi-Fi bee, and bees like honeybees.
Oh.
The Wi-Fi bee bug.
Or honeybee.
And some people have, like, speculated that maybe, uh, radio signals are interfering with, uh, bees' ability to, uh, get back to their hives.
I think that the insect hive mind of the world just wised up and said, let's quit feeding these humans.
That's a very plausible idea, yeah.
Well, tell you what, why don't I give up a line so that one of those bees can call in and complain.
Talk to you guys later.
Thanks, Mark.
Okay, bye.
It's been a pleasure.
This is PR News.
President Bush is trying to set up a terrorist unit today at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
The President says he's not going to be able to get the bees out of the hive.
He's already got the bees out of the hive.
He's the first U.S. American terrorist found in a river inside the United PR News.
And now, the return of PR News.
President Bush is trying to set up in a river inside PR News.
Weird, you know, basically wearing a bar mop, but, uh, I had plastic that, you know, may clean there.
So did you ever sit in with, uh, Doctors for Bob, puzzling?
Um.
Um.
Which Doc, which Doctors for Bob?
When?
Way back when, you know, I was just thinking, you know.
Oh, yeah, you know, actually it's the original, uh, the original, um, I don't know, I don't


80, 80, 81.
They won on Main Street in Dallas.
Yeah.
And I had no mustache.
And you played.
And the Overman played.
And Meyer ranted and he was very frustrated
because the band wouldn't be like a real band for him.
Yeah, I remember that.
That was fun.
That was fun.
What did he want that he wasn't getting?
When he put his hand up and put his hand down,
he wanted us to stop playing and we just kept honking away.
Or playing terrible things that did not back him up perfectly.
And we ruined his show forever and ever.
Did he write another letter about it?
But he forgave us from that one.
I get all confused on which we are forgiven for and which we are not.
One of Wellman's tapes came on and I closed my eyes.
It was a tape loop of car accidents and dinosaurs fighting.
I opened my eyes and threw it up again,
so I shut my eyes once more and suddenly a vision came to me.
The Torch.
The creature set in.
It was evenly dispensed.
Properly distributed across a broader spectrum of the clientele.
They were dressed in silly uniforms.
Much like a beekeeper or frogman.
We were all waiting for Dobbs to show up.
We were waiting for Dobbs to show up.

Well, and the suspense.
Did he show up or didn't he?
Well, I was nervous.
I'm still nervous.
And he did show up, but not where we thought it would be.
He was supposed to be at the show.
Instead, he showed up in the middle of the fire.
Definitely sloppy second coming.
Hmm, I'm not sure how I can interpret such a...
You sleep here?
Sure, whatever I can.
I can't.

The Pink Boys, dear friends, from 1978.
That was a Dallas band of some friends of mine.
And in fact, the guy singing,
who wrote,
that song,
watching the TV,
was Dr. X,
who you'll find listed in Book of the Subgenius
as one of the three co-sub founders.
He's the third guy,
besides Dr. Philodrummon and me,
who were originally working for Bob
on Subgenius materials.
But he's like the Brian Jones
of the Church of the Subgenius
and died a long time ago.
But, you know, he was right.
TV is the ultimate drug.
And this drug you're listening to
is Hour of Slack,
number 1104,
from the Church of the Subgenius.
And if you want more information
about the Church of the Subgenius,
please look at our rather huge website,
subgenius.com,
where you can also download
all the last few hundred episodes of this show.
Friends, it might not be too late
to make the saucers.
And now,
Lemur.
Who is it?
Who's there?
I'm the werewolf.
Oh, just a moment.
And if it's the werewolf,
where's his car?
If and when the werewolf was sighted
in the gray convertible,
we'd automatically take over
the coffee and the hamburgers,
and all we needed now
was to find the werewolf inside.
Phone rang.
This is Werewolf Boy.
How come?
I don't know.
Oh?
Yeah.
What do you think, Joe?
I don't know.
Code 3.
Code 3.
Come on, let's roll.
Code 3.
Same story.
Werewolf.
Then the newspapers played it big,
and in two days,
the story was on the front page
of every paper in town.
Maybe that should have made
the werewolf lay low,
but it didn't.
Code 3.
At 7 that night,
Ben and I made the rounds
and found each of the policewomen
on her job as a werewolf
behind bars.
The werewolf?
Yeah.
Got anything for us this morning?
Yeah.
Great.
When we told him about the werewolf,
he didn't say a thing for a minute.
4-7-6-3-5-6-3-4-2-6-1-3-8-5.
Got those?
Yeah, yeah.
1-2-3-7-10.
Now we haven't got even half of them.
Yeah.
That's perfect.
Right.
The werewolf was tried and convicted.
That's good.
That's all.
This is PR.
From PR News in Washington,
I'm being held in a prison
with three others.
A tuberculosis patient says
that Alexander Litvinenko
might have spilled secrets
about his work with Britain.
The member states are responsible
for tracing their own nationals.
On Wall Street,
124-665.
This is PR News.
PR's bad.
PR's bad.
Northwest Airlines has emerged
from a police recruiting center
in California.
The U.S. says that Iran
has been missing for more than two weeks.
The U.S. claims Iran's been transferred
from a hospital in Atlanta
with a rare and dangerous form of PR news.
PR dedicated to protecting
Marxism and communist liberals.
You'll smile now.
True.
This is fiction.
And this is
Be Warned It, Be Not.
One of the most amazing funerals
of all time took place
in the townhouse
of the Roman poet Virgil.
But he overlooked
a loaded revolver
in his bureau drawer.
With the aid of neighbors,
a pistol report rang out
and his pet fly fell dead.
Be Warned It, Be Not.
In a moment,
I'll tell you about the donkey
that averaged 25 miles a day.
Amid barbaric pomp and splendor,
a lost donkey wandering,
aimlessly over poor roads
in all kinds of weather,
averaged 95 miles a day
for 59 days.
Yet he averaged 100 miles a day.
Be Warned It, Be Not.
Five letter blocks
contain a total of 30 letters.
Be Warned It, Be Not.
In a moment, I'll tell you about
a real distance runner.
Manson Ernst, a Norwegian,
was the greatest long-distance runner
who ever lived.
Judge Norman Buck,
District Court of Idaho in 1885,
directed that his skin
be made into a military shirt.
Jerry Drum,
Be Warned It,
Be Not.
Well, I'm going to say goodnight
to our listeners now.
And the Martians, they dig it.
Because they're bone-dry monsters
from another world.
They might as well go back
and get that, uh,
get the first rays of the sun.
The sunny rays that point their spears
upon Udonna.
Right, California,
wherever you are.
There goes a great American
and a great subgenius,
Dr. Philo Drummond.
Ascending to the zenith
as he speeds homeward
like a ray of light
across the face of the cosmos.
Now, almighty gods of Egypt,
may you find in this young follower
a success so worthy in every respect
to carry on the sacred trust
now delivered into his hands.
And save him from any temptation
that might destroy him
as it nearly destroyed me.

Material Chamber.
Frop, frop, zippy, frop, frop.
Just like you see on
the Uncle Bob Show.
Frop, frop, zippy, frop, frop.
Learn to cough like Captain Drummond.
Give me more pills, Bob.
Bob, give me more pills, please.
If you could just send
three more of those pills.
Good lord, let's eat, Bob.
I'd feel a whole lot better.
I just took the last one, Bob.
The last pill.
I'll need some more
for the next year.
And now, the mirror.
Now I'm asking you for the last time. Come on, get up.
You're over 21.
Figure it out yourself.
