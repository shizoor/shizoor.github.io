1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Recording, everything's going fine, no trouble.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,680
Friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang sitting here with Princess Wee and Buddy, the new

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,740
subgenius foundation guard dog, who is a small version of the late Dammit.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,060
We got him at an adoption center.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,920
Anyway, this is not the show.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:35,420
This is a section I'm tacking on to the beginning of Hour of Slack number 1645, because it's

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,140
really important and of timely nature.

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:48,800
You know, these folks in Austin who have made movies before are making a documentary movie

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,220
about the Church of the Subgenius, a really serious one.

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,900
I mean, it's going to probably be on...

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,960
Netflix and, you know, out and available as a DVD.

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,640
Probably won't be in theaters much, but it'll be in film festivals and you'll see it and

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,340
it'll be really good, I think.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,660
I'm working very closely with them on the archival footage and stuff like that.

15
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,620
Anyway, the point is they need money to finish this thing, okay?

16
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,140
They have a fundraiser on Kickstarter.

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,520
But there's only like five days left and they haven't...

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,900
They've raised about two-thirds of the money.

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,940
That's great.

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,180
But...

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,860
But they have another whole thing to go.

22
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,380
Right.

23
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,900
There's another like...

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,980
Well, when I looked yesterday, they needed $80,000.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,440
So if only two of you would donate 40,000 bucks.

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:52,400
Anyway, the way to learn about this and see a trailer for the project showing all of us,

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,120
even Lone Star.

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,020
We're going to be doing some Cowboy Dave.

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,340
You can just go to subgenius.com and click on the sentence.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,300
They're making a movie about us.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:12,620
Or you can go to bit.ly slash capital S of slack on and on has a capital O.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,820
Or just type the Subgenius documentary into Google and probably something will pop up

33
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,080
about their fundraiser.

34
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,540
But again, simplest thing.

35
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,120
Just go to subgenius.com.

36
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,520
That's the subgenius.com front page.

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,720
And there's a movie link there.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,780
We understand that subgeniuses may not have a lot of money, but there are some who do

39
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,880
and some who have some money.

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,940
And you should check out the cool rewards that come with the various levels of contribution.

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,600
Of course, they won't take your money unless they...

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,800
This is an all or nothing fundraiser.

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,200
They won't get anything.

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,600
They won't get anything if it doesn't meet the goal in five days.

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,300
But it can be done.

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,220
They've raised a hundred and...

47
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,100
There were $127,000 that they've raised in less than a month.

48
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm sure that didn't come in big chunks either.

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,440
I mean, little chunks.

50
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,560
Oh, I've been following it.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,440
Yeah, it was in little chunks.

52
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,540
Oh, and the funny thing was there were exactly 666 donators yesterday.

53
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,520
No, today it's probably 668.

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,540
I've been sending out bulk emails about it.

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,160
And I'm not sure if that's true.

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,060
A lot of us have been doing video updates as part of the fundraiser thing.

57
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,400
You can see them on Facebook if you follow the fundraiser.

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,940
Even if you don't donate any money, you'd be really interested in seeing what some of

59
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,740
the rewards are and seeing some of the videos.

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:48,740
We worked the comedic views of our move to Texas, which is complete, except that we're

61
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,660
not unpacked.

62
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,480
We got everything here.

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,340
And we got here.

64
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,140
And everything's fine.

65
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,920
But it's been terribly hectic.

66
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,180
That's why the show is late.

67
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,640
And that's why I'm doing this.

68
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,600
And it's kind of a canned show.

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,880
But you haven't heard it.

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,920
Yeah, that fundraiser is really, really important.

71
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,760
And I was going to say who some of the people in the movies are.

72
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,820
Philo and I take our shirts off in one of the promo movies.

73
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,340
Oh, there should be one that they're putting out today with Matt Groening.

74
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:29,520
And me doing a bunch of shtick just off the top of our heads after breakfast in Los Angeles.

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,680
That was a big high point for me.

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,260
I got to tell Matt how much I admired Futurama and The Simpsons, which was so much that when

77
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,620
Fox messed with The Simpsons, that was the last time I watched a show on TV.

78
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,340
I switched completely to the internet after that and never saw another commercial.

79
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,640
Oh, and Jerry Casale of Devo.

80
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,320
Oh, yeah.

81
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,320


82
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,320


83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,320


84
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:57,620
And I think Alex Cox, the movie director that did Repo Man and Sid and Nancy and a

85
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,380
bunch of really nutty movies.

86
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,200
He's buddies with Paul Mavridis.

87
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:09,900
You see Paul and Puzzling Evidence and Lonesome Cowboy Dave did a Kickstarter routine.

88
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,680
And yeah, it's really been fun.

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,080
So check it out.

90
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,960
And now you can hear Hour of Sight number 1645.

91
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,320
Oh, yeah.

92
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:30,160
Which is a copy of a radio synesthesia show from about a month ago in September that Princess

93
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,140
Wee, you and I sat in and Dave called in.

94
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,500
We stayed at the station for an extra two hours.

95
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,720
I was saving it for this busy, busy week.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
So here it is.

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,560
Praise Bob.

98
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,100
Hail Connie.

99
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,720
Amen and all women.

100
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,700
Who's there?

101
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,300
The Souljauners.

102
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


103
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


104
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,580
The genius.

105
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,600
The power.

106
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,880
All the soul.

107
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,540
What?

108
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,560
Now I know all about everything.

109
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,040
What?

110
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:12,580
We wrote this next song when Ronald Reagan was president.

112
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:12,680
How did we do boys?

113
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,220
You guys know how to play it, you know me and you guys.

114
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:25,860
The last time, the last time I saw you and you, you were watching some fans like this.

115
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,240
Told me you'd been there too, Ryan.

116
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,320


117
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,320


118
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,320


119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,520
Flying program.

120
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,520


121
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,520


122
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,520


123
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,520


124
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,520


125
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,520


126
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,520


127
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,520


128
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,520


129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,800
Step.

130
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,220
And we learned this song and we thought,

131
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,180
well, it won't get any worse than this.

132
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,560
Do you remember when George W. was president

133
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,860
and all these singers across the country

134
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,520
started playing Master of War?

135
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,500
And the idea was we were going to play Masters of War

136
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,960
until the Iraq War was over.

137
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,860
Come here, Masters of War.

138
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,620
You that build the big guns

139
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,960
You that build the death plates

140
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,700
You that build all the bombs

141
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,160
You hide behind walls

142
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,840
And churches and desks

143
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,780
We thought it couldn't get any worse than this.

144
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,860
Let's shake it up.

145
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,220
Well, I was thinking about Abraham Lincoln

146
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,840
And the enemies of the truth

147
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,700
But I could not tell

148
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,620
I came that deep from a job

149
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,220
And wailed through the loud of my feet

150
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,880
Out of my way

151
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,300
Out of my way

152
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,940
Hard rockin' on the record today

153
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,000
And I feel like thinking twice

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,680
With anybody who claims they're right

155
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,180
All the preachers, men, the politicians

156
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,720
All the critics and the things they write

157
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,240
Out of my way

158
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,720
Out of my way

159
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,160
Out of my way

160
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,920
Hard rockin' on the record today

161
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,860
And this is a call to heart

162
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,300
This is a call to have

163
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,380
This is a call to the voices and minds of the people

164
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,520
In every land

165
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,020
Out of my way

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,580
Out of my way

167
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,060
Out of my way

168
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,820
Hard rockin' on the record today

169
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,380
Record today

170
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,820
Put the money in the mattress

171
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,720
Record today

172
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,240
Put your penis lake out

173
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,440
Record today

174
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
There's nothing left to believe in

175
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,960
Record today

176
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,900
Nothing left to wait for

177
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,720
Eh...

178
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,720


179
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,720


180
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,720


181
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,720


182
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,720


183
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,720


184
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,720


185
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,720


186
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,720


187
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,260
Saying those who rely on you

188
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,260
We're takin' the history test

189
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,700
Whose baddest will do his best

190
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,940
Lenin the brother

191
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,880
Lenin the sisters

192
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,420
Lenin the communist

193
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,940
Out of my way

194
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,220
Out of my way

195
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,420
Out of my way

196
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:36,960
Hard rockin' on record today

197
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,300
And likewise

198
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,900
And everybody's doing pity

199
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,820
Till they burned down my boat in blue

200
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,280
Out of my way

201
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,740
Out of my way

202
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,220
Out of my way

203
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,100
Hard rockin' on a recordin' day

204
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,600
Recordin' day

205
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,940
With no money in the backstreet

206
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,140
Recordin' day

207
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,400
Put your fingers to the count

208
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,620
Recordin' day

209
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,020
Super less than believe in

210
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,160
Recordin' day

211
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
Nothing left to wait for

212
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,460
We are the immigrant flock

213
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,880
Shipwrecked on a lemon rock

214
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
From the monitor

215
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,100
And the mirror back

216
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,520
From the pressure and the quiver

217
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,700
And the titanic

218
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,680
Recordin' day

219
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,120
With no money in the backstreet

220
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,260
Recordin' day

221
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,480
Put your fingers to the count

222
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,760
Recordin' day

223
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,140
Super less than believe in

224
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,220
Recordin' day

225
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,140
Nothing left to wait for

226
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:35,900
Recordin' day

227
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,160
Get out of my way

228
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,660
Get out of my way

229
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,120
Get out of my way

230
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,680
Get out of my way

231
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,200
Well, at least we know it won't get any worse than this.

232
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,500
Yeah, I shouldn't say that.

233
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,460
Oh, yes, dear friends.

234
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,560
Thank you, The Rainmakers.

235
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:34,000
Recorded June 2, 2017 at Knucklehead's Garage in, I think, Kansas City, Missouri.

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,460
We're trying to get Bob Walkenhorst to the Starwood Festival next year.

237
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:45,220
Friends, the great news is we made it to Stang Ranch, Texas, intact with all our stuff,

238
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,540
the entire Church of the Subgenius main media archive, and Slack altar elements.

239
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,500
After a truly strenuous and taxing house move.

240
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,200
We even stopped at a dog rescue shelter outside of Dallas on the way in.

241
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,980
Met this young little...

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,820
hound dog named Buddy that we'd been checking out to be our new master after Dammit.

243
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,600
And by gobs, we hit it off.

244
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:19,280
And now Buddy considers Stang Ranch his home and Princess Wee and myself to be his personal

245
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,080
monkey people.

246
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,760
He walks us many times a day.

247
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,520
Our dog is always with us.

248
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,540
We're still unpacking.

249
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,420
But basically the huge move is over.

250
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,440
And we can emit this new like Hour of Slack number 1645.

251
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,480
Finally.

252
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,840
Maybe a little late.

253
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:50,140
The rest of this was recorded September 17, 2017, conspiracy year, on Dr. Sinister's show

254
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:56,440
on WCSB Cleveland, Radio Sinesthesia, which follows Hour of Slack.

255
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,920
Only that particular night, we stuck around.

256
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,720
And welcome to the program, dear friends.

257
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,740
This is a very special edition of Sinesthesia on WCSB Cleveland 89.3 FM.

258
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,000
Portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

259
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,020
Therefore, WCSB advises listener discretion.

260
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,000
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,520
State University.

262
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,520
And you have been warned.

263
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,100
If you would like to jibber jabber, we're going to start early tonight because we can.

264
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,400
216-625-7000.

265
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,400


266
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,780
I feel like I owe you all an explanation for why I was absent last week.

267
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,580
I was lucky enough to get a ride to the station.

268
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,580
I don't have a car anymore.

269
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,640
I don't have a car anymore because some jackass fell asleep at the wheel and rear-ended me

270
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,440
at full speed.

271
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,560
And shopping for a car is a real pain in the bum.

272
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,680
Thank goodness you're okay.

273
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,540
My God.

274
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,160
That had a heck of an impact.

275
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,780
I've taken a header or two in my day.

276
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,940
What's really funny though is a cop just happened to show up as I was exchanging information

277
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,640
with the guy.

278
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,120
And I'm like, yeah, I want to file a report because this, you know, I want to get that

279
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,760
on the record, man.

280
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,240
This guy, this guy shouldn't even be driving.

281
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,340
This guy shouldn't even have a license.

282
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,660
Right.

283
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,220
Hopefully his license has been revoked.

284
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,080
He's like, oh yeah, I just kind of dozed off there.

285
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,020
I have sleep apnea.

286
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,840
Oh, and it said on his, on the police, the cop asked us who our employers were and he

287
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,780
put down Uber Eats as his employer.

288
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,920
And I'm thinking, oh crap.

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,400
Like his employer.

290
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,640
His insurance is not going to pay for this.

291
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,160
They're going to say you're a delivery driver.

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,980
Your car insurance is null and void because you're doing delivery work.

293
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,460
Wow.

294
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,040
And what's really funny is the only reason I actually went to my own insurance for it.

295
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,320
And the only reason I even had coverage for my own car is because last month I took my

296
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
road trip to Pittsburgh for my jeopardy audition.

297
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,640
And I'm like, okay, well I'm taking a road trip.

298
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,220
I'm going to increase my insurance for this trip.

299
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,960
And then I get back and like, yeah, you know, there's no sense paying for this insurance

300
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,220
anymore.

301
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,120
My car is not worth that much, but I never got around to reducing it.

302
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,940
So my laziness actually paid off.

303
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,180
Praise Bob.

304
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,400
I got paid for my car in just a couple of days.

305
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,640
I tried to sell my junker last week.

306
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,480
Yeah.

307
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,900
You know what?

308
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,440
I don't even think I'd fit into your junker.

309
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,380
It's a smaller vehicle.

310
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,520
It's too small.

311
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,720
And I am a giant of a man as tall as all my fans know.

312
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,680
Yes.

313
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,280
And, uh, but yeah, so anyway, here I am.

314
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,400
And, uh, one of my good friends who was also, was also a station member.

315
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,920
Uh, was, uh, gracious enough to provide me a ride this evening so I can be here with

316
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,360
you, the people.

317
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,020
And especially we have Keith in the studio.

318
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,700
We have princess.

319
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,660
We are do, and we have the Reverend Ivan staying.

320
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,060
And it is my great pleasure to have such a great group of my friends here in the studio

321
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,500
with me.

322
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:58,360
And now it is just as great a pleasure, if not greater to introduce the one, the only

323
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,920
lonesome cowboy.

324
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,240
Dave.

325
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,700
I am certainly on the air as long as I can remember.

326
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,440
It's been a powerful, powerful afternoon listening to these, uh, quite erudite Shermans and sermonettes

327
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,940
by Reverend We are weird.

328
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,280
Uh, of the, we are dope.

329
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,800
Remember I haven't stayed with the church of the subgenius and also of yourself, sir.

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,520
Fine.

331
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:29,220
Fine for yourself to elucidate what needed to be said and done at this hour of our daily

332
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,160
critical needs.

333
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,380
Thank you.

334
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,880
Thank you so much.

335
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,300
Dave.

336
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,540
Give us this hour.

337
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,620
Our critical needs.

338
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,600
And forgive us our bun heads.

339
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,740
Dog.

340
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,800
Dog is great.

341
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,160
Dog is good, but dog cannot have our foot.

342
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,660
That's another Benedict women.

343
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,680
Yeah.

344
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,360
I remember when he was just a wee pup himself.

345
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,720
He was a short stalwart guy, kind of 350 pound yeoman looking.

346
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,280
Yeah.

347
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,560
I remember.

348
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,300
Yeah.

349
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,700
Yeah.

350
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,600
Yeah.

351
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:00,940
Yeah.

352
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:09,440
I think to me he was just a, he was a snowflake too.

353
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,740
Isn't that what you call them staying because of your strong conservative views?

354
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,160
He called me a snow.

355
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,640
Snowflake, I'm going to breathe on you and you going to melt.

356
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,380
The girls are picking on me again.

357
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,800
I was crying.

358
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,280
I was crying on the weekend.

359
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,280


360
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,280


361
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,280


362
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,960
Anglo white wasp men never get any slack.

363
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,060
All the minorities pick on us all the time.

364
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,160
The snowflakes are mean to us.

365
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,460
Me.

366
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:59,200
Did you know that this is a really true fact, that 40 percent of the election money that flows in the United States during any election cycle, especially presidential, is considered 40 percent of all the critical.

367
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:14,960
Money that comes into donations can count campaign funding and stuff like that is run by less than point zero one five percent of the population.

368
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,460
Meaning it's like five guys.

369
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,360
They make some tasty burgers.

370
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,560
Mr. Exxon, Mr. Mobile, Mr. Shell.

371
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,260
And, you know, those.

372
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,680
Yeah, the climate scientists.

373
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,360
Yeah.

374
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,140
That decide who votes for what.

375
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,980
And you know who the best climate scientists in the world are?

376
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,700
A.M. radio host.

377
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,640
They know more about the weather.

378
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,580
Especially since like when they were in 10th grade, they thought they might want to be the weatherman on TV.

379
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,160
Honestly, I have to agree with you there.

380
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,080
Rush Limbaugh knew that he was going to be perfectly safe in South Florida.

381
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,180


382
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,060
And the only reason.

383
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,400
He evacuated was for security reasons.

384
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,080
All right.

385
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,680
Yeah.

386
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,220
Because nobody cares about national security more than him.

387
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:08,960
Right.

388
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,020
Well, he produces a lot of the nation's insecurity.

389
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,620
I would test.

390
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,060
He manufactures it.

391
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,760
What a swine.

392
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,560
So bright and so pink.

393
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,260
He does sound a little bit like Porky the pig.

394
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,060
I won't say the full name because I think Warner Brothers was brought up.

395
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,780
By Warner Sisters.

396
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,620
At least I might get something wrong.

397
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,280
And they'd have to.

398
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,060
The only Warner Sister I know of is Dot.

399
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,120
Dot?

400
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,720
Yeah.

401
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,540
And then there was Dot Warner?

402
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,240
Yeah.

403
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,840
There was Yakko and Wacko and Dot.

404
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,320
You're not allowed to make me find these humors.

405
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
Because I do not.

406
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,020
Dot.

407
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,440
Dot?

408
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,500
Dot Matrix.

409
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,160
Dot.

410
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,300
Polka Dot.

411
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,800
Dot.

412
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,200
Matrix was her married name.

413
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh.

414
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,560
Okay.

415
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,520
Well, I want to get back on the subject of climate change.

416
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,400
I heard that liberal scientists caused all those hurricanes in order so that

417
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,680
Hitler could take away our guns.

418
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,100
Oh, I see.

419
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Not only that.

420
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,640
Not only that.

421
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,760
They would convince everyone that there was such a thing as climate change.

422
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,860
But we were unaware.

423
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,480
I'm sorry.

424
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,460
My point is that.

425
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:26,980
Not only that.

426
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,600
Not only that.

427
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,720
But a sheriff's office.

428
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,480
In Florida.

429
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,240
Was actually issuing a public statement.

430
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,540
Warning citizens of his county.

431
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,920
Not to shoot at the hurricane.

432
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,980
And what kind of.

433
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,580
What kind of.

434
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,080
What are you.

435
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,440
How are you trying to ruin America.

436
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,280
When you're telling us we can't shoot at hurricanes.

437
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,600
They hate our freedoms.

438
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,560
Well, this guy.

439
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,120
This guy started posting.

440
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,120
He.

441
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,780
This guy.

442
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,160
This guy's suggestion about doing that went viral.

443
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,360
And the sheriff was wisely concerned.

444
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,820
That people were going.

445
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,560
To stand there firing into the high wind.

446
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,760
Which of course.

447
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,720
The bullets are going to come down somewhere.

448
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,340
And what.

449
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,960
Got your baby's name on it.

450
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,880
May.

451
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,340
I just.

452
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,800
I can't.

453
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,460
I cannot approve.

454
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,560
I cannot approve of shooting at anybody named Irma.

455
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,460
That's.

456
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,120
That's somebody's grandma.

457
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
You can't shoot.

458
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:18,960
Yeah.

459
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,360
You're not supposed to do that to women.

460
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,240
You're supposed to hit them with golf balls.

461
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,560
Knock them down.

462
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,520
With golf balls.

463
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,920
You don't get that.

464
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,180
No, I don't get that one.

465
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,760
It's a.

466
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,420
That was.

467
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,220
That was posted very recently.

468
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,480
He showed Trump.

469
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,760
Teeing off into Hillary.

470
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,720
Crimpton.

471
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,160
There's no such person as Hillary.

472
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,620
Crimpton.

473
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,460
I mean.

474
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:39,860
This.

475
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,320
Hillary.

476
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,020
Martha.

477
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,440
Plimpton.

478
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:41,860
Trump.

479
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,640
Teeing off.

480
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,200
Peter.

481
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,440
Frampton.

482
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,000
Hillary.

483
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,220
Clinton's back.

484
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,020
Right.

485
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,380
Right.

486
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,660
In other words.

487
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,480
A funny image of a man knocking a woman down.

488
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,960
Yeah.

489
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,780
Nothing funnier than that.

490
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,280
What do you tell a woman with two black eyes?

491
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,880
Nothing.

492
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,120
Nothing.

493
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,900
You already told her.

494
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,520
Two golf balls for one ball.

495
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,800
Lock her up.

496
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,960
Yep.

497
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,980
The next time he makes his way on down to the local airport.

498
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,400
Just.

499
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,640
You just wait outside.

500
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,160
Ask him if he can have you those party flavors that they have on.

501
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,000
Exam.

502
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,580
Our president.

503
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,020
What's.

504
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,540
What's he calling?

505
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,720
Blue Book one or something.

506
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,140
Or.

507
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,300
Air Force one.

508
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,680
Yeah.

509
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,760
That's the one they've had.

510
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,740
Remember when they had him in the waistcoat and the.

511
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,840
And the body strippings.

512
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,040
And the.

513
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,480
And the.

514
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:29,600
And the um.

515
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,900
The uh.

516
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,540
Straight jackets.

517
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,340
Speaking of jackets and the president.

518
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,740
I just saw a picture recently of him meeting with somebody in the Oval Office.

519
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,240
And in a photo op.

520
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:39,680
And uh.

521
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,980
His pants.

522
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,620
And his suit pants and suit jacket were mismatched.

523
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:44,900
What?

524
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,100
Well that's no way.

525
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,540
That's good.

526
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,640
It would.

527
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:48,840
It would.

528
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:48,880
It would.

529
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,000
In pink.

530
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,280
Lock her up.

531
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,760
He doesn't even know how to put a suit on.

532
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,620
Lock her up.

533
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,780
She switched his clothes.

534
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,300
Just to embarrass him.

535
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,040
He's wearing a suit.

536
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,040


537
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,040


538
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,960
There's no way he's going to wear those.

539
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,180
I'm fine.

540
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,500
Come on.

541
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,560
Hillary's still sneaking around that White House.

542
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,320
I still maintain.

543
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,040
Tied his shoelaces together.

544
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,600
And short sheeted his bed.

545
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,600
I still maintain.

546
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,500
This is not fair.

547
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,700
They're picking on us conservatives.

548
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,260
They're picking on the wealthy.

549
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,260
They're picking on us rich people.

550
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:17,400
They're picking on us rich people.

551
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,860
We could buy away everything with a suit, too.

552
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,860
With more suits.

553
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,960
My existential angst nausea.

554
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,520
No.

555
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,560
I still maintain the only reason that Donald Trump has become so anti immigration in recent

556
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:28,960
years.

557
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,020
Because he's getting rich.

558
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,020


559
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,020


560
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,860
is because Melania is getting older

561
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,220
and he wants to be able to deport her

562
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,140
so he doesn't have to go through a messy divorce.

563
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,180
Ah.

564
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
You know, I mean, she's getting up, you know,

565
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,620
I mean, like, you know, once, I mean, he said before,

566
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,340
it's very hard to be a 10 when you're over 40.

567
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,280
So, I mean, you know, he generally,

568
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,460
every 20 years or so,

569
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,540
he'll trade his wife in for a newer model.

570
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,700
You're out of here, Tabby.

571
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,040
So, yeah, I mean, that's why he's anti-immigration now.

572
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,920
Melania?

573
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,460
Let somebody else walk up and grab you by the...

574
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,580
I bet Melania probably has family in Cleveland.

575
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Free Melania.

576
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,240
Oh, yeah, sure.

577
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,780
We're like the biggest Slovenian city outside of Slovenia.

578
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,120
Yes, the Slovenian Hall, Polka Hall of Fame

579
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,900
is in Euclid at the old shore high school.

580
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,200
Like, I mean, this is a long time ago.

581
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,080
It was like 15 years ago,

582
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,680
but I went to New York and did a tour of the UN building

583
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,000
and there was this guy from Slovenia in the tour group

584
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,720
and everyone's like, oh, where are you from?

585
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,140
I was like, oh, and I mentioned I was from Cleveland.

586
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,440
He's like...

587
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,140
Oh, yeah, yeah.

588
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,960
Everybody in Slovenia has cousins in Cleveland.

589
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,320
Yeah.

590
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:32,800
I was surprised.

591
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,840
So maybe Cleveland will have to become a sanctuary city

592
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,600
for Melania Trump.

593
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,980
There are a bunch of wineries out in winery land

594
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,360
that all have Slovenian names.

595
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,600
Maybe, maybe.

596
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,400
There are a bunch of wineries in all of Slovenia.

597
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,940
I don't know.

598
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,820
216-687-3515 is the number to call

599
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,600
if you'd like to get on the air.

600
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,440
We do have someone else trying to get on the air right now.

601
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,300
So why don't we bring on...

602
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,680
another victim here.

603
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,580
You're on the air.

604
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,800
These jokes are so old.

605
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,880
They're the ones my grandmother...

606
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,800
Well, hey, man, I recycle my jokes

607
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,980
because it's good for the environment,

608
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,060
including that one.

609
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,020
So anyway...

610
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,760
I didn't really hear any jokes.

611
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,160
Were there supposed to have been some jokes happening?

612
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,560
I don't know.

613
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,040
I'm pretty...

614
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,540
I'm a very serious person.

615
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:26,020
I did say something that I read somebody else say

616
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,280
about six hours ago.

617
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,280


618
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,100
So that was an old joke.

619
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,560
Six hours old.

620
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,440
It was on the internet about six hours.

621
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,180
Free Melania was the phrase.

622
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,900
Oh, so there was...

623
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,140
Some movie stars...

624
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,080
That wasn't real also.

625
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,300
Yeah, some movie star was actually...

626
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,760
had that idea and was promoting T-shirts

627
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,140
that said Free Melania.

628
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,080
Well, just remember,

629
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,320
even though it came out six hours ago,

630
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,040
the guy who just called all angry and bitter

631
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,980
and stuff like that,

632
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,800
he didn't get it out until just now.

633
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,060
He just listened to it.

634
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,180
Yeah, well...

635
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,840
That's stupid.

636
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,860
That's stupid.

637
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,000
Take it all back.

638
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,020
I don't mean a damn darn word of it.

639
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,200
I have no regrets.

640
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,760
Maybe it seemed like somebody

641
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,780
had some sort of pastoral hierarchy

642
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,840
where he just gets to be the goblet king

643
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,440
and pass down the secret wisdoms

644
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,520
in his own urine sack

645
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,200
like he was some sort of ancient Navajo hunter.

646
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,580
But I know it's all untrue

647
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,900
because I believe it's a lie.

648
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,700
Therefore, it could...

649
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,360
Squid...

650
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,940
Pro...

651
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,160
Quo...

652
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,160


653
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,080
Um...

654
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,720
Canker.

655
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,040
Yeah.

656
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,740
Canker.

657
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,720
You mentioned the goblet king.

658
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,800
Who, me?

659
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,420
Yeah.

660
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,460
Oh, I don't know.

661
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,160
It's just there was an impenetrable thought

662
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,940
that made its way into the backyard of my vacuum once.

663
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,220
I've got two of those in my mouth right now

664
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,640
that are really irritating me.

665
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,160
Little lumps that are sore.

666
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:56,860
But...

667
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,440
Just appeared.

668
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Yeah, but you often...

669
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,000
Do you get that often?

670
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,700
My tongue...

671
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,320
The unfairness.

672
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,380
No, I don't.

673
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,740
My tongue won't leave them alone.

674
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,380
It's driving me nuts.

675
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,420
I just showed Princess Leewa.

676
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:07,700
See?

677
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,740
What color is it?

678
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,360
Is it purple?

679
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,520
Pink.

680
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:10,700
The bump.

681
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,300
Pink.

682
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,240
There's a pink bump on my lip,

683
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,180
on the inner lip.

684
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:15,720
Mm-hmm.

685
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,680
Can...

686
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,960
Listeners, can you...

687
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,180
If I scrape it against some microphone...

688
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,540
It's got that foam rubber on it.

689
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,400
It wouldn't be the most disgusting thing

690
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,440
ever done to that microphone.

691
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,860
Oh, tell him that

692
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,040
These microphones are like...

693
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,700
These microphones are like

694
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,260
everything in a hotel room.

695
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,740
I once had a guest up here,

696
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,660
a young lady who works as a stripper

697
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,080
who was once banned from X-Day,

698
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,460
and she was my guest on this program once,

699
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,440
and that very microphone

700
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,900
into which you're speaking, Reverend Stang,

701
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,720
at one point during the program,

702
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,180
she farted directly into that microphone.

703
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,520
I tell you, everything...

704
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,240
These microphones have been everywhere

705
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,880
that anything in a hotel has been.

706
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:56,880


707
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:56,880


708
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,060
Yeah.

709
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,460
In other words,

710
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,240
up somebody's something.

711
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,140
216-687-3515

712
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,060
is the number to call,

713
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,260
and we have another caller here.

714
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,260
Oh, and they hung up.

715
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,440
Wasn't that your hero,

716
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,040
the other...

717
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,840
the podcast guy?

718
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,100
It was his buddy that said that,

719
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,820
his buddy that he got...

720
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,980
I can't think of his name.

721
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,240
No, Jonathan Colton has a co...

722
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,520
has a friend...

723
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,180
He's a co-ranter.

724
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,400
Paul Rogers something.

725
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,120
I can't remember anyway.

726
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,280
He was the one who came up with that.

727
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:26,580
Yes.

728
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,740
Which I already forgot.

729
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,100
Oh, yeah, everything...

730
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,780
Everything in a motel...

731
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,000
You know, I don't like Jonathan Colton.

732
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,360
I...

733
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,960
Philo wouldn't let me play that stuff.

734
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
I wanted to like him,

735
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,340
but he quickly got on my nerves.

736
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,760
My only familiarity with him is from

737
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,220
Ask Me Another at NPR.

738
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,240
Oh, I used to play select stuff by him

739
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,840
for about a year.

740
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,200
I was playing him every week.

741
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,280
He sounds like...

742
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,700
He sounds like a goddamn hipster.

743
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,140
He just...

744
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,580
I don't know.

745
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:57,920
I don't know.

746
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,540
Isn't hipster just what hipsters call other hipsters?

747
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,620
Hipster?

748
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,540
You have to cite...

749
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,760
Only hipsters even use the word hipster.

750
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,040
Okay.

751
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,380
Yeah.

752
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,500
Maybe you're onto something.

753
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,160
I don't know.

754
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,940
He sounds like the kind of guy

755
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,500
who is kind of dorky cool,

756
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,220
but whose ass I could kick.

757
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,200
Well, that's the difference.

758
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,820
You just described yourself and most of my friends.

759
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,040
I could kick most of their asses.

760
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,200
Yeah, you sound like you're mentally disturbed, too.

761
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,660
But most of us...

762
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,680
A lot of people could kick your ass.

763
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,300
Even though you're...

764
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,560
You know what?

765
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,840
The only friend of yours I've ever met

766
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,920
who I thought could take me was Legume.

767
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,320
I think he's the only one I've ever met who could...

768
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,400
But that was before his open-heart surgery.

769
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,240
Yeah, he had a quad...

770
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,040
He had a quintuple or whatever.

771
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,080
You haven't...

772
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
That's because you haven't met...

773
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,180
You get stuck in New Jersey on one of those things

774
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,540
and you can never get off of it.

775
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,840
He's never met Reverend Dr. Sinister Killer yet.

776
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,400
Oh.

777
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,260
Also, Reverend...

778
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,460
With a name like that, I like him already.

779
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,140
Right.

780
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,840
I figured.

781
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,720
I mean, come on.

782
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,720
How can anyone in this room put down Jonathan Colton

783
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,300
for being a smarmy hipster?

784
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,580
I don't know.

785
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,320
I don't like the way his voice sounds.

786
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,140
And I don't like the...

787
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,240
Goodness.

788
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,620
I don't like the songs that he chooses to play.

789
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,400
And the fact that he was...

790
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,000
He does original songs.

791
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,400
The fact that he was a whiff and poof.

792
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,340
Oh, that's it.

793
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:23,480
What the hell?

794
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,180
Is that the thing?

795
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,180


796
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,180


797
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,180


798
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,180


799
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,780
The thing that bugs you?

800
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,380
That's part of it, yeah.

801
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,420
Well, I've been to Burning Man twice,

802
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,260
so I guess I should just leave the room

803
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,980
because I'm too...

804
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,100
But you went to Burning Man before.

805
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,740
It was cool.

806
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,640
No, you're just a poof doll.

807
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,940
Oh, there was already...

808
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,840
There were 30,000 people there in 2000 and 2001

809
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,560
when I went.

810
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,780
It was already not cool.

811
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:40,860


812
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,400
Except I still consider it the best party

813
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,220
I've ever been to,

814
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,180
and I'd go back in a second if I could.

815
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,720
So you went there around the same time

816
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,760
that I first heard about it.

817
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,480
Actually, I had...

818
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,000
I went there about the same time

819
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,140
that my friend's father...

820
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,220
Milo and Puzzling Evidence

821
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,800
were getting tired of it after 15 years.

822
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,980
They had been involved in it

823
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,460
from when it started...

824
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,340
Well, Puzzling Evidence

825
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,160
was probably the first one in 1980.

826
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,420
But they were saying it was sold out by then.

827
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,000
Well...

828
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,980
But he was also doing...

829
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,540
It was popular.

830
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,860
It got popular.

831
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,380
I went to the Burning Corn Festival

832
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,200
around that same time

833
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,220
that you went to Burning Man.

834
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,640
I went to the Burning Corn Festival.

835
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,340
Did you get rid of your corns?

836
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,100
No, I ate some corn,

837
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,980
and I saw a gigantic paper mache

838
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,360
ear of corn set on fire.

839
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,820
It was hosted by Trademark, actually.

840
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,220
Oh.

841
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,940
Trademark.

842
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,400
Yeah.

843
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,400
He did radio at Burning Man

844
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,460
for years and years.

845
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,080
He's always been going.

846
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,540
Dr. Hal is always there

847
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,320
running the fashion show

848
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,960
and usually singing in operas and things

849
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,900
while buildings burn down around him.

850
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,240
And he's like 79 years old.

851
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,760
Yeah, if he's black and old enough,

852
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,000
he can live 79 more years.

853
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,680
And when you're the emcee

854
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,560
of the fashion show,

855
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,980
think what kind of people

856
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,260
are trying to bribe you

857
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,260
into judging their costume

858
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,140
and, you know, pump you up.

859
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,700
Like you have a ball constrictor

860
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,700
wrapped around your neck.

861
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,660
Tall, naked girls.

862
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,380
Leggy models.

863
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,800
Yeah, tall, leggy models.

864
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,420
Dr. Hal's actually done pretty well

865
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,200
with long-legged models.

866
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,920
Oh, you'd be surprised.

867
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,160
You'd be surprised.

868
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,600
We get all kinds here.

869
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,020
By the way...

870
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,100
It would look any better

871
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,600
than having...

872
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,460
No kinds at all.

873
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,700
He's a hound dog.

874
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,120
Nothing.

875
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,360
Dr. Hal Robbins, he's a hound dog.

876
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,320
Oh, yes, he is.

877
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,580
Oh, creepers snooping around the back.

878
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,360
Jonathan Coulton.

879
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,460
He's a backdoor man.

880
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,720
Sidekick.

881
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,300
Dr. Hal is a backdoor man.

882
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,640
Is John Roderick.

883
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,520
I'm not kicking any man

884
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,400
ever seen here.

885
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,220
Oh, John Roderick.

886
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,660
That's the guy you're talking about.

887
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,080
Yes, he's the one that said...

888
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,760
The guy that originally said

889
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,680
that everything in every motel room

890
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,960
has been up somebody's...

891
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:49,960
You know.

892
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,320
You know.

893
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,980
You just said that previously

894
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,240
in the last commentary

895
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,220
and you forgot to remember it.

896
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,760
No, I found that the originator...

897
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,900
You should remember the guy's name.

898
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,700
John Roderick, yes.

899
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,060
I got his full name.

900
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,220
He has a pretty funny show

901
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,360
that sounds kind of like

902
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,760
this one does.

903
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,600
The little brain in my pocket found it.

904
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,320
He's also the antichrist

905
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,100
if you guys would even care

906
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,320
to look into the subject

907
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,980
a little bit.

908
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,400
Just a little bit faster

909
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,580
than the nose on your own butter.

910
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,960
He is and could be...

911
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,540
possibly tomorrow.

912
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,740
The antichrist.

913
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,160
Who couldn't?

914
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,860
Anybody could.

915
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,480
Yeah, that's not the point.

916
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,640
The point is whatever I just said

917
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,520
makes more sense

918
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,760
than what you just said.

919
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,880
Unlikely.

920
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,180
It's not really hard

921
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,200
to make much more sense

922
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,160
than what we've been seeing.

923
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,100
That is true.

924
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,060
Bear that in mind.

925
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,240
Don't talk about bears

926
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,160
on this show, man.

927
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,600
Yeah, antelope that.

928
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:52,840
Yeah, man.

929
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:52,960
Antelope that.

930
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:52,960


931
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:52,960


932
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,960
Don't bear it in mind.

933
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Antelope it in mind.

934
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
Don't even use the word bear.

935
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,680
You did it.

936
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,180
Oh, sorry.

937
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm sorry.

938
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,580
Especially the conditioning

939
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,840
of the studio there

940
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,940
down on the lake area

941
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,180
where the bears come swimming

942
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,320
right up out of the lake area

943
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,840
and just come walking past

944
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
little Chinatown

945
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,820
or our new old Chinatown

946
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,040
or Carnegie or wherever

947
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,280
that is.

948
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,880
That's a pretty decent hike

949
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,420
from the lake to Chinatown

950
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,100
here in Cleveland,

951
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,900
but yeah, for a bear.

952
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,900
He's talking about

953
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:22,940
Ashtabula.

954
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,840
I think, isn't he?

955
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,520
No, I was talking about

956
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,180
Chinatown.

957
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,260
It's underwater, dude.

958
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,740
I'm not making

959
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,720
a commercial statement,

960
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,560
but near Dave's Supermarket.

961
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,720
I'll have pain there.

962
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,560
You know, the

963
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,840
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's Supermarket.

964
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,420
I hear you can get

965
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,280
cheap heroin there.

966
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:39,920
Man.

967
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,740
Oh, yeah.

968
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,260
I recently heard the song

969
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
by the Easter Monkeys.

970
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,460
I bought it at the supermarket.

971
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,280
It was actually about

972
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,660
the Dave's in Chinatown.

973
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,740
And now they're moving it.

974
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,900
And now they're moving it?

975
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:53,480
Yeah.

976
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,080
Where am I going to get

977
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,860
my cheap heroin now?

978
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,040
I think I'm moving it

979
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,900
like 55th and somewhere.

980
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,740
Oh, man.

981
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,640
Where do you get

982
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,580
the cheap Adderall?

983
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,900
That's all I care about.

984
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,540
I've only ever

985
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,400
done Adderall once.

986
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,320
You beat up about

987
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,260
half of my students.

988
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,420
Hmm?

989
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,320
You beat up about

990
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,280
half of my students

991
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,440
and take it from them.

992
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Just steal it from them.

993
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:11,800
Yeah.

994
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,160
Just knock them down.

995
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,220
I hate to treat

996
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,800
kindergartners that way, though.

997
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,040
They're high school students.

998
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,720
They could take it.

999
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,260
Take it, go get more.

1000
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,940
They beat me up

1001
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,160
and take my heart medicine.

1002
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,540
I'm sorry, Dave.

1003
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,060
What did you say, Dave?

1004
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,320
I heard somebody mention

1005
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,240
the Easter Monkeys

1006
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,000
and I just wondered

1007
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,100
what the context was.

1008
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,680
We were talking about

1009
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,440
the Dave's supermarket.

1010
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,240
Looping forehead.

1011
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,260
We were talking about

1012
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,840
the Dave's supermarket.

1013
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,820
That was a good band, too.

1014
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,260
And they had a song

1015
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,120
called Cheap Heroin

1016
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,700
that mentioned that

1017
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,200
they bought it

1018
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,780
at a supermarket

1019
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,240
and the supermarket

1020
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,180
in question was

1021
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,020
the Dave's grocery store

1022
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,700
that is now relocating.

1023
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,120
Okay.

1024
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,260
The Easter Monkeys, yes.

1025
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:54,960
Yeah.

1026
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,380
So, I guess back

1027
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,300
in the early 80s

1028
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,820
people sold heroin there.

1029
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,380
Actually, they probably

1030
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,040
sell it there now.

1031
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,420
That's funny.

1032
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,400
I've done drugs

1033
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,160
you've never heard of

1034
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,140
and I've never even seen heroin.

1035
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,100
That's Charlie Ditto's band.

1036
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:07,820
Yeah.

1037
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,220
That's one of Charlie Ditto's

1038
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,960
early bands,

1039
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,980
the Easter Monkeys.

1040
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
I bet Keith knows

1041
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,480
more about them than I do.

1042
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,240
A little bit.

1043
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,520
Probably more than you,

1044
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,160
but probably not

1045
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,080
nearly as much

1046
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,640
as other people.

1047
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,340
Mm-hmm.

1048
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,560
It's a band

1049
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,160
I only know about.

1050
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,520
That was your brother's.

1051
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,620
We have Charlie Ditto's

1052
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,880
fingerless gloves.

1053
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,160
No.

1054
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,980
We don't?

1055
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,580
We throw them away.

1056
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,700
We throw them away?

1057
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,180
Yes.

1058
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,860
He left his

1059
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,980
worn-out gloves

1060
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,580
at our house

1061
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,800
after we hired him

1062
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,240
to paint our garage.

1063
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,720
Oh, no.

1064
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,000
He did a new roof

1065
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,480
That's right.

1066
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,340
He put a roof on it.

1067
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,020
He didn't paint it.

1068
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,580
Somebody else painted it.

1069
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,780
He put a roof on it.

1070
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,600
Roofing is a difficult job

1071
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,260
and he did a beautiful job at it.

1072
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,340
He was playing

1073
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,920
punk bass the whole time.

1074
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,140
He was slinging shingles

1075
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,100
and hammering them down

1076
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,480
while playing punk bass.

1077
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:52,500


1078
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:52,500


1079
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:52,500


1080
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,440
I like to take roofies

1081
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
before I do roofing.

1082
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:56,740
Yeah.

1083
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,760
Well, that's because

1084
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,140
you're part of generation.

1085
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,900
You're a millennial

1086
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,580
transgression.

1087
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,320
You know what?

1088
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:05,960
I'm technically

1089
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,840
not a millennial.

1090
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,500
Well, I know,

1091
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,520
but you're still

1092
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,520
I'm a little too old.

1093
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,980
You're a millennial.

1094
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,820
Yes, you are a little

1095
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,960
like only eight years too old,

1096
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,480
but still.

1097
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,600
What do you do

1098
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,580
before you do roofing?

1099
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,280
Roofies.

1100
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:20,960
Roofies.

1101
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,240
Roofies before roofing.

1102
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:22,720
Mm-hmm.

1103
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,060
Actually, I think

1104
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,220
most of the roofers

1105
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,400
are Adderall.

1106
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:27,980
Probably.

1107
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,580
That's where I need to go

1108
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,220
is just ask the roofer.

1109
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,020
The only time I ever took Adderall,

1110
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,020
I was a freshman in college

1111
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,240
and the dorm I was staying at,

1112
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,180
this kid was prescribed Adderall

1113
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,740
for his ADHD

1114
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,960
and he wouldn't take it

1115
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,700
because it made him tired,

1116
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,360
which is a sign

1117
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,420
that he probably needed it.

1118
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
So, yeah, he would gladly sell it

1119
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,060
to anybody who wanted it.

1120
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,100
And I had been slacking.

1121
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,240
People tell me I'm a smart guy,

1122
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,080
but let me tell you something.

1123
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,860
I've taken three or four math classes

1124
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,440
in college

1125
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,280
before I finally dropped out.

1126
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,240
I have failed.

1127
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,020
I've gotten an F

1128
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,300
in every single math course

1129
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,420
I've ever taken in college.

1130
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,120
Well, you know...

1131
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,420
Yikes.

1132
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,020
Yeah.

1133
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,260
That's because you didn't

1134
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,300
take the Adderall, man.

1135
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,740
Well, no, I did one time.

1136
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,020
The very first college math course I took,

1137
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,020
I slacked off the entire quarter

1138
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,660
and then the day of the final,

1139
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,620
I realized that

1140
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,480
I was in deep trouble

1141
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,520
if I didn't pass the final.

1142
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,140
And so...

1143
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,100
On the day.

1144
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,260
I bought some Adderall

1145
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,700
from this guy in my dorm.

1146
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,040
What's his phone number?

1147
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,860
It's probably not even valid anymore.

1148
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,560
This was almost 20 years ago.

1149
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,720
But...

1150
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,100
So I take the Adderall

1151
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,920
and then it kicks in

1152
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,560
and I start just doing

1153
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,840
all the homework problems

1154
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,640
in the math book

1155
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,060
from I started chapter one

1156
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,860
and I get all the way through it

1157
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,080
and I'm like,

1158
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,920
yeah, all right, math.

1159
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,740
Yeah, math.

1160
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,420
Yes!

1161
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:51,760
Math!

1162
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,520
Yes!

1163
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:52,920
Yes!

1164
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,240
I get it!

1165
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,700
I get it!

1166
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:53,960
Yes!

1167
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,400
Math!

1168
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,920
You don't have to take

1169
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,220
the whole Adderall.

1170
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,400
And I got all the way through it

1171
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,500
right up until the last chapter

1172
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,940
and I seriously did

1173
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,020
every single practice problem

1174
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,880
and I got them all right.

1175
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm like, yes, I get it!

1176
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,600
I get it!

1177
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,180
I'm ready to take the final!

1178
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,360
And the Adderall was still in effect

1179
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,800
and so it was like an evening class

1180
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,880
so I went to the class

1181
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,540
to take the final.

1182
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,460
I didn't get to the last chapter

1183
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,700
but I figured, okay,

1184
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,400
I got everything but the last chapter.

1185
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:20,880
Oh, no.

1186
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,300
The final was all on the last chapter.

1187
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:23,840
Oh, no.

1188
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,220
And I'm sitting there

1189
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,280
taking the test

1190
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,640
with the Adderall still in me

1191
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,500
going, math!

1192
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,080
Yes!

1193
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:29,780
Math!

1194
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,280
Yes!

1195
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,580
Math!

1196
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,060
No!

1197
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,080
Math!

1198
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,640
No!

1199
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,600
So, yeah, that was the first

1200
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,780
and last time I ever took Adderall.

1201
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,240
A little mouse speech

1202
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,120
in the maze, too.

1203
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,240
I love tales of self-inflicted wounds

1204
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,840
like that.

1205
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,560
I've had so many similar instances.

1206
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,820
One time I saved up

1207
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,340
5,000 U.S. American dollars

1208
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,860
for a test.

1209
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,580
So I could go to a delicatessen

1210
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,180
that I always dreamed I would go to

1211
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,820
if I was rich and stuff like that

1212
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,100
because I was almost a street person.

1213
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,420
When you are rich,

1214
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,600
you don't go to the delicatessen.

1215
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,060
The delicatessen comes to you.

1216
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,260
Right.

1217
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,480
In the form of a dumpster box.

1218
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,280
In the back with an opening

1219
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,720
that says,

1220
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,880
Pick up on Tuesday.

1221
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,600
Ah, the life of the U.S.

1222
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,700
Bossman didn't...

1223
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,600
Rick...

1224
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,120
Rick...

1225
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,760
Rick...

1226
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,180
Rick...

1227
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,860
Rick...

1228
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,000
Rick...

1229
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,240
Rick...

1230
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,240


1231
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,140
Rick...

1232
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,960
Rick...

1233
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,520
Rick...

1234
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:22,540
Rick...

1235
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,100


1236
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,260
I have no idea who was doing that.

1237
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,200
Sure, Dave.

1238
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,820
When it wasn't lonesome cowboy Dave,

1239
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,320
I can tell you that much.

1240
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,020
And how does this make you feel?

1241
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:42,860
It was like a voodoo loa.

1242
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
You know, like El Candoor

1243
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,160
or Django.

1244
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,720
Or any of those, you know,

1245
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,060
Speed Lieutenant, you know, the airplane pilots.

1246
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,120
I've forgotten the names of a lot of those voodoo saints.

1247
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,040
But they're very colorful.

1248
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:08,460
How come nobody's done a cartoon or a comic book about the voodoo?

1249
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,000
You know, those weird character saints that go with voodoo.

1250
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,160
I just saw somebody did a tarot set of those.

1251
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,500
Somebody at Starwood.

1252
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,480
Taliesin showed me.

1253
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,240
I remember a really bad joke about a voodoo dildo.

1254
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,120
Go ahead.

1255
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,480
I need to bone up on my voodoo.

1256
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,020
Bone up right after dildo?

1257
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,760
Really, dear?

1258
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,260
Yeah.

1259
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,220
I don't get the connection at all.

1260
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,780
I bet you don't.

1261
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,220
I don't.

1262
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,500
No.

1263
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,100
I wouldn't imagine you would.

1264
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,940
You're too innocent.

1265
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,440
The old guy used to call him a corn sucker.

1266
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:43,820
Right.

1267
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,520
It's waifu.

1268
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,120
Right.

1269
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:45,860
Waifu.

1270
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,700
If you had the same idea as he did, you'd be in prison right now or in a mental institution.

1271
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,520
How do I know I'm not?

1272
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,180
How do you know you're not in a mental institution?

1273
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,380
In prison, in a mental institution.

1274
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,620
You are at this current moment in a prison, in a mental institution.

1275
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,000
Now, the problem we've got with a lot of the people here, a lot of the inmates,

1276
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,120
is they really, really don't understand their position in the dichotomy.

1277
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,720
The long-handed spaces in between.

1278
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,780
And so they think they're at some sort of assisted facility where living is everything.

1279
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,500
And bohemian behaviors-

1280
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:34,880
Well, they are at an assisted living facility for people who hallucinate that they're on

1281
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,800
a college radio station.

1282
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,580
Yes.

1283
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,000
It's a very common delusion.

1284
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,140
You see these homeless people shuffling around in the streets.

1285
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,140


1286
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,140


1287
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,940
Shuffling along, muttering to themselves, saying things like, you're listening to

1288
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,100
WCSB.

1289
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,540
WCSB Cleveland.

1290
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,180
Cleveland.

1291
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:53,900
Yeah.

1292
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,640
And they're, you know, eventually they get taken in and locked up.

1293
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:06,040
There's rooms full of people saying, you know, portions of the following broadcast may be

1294
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,080
objectable, mumbling.

1295
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,920
Yeah.

1296
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,280
Hard on the tooth too.

1297
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,740
The really bad ones sound like the hour of slack.

1298
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,900
Yeah.

1299
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,120
Yeah.

1300
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,120


1301
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,120


1302
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,120


1303
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,120


1304
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,120


1305
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,980
The quick, strong, lonesome cowboy Dave as the mumbling crazy guy.

1306
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,880
As well as the scum's behavior of the ancient ones.

1307
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,640
Well, it wasn't my fault.

1308
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,620
It was all politics.

1309
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,560
You know what I mean, Stan?

1310
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,960
You know what I mean, Dr. Sinister?

1311
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,140
Everyone's blaming politics these days for all their problems.

1312
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:41,540
Yes.

1313
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,640
Well, shouldn't they righteously do so, though?

1314
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,500
I mean, really, when you think about it.

1315
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,100
I mean, I think it's a good thing.

1316
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,100


1317
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,100


1318
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,100


1319
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,100


1320
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,100


1321
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,660
Everybody does have an axe to grind.

1322
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,460
Some of them don't have too many of them.

1323
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,220
Yeah, well.

1324
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,960
You know, like, if you're born with eight foreskins and three handles, you're not going

1325
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,820
to get around, like, you know, lolly the trolley or something.

1326
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,180
We inherited two axes.

1327
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,500
We need to get rid of one of them unless we're both going to use them.

1328
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,460
Hey, Princess Freya.

1329
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,000
See, the thing is, I might be the only guy who does not have an axe to grind because

1330
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,120
I spent all my youth.

1331
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,480
Let's get him.

1332
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,980
I spent all my youth grinding.

1333
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,600
My axe.

1334
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,700
You did not just ask me that.

1335
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,860
You did not.

1336
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,780
I spent all my youth grinding my axe and it's as sharp as it's going to get.

1337
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,420
And then I finally just gave up and stopped caring about things.

1338
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,680
But I still have that axe.

1339
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,420
And it is pre-ground.

1340
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,440
Yeah, I understand that.

1341
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:33,900
If you wanted to.

1342
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,300
It's up to you.

1343
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,120
If you decide one of these days you're done with your not grinding ways and that you become

1344
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,940
a peaceful platnick, you can just grab that axe and grind it.

1345
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,060
I won't have to grind it until I have to use it.

1346
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,040
I've never had to use it.

1347
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,400
Exactly.

1348
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:49,940
But it's ready.

1349
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,300
I used to keep my axe real sharp and I used it every chance I got.

1350
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,220
Now it's just this rusty old thing.

1351
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:01,040
I might be lucky if I've rubbed something to pieces with it.

1352
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:07,740
A lot of times a bunch of handle is missing and it looks like it's about ready to fall

1353
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,720
down past where the, you know, where everything would be.

1354
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,240
We might rub this log in half.

1355
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,460
No, man.

1356
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,040
I might just go up and pick a new one.

1357
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:29,240
Well, you were busy grinding your axe.

1358
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,240
I studied the blade.

1359
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,680
Oh, wow, man.

1360
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,420
That is so succinct and so sublime.

1361
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,120
It reminds me of that.

1362
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,300
Could you repeat that?

1363
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,800
No, I never had to use the axe.

1364
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,280
I just handed it to her.

1365
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:52,220
Whenever I had to cut down a tree, I would just hand the axe to a subgenius and say,

1366
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,500
Now, don't cut down that tree!

1367
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,120
Whatever you do with this axe, don't cut down that tree!

1368
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,280
And about five minutes later, they'd come back to me going,

1369
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,880
You did tell me to cut that tree down, right?

1370
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,500
Right. It sounds like Tales of Huckleberry Dingleberry or Tom Sheridan or whatever his name was.

1371
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,220
Yeah, but that really is how it works.

1372
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,580
That's how you get things done in churches, subgenius.

1373
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,460
Hand them a pencil and a tape deck and say,

1374
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,960
Don't come up with a book!

1375
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,280
Don't start a radio show!

1376
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,620
Whatever you do.

1377
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,340
Don't whitewash this fence.

1378
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,700
Whatever you do, don't rub the Buddha's belly.

1379
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,960
Don't you dare throw me in that briar patch.

1380
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,520
Don't give me any of that Adderall.

1381
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,200
Dang, sounds fixated a little bit.

1382
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,740
I'm sleepy.

1383
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,100
Doesn't he? Doesn't he?

1384
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,060
I'm tired, man.

1385
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:54,220
I've been packing books, fudge, all kinds of stuff all day.

1386
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,320
Packing a mean one.

1387
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:03,520
I really honestly did pack all of the fiction paperbacks that I own into nine cubic foot boxes.

1388
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,580
You know, you didn't have to dirty that statement with saying that you packed fudge.

1389
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,560
What you did was honorable.

1390
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,800
Look, we're working on our kitchen, too.

1391
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:19,760
I packed rice, fudge, dry beans.

1392
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,580
We packed all kinds of stuff.

1393
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,180
I don't get these.

1394
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,680
I know.

1395
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,860
They have to assign these, you know.

1396
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,820
Dirty stuff.

1397
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,380
It's all dirty stuff.

1398
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,700
Seeming underbelly things, yes.

1399
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,940
I think it's sexist.

1400
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,980
Yeah, I think it's paramilitary on the very least.

1401
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,420
That's assault.

1402
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,260
I'm triggered.

1403
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,980
I can't do my job anymore.

1404
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,400
I'm going to have to sue you now.

1405
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,340
Did you ever have tomato popcorn soup?

1406
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,180
You made my...

1407
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:49,520
It's a solvent.

1408
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,040
It's made of human beings.

1409
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,080
Tomato popcorn soup?

1410
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,680
I thought my mother invented that.

1411
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:55,920
What?

1412
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,820
Swirling cream, right?

1413
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,900
You put popcorn in tomato soup?

1414
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,440
Yes, my mother invented eating cream of tomato soup with popcorn.

1415
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,260
Yes, that was her invention.

1416
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,200
Popcorn in the soup?

1417
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,180
Yes, toss the popcorn in like crackers.

1418
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,280
Sort of, it does, but it's good.

1419
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:12,780
It's fun.

1420
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,080
Yeah, I took to putting...

1421
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:14,960
She can handle popcorn.

1422
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,220
I took to putting ketchup on popcorn for some years.

1423
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,840
And it would, in fact, make the popcorn mushy.

1424
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,200
That sounds really disgusting.

1425
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,660
I also used to deliberately let my Captain Crunch soak in the milk for 20 minutes.

1426
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,180
Oh, that's so disgusting.

1427
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,800
So that it turned into...

1428
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,740
You and your cereal mush.

1429
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,720
If you don't do that, it tears up the roof of your mouth.

1430
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,460
You're no kidding.

1431
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:35,860
Exactly.

1432
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,680
That stuff's made of spun glass.

1433
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,220
Captain Crunch can really cut you up if you don't soften it up.

1434
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,100
I'm surprised there hasn't been a class action lawsuit against the maker.

1435
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,960
In Great Britain, this is really true.

1436
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,440
Mr. Crunch to the stand.

1437
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,980
He's not even a real captain if you look at his uniform.

1438
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,500
I can't remember exactly what rank he is, but it's definitely a rank below a captain if you look at the insignias on his uniform.

1439
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,340
Completely false credentials.

1440
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah.

1441
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,740
Stolen valor.

1442
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,420
Did anybody ever hear of his habit when he was in the British Empire of drinking coffee with ketchup in it?

1443
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,200
Next they're going to tell me there's no Chef Boyardee.

1444
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,480
He's just a character on a label.

1445
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,200
Actually, there's...

1446
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,140
There was a Chef Boyardee, and he was from Cleveland.

1447
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,060
Oh, really?

1448
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:17,620
Yes.

1449
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,040
Chef Boyardee did land here on the wrong boat.

1450
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,640
What kind of a name is Boyardee?

1451
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,100
It sounds like a Weard-o.

1452
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,140
It was Boyardee.

1453
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:28,900
Boyardee.

1454
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,260
It's B-U-O-R-D-E.

1455
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,060
B-U-O-A-R-D-E.

1456
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:44,080
I used to eat a lot of Sylvia's canned southern cooking before they made me.

1457
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,820
If you stop eating sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-salt.

1458
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,720
Salty canned things.

1459
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:50,980
Yeah.

1460
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,240
I wonder if Syl- I believe that Sylvia is real.

1461
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:56,720
Yeah.

1462
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,220
Yeah, she is.

1463
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,060
Well, Sylvia is real.

1464
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,240
As real as in your mind and your heart you don't want her to be.

1465
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,180
Sylvia Israel or Sylvia Palestine?

1466
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,620
And there's a little bit of her in every can.

1467
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,940
Yeah, that's the one I'm talking about.

1468
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,280
The creationism one.

1469
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,680
The one who knows to make turnip greens with actual real human beans.

1470
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,180
Yeah.

1471
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,000
Human beans

1472
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,740
Human beans

1473
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,720
Human beans and rice

1474
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,920
Yeah sure whatever

1475
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,820
I didn't really mean that because

1476
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,660
I fell asleep but I woke up in the middle

1477
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,200
Of a fitful distraught dream

1478
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,140
You know I am a dyed in the wool Yankee

1479
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,320
But I do enjoy turnip greens

1480
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,980
Mustard greens, collard greens

1481
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,040
I will make them myself

1482
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,580
That's a good eating

1483
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,060
Me too

1484
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,920
I enjoy this social

1485
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,300
Food that is very very

1486
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,540
Reliable to me

1487
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,760
But nothing

1488
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,960
Is better than taking an old fashioned

1489
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,800
Bowling bag into your local

1490
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,760
Supermarket and just start beating people

1491
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,820
Over the head until the police come and shoot you

1492
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,960
That's even better

1493
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,680
That's one way to go

1494
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,600
When I was growing up I thought that

1495
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,760
Soul food, I didn't even start hearing

1496
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,900
That phrase until maybe the 70's

1497
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,920
And I

1498
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,540
Thought it was some kind of exotic thing

1499
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,440
That black people

1500
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,100
Ate and I didn't know what

1501
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,560
Was a good example of soul food

1502
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,080
Finally

1503
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,580
After I moved to Cleveland

1504
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,900
I learned

1505
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,600
That soul food was

1506
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,640
In fact exactly what

1507
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,560
I had been eating most of my

1508
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,380
Life, my father is from

1509
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,640
South Carolina and learned

1510
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,460
His cooking from

1511
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,200
The family maid

1512
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,640
And taught it to

1513
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,260
My mom who also

1514
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,200
Then taught it to me and actually Joy

1515
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,740
Of cooking is full of that

1516
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,220
The same

1517
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,160
The same recipe so it was

1518
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,940
I grew up thinking it was called

1519
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,400
Southern cooking

1520
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,420
Because I came from

1521
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,880
People who did not believe

1522
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,840
That there even was a soul

1523
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,240
That's how white my

1524
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,440
Family is, they don't even believe in souls

1525
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,100
You know how white my high school

1526
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,100
Class was? How white were they?

1527
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,080
I graduated from high school in 1999

1528
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,300
And guess what song was not our class song

1529
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:09,680
What song?

1530
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:11,580
1999

1531
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,060
By Prince, yeah

1532
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,000
That was not our class song

1533
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,600
Wow, that's white

1534
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,940
That's really white

1535
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,840
Ha ha ha

1536
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,120
Why, why, that's very

1537
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:23,880
Silly too

1538
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,300
It's not stupid

1539
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,180
Somehow

1540
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,600
But I look down on myself in shame

1541
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,100
You know I look past the cross bars

1542
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,640
And the clavichords and the

1543
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,040
Collar bones and all the

1544
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,140
Other things that we're forced to eat that remind us

1545
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,620
Of chicken pie and I think to myself

1546
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,300
What a wonderful land

1547
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,880
This America is, our home

1548
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,240
Our native land, oh yes

1549
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,600
Then I sit down in my chair

1550
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,420
For a short while

1551
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,200
Eat some thunderhood pie and start crying

1552
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,080
Like a baby

1553
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,680
And I just want to shoot everything in sight

1554
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,000
For some reason, but I don't know what I'd shoot

1555
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,280
Them with because I'm non-violent

1556
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,500
That's because you're an American Dave

1557
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,220
You'd want to kill to make America great

1558
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:06,980
Yeah

1559
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,700
Kill, kill for the love of killing

1560
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,180
Kill for fun, kill for the love of killing

1561
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,700
Kill to stay free, kill to make America great

1562
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,760
What's a thunderhood pie?

1563
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,980
Kill for Jesus

1564
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,400
Kill for Kali, kill for Bob

1565
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Kill for Jesus

1566
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,860
Kill for fun, kill for Jesus

1567
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,980
What's a thunderhood pie?

1568
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,760
Kill to make America great

1569
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,000
Kill, kill, kill for peace

1570
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,340
Oh I left off the again

1571
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,840
That's very important

1572
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,560
Kill, kill, kill for peace

1573
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,580
Near and far and Middle East

1574
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,080
What's so funny

1575
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,820
About peace, love and understanding

1576
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,240
Oh I left off the again

1577
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:42,900
About peace, love and understanding

1578
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,380
What's so funny about it

1579
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,260
The fact that Elvis Costello was singing that

1580
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,000
That was written as a sarcastic

1581
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,880
Mean song

1582
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,780
Meant to be sung in a

1583
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,940
Simpering folk music way

1584
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,780
And Elvis Costello

1585
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,700
Looked at it and went

1586
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,440
Actually this would be a really good song

1587
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,480
If you do it sincerely punk style

1588
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,780
So he took something that was written to be

1589
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,500
Smarmy and cloying

1590
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,360
And triacly

1591
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,680
And by changing the beat

1592
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,580
To its opposite

1593
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,840
He made it into quite an anthem

1594
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,140
He made it into quite an anthem

1595
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:21,940
I never liked his words

1596
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,660
Well you said triacly

1597
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,660
I actually can

1598
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:29,240
I know all the lyrics to his first three albums

1599
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,620
I know all the lyrics to his first three albums

1600
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,640
I know Elvis real well

1601
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:32,820
I know Elvis real well

1602
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,660
Both Elvis's

1603
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,840
He's waiting for the end of the world

1604
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,500
Waiting through the end of the world

1605
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,680
Waiting through the end of the world

1606
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,020
Waiting through the end of the world

1607
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:42,520
Waiting for an important distinction

1608
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,020
With the whole

1609
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:50,040
I never thought

1610
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,060
They'd put me in the

1611
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,100
Their

1612
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,220
The

1613
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:54,820
And

1614
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,160
The

1615
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,460
The

1616
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,500
Gainsquiiiiid

1617
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,140
I never

1618
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:03,560
Thought

1619
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,260
They'd put

1620
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:04,260


1621
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:04,320
Thought

1622
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,420
That was all he was good for was three albums,

1623
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,000
and he became a Cole Porter gesture,

1624
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,380
gesticulator, you know,

1625
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,760
one of those old-fashioned guys with a big hat, you know?

1626
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,420
And, like, Joe Jackson kind of went in that direction,

1627
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,140
but he was more successful at it.

1628
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,020
I think the greatest work that Joe Jackson ever did...

1629
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,500
The greatest work that Joe Jackson ever did

1630
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,640
was his duet with William Shatner

1631
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,660
covering Common People by Paul.

1632
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,140
Yes.

1633
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,660
Oh, I just remembered something from my past

1634
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,020
that was impressive to me at the time.

1635
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,240
I've got a magazine article that mentions...

1636
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,660
It was about Elvis Costello and the Attractions,

1637
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,360
the other fellows in the band,

1638
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,720
and it mentioned that one of the Attractions

1639
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,940
was reading something called The Book of the Subgenius.

1640
00:55:59,240 --> 00:55:59,820
Oh, wow.

1641
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,000
Get out of here.

1642
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,640
Well, that would be...

1643
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,240
No, think about it.

1644
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,760
That would have been 1983

1645
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,340
when Book of the Subgenius was very first published.

1646
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,060
In 83 and 84,

1647
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,020
we were the coolest thing in San Francisco

1648
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,560
for about one month.

1649
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,400
Then it's San Francisco,

1650
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,200
so, of course, it moves on to something else.

1651
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,560
But we...

1652
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,860
Fickle, fickle San Francisco.

1653
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,520
There was a time when people go,

1654
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,740
oh, yeah, Bob Dobbs.

1655
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,860
I know who he is.

1656
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,720
I'm scared.

1657
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,780
I'm scared.

1658
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,340
Oh, nowadays,

1659
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,220
only the finest minds and the coolest people

1660
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,900
have any inkling

1661
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,240
who that man J.R. Bob Dobbs truly is.

1662
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,720
And perhaps it's for the best

1663
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,580
because, as Jesus said,

1664
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,740
do not try to convert the pinks

1665
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,360
because they will get it all completely wrong.

1666
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,740
As Jesus said on the cross,

1667
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,700
do not try to get it all.

1668
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,980
That's not one of the ones...

1669
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:00,980


1670
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,740
That's the ones that preachers quote a whole lot.

1671
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:04,960
Strangely enough.

1672
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,660
Do not do this at home.

1673
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,160
Yeah, it basically says,

1674
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,120
don't try to make everybody a Christian.

1675
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,660
They'll get it completely backwards.

1676
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,220
And, you know, don't...

1677
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,220
Jesus said that.

1678
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:14,880
Don't...

1679
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,060
Except there wasn't really a Jesus,

1680
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,060
but somebody put the words in...

1681
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,440
The same guy that wrote most of Bob's stuff

1682
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,000
put that stuff in the mouth of a character,

1683
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,540
a common archetypal

1684
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:30,080
and a rich doctor character of the times.

1685
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:30,980
But Bob...

1686
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,520
Beware of those who pray on the street corner very loudly.

1687
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,460
When you want to pray, you must go into a closet.

1688
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,340
Keep your prayers in the closet.

1689
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,480
That's what Jesus said.

1690
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:43,620
1138.

1691
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:45,840
Andre prayed.

1692
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:46,880
Do you remember that?

1693
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,820
I was praying last night when an angel broke the light.

1694
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:55,300
Said, gonna have to put you on hold for a time.

1695
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,280
I said, hold like hell.

1696
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,240
Let me talk to the boss.

1697
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,700
Said, sorry, sucker.

1698
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,120
Sinner, it's the boss's day off.

1699
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,960
I realized then that the wages of sin was...

1700
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,380
Two bucks an hour.

1701
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,340
All the nails you can bend.

1702
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,060
So I still have a memory for some things.

1703
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,860
For some things that you learned long ago.

1704
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,240
I like the story about how...

1705
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,640
It's in the cusp of the moon.

1706
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,380
You have to be in a certain biological framework.

1707
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,940
Like if your mother, say, was born in 1978,

1708
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,120
or 72 or something like that,

1709
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,400
that means her estrogen cycle is similar to that of a chimp.

1710
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,440
And she has a hard time making her way around the room.

1711
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,540
Unless her son has bowel disorders too.

1712
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,640
And she's scratchy and itchy too.

1713
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,600
And she just beat up the warden and the zookeeper

1714
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,620
at the same time by crunching their heads together.

1715
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:58,160
Oh, that's what I wanted to hear.

1716
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,740
Soviet imperialism.

1717
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,260
Everybody's got a favorite monkey.

1718
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,120
Everybody's got something to hide except for me and my monkey.

1719
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,880
Chimpanzees are not monkeys, Dave.

1720
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,200
But figuratively, not metaphorically,

1721
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,380
but of course universally and socialistically...

1722
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,940
Every subgenius in the room starts talking about the monkeys

1723
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,320
at the beginning of 2001.

1724
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,160
What do you want them to say?

1725
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,220
Call them primates or something?

1726
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,820
If Hal or me says,

1727
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:30,960
chimpanzees aren't monkeys,

1728
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:30,960


1729
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:30,960


1730
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:30,960


1731
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,100
puzzling evidence and phylo will use the word monkey

1732
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,640
specifically to cover chimpanzees for the rest of the hour.

1733
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,020
You know, obviously there is a difference between a monkey and an ape.

1734
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:43,940
We all know this.

1735
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,220
We all know this.

1736
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,060
But...

1737
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,000
We do?

1738
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,320
It is so much more fun to say the word monkey.

1739
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:50,960
It is.

1740
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,560
It is.

1741
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,000
And it's like, I understand.

1742
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,540
Griping about that is like going...

1743
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,540
It's actually...

1744
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,940
The name of the monster is Frankenstein's monkey.

1745
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,340
It's a monster.

1746
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:04,460
Frankenstein is the name of the doctor who made the monster.

1747
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,520
Even I got tired of that after a while.

1748
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,400
Go on.

1749
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,480
No, the monster is Frankenstein.

1750
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:10,880
Give up.

1751
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,720
Everybody knows what I'm talking about.

1752
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,440
Obviously, the monster took the same name as his father.

1753
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,160
Right?

1754
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,560
So obviously, the monster is Frankenstein.

1755
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,380
It's Frankenstein Jr., but...

1756
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,520
Frederick Frankenstein Jr.

1757
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,660
Oh, you know how the imperialist mind works.

1758
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,200
Once they...

1759
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:26,880
Frederick?

1760
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:28,960
Yeah.

1761
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,580
DeCoursey Frankenstein.

1762
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:30,800
DeCoursey Frankenstein.

1763
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:30,920
DeCoursey Frankenstein.

1764
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:30,920


1765
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:30,920


1766
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:31,120
DeCoursey Frankenstein.

1767
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:32,900
DeCoursey Frankenstein.

1768
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:36,280
Well, I'm not associated with them anymore.

1769
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,420
They used to have a bowling league in Maple Heights.

1770
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,180
And they actually were involved in some human dope traffic.

1771
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,140
I forget what it's called.

1772
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,440
Stupidity or something.

1773
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,840
That was good stuff.

1774
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,300
Can you get stupidity?

1775
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,820
Oh, can I get it?

1776
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:53,580
I've got it already.

1777
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,920
I can get three or four...

1778
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,060
Well, we probably shouldn't talk about this on the radio,

1779
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,300
but, man, I've been...

1780
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,820
I've heard stupidity.

1781
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,420
I've heard stupidity just makes you feel so much better.

1782
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,820
It makes you feel better than everybody else.

1783
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,260
And it makes you feel so smart.

1784
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,660
These guys that are on stupidity...

1785
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,520
Speaking of...

1786
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,860
...that get really, really stupid,

1787
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,660
they're the ones that say they're the smartest of all.

1788
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,960
They're the opposite of subgeniuses in every way.

1789
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,420
Don't have that.

1790
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,100
Speaking of stupidity,

1791
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,800
you're listening to WCSB Cleveland.

1792
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,280
I'm...

1793
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,260
I knew that one was coming.

1794
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,620
Portions of the following broadcast

1795
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,340
will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

1796
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,400
Therefore, WCSB advises the listener discretion.

1797
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,140
The views and opinions expressed on this program

1798
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,680
are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University

1799
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,280
or anybody with their head screwed on straight.

1800
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,600
For that matter, you have been warned.

1801
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,400
I'm Dr. Sinister, and this is Synesthesia.

1802
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,300
We have our special guests,

1803
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,720
Reverend Ivan Stang and Princess Wee Ardo,

1804
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,140
and, of course, Keith here with us as well in the studio.

1805
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,840
216-687-3515 is the number to call.

1806
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,640
We're going to take a short break.

1807
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,760
You mentioned me again,

1808
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,220
so I guess I'm just going to...

1809
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:04,140
Oh, Dave, your presence goes without...

1810
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,260
Mentioning that Lonesome Cowboy Dave is here

1811
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,440
is like mentioning that there is air around us.

1812
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,440
Like, of course you're here.

1813
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:17,080
Right, and we plugged your food supermarket chain like crazy.

1814
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:19,260
We just got done doing that,

1815
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,880
but I still haven't seen any difference

1816
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,280
in my overall capability.

1817
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,200
Dave, you are the oral fabric upon which we stand.

1818
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,220
Your power grows by the minute, sir.

1819
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,120
And speaking of which,

1820
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,500
we're going to take a couple of minutes here.

1821
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,920
The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life.

1822
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,420
We're going to take just a couple of minutes here

1823
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,120
to pause here for some public service announcements,

1824
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,820
and don't touch that dial.
