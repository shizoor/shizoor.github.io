1
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,620
Thank you.

2
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:12,440
Thank you.

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,360
Cyber chump in the background here, the construction of things.

4
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,940
And normally here in Cleveland, you'd be listening to radio synesthesia.

5
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:49,560
But the bad Dr. Sinister, well, he ran into a little tiny bit of a trouble.

6
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,200
Well, he didn't run into anything, but somebody ran into him.

7
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,600
Yeah, somebody ran into him, so he won't be here tonight.

8
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,560
And so instead of radio synesthesia,

9
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm afraid you get yet another hour of slack.

10
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,620
A spare hour of slack, dear friends.

11
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,760
And you know what that means.

12
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,400
No, I don't know either.

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,240
But I do have some interesting music lined up.

14
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:28,020
And then we'll probably have some more lonesome cowboy man calling in at some point.

15
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,080
In the future.

16
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,580
Char.

17
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,320
Tupperware doodle.

18
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm where you got to go.

19
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,160
Why?

20
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


21
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


22
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


23
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


24
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


25
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


26
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


27
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


28
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,160


30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,320
i sveeway face

31
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:19,500


32
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:19,500


33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:19,500


34
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:19,520
Always.

35
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,520


36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,620
Bye bye.

37
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:19,840
Dany.

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,300
Andi.

39
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:20,940
Bye.

40
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:20,960
Kevin.

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,840
PETER.

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,000
Bye.

43
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,420
Everybody.

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:27,940
Bye.

45
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,380
Thank you.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,600
Thank you.

47
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,320
Thank you.

48
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,780
Thank you.

49
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Thank you.

50
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,940
Thank you.

51
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,320
Thank you.

52
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,740
Thank you.

53
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,640
Thank you.

54
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,660
Thank you.

55
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,840
Thank you.

56
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,440
Thank you.

57
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,020
Thank you.

58
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,720
Thank you.

59
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,160
Thank you.

60
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,760
Thank you.

61
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,200
Thank you.

62
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,560
Said, Mother, you're one man that I love to read

63
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,060
Well, I'm gonna get high

64
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm gonna get high just till you show my name

65
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,940
Well, you know I'm gonna get so high this morning

66
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,960
It's going to be a crying shame

67
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,520
Well, you know I'm gonna stick with my reform

68
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,220
I ain't gonna be messing around with no cocaine

69
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:56,560
I ain't gonna be messing around with no cocaine

70
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,460
And I don't even know what I'm saying

71
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,300
The way I talk, you think I was dead

72
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,740
And I can't even piss in a straight line

73
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,520
And I can't even wipe my own ass

74
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,660
If you want me to try and think some

75
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,240
Well, I'm sorry, I think that I'll pass

76
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,020
Cause I'm so dumb, I can't believe

77
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,000
The shit that I say

78
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,060
The shit that I can do

79
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,260
There's nothing here between my ears

80
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,200
For years and years

81
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,240
But a couple of ears

82
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,660
Well, I think that my food is dried up

83
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,220
But I don't know who I should blame

84
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,460
Cause I can't even think of nothing

85
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,060
And my whole life's been much the same

86
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,460
Got my needles here beside me

87
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,240
And my pants are covered with piss

88
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,500
But my feet don't ask about that

89
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,260
Cause my life's too hard as it is

90
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,700
Cause I'm so dumb, I can't believe

91
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,860
The shit that I can't do

92
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,920
There's nothing here between my ears

93
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,840
For years and years

94
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm so dumb, I can't believe

95
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,820
The shit that I can't do

96
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,120
Cause I don't know who I should blame

97
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,100
Cause I can't believe

98
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,200
The shit that I can't do

99
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,340
Gotta get it done

100
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,360
Never does that happen

101
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,640
And never does that happen

102
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,340
Well, I'm sorry, I think that I'll pass

103
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,740
Cause I think that I'll pass

104
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,580
So if you come home and available

105
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:52,780
And you want a few 5 cents

106
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,980
I'm willing to pay $100 and everything

107
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,440
Thank you.

108
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,580
Thank you.

109
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,200
Thank you.

110
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Thank you.

111
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,460
Thank you.

112
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,780
Thank you.

113
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,440
Thank you.

114
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,240
Thank you.

115
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,660
Thank you.

116
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,940
Thank you.

117
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,900
Thank you.

118
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,980
Thank you.

119
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Thank you.

120
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,120
Thank you.

121
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,260
Thank you.

122
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,960
Thank you.

123
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,060
Thank you.

124
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,100
Thank you.

125
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,220
Fit

126
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,480
did

127
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,520
ink

128
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,120
how

129
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,580
the

130
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:47,880
there

131
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,080
there

132
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,920
the

133
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,340
thing

134
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:57,960
that

135
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,480
He won't be having any more puppies.

136
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm having the immortality implant placed in my, you know, my cerebral clavicle.

137
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,220
Aren't you even least considering the ideas?

138
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Because so many of tomorrow's nowadays people will be forced to live in assisted living quarters somewhere near the outside of town where the wolves howl.

139
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
And where the weirds party.

140
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,360
Yeah, like dancing in their nightclub uniforms and their pretty blue underpants.

141
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,120
I just read the weirds party section from Neighbor World waiting for you to call in.

142
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,940
Yes, he gave a tantalizing excerpt.

143
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,440
Yeah, I've read the sexy party scene.

144
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,960
Well, I forget which part is that.

145
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,960
Could you give me a small one?

146
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,440
He gets laid with Leia.

147
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,880
Oh, where the pigs are dancing, right?

148
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,900
Yeah.

149
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,960
Yeah, pig nose, pig nose basil.

150
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,360
Yeah.

151
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,580
Yeah.

152
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,420
Yeah, I'm not sure if the music I had in the background was really appropriate, but we'll live with it.

153
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:10,960
It wasn't like real caustic subterranean, you know, like Appalachian music with a few foul words thrown in to make the exorcism.

154
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,540
No.

155
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,580
No, it wasn't.

156
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,940
No, but it is now.

157
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:25,300
I still want to, before the hour is up, I do want to run the 13-minute Lenny Bruce.

158
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,060
I'm going to run the 13-minute Lenny Bruce routine.

159
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,020
You'll want to hear that, too.

160
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:47,180
The way you're doing the pop-by-the-sailor-man music right now is to get everyone ready to get them in the right uniform and all hot and sexy to think about Lenny Bruce in his latter period before he stuck a vein into his vein and expired from constant rheumatoid arthritis of the rectum.

161
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,940
Yeah, but before we get to that stuff, we'll dance a shanty.

162
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,560
We'll dance to this fine ocean shanty with the whalers.

163
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,340
And the whalers...

164
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,600
Whale blubber, slipping and sliding on the blood and blubber.

165
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,280
Aboard the ship.

166
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,340
Ah, yes, our.

167
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,920
We're whale pirates.

168
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,060
What kind of pirate did we decide our dog was the other day?

169
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,820
This morning, we decided, damn it, our hound dog was some kind of a pirate.

170
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,760
Chicken bone pirate.

171
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,820
Chicken bone pirate.

172
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,180
He could be like a dog pirate or something, but not a whale pirate.

173
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,480
Yeah, he's a chicken bone pirate.

174
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,980
He'll...

175
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,940
We'll be walking him along.

176
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,680
He'll be in some innocuous place, and suddenly, he's trying to eat something furtively.

177
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,640
And it's all...

178
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,860
And we grab him by the jaws.

179
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,700
And I pry his jaws open.

180
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,820
Stang pries his mouth open.

181
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:46,080
I reach my hand down his throat and pull out shards of extremely sharp chicken bones that were just about to go down his throat.

182
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,960
Yeah, we're always...

183
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,280
Yeah.

184
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,380
I hate that drill.

185
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,580
I remember that.

186
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,500
That's one of the few things I do not miss about having an animal enjoy my...

187
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,260
Physical company, if you know what I mean.

188
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,380
Which is amazing how fast it has snapped up and chewed.

189
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:09,780
Well, and shattered into spiky shards that will lodge in his throat when he swallows them.

190
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:17,880
I had a Springer Spaniel long, long ago that got a bad chicken bone in his neck, and...

191
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,240
Brace yourself, folks.

192
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,280
This is a gross story.

193
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,480
I had to spend the rest of that dog's life every day poking a little metal tube...

194
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,560
into a hole in his throat and squirting disinfectant in there.

195
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,400
Because it went straight through, thanks to the chicken bone.

196
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,000
I don't ever want to have a permanent hole in a dog's neck again.

197
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:37,640
No.

198
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,540
That's a bad, bad injury to have.

199
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,600
No, it's just the idea of it.

200
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,580
It's frightening enough you didn't have to bring that up, Stan.

201
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,240
Well, I didn't want it to happen to you, Dave.

202
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,620
I know you're a chicken bone pirate yourself.

203
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,580
I know it.

204
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,840
I've seen him go for them.

205
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,020
Yeah, I've heard myself.

206
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,480
You snap them up and start crunching those bones.

207
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,660
He likes the marrow.

208
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,340
Yeah, I did just the other afternoon, as a matter of fact.

209
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,380
And I was even thinking about that.

210
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,020
Man, I'm going to puncture my throat like a dog or something.

211
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,560
Because I was just gobbling them so quickly.

212
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:14,800
And the person at the Giant Meager store, the elephant store that I was located at...

213
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,780
Giant Meager?

214
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,340
Uh-huh.

215
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,580
Giant Meager.

216
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,360
There were very few.

217
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,740
It's like David's Restaurant.

218
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,400
Uh-huh.

219
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,180
Also on the same south side of...

220
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,420
Anyway, the turnpickle.

221
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,480
The turnpickle was pointed the wrong direction for me, that's for sure.

222
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:34,280
Because when those fuzzy-y-full guardians, I guess you'd call them, came out with the clubs and the fists.

223
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,960
It was painful.

224
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,220
It was painful.

225
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,160
It was painful.

226
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,400
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

227
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,040
Mm-mm-mm.

228
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,660
Sounds painful.

229
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,400
You don't want to get involved in anything like that.

230
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,560
Especially if there's whipped cream around and they're trying to kill each other.

231
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,160
Some of these people just have bad habits.

232
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,120
You're right.

233
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,920
They're sore losers.

234
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,780
They voted for tut-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

235
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,940
And staying, like, like some of them.

236
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,800
Like, you know, in a compromising sexual way.

237
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:14,440
Only when I'm in Russia, visiting my special friends, then we have a little water party.

238
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,320
And we do some sports with the spraying.

239
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,420
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

240
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,560
Oh.

241
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,100
Oh.

242
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,560
Possible.

243
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,800
And then we sell them

244
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,480
Then we try to sell them a hotel

245
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,700
But they don't buy it

246
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,280
First we spray the spray all over the bed

247
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,440
That Obama slept in

248
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,280
And then we try to sell them a hotel

249
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,920
And they go, no, no

250
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,800
And we won't give you copies of the video

251
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,900
Which is shot either

252
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,180
Yeah, exactly

253
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,080
Just like F-Cup, it's sterile

254
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,060
And his own version of the blue underpants

255
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,380
Of Monterey Bay

256
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,880
And the exciting areas near there

257
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,480
Where all the fisticuffs used to take place

258
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,220
You just play your cards right, Mr. President

259
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:10,140
And we will make sure that you retain your power

260
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,280
And we will flood the Facebooks of the leftists

261
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,160
With the fake news that you love so much

262
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,620
Oh wait, I went from Russian to Nazi

263
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,220
I know

264
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,880
But it was such a seamless

265
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,240
Well, it wasn't really seamless

266
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,800
In fact, there was a huge lump on the side of his neck

267
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,120
It looked like a coral snake

268
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,780
Yeah, you gotta stick a tube in there

269
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,640
Disaffected

270
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,680
Squeeze it

271
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,860
Suck it

272
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,200
Suck it right out

273
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,340
You have to

274
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,440
You also have to express the oral gland

275
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,380
Or the meat will be spoiled

276
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,700
That's always one of my favorite things

277
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,640
You must get the oil of the oral gland

278
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,060
Away from the meat

279
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,580
Before you prepare

280
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,820
I don't think I want to continue this line

281
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,900
Of course of interesting information

282
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,420
Boys will be boys

283
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,200
You boys will be boys

284
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,400
I had a cat that got bit on the neck one time

285
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,480
And it puffed up and I had to squeeze that

286
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,720
And it went right in my eye

287
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,220
Oh no, Dave, no

288
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,780
That's horrifying

289
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,260
You know, when you have your little children

290
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,500
Your little male children

291
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,580
And you're changing them

292
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,220
And they pee in your eye

293
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,980
Of course

294
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,900
It's a family kind of thing

295
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,480
Oh, it's cute

296
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,860
Thank you

297
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,380
They do that once you get them completely clean

298
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,220
And dry

299
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,820
And a little bit of baby lotion

300
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,760
And some powder

301
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,020
And then pee

302
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,960
Bob Dobbs still does that

303
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,040
Bob Dobbs still does that

304
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,240
If he relaxes enough

305
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,060
He'll pee in your eye

306
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,660
I think that's

307
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,520
Carnivuncular or whatever the word is

308
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,600
For central focus

309
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,480
I think that is central

310
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,860
To the central focus

311
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,580
This is just fresh

312
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:55,580


313
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,360
Take off

314
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,740
All right

315
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,140
So if you're drawing what I wrote

316
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,020
Well there is no opacity

317
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,060
But we need it

318
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,420
Take off

319
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,340
You're looking straight at a

320
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,080
Puff

321
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,200
Like a

322
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,840
Puff

323
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,380
Yeah

324
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:22,900
or something?

325
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,760
I cried because I could not squint

326
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,000
and then I met a man who could not

327
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,540
drool.

328
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,180
Well, introduce me to that person, compadre.

329
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,740
I'd like to shake his hand

330
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,200
and his dolphin-like foot.

331
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,720
Well, just because he doesn't drool?

332
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,020
He can't drool.

333
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,040
That's the saddest thing.

334
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,380
I got it.

335
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,520
You know, he just fills up.

336
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,780
Well, I'm not as beleaguered

337
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,920
as you think I understood.

338
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,740
At least I didn't want, you know,

339
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,340
I didn't have any fantasies like John David Rockefeller

340
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,840
in the 1860s.

341
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,500
He has to either swallow it or stand on his head

342
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,800
so it runs out his nose.

343
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,660
Like Johnny Weissmuller playing orangutan

344
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,060
in the Tarzan movies.

345
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,320
What?

346
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,680
I forget.

347
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,040
No.

348
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,320
Don't you?

349
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,160
I'm sure you do.

350
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,620
You just don't want to be reminded.

351
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,140
I knew a girl who knew Johnny Weissmuller

352
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,120
in the nursing home in Hollywood.

353
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,340
The aged Johnny Weissmuller

354
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,740
would, in fact,

355
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,720
still do the Tarzan call

356
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,520
at the top of his lungs

357
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,240
and he would

358
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,420
sexually harass the young nurses.

359
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,280
Cool.

360
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,220
Mercilessly.

361
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,240
I'm sorry.

362
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,240
I didn't mean that.

363
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,640
But Cheetah was the one who always scored.

364
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,260
I heard a lie that Cheetah outlived

365
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,320
Johnny Weissmuller.

366
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,580
I don't believe that.

367
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,360
On the other hand, we have a newt

368
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,660
that's outlived several of my friends.

369
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,820
Yes.

370
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,940
A four-inch long amphibian

371
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,780
that's at least,

372
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,660
he must be 38 years old now.

373
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,960
Yeah, something like that.

374
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,480
Well, how old can a Republican get?

375
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,060
He's 40?

376
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,820
The newt.

377
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,460
Yes, the small amphibian.

378
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:26,800
The newt.

379
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
I was just thinking of the newt.

380
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,680
We don't know how old he was

381
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,120
when Princess We got him from the pet store.

382
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:34,780
No.

383
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,520
40 years ago.

384
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,520
You could be sitting on the science fiction novel

385
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,680
of your lifetime, Senor, right there.

386
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,840
Because what if that newt is secretly

387
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,540
controlling the miles of everybody

388
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,520
within, say, 40?

389
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,420
Five or 67 miles?

390
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,520
He could be.

391
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,640
The newt could be controlling the minds

392
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,140
of everyone within the near 67 or 48 miles.

393
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,640
And guess what's near Cleveland Heights

394
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,840
and around where I live, right in between there,

395
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,460
is one of the world's largest concentrations

396
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,360
of crystal quartz underground

397
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,920
that a spring runs through.

398
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,160
Go on, get out of here.

399
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:14,800
Are you serious?

400
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,040
Yeah.

401
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,100
I didn't know that.

402
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,840
I told you that once anyway.

403
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,640
Ohio rocks.

404
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,880
Those are Ohio rocks.

405
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,920
Speaking of which,

406
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,940
I joined the Northeast Ohio Rocks Facebook thing today

407
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,480
so that I could send them the picture

408
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,700
of the hidden painted rock that you found.

409
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,100
Oh, good.

410
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,860
Thank you.

411
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,260
Yeah.

412
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,420
Princess We found a golden egg in a park.

413
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,540
We thought it was a golden egg,

414
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,320
but it was rather irregular shape.

415
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,400
It was just a little rock

416
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,260
and it was painted gold.

417
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,940
And on the back,

418
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,340
it said,

419
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,060
if you find this,

420
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,080
send a picture to Northeast Ohio Rocks.

421
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,600
It had a number on it as well.

422
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,800
Now, here's the weird thing.

423
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,000
This Ohio Rocks thing,

424
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,580
it's just this,

425
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,020
do a kindness by leaving a painted rock somewhere.

426
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,640
Okay.

427
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,260
Okay, that's all well and good.

428
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,380
They do that down at the beach.

429
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,240
It's a nice, you know,

430
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,040
distraction for little old ladies

431
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,620
who collect statues of owls and stuff

432
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,920
and have, anyway.

433
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,400
Anyway.

434
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,600
The funny thing was,

435
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
when I looked up that innocuous little Facebook page.

436
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,200
Jays.

437
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,640
There were anti-Northeast Ohio Rocks pages.

438
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,720
Like pages with the name Northeast Ohio Rocks are morons.

439
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,520
What?

440
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,520
Right.

441
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,300
It's like the internet is so filled with bored haters

442
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,740
that they've got,

443
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,740
they're hating even the most boring, innocuous, pink,

444
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,160
goody two-shoes, non-objectionable.

445
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,480
It's like, how can you waste your time

446
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,560
getting mad at these lamers?

447
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,400
How lame are you?

448
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,960
I would like to strangle them all.

449
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,400
To be a snowflake over them.

450
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,660
Not with my own hands,

451
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,020
but I'd like somebody else to go and strangle them.

452
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,900
I mean, you...

453
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,300
Or at least try to.

454
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,840
Okay, there's this horrible set of hurricanes going on

455
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,720
at this writing.

456
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,520
Jays.

457
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,380
I get to the end,

458
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,020
at the end of an article,

459
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,120
I read the comments.

460
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,040
Arr.

461
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,080
And they, somehow or another,

462
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,120
half of the commenters

463
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,180
turn it,

464
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,540
turn the whole hurricane thing

465
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,900
into a plot by Al Gore

466
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,720
to trick libtards into giving him money.

467
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,960
And that's really,

468
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,440
the hurricanes aren't really that bad,

469
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,420
but the, you know,

470
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:44,580
the,

471
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,120
all the other reporters in the world

472
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,680
are making them look bad.

473
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,940
It's the right-wing version

474
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,420
of the conspiracy of geothermal engineering,

475
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,700
geoengineering.

476
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,000
It's the right-wing version of it

477
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,680
because somebody's got to be doing it,

478
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,780
the person who's doing it,

479
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,260
instead of oil companies and other people

480
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,280
who actually stand to materially gain

481
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,700
by controlling the weather and stuff.

482
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,900
They don't consider that they can,

483
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,380
they like to build demonetized,

484
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,700
demonic guys like Al Gore.

485
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,300
Like, we mentioned his name,

486
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,120
or Nancy Pelosi.

487
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,340
Well, of course,

488
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,520
right-wingers aren't the only ones who do that.

489
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,340
Extremist left-wingers have,

490
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:25,940
have,

491
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,460
have had all kinds of paranoid delusions about,

492
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,800
of when an earthquake happens.

493
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,420
Oh, that was planned.

494
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,440
That was caused by such and such fruit company.

495
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,300
Like, I wish.

496
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,100
Because if you could cause an earthquake,

497
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,020
you could probably also prevent,

498
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,660
you know, a very, very serious one.

499
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,220
Right.

500
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,840
I'm sorry, but it just doesn't add up.

501
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,540
No, it doesn't.

502
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,060
That science ain't there yet.

503
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,840
I, I don't think anything of what you just said

504
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,420
makes any sense to me, but...

505
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:55,860
Good.

506
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,100
Nothing makes sense to me.

507
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,460
I know.

508
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,000
And nothing makes sense to anyone else

509
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,700
after it's been processed through you.

510
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,680
At first.

511
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,100
It's like the second time you hear it though,

512
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,400
it's like, oh, he actually did say something.

513
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,100
Oh yeah.

514
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,380
Yeah.

515
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,380


516
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,000
He just said it in a very, very...

517
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,040
You know the laughing kind,

518
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,140
the greasy little pages with your fingers,

519
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,360
just like you're having chicken salad sandwiches, Monsieur?

520
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,620
Which is something on the side,

521
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,260
like a capitalist robot.

522
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,420
Yeah.

523
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:30,820
I'm sorry.

524
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,380
Right.

525
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,660
Well, it's time, you know,

526
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,200
I think it's time for this witty banter to end,

527
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,980
because I really want to hear this Lenny Bruce thing.

528
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,900
It's, I came into a stash of Lenny Bruce material.

529
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,200
You know,

530
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,060
I don't listen to standup comics.

531
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,940
I listened to Bill Hicks for a while,

532
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,120
but then it was like, you want to copy him.

533
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,140
And so, so you don't.

534
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,780
I don't know if other people are like that,

535
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,480
but I just like that.

536
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,200
If something's a little bit like what I want to do,

537
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,160
I don't want to be too much like them.

538
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,300
So I, and I've had the problem of sometimes quoting somebody

539
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,360
without knowing I'm quoting them.

540
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,580
I'm thinking I made it up myself or one of my friends said it,

541
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,660
but really they're quoting George Carlin or somebody,

542
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,820
you know, and, and you said later on,

543
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,380
you end up looking like an idiot.

544
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,880
If somebody else goes, no, George Carlin said that,

545
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,360
not Philo.

546
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,180
Yeah, that's what I was just going to say.

547
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,000
And it's still, yeah.

548
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,540
But it goes both ways.

549
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,980
I've also had people explain that George Carlin said something or another,

550
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,280
that I know that Robert Antonov is a racist.

551
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,240
John Wilson said, well, and I know where he got it from me.

552
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,620
So there it goes both ways in all directions.

553
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,620
Goes all ways.

554
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,440
Yes.

555
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,700
The statement that America's club and you ain't in it.

556
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,260
And it's also the same club they used to bang you over there to keep you in line with.

557
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,520
Do you remember that line from George Carlin just before he expired from?

558
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,500
No, I didn't.

559
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,080
I don't listen.

560
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,660
I don't listen to other standup comics.

561
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,280
See?

562
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,880
Well, I only, I only.

563
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,480
I don't hear Lenny Bruce's okay, because I can't ever sound like him.

564
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,480
And, yeah.

565
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,360
Yeah, whereas Bill Hicks, he was like my neighbor.

566
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,080
That guy's another Texas guy.

567
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,960
Yeah, I think he was, he was also fascinated by the police force.

568
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,240
Just like Lenny Bruce.

569
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:36,980
No, I.

570
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,260
No, it's the other way around.

571
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:44,080
Lenny, the police force was interested enough in Lenny Bruce that his best friend thinks that he was murdered.

572
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,920
He was murdered by the police.

573
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,600
And his mom doesn't think he committed suicide.

574
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,340
His friend said he wouldn't have overdosed.

575
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,020
Lenny Bruce allegedly died of an overdose.

576
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,880
But the police hated it.

577
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,500
Now, his best friends all said no.

578
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,520
Lenny was too expert of a heroin addict to ever overdose.

579
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,440
And his mom said, well, he wasn't deliberately committing suicide, because why else was he trying to lose weight?

580
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,800
So, who knows?

581
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,060
But anyway, I'm going to, I'm going to go back.

582
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,000
That's enough of that.

583
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,020
Let's listen to some old Lenny Bruce.

584
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,260
He's doing a routine that's not at all raunchy.

585
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,300
It's just kind of funny to me.

586
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,240
But he's got a heckler in the crowd.

587
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,340
And the way he deals with the heckler is really interesting.

588
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,020
So, Dave, do you want me to just pot you down and let you listen to it?

589
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,120
Or do you want to wait until you get the CD later?

590
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,740
Yes, I would like to listen to a little bit of it right now.

591
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,760
Okay, well, I'm going to see.

592
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,040
You're fighting against me.

593
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,160
I'm going to be waiting out.

594
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,760
The other music is gone now.

595
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,680
Please, your voice is going away, Dave.

596
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:54,140
And we should hear great Lenny Bruce in some nightclub in the 60s.

597
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:54,900
All right.

598
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,380
Now, let's see what I do with you.

599
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,020
Oh, I'll talk about, oh, here's a bit, you know, for the people who have seen me work before,

600
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,100
I always find a lot of humor tied in with motion pictures.

601
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,500
So, Dave, I had a weird kind of thing I was thinking of.

602
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,980
To do a science fiction picture that opens up in Atlantis.

603
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,520
You know, the old Myrna Loy.

604
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,500
Things under the sea.

605
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:24,800
And it has this hate crazed skin diver and a physical education major, a real moron,

606
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:30,220
who was thrown out of SC for looking over the lockers of the other guys in the showers,

607
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,880
you know, and taking showers with his underwear on.

608
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,000
Hey, you remember those guys that saved the brown underwear from the army, you know?

609
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,600
This is plenty good.

610
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,180
Let me show you.

611
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,420
So, that dig opens up, ready?

612
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,400
And they're down there and they're making this terrible monster, a real weirdo, and

613
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,640
they're getting them all ready with the scales and the fins and the whole bit, you know?

614
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,300
So, now he's all ready, right?

615
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:00,940
He's okay.

616
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,540
Is he ready?

617
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,040
Looks weird?

618
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,260
Good.

619
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,000
Send him up.

620
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,360
And he comes up, the monster, in Coney Island.

621
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,080
Starts stalking the beach and he comes up and there's all these people, you know, and he goes,

622
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,140
And so the Jewish ladies start whacking him in the face with their pucker books, you know?

623
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,980
So he's looking, you know, and kids are punching him, you know?

624
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,260
And the cop gives him a ticket for changing his suit under the boardwalk.

625
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,160
And like the sand is too hot for his feet and he's walking around like this.

626
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,760
He's like, get out of here!

627
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
So he flips, you know?

628
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,960
So, all right, shut up now, you hooker.

629
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,820
And out of here, Daddy Warbucks.

630
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,380
Never mind the diner's club schtick.

631
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,980
Listen, oh, you like this.

632
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,700
The convention isn't in town anymore.

633
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,080
Now they found him here.

634
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,240
Now the tape is for falling, right?

635
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,500
Screwed up the tape.

636
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,580
You came down here for nothing.

637
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,040
I had to get these two girls here from Sally Stanford's.

638
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,440
Now, you don't understand.

639
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,660
You can't talk here.

640
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,900
You'll get the towels and leave.

641
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,180
Now, because it doesn't matter.

642
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,620
I'm an existentialist, sweetheart, so you can't.

643
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,040
Okay, now back to...

644
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,180
No, it doesn't matter.

645
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,980
What, what, what, what?

646
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,960
All right, I'll wait.

647
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,980
I'll wait, Miss Brooks.

648
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,040
But don't get it on the suit.

649
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,100
That's what I said.

650
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,880
But I said existentialist.

651
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,160
Listen, forget it.

652
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,700
Listen, you'll end up in the trunk with Dr. Shepard.

653
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,820
They'll get you.

654
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,620
The gas in the face, you'll like it.

655
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,440
Don't, don't...

656
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,320
Look, it's nice.

657
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,100
It's really nice.

658
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,180
See, I've got a traumatic kind of...

659
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:31,740
I think we're all together.

660
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,180
No, I like the...

661
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,560
I want to go home with the three of you.

662
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,060
I'll sit on the bed.

663
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,880
I won't touch anybody.

664
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,360
I'm one of those guys.

665
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,240
I'll just watch.

666
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,640
Listen.

667
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,140
A lot of guys promise, you know, they say, oh, yeah, you promised you wouldn't touch

668
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,040
her, but you did.

669
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:51,340
And...

670
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,040
Well, there goes the picture.

671
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,880
There goes the money down the drain for the film.

672
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,920
I hope you enjoyed being part of the four show.

673
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,500
No, you're certainly very nice.

674
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,840
Those faces will come back.

675
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,400
Here's a...

676
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,420
The write-up did it.

677
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,120
That's what did it.

678
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,940
That really got me for the show.

679
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:10,940


680
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:10,940


681
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:10,940


682
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:10,940


683
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:10,940


684
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:10,940


685
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:10,940


686
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:10,940


687
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,580
I had a whole fight with myself in the dressing room.

688
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,940
I read it, you know, and then I was mad.

689
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:16,880
Then I went back.

690
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,800
I said, no, what is...

691
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,060
You know, back to our conversation in the car where I said, it doesn't matter, you know.

692
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,600
Then I did let it...

693
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:22,920
I don't know.

694
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,080
That's why we use narcotics.

695
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,480
Now...

696
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,360
Okay.

697
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,020
Back to...

698
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,280
No, I don't...

699
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,300
I can't talk while you're talking.

700
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,980
Be nice.

701
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,920
I like you.

702
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:35,500
You...

703
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,960
The elderly man.

704
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,040
You've only got a few years.

705
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,040
Live it out gracefully.

706
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:40,800
Where do you want to go?

707
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:40,940
There's a...

708
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:40,940


709
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:40,940


710
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:40,940


711
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,780
You know, they should say nice things about you, you know.

712
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,600
You don't want the guy to be insincere.

713
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,180
Said he was nice to comedians.

714
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:46,820
He was very...

715
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:47,540
Okay.

716
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,360
Now...

717
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,060
Back to...

718
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:50,120
Oh!

719
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,480
Okay.

720
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,620
Now, you remember the picture where he comes back down and the old...

721
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,700
They were hitting him and yelling.

722
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,500
So he comes down.

723
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,700
The scientists are waiting, you know.

724
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,580
So he says, what happened?

725
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,500
He said, I don't know.

726
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,220
I bombed.

727
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,340
He says, you're putting us on.

728
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,580
He says, no.

729
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,320
He says, what do you mean?

730
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,820
You didn't flip anybody?

731
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,900
No one was scared?

732
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:09,940
He says, no.

733
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,920
He says, did you do all the big things?

734
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:10,920


735
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:10,920


736
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,600
Did you do...

737
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,000
Yeah.

738
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,380
Did you do the other one?

739
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:14,820
Yeah.

740
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,120
That's what they say.

741
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,780
Said I was doing Jerry Lewis.

742
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,180
Geez, I don't know what the hell I'm making of that.

743
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,560
Is that...

744
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,880
Well, I know what it is.

745
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,560
Coney Island.

746
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,780
It was...

747
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,220
That's...

748
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,180
They're weird there.

749
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:27,740
Yeah.

750
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,180
Got to send them up maybe to Brighton Beach.

751
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,080
That's what it is.

752
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,380
They get him...

753
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,080
Again, weird.

754
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,640
Put an abalone on his...

755
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,740
Oh, you know, the whole bit.

756
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,340
The shrimp in his nose and...

757
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,580
Now he's ready.

758
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,100
Comes up again.

759
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:42,680
Shhh.

760
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,980
Comes up on the beach.

761
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,080
An old Jewish woman runs up to him.

762
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,000
She says, are you married?

763
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,280
My daughter's Sophie.

764
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,440
So he really flips this time.

765
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,260
You know, runs down the scientist as well.

766
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,180
No.

767
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,360
Come on.

768
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,440
You didn't scare nobody?

769
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,560
He says, no.

770
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,080
They're flips.

771
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,300
I don't know what the hell it is.

772
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,320
I just...

773
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,320
He says, I know what it is.

774
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,020
You look weird, but you're not thinking horror.

775
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,320
You're not predicting.

776
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,040
You're projecting yourself.

777
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,360
Now come here.

778
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,340
Are you really a weirdo?

779
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,320
She says, yeah.

780
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,480
Because if you're not, a lot of guys say they're freaky.

781
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,980
You know, they say, yeah, I'm wild.

782
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,340
You know, but when it comes to...

783
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,300
No, I'm wild.

784
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:21,860
Believe me.

785
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,400
Give me a break.

786
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,480
Cut to...

787
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,620
He's on the subway, right?

788
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,780
Now he's waiting there.

789
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,820
So this chick starts digging him, looking at him.

790
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,960
So she comes over to him.

791
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,320
She says, listen, I don't want to offend you, but I know a plastic surgeon and I had a nose

792
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:38,840
like that.

793
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,500
Just a tip.

794
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,300
And I'm like, what?

795
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,300


796
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,300


797
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,580
So now he really flips out.

798
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,900
He reaches out.

799
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,220
But you dig, I'm talking now, but I'm really not being sincere because I'm still digging

800
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,460
this two lepers on my left ear, you know?

801
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,520
And I'm not a mechanical comic.

802
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,200
You know, I haven't got routine, you know?

803
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,800
I have to feel good, you know?

804
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:05,500
And I'm going to do something very different you've never seen in a nightclub before.

805
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,220
Listen, stop it.

806
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:09,400
Stop.

807
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:10,780
I have these headaches.

808
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,620
Listen, you'll pose for the Legionnaire picture.

809
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,460
Hold it.

810
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,720
Now, it's really nice.

811
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,440
I've seen this guy somewhere in those sex offense magazines.

812
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:22,880
It's lovely.

813
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,260
Listen, forget it.

814
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:24,720
Lolita.

815
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,100
You'll get a four-year-old kid.

816
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,800
You don't need these elderly broads.

817
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,300
No.

818
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:29,920
Okay.

819
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,040
You'll get a nice kid.

820
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,900
You'll wash him up.

821
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,920
You'll get the fireman.

822
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,340
You'll give those firemen a bath.

823
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,880
And you must speak.

824
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,840
I don't mind you talking.

825
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,620
But just...

826
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,660
No, I do.

827
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,200
I just...

828
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,440
You can't be audible.

829
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,900
You don't even like your clothes.

830
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,380
I do.

831
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,900
I love the both of you.

832
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,360
I want to pour gas on you.

833
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,100
It'll be nice.

834
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,900
A little party.

835
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,680
What does it mean?

836
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,840
Once a year.

837
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,480
Yeah.

838
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,980
What a kind of a...

839
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,700
No, don't give me the shtick.

840
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,280
It's two.

841
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,260
Not one.

842
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,340
Never cutting the prices.

843
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,140
Now, now.

844
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,140
George, he'll say, don't do that bit.

845
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:07,820
Right?

846
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,820
I'll say, you know, I'm not a...

847
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:09,820


848
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:09,820


849
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:09,820


850
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:09,820


851
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:09,820


852
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:09,820


853
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,060
You're offending somebody.

854
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,800
Where do you go there?

855
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,020
Okay.

856
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,500
All right.

857
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,520
Meanwhile...

858
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,760
Being nice to me.

859
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,360
Don't you know I...

860
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:19,760
I can't...

861
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,260
That's my function to entertain you and get you Kleenex and everything.

862
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,440
Now, we're going to...

863
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,360
See, I'm basic.

864
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,360
All right.

865
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,240
We'll talk...

866
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:33,760
Okay.

867
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,960
Listen, how did you happen to come in here?

868
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,800
Well, is it a mystery bus?

869
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,160
Is it a mystery bus tour?

870
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,080
You got the tickets.

871
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,120
You got your slacks clean, free, then the roller rink, and then...

872
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,060
You have eyes for me, I can tell.

873
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,300
You can take me a little bit, right?

874
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Later, 612, the keys under the rug.

875
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,240
I'm saying at the Olympic.

876
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,460
Take the elevator, the seventh floor, and walk down one.

877
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,040
And later, we'll show you Mel's wigs.

878
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,440
Now, it's weird, right?

879
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,400
I want to do the...

880
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,640
There's the great voice content.

881
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,200
The guy who introduces you.

882
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,740
If you remember the beginning of this show.

883
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,780
Can you tell us what he does?

884
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,520
What, dear?

885
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,560
Don't you feel like a nut now?

886
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:19,660
Don't you feel like a complete nut with that Woodbury necklace that you saved for...

887
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,660
Now, you're getting a different tape on me, right?

888
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,320
Lenny Bruce is hostile.

889
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,160
That's that kind of a thing.

890
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,460
Okay.

891
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:28,620
Yeah.

892
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,800
We might as well continue in that vein.

893
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,920
And I'd like to put something in your vein, an overload.

894
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,460
I don't know.

895
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,600
No.

896
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,500
Don't leave because George gets nervous.

897
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:39,780
Okay.

898
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,800
He doesn't realize that a certain percentage of the audience find me...

899
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,440
Yes.

900
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:53,200
We have another biological failure, a result of fallout.

901
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,120
Yeah.

902
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,280
It's all right.

903
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,540
See, the second generation of genetics have suffered.

904
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,200
We're getting paid back for Hiroshima.

905
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,140
All right.

906
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,220
What?

907
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,440
I think you're the best.

908
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,780
And I'm the best.

909
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:09,780


910
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:09,780


911
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:09,780


912
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,020
Yes?

913
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


914
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,640
What's the clock?

915
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:18,940
So,

916
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:19,360
Okay.

917
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:22,160
Yeah.

918
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:34,140
I'm so sort of sunshine, me and a beer place is wonderful, eh?

919
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,720
they're naked.

920
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,080
You're paranoid, that's what it is.

921
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,900
I'm not persecuting you.

922
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:40,620
I love you.

923
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,920
You I like better than the others.

924
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,880
What do I represent to you?

925
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,380
I'm surely not your father image.

926
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,340
Go home, Lenny.

927
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,180
Well, he finally spoke up.

928
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,100
The fellow sitting on the rubber tube.

929
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,920
Right?

930
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,700
He bought his own whoopee cushion

931
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,620
from the fun shop.

932
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,220
Okay.

933
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:07,540
Oh.

934
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,420
Oh, you don't know the bit.

935
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,260
After the show, they say,

936
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,240
we helped you out, right?

937
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,040
And some other schmuck says,

938
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,280
yeah, they were in the act, right?

939
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:15,980
There were stooges.

940
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,320
Yeah, la-da-da-da.

941
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,760
Yeah, I'm laughing,

942
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,240
but I don't like this kind of a show.

943
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,420
You know.

944
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,820
Paid this guy's $800 to tape the show

945
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,600
and this schlub is,

946
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,780
this parakeet with the blonde hair.

947
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:29,720
Now.

948
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,220
Ah! Ah! Ah!

949
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,520
Polly's a hooker!

950
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:34,360
Now.

951
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,160
All right.

952
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,480
That's it.

953
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,960
That's the one time you need the band.

954
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,400
Go into Hot Tech for the Star Spangled Banner.

955
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,260
All right.

956
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,400
Now.

957
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,260
Shh.

958
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:46,920
Be nice.

959
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,440
Soon the gas will be here.

960
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,020
But I'm kind of weird.

961
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:51,900
I kind of dig the blonde

962
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,900
on the Leah Zephyr.

963
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,960
She's wild, right?

964
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,220
I do.

965
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,080
Like, I'm a real nut.

966
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,240
Like, I'm spritzing her,

967
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,320
but I'm kind of looking at her, you know.

968
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,380
That's sick, right?

969
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,360
That's what guys are the lowest, right?

970
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,980
They're really rotten, right?

971
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:05,620
Look at me, right?

972
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,080
They're really bad to me.

973
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,000
That's why we're all dishonest.

974
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,880
I really feel rotten about that, you know.

975
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,620
Because I recognize my own dishonesties.

976
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,940
Like, if that's a guy yelling at me that way,

977
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,420
I'm real blaggish with him, you know.

978
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,960
And I'm bugged and I hate him, you know.

979
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,180
But like, there's three people

980
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,020
and the chick on the left

981
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,000
is kind of hot looking, you know.

982
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,700
So I feel hostility toward her,

983
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,520
but I'd like to hug her a little too.

984
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,120
You know.

985
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,900
Why is that?

986
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,780
Why do I like you?

987
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,260
What's your name?

988
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:33,660
That's it.

989
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:33,800
That's it.

990
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,540
Screw the show.

991
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,140
That's right.

992
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,140
Talk dirty to me.

993
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,580
I don't care.

994
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,040
I'm nothing.

995
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,260
That's right.

996
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,360
Take me home, men.

997
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,160
Right?

998
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,180
Hit me.

999
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,980
But I'm yours.

1000
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,940
I'm just a clown on the stage for you,

1001
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,000
oh beautiful blonde goddess.

1002
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,620
I can't see.

1003
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,040
Is that a waitress there?

1004
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:52,460
Bobby?

1005
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,340
Would you bring them around, please?

1006
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,680
Thank you very much.

1007
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,320
Let's see.

1008
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,160
Where's the piano player?

1009
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,620
This is the first night

1010
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,380
I didn't have the piano player.

1011
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,560
Oh, thank you.

1012
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,680
You're not the piano player.

1013
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,460
You're the owner's son.

1014
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,700
And a you-in for a terrible life.

1015
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,940
His whole life is ruined, right?

1016
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,420
That's it.

1017
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,600
Look what you'll inherit.

1018
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,380
Someday this will be all yours.

1019
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,220
Just think of it, right?

1020
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,200
Get everything that was done

1021
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,120
with a stapling gun.

1022
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,780
Oh, you're back.

1023
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,340
Hello there.

1024
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,420
They have a different piano player

1025
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:30,840
every night.

1026
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,760
Okay.

1027
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,160
I'm gonna do something

1028
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,440
I've never done yet.

1029
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,080
I can do something

1030
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,600
each different show.

1031
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,260
I did a whole lot of waitresses.

1032
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,860
And you can see me

1033
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,760
on Mr. Ripley's show.

1034
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,540
Get that on tape, Fritz.
