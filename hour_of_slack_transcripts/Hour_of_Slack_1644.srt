1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
We don't have no time for that. All we want is an hour of slack.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,700
Do you know where it's at? All you need is an hour of slack.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,680
Everyone needs a strained jacket. Pull it tight, let's all slack it.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,320
Everyone needs a strained jacket. Hold on tight, let's all slack it.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:32,740
I know, and among other things, Bog, I'm doing pretty well with those pills you sent.

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:48,680
Pretty well, but I can always use more, and it's because of Ohio and red trucks, and they're all gone.

7
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,300
And I'm not going to use them anymore.

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,200
Bog? But that's okay.

9
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,780
Here's your new Christmas.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,760
The farmer, he got plowed. The bricklayer got plastered.

11
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,300
The mechanic, he got tatted.

12
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,300


13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,740
The bank, and the construction worker got blasted.

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,280
And daddy beat up mommy and broke her collarbone for good luck.

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,280
And everybody's drunk. And everybody's wasted.

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,520
And everybody's drinking off the job.

17
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,900
Music.

18
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,860
The garbage man got trashed. The janitor got messy.

19
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:02,400
The taxi driver got smashed. And the waitress kitty got tipsy.

20
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:10,020
In Kansas City, New York City, great big city, itty bitty city.

21
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,140
Now everybody's drunk. And everybody's wasted.

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,440
And everybody's drinking on the job.

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,620
Music.

24
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,820
Well, there's a whole lot of places that I ain't been.

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen.

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,940
A whole lot of things I'll never be.

27
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:45,260
The generation that will change the world is still looking for its car keys.

28
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,080
Music.

29
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,300


30
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,040
Music.

31
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
Music.

32
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,280
Music.

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,940
Music.

34
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,740
Music.

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,880
Music.

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,380
Music.

37
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,860
Music.

38
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,800
Music.

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,080
Music.

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,240
Music.

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
Music.

42
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,700
Music.

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,100
Music.

44
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,500
Music.

45
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,480
Music.

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,380
Music.

47
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,000
The terrorists got bombed.

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,440
The president got hit.

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,820
Security was tight.

50
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,420
Hey, the Secret Service got lit.

51
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:39,840
The FBI, the CIA, DWI, USA.

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,060
Everybody's drunk.

53
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,860
And everybody's wasted.

54
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,580
And everybody's stoned.

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,080
There's nothing, nothing gonna change it.

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,180
Cause everybody's drunk.

57
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,040
And everybody's wasted.

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,180
And everybody's drinking all the time.

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,780
Just about a year ago.

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,560
I set out on the road.

61
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,200
Seeking my fame and fortune.

62
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,740
And looking for a pot of gold.

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,860
Well, things got bad.

64
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,920
And things got worse.

65
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,540
I guess you know the tune.

66
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Oh, Lord, stuck in low die again.

67
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,840
Oh, Lord, stuck in low die again.

68
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,780
I say, oh, Lord, stuck in low die again.

69
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,600
Sometimes I think life is just a rodeo.

70
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,020
The trick is to ride and make it to the bell.

71
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,840
Well, this one's a little bit more difficult.

72
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,840
I want to be the next thing sweetest you'll ever know.

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,400
In music and love.

74
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,960
Things you never tell.

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,160
Hey, let's go all over the world.

76
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,620
Rock and roll girls.

77
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,360
Rock and roll girls.

78
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,540
You got a song, Rich?

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,500
You got a song for us?

80
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,460
Maybe something a little bit of Nazareth

81
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,880
Maybe

82
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

84
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,060
I've got a nurse, got a nurse

85
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,260
And it's out of control

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,940
I've got a nurse, I want to first

87
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,360
Cause I feel it's in control

88
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,740
I've got a look at your alert

89
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,700
I want to tell you all about it

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,820
I've got a look at your alert

91
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,920
It makes me feel it

92
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

93
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

94
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,080
One, two, three, four

95
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,900
That was inspired

96
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,780
Look out now

97
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,520
We're drinking

98
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,960
Yes, we're drinking

99
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,480
Oh, baby, we're drinking

100
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,660
Drinking on the job

101
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,120
Drinking on the job

102
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,660
Drinking on the job

103
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,340
Drinking on the job

104
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,800
Drinking on the job

105
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:42,800


106
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,500
I get real scared, Bob

107
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,400
Cause I've seen them

108
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,680
I've seen them before

109
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,380
But there's more of them now

110
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,340
And cause there's lots more

111
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,980
They're floating in the air

112
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,780
And they're living in the wood

113
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,720
And the rocks and everything

114
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,360
And they're

115
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,340
They're living in the air

116
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,340


117
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,020
They're always kind of

118
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,480
Laughing and

119
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,020
Feeling and laughing

120
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,400
And all the time

121
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,240
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society

122
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,980
Has interpreted the signals as a message from a space probe

123
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,080
A message from a dying planet in Eta

124
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,500
Yeah, the little green man's day was real headcatch

125
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,280
Rocking and a-rolling through the crazy flats

126
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,100
Brought out a sax and then started to flow

127
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,340
Brought out a sax and then started to flow

128
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


129
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


130
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,940
Brought out the drums and they started to roll

131
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,720
Flat saucer, rock and roll

132
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,540
Flat saucer, rock and roll

133
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,160
I couldn't understand it

134
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,940
A big head said it was a crazy beat

135
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,160
It just stopped me dead

136
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,440
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack

137
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,540
And a conspiracy of pinks

138
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,700
The subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse

139
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,180
According to church doctrine

140
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,200
On July 5th, 1998

141
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,400
When the television signal of Amos and Andy

142
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,320
Reaches the sky

143
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,580
The men from Planet X

144
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,000
The aliens will unleash their wrath upon the earth

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,800
And the men from Planet X are going to come down

146
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,260
And take over Earth

147
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,100
They are going to

148
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,660
They will put us out of our misery

149
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,400
Unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand

150
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,860
That there is something on Earth worth saving

151
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,460
And only the subgenii

152
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,220
The dues paying, book buying, receipt in the pocket

153
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,540
Paid and full to the church subgenii

154
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,300
Have the tiniest, smallest chance to survive

155
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,100
prayer of survival.

156
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,440
The rest of them,

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,180
it's a tough world, right?

158
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,280
Yeah!

159
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,480
I hate it!

160
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Nature!

161
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,480
I hate it!

162
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,480
Well, the forces of nature

163
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,260
come in many degrees.

164
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,260
Maybe a forest fire

165
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,840
will kill or ease.

166
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,760
Maybe an earthquake

167
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,080
or maybe typhoon.

168
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,000
Tornadoes, volcanoes,

169
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,720
rains will consume.

170
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,180
Nature!

171
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,740
I hate it!

172
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,420
Nature!

173
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,740
I hate it!

174
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,900
Feel the baby's dioxin

175
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,720
through the waves.

176
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,840
Wipe out a whole species

177
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,860
of hard-to-take-and-feel.

178
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,060
Guard your hole in the earth.

179
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
Feel that hole

180
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,640
in plast handmade.

181
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,140
The way we treat our planet

182
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,860
wonder then.

183
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,520
Know that it means

184
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,360
Is this democrats вообще

185
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,460
real?

186
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,200
Are there real monkeys

187
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,860
in hedge Mission K menging?

188
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,440
They are.

189
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,040
Are you saying

190
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,500
we just gotta

191
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,120
judge them?

192
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
Oh, I'm not gonna judge them.

193
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,240
Well, okay then.

194
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,940
Thank you.

195
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,340
Thank you.

196
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,840
Thank you.

197
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,720
Thank you.

198
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,260
Thank you.

199
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,460
Thank you.

200
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,620
I don't want to get off the stage.

201
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Who told me to get off the stage?

202
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,140
Am I just paranoid?

203
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,280
Speed.

204
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,020
6A, take one.

205
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,260
Roll camera. Slate it.

206
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:59,800
Bob, sometimes it gets so hard to talk, Bob.

207
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,560
It gets so hard.

208
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,300
Scene 7, take one.

209
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:07,780
Camera.

210
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,860
Roll.

211
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,980
He shall follow the gold profits of Slark.

212
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,820
Yet in his hour of need, we will provide the manor.

213
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:40,020
But, Bob, I still hear these voices, you know, these voices that bang, bang, bang on the wall and bang on the inside of my head, Bob.

214
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,100
You know, they're always a bang.

215
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,580
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang on the inside of my head, Bob.

216
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:02,720
And, you know, they make it be real weird, Bob.

217
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,520
And thank you, Roberto de la Rosa.

218
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,400
That was the voice.

219
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,080
That voice.

220
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,500
That voice there.

221
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,260
The guy who wants the pills.

222
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,020
More them kind pills, Bob.

223
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,480
Reverend Roberto de la Rosa was one of the earliest subgeniuses.

224
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:32,980
I mean, he actually got hold of the early copy of Book of the Subgenius that was different from the one we know of.

225
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:41,520
And he was played by Reverend David Boone of Austin, the late David Boone.

226
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,160
And he was played by Reverend David Boone of Austin, the late David Boone.

227
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,160


228
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:50,020
Who made the movie Invasion of the Aluminum People, the greatest Super 8 sound film ever made.

229
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,920
And we heard a little bit of sound effects from that, too.

230
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,720
Those were some crazy sound effects.

231
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,640
Yeah.

232
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,300
Well, and there'll be more about David Boone soon.

233
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,320
How about that Rainmaker song right at the beginning?

234
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:04,840
Woo-hoo!

235
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,680
With the uncontrollable urge in the middle.

236
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,440
I downloaded a bunch of their live stuff.

237
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,820
Of shows that I'd never heard before.

238
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,380
And it turns out whenever they do drinking on the job, it would turn into a medley.

239
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,160
They'd do like Tom Petty songs and Warren Zevon songs.

240
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,500
Not Warren Zevo.

241
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,760
Warren Zevon.

242
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,500
And what else did we hear?

243
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,160
But it was Devo.

244
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:41,320
Oh, there was a Pills kind of crazy chant with a lot of music from Doc Stock No. 2, which was sometime in the 80s.

245
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,300
None of us can remember.

246
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,860
I don't remember when.

247
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,440
You can kind of tell.

248
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,400
But the recordings actually sound pretty good.

249
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:55,660
And we heard the Swinging Love Corps is doing Nature I Hate It, which might be the theme song of our friend Mr. Sister.

250
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,560
But that was live in St. Louis in the 90s.

251
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,400
That stuff by the Rainmaker was from Record Bar.

252
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:11,460
Oh, well, the reason I stopped to do credits is because I'm going to play another Rainmaker song that's in keeping.

253
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,300
Because we're more than just recorders.

254
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,720
We're moving.

255
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,240
We're moving.

256
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,400
We've been in the process of moving everything in the Slacker Mansion.

257
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:26,740
And during this week, I boxed up literally all of the subgenius media.

258
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,400
More on that later.

259
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,460
This is me, right?

260
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,160
Today.

261
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,060
I hate it.

262
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,440
te trying to pause?

263
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,180
Maybe this is something my first time hearing, so I'm just laughing.

264
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,680
And for some reason, all I hear around here are just listeners that I don't richer.

265
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,120
About them, you're just blind.

266
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,120


267
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,520
I strapped these on for a little sol Doppler Zweezels here to meet us.

268
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,860
Hi, you know who's talking ?

269
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,380
Here's your version through 이거는 learners.

270
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,120
Hey there.

271
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,260
Don't you come because I can't go

272
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,360
I owe my soul to the company store

273
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,660
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine

274
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,620
I picked up a shovel and I walked to the mine

275
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,620
Threw the sixteen ton lumber, not coal

276
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,260
And the shovel said, well, bless my soul

277
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,200
Sixteen ton, and what do you guess?

278
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,820
Another day older and the deeper it gets

279
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,620
Say, Peter, don't you come because I can't go

280
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,660
I owe my soul to the company store

281
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,980
I was born one morning near a drizzling rain

282
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,140
I picked up a shovel and I walked to the mine

283
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,460
Threw the sixteen ton lumber, not coal

284
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,460


285
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,740
I was born one morning near a drizzling rain

286
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,640
I was raised in the cave, my home, I'm alive

287
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,520
You know, I told no woman, make me walk alive

288
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,520
Sixteen ton, and what do you guess?

289
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Another day older and the deeper it gets

290
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,600
Say, Peter, don't you come because I can't go

291
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,280
I owe my soul to the company store

292
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,420
Now if you see me coming, better step aside

293
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,260
A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died

294
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,040
I got one fist of iron, the other of steel

295
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,040
If the rock don't get your man to live

296
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,600
To what it takes, to what it takes

297
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:07,600


298
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,800
I'm a man of the way, I'm a man of the way

299
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,660
Sixteen ton, and what do you get?

300
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,420
Another day older and the deeper it gets

301
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,180
Say, Peter, don't you come because I can't go

302
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,160
I owe my soul to the company store

303
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,580
Amazing!

304
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:29,580


305
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:29,580


306
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:29,580


307
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:29,580


308
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,140
Amazing!

309
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,740
Amazing!

310
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:31,740


311
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,020
Amazing!

312
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,020


313
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:37,600
Amazing!

314
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:37,600


315
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,380
Amazing!

316
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,120
We had 46 listeners.

317
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,220
Now we have 36, but our friends in Leipzig are there, in Saxony.

318
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

319
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:26,080
And I held in my hand an hour of slack that was made by Bucky, Reverend Bucky.

320
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,400
Remember? A long time ago.

321
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,020
He put together his favorite stuff.

322
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,420
It was a real good one.

323
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:41,100
I've put my hands on every recording in every format in the last couple of weeks.

324
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,180
We've actually been working on this move for two months.

325
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,180
I mean, ever since.

326
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,220
After the devotional, we hit the ground hauling.

327
00:23:52,520 --> 00:24:00,360
And you may think, well, how could...

328
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,900
I...

329
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,460
All my videos fit on a hard drive.

330
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:11,140
All my radio shows and music, it all fits on a thumb drive.

331
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,340
How can it be so hard to move this stuff?

332
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,260
Well, you didn't always keep your videos on a thumb drive.

333
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,000
In fact, there was a time when you couldn't even keep your videos

334
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,360
because they hadn't been invented yet.

335
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,400
I've been putting my...

336
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,020
Hands on cans of film.

337
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:41,260
Mostly 16 millimeter, but the oldest can in there was 35 millimeter negative

338
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,520
of a claymation thing I did when I was 15.

339
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,960
And friends, old film smells just like vinegar.

340
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,240
It's the developing fluid.

341
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,900
No, I mean, when you get film back from the lab, it has this cool, fresh film smell.

342
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,360
But when it's really old...

343
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:07,220
It undergoes a chemical change and becomes somewhat stanky.

344
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,560
Stanky like somebody I'm thinking of right now.

345
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,620
I'm watching for that little dot.

346
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,880
Actually, I'm pretty stanky right now, said Stank,

347
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,480
because of the hauling and moving.

348
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,100
My phone app tells me how far I've walked and how many floors I've done.

349
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,400
And because we have...

350
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,860
I have a three-story house, including the...

351
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,980
By the bed of death.

352
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,760
What?

353
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,920
The bed of death.

354
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,840
Yeah, I have that problem, too.

355
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,040
The mummy is in the background, the original mummy.

356
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,860
What was I saying?

357
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,960
Something about the...

358
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,200
Vinegar.

359
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,680
It was about the vinegar.

360
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,540
Yeah, the stinkiness of the...

361
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,140
Well, yeah, the media was huge back at...

362
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,280
We were...

363
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,720
We were moving Princess Wee's mom.

364
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,560
Wee maw maw.

365
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,560
And some young movers were there.

366
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,520
They were astounded by the fact that so much stuff was made out of wood.

367
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,620
And they said, how can anyone have this much stuff?

368
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,900
And I had to point out that when you had pictures then,

369
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,420
they were on paper.

370
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,100
They weren't online.

371
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,020
And when you had records, they were heavy.

372
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,820
In fact, 78 RPM records were real heavy.

373
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,200
And he's not heavy.

374
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,240
He's my cowboy.

375
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,080
Yes, I know.

376
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,080
Four flushing, four fingered, four skin, eyeball jagged nails.

377
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,720
Yeah, you should see my fingernails on my foreskin, Dave.

378
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,660
They're so filthy.

379
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,240
I've been cleaning them and cleaning them, but they won't get clean.

380
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,680
Oh, and they're ragged because they break all the time when you're moving things like we are.

381
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,980
Well, I've been picking up boxes that are like 30 years old.

382
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,220
The last time I picked them up was the first time I moved in Dallas.

383
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,780
They've just been growing hair on them.

384
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,860
Really, when boxes get old, they get hair.

385
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,360
They get hairy.

386
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,460
Oh, they get whole colonies of like beatnik-looking type, you know.

387
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,320
Oh, they didn't have CDs back then.

388
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,220
They look like educational devices, the kind of tutorial you get when you get a spanking for being a nasty mammy.

389
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

390
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

391
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:30,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

392
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,320
Well, it's growing under my fingernails, the funk of 10,000 years.

393
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,580
It's a trailing cobwebs.

394
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,520
That's the funk of 10,000 years.

395
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:47,020
Well, actually, that 35-millimeter negative, let's see, if I was 15 years old, yeah, that'd be from 1968.

396
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,560
Jesus.

397
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,380
Good God.

398
00:27:51,640 --> 00:28:00,640
We're so old that just our photographs take up 10 boxes.

399
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,080
They broke in a time.

400
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,900
And they're heavy.

401
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,180
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,320
Because paper is heavy.

403
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,460
Our LP records are all at Weirdsville Records in Detroit now.

404
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,780
700 of them.

405
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,380
Somebody's going to get a really good Hendrix bootleg collection.

406
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,080
Oh, wow.

407
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,020
Only the MP3s of them sound a lot better.

408
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,600
They actually do.

409
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,040
Well, they don't have scratches.

410
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,420
And they're not as heavy.

411
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,380
What was it?

412
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,320
I was talking about how heavy all this stuff was and how many boxes.

413
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,860
And Bleepo said, just put it in an envelope.

414
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,580
They're much lighter.

415
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,220
Yeah.

416
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,980
You've been referring to filth too a lot.

417
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,020
You filthy this and filthy that.

418
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,220
And what was the argument, the disagreement anyway about hemorrhoids?

419
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,800
You said the judge was going to give you a 5 to 10 or something?

420
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,940
We weren't going to talk about it.

421
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,260
We weren't going to talk about that on the show, Dave.

422
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,640
Oh, we don't know any better.

423
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,620
You should forewarn me.

424
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,120
I will next time.

425
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,460
Hey, did I tell you that I learned?

426
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,300
I got the weirdest phone call.

427
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,440
Did I talk about this last week?

428
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,140
I got a phone call from the doctor saying,

429
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,220
well, we saw your x-rays of your back and we didn't see anything wrong,

430
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,720
just your ordinary arthritis and your constipation.

431
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,860
And I went, what?

432
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,180
I never heard about the constipation.

433
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,880
That's one of the few ailments I don't have any trouble with.

434
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,020
And I didn't know I had arthritis.

435
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,880
No one's ever told me I have arthritis in my back.

436
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,260
Thanks for telling me in a very odd way.

437
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,160
Yeah, me too.

438
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,480
I know exactly what you mean.

439
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,740
I'll read this all right.

440
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,420
Sometimes you get pain in the septic valve.

441
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,860
Oh, yeah.

442
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,000
It backs up.

443
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,280
And then you blow your O-ring at the funeral.

444
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,100
Your ovaries can be affected too,

445
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,240
especially if you're a male participant in the group swelling.

446
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,700
Because a lot of times when you take the conditional test after the test,

447
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,880
everybody flunks.

448
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,140
No, I didn't.

449
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,060
After I flunked the test, they gave me the operation.

450
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,760
And it's starting to wear off.

451
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,820
That guy said that his terp was good for 10 years.

452
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,980
And it's only been about...

453
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,500
About three.

454
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,280
And I'm already...

455
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,440
I've had to go to the bathroom several times this year.

456
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,340
That wasn't supposed to happen.

457
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,960
They're supposed to cure me of that.

458
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,340
Well, we've all heard similar stories.

459
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,440
A lot of us have just taken the other side entirely.

460
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,180
Just gone like hypotenuse Toad Louie or something.

461
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,460
Just completely get away from the basic conjecture.

462
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,100
You know?

463
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,420
If everybody's going to have it, why doesn't everybody get it?

464
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,240
You know what I mean?

465
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,180
Psychosomatically speaking, get it.

466
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,300
Yeah.

467
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,740
Yeah.

468
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,660
Hey, you know what we're going to miss, Princess Wee?

469
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,020
Tell me what we're going to miss.

470
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,440
The WCSB Halloween ball.

471
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,280
Oh, are you kidding?

472
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,800
I know that so painfully well.

473
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,100
Actually, it's Friday the 27th.

474
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:23,920
Technically...

475
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,780
Oh, no, no.

476
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,340
We'll be gone.

477
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,780
That's the day that the truck arrives at Stang Ranch.

478
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,820
With all of our stuff.

479
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,120
Yes.

480
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,920
All of it, I tell you.

481
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,480
Drycar let me know that that was completely unacceptable.

482
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,520
And we had to be there.

483
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,600
And I let him know that, well, sorry about that, dude.

484
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,060
But we're going to have to do it.

485
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,560
Well, we'll get to go to Fossil Mania in Glen Rose, which is our other favorite thing.

486
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,560
If you can't go to the Halloween ball.

487
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,540
It's the Fossil Dinosaur Capital.

488
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,760
It's the Fossil Dinosaur Capital.

489
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,460
Capital of the world.

490
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,720
Not of the world, but of the greater...

491
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,420
Of, yeah.

492
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,040
Yeah, but this is the first Halloween ball at the Beachland Ballroom.

493
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,520
It's like a real ball at the ballroom.

494
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,380
Yeah, that's right.

495
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,420
So it's...

496
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,640
Yeah, it's...

497
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,460
I'm sick that we have to miss it.

498
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:22,920
I used to make the theme projections that never looked very good because we never had a screen.

499
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,600
It was just projected on bricks.

500
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,120
But they were white bricks.

501
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,560
Yeah.

502
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,740
The Godzilla theme.

503
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,280
They were good bricks.

504
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,620
The underwater theme.

505
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,720
The battles in outer space theme.

506
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:41,140
I remember in the old days, rock and roll, a real long time ago, 20, 30 years ago,

507
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,200
if you did a good job picking up on some chart or something, they'd just stick right in front of you

508
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,380
or maybe just hum a little whistle tune in your ear and you'd pick it right up and say,

509
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,760
you're a brick, man.

510
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,000
You're a brick.

511
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,180
Meaning like you could be depended on or something.

512
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,980
You know what I mean?

513
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,200
I know what you mean.

514
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,840
It made too much sense, so you didn't think it was lonesome enough.

515
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,740
That's what you thought.

516
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,960
You thought, you know, that's actually true.

517
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,420
That's what people used to say and that's what they used to mean.

518
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,240
You'd expect me to be full of all kinds of esoteric Spanish and Wittgenstein stomp and whatnot.

519
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,180
You're a brick.

520
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,440
I'm a brick, man.

521
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,720
A brick, man.

522
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,820
Thank you.

523
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,200
Brick.

524
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,360
I can hear you.

525
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,060
I can hear you.

526
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,220
I can hear you.

527
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,620
I can hear you.

528
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:25,800
I can hear you.

529
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,080
I have halitosis and I don't want to talk anymore.

530
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,580
Oh, I see.

531
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,360
That's okay.

532
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,120
I was thy consecrated vessel.

533
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,420
I broke my vows.

534
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,420
Save me now.

535
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,900
Teach me the ancient summons, the holy spells I've forgotten.

536
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,120
I call upon thee as of old.

537
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,580
Yeah, me too.

538
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,220
Yeah.

539
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,880
Me too.

540
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,740
I call upon you too.

541
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Last week we said that we were going to announce world shattering events.

542
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,760
Didn't we?

543
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,220
Yeah.

544
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,320
Yeah.

545
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:06,660
And I actually was planning to announce two, but one of the world shattering events, I

546
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:14,160
think I accidentally insulted it and it dropped out, which is a horrible, horrible shame and

547
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,720
a real mis...

548
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,140
It is.

549
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:21,940
It was a result of either I'm missing something or somebody else is missing something, because

550
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,840
I think it was...

551
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,760
Somebody certainly...

552
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,160
It does not add up.

553
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,380
It does not add up.

554
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,260
The facts are not all there.

555
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,780
The names have not been changed, but the...

556
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,820
Well, anyway, I can only talk about...

557
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,060
You're like a bad daddy-o, like nobody knows what you're talking about.

558
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,440
I know.

559
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,320
And the thing is, it shot down...

560
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,940
I did a bunch of work on one of those events and nobody's ever going to see it.

561
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,500
And that's frankly...

562
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,640
Well, okay.

563
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,520
The other event that we had to wait for...

564
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,140
Yeah.

565
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:03,460
...is the fact that these people are indeed, as we mentioned, making a documentary movie

566
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
about the Church of the Subgenius.

567
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,340
Women of Austin.

568
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:13,840
I used the term a serious documentary and several subgeniuses got upset and said, no,

569
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,860
it should be crazy and weird and insane and hard to figure out.

570
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:26,140
And I said, yeah, that would be Arise, the subgenius movie that we did 15 years ago.

571
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,140


572
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,380
Or however long.

573
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:28,960
Right.

574
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,300
That's been in the can for a long time.

575
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,980
Yeah, that's been in the can for a long time.

576
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,400
And...

577
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,380
Gansky-mansky.

578
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:41,140
But this new movie, friends, we can now announce, and you can see a trailer for it if you go

579
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:47,940
to subgenius.com, right at the top of the page, there's a link to this project, which

580
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,420
is now called Slacking Towards Bethlehem.

581
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,940
The story of J.R.

582
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,220
Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

583
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:07,380
And as I said, I've been working on it on and off or talking to them about it or being

584
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,220
interviewed or going to see when my friends are being interviewed with them for like almost

585
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:13,820
a year.

586
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,200
And now they have a Kickstarter thing.

587
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,700
They're trying to raise money for it.

588
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,580
And I can't tell you anything about that that you can't see for yourself.

589
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,920
But it's a really interesting...

590
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,860
It's a really interesting campaign because they're kind of using bits and pieces of it.

591
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,400
And they did a...

592
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:39,460
It's like there's going to be weekly or even daily reports from people like me while we're

593
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,940
moving, while we're on the road.

594
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,660
I'm going to send them little video reports.

595
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:50,660
And there'll be new Kickstarter messages about how great it's going to be from people like

596
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,820
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

597
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,520
And Matt Groening.

598
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:55,920
Yeah.

599
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:55,920


600
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,220
And the other guy who's going to be doing it.

601
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,540
And I'm going to send them a video of the Simpsons and Futurama.

602
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,620
And Jerry Casale of Devo.

603
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,760
And Dr. Hal.

604
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,800
And Paul Mavridis, whom my phone calls Paul Mavrides.

605
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,160
And Puzzling Evidence and Philo and Susie the Floozy and everybody.

606
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,700
Because they came to X Day and filmed.

607
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:24,500
And like I say, you can see bits and pieces of the movie in progress.

608
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,120
Yeah.

609
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,700
And you can see the highlights of it.

610
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:39,320
If you go to subgenius.com, their actual URL is bit.ly, that's B-I-T dot L-Y slash

611
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,700
slack on and the S and O are capitalized.

612
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:50,620
But you know what I can play, uh, Dave, since you can't see it, I can play the soundtrack

613
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,540
of it, of the little trailer.

614
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,980
It's only about two minutes long.

615
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,400
Paul!

616
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,880
that? Sure, would you

617
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,920
like to hear that? Yeah. No, I want

618
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,120
everybody else to hear it.

619
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,900
I'm concursive. I agree with

620
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,800
anybody and everybody most of the time.

621
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,800
I don't really know what you're talking

622
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,940
about. I haven't understood a single

623
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,960
word over the last

624
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
15 minutes, but I heard you did say

625
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,740
my name there at the end, so I'm awake.

626
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,980
Please don't get mad at me for misunderstanding

627
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,780
me.

628
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,640
Anyway,

629
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,440
I just made my toes curl.

630
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,600
Here, you'll hear in this, you'll hear the

631
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,840
voices of

632
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,540
well, me and Philo

633
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,120
and Puzzling Evidence

634
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,800
and Paul Mavridis and a bunch

635
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,480
of gals that

636
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,580
you don't know.

637
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,600
But I do, and we're going to

638
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,040
go ahead and play that, so

639
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,500
let's all be kind of quiet.

640
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,920
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

641
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,440
Have you ever wondered about your

642
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,500
neighbors? Maybe wondered about the

643
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,580
weird thumps and bumps or chants

644
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,800
emanating from their apartment?

645
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,300
Well, they may be followers of Bob,

646
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,420
that's the fastest growing cult here in the

647
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,300
Southwest. I grew up as

648
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,060
a little white boy

649
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,860
in America in the 1950s

650
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,060
in a middle class home.

651
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,300
I was in the perfect position of being

652
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,380
desperate enough to do

653
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,940
low budget promotion

654
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,460
for a weird cult.

655
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,980
If you have never heard of the Church of the

656
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,020
Subgenius, do not look to us

657
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,080
for enlightenment. It all began

658
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,840
with the book of the subgenius

659
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,400
and the church's deity, Bob Dobbs.

660
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,180
It was part pop culture,

661
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,440
part science, part religion.

662
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,240
We tied together every

663
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,720
occult,

664
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,080
superstitious,

665
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,300
fringe belief you could think of.

666
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,360
It was so much fun!

667
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,380
Wouldn't you like revenge

668
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,220
on these mediocritans,

669
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,280
these pink boys, these

670
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,320
box-dwelling Barbies and

671
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,380
Kens, these normals

672
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,440
who have made normality the norm?

673
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,500
You either got the joke

674
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,520
or you didn't, and you got the joke

675
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,240
instantly.

676
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,880
My name is JR Bob Dobbs

677
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,100
and I'm working exclusively with a team

678
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,980
of filmmakers on a documentary about

679
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,620
the Church of the Subgenius.

680
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,300
It's time for my story to be told!

681
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,500
This film team wants to expose it

682
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,720
and all the subgenius are ready to talk.

683
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,520
I just loved the brotherhood

684
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,560
of guys talking about

685
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,820
this made up religion.

686
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,440
That was a great release.

687
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,920
You know, to have all this nutty stuff

688
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,000
in your head, and then find like-minded

689
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,580
people to, you know, talk about this.

690
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,880
you know, express it with.

691
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,580
We were aware that we were sort of influencing other people.

692
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,080
What they got was, you know, people were joining the church.

693
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,040
We were getting better known outside of Dallas.

694
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,900
Mark Mothersbaugh came by.

695
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,960
David Byrne, he had become a subgenius minister.

696
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,580
It's called the church of the subgenius.

697
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,140
The church was always meant to never be mass marketable.

698
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,280
Is the world going to end?

699
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,400
That's what I'm asking you.

700
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,300
The audience kind of took over.

701
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,420
I feel like I'm part of something now.

702
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Yeah, I feel like I'm finally being represented by something.

703
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,140
That moment of realizing this thing goes farther than I ever imagined.

704
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,580
All of a sudden, it got very real.

705
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,180
Bob Dobbs, the icon of the church of subgenius.

706
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,300
You have seen this guy's face, stickered or stenciled somewhere, haven't you?

707
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,260
This subgenius filmmaking team can only make this documentary

708
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,860
if you share this exceptional project on your social media outlets

709
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,400
— flying saucer radars and obviously smoke signals.

710
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,940
This is not a drill.

711
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,160
We need you.

712
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,020
Get slapped.

713
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:43,140
Uh, yes.

714
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,380
So, I think that was a fake Bob.

715
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,640
They disguised his voice.

716
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,860
And when you see him, it's just a guy with a box on his head and a picture of Bob taped

717
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,920
to the box.

718
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,660
So, I think they didn't really have him signed.

719
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,020
I don't think Bob signed a release.

720
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,020
But for the purposes of the Kickstarter campaign, it was cute.

721
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,940
So, yeah.

722
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,660
Earlier, I was mentioning and playing some tapes.

723
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:27,460
These tapes by David Boone, Reverend David Boone, who also was known as Roberto de la Rosa.

724
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,080
He was one of the very first people to join the church.

725
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:38,640
Before you could even—I mean, before Philo and I had even thought about the membership

726
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,140
thing, or a lot of it.

727
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:49,180
And his widow is the director of this movie, Sandy Boone.

728
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,340
She was at the—

729
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,160
The very first Subgenius D Bible that ever happened.

730
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,900
That was at Philo's house in Dallas.

731
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:04,080
And was involved in the very early days.

732
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,120
And then she got a life.

733
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,200
And then she lost one.

734
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,000
Reverend Boone had to join the saucers.

735
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,520
He had to board the saucers way early.

736
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:19,880
Yes, he boarded the saucers.

737
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,320
And way early.

738
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,020
Way unexpectedly.

739
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:30,980
And she kind of wanted to honor his memory and get back into it, among other things.

740
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,120
It's also a great story.

741
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,020
The true story of the Church of the Subgenius is in some ways a lot more interesting than

742
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,320
the untrue story that most people think of.

743
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,820
You know, that Philo and I just made this stuff up.

744
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,520
The true story with Bob and Connie and all that is really pretty amazing.

745
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,220
Yeah.

746
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,820
It is definitely a tale worth telling.

747
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,400
You've got that—

748
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,020
And wagging.

749
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,980
You're doing it both physically.

750
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,520
It's a tale you can wag, man.

751
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,340
And there's a lot of wags in it.

752
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:08,260
One way that I learned that I was having some back problems was because they—I was sleeping

753
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:16,740
in a lot of different beds during last summer because they kept flying me to places to be

754
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,740
part of the filming.

755
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,200
They filmed stern and—.

756
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,200


757
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,200


758
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,200


759
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,200


760
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,340
Oh, come on, man.

761
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,540
Oh, you're oversleeping.

762
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,140
I'm not.

763
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,480
Yeah, I was—I'm really a bit of a snob when I— sudden attention gets the better of

764
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,160
bike and sleep, and they say, like, see, what's this, za da-da, in your dreams.

765
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,320
Sounded like soon to be planned, but it actually seems pretty creepy.

766
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,100
It does.

767
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,100


768
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,220
Maybe, «E

769
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:48,660
» Right?

770
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,180
at Stang Ranch Fossil House

771
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,100
in Glen Rose, Texas,

772
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,340
and put you on by phone,

773
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,180
just like we do here.

774
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,520
But the difference is you can't hear

775
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,280
Doctors for Bob playing in the background.

776
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,180
Well, sometimes you can.

777
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,160
Were you talking to me?

778
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,740
Yeah, you can't hear the background music

779
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,760
when we do the Texas shows.

780
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,360
Jay's Dave can't hear.

781
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,200
I can intuit it, though.

782
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,520
That's what it goes like.

783
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,620
See, now I can hear the backtrack,

784
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,800
but it's kind of flabby and moist,

785
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,980
kind of like a piece of pound cake over there

786
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,160
that got shoved in your eye.

787
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,940
But if you look a little bit more closely,

788
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,820
you can make a lot of decisions

789
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,240
through the psychic hotline,

790
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,760
through the networks that connect us all

791
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,880
by matters of beams of light

792
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,480
and different stuff like that.

793
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:39,800
Okay, okay.

794
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,780
Yeah, I was just listening to Doctors for Bob there.

795
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:42,900
The background music is the bigger teeth.

796
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:43,960
Yeah.

797
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,760
That was the kind of thing,

798
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,360
you know, you forget that you have

799
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,740
the Doctors for Bob hit songs without the vocals.

800
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,720
That's what I've got in the background here.

801
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,120
And you forget, you know, this radio station

802
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,600
and any other broadcast from the Church of the Subgeast,

803
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,920
you can pick your own soundtrack music

804
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,880
based on your own prefrontal,

805
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,220
all the bottom weeks and so forth.

806
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,240
You know, like you go and you tune in,

807
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,500
you usually got to hear what this radio station

808
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,080
or the other caveat emptory is playing for you.

809
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,300
But in this unit,

810
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,340
you can just press your navel like a little small monkey

811
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,600
and next thing you know, you've got, you know,

812
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,440
Morricone style.

813
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,740
You know, whatever kind of background music style you want.

814
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,560
Yeah.

815
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,540
Why did they let the monkey go

816
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,140
but blame the monkey ranch?

817
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,260
Yeah, that's what I've always,

818
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,480
man, that's been driving me nuts

819
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,180
for about 12, 15, 20 years now.

820
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,900
Like, whoa, whoa, what does it mean?

821
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,000
What, what?

822
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,000
And I never did it.

823
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,280
It's a truthful answer from the demons, you know.

824
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,400
I can tell you what it means.

825
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,160
It's part of, it's part of a song

826
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,900
called Rockin' at the Team Dance by Bob Walkenhorst.

827
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,820
That song, boy, Chaz would have loved it.

828
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,240
The song is actually about the Apollo mission

829
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,720
that exploded on the,

830
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,380
where the astronauts died on the launch pad.

831
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,340
Yeah.

832
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,680
Due to bad manufacturing of a part

833
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,880
and bad use of oxygen.

834
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,100
And sparks.

835
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,340
But yeah, they let the monkey go

836
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,340
but blamed the monkey ranch.

837
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,940
And did you know that they,

838
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,500
politically, they let that go out of control?

839
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,300
Just like when the Challenger went down

840
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,920
after they heard that Ronald Raygun,

841
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,220
that Ronald Raygun has said,

842
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,320
well, I'd really like to see that thing

843
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,660
make it off the launch pad.

844
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,540
It's been a long time.

845
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,800
You know, whatever he said in his sleep and stuff,

846
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,840
but it supposedly was Raygun who said,

847
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,720
oh man, problems with the Challenger be damned.

848
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,240
It's got to go tomorrow

849
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,060
so it looks good on my PR and stuff.

850
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,800
And so they took off and they all died.

851
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,820
I didn't know that about the Challenger.

852
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,260
Well, they said similar things about Gus Grissom

853
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,560
and the purple astronaut, Turford.

854
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,300
Yeah.

855
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:08,760
You know.

856
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,320
Chaffee, White, and Grissom

857
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,160
on a rocket ride to heaven.

858
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,780
You know, the old punk rock song,

859
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,980
was right to hell.

860
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,860
They're scarier, man.

861
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,860
While we've been packing,

862
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,720
I've been listening to my short derper, Sav,

863
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,500
the Rainmakers, a lot,

864
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,400
because I found a whole bunch of new live concerts.

865
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,880
So I've heard all these songs like three times a day.

866
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,420
Me too.

867
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,380
And I know the lyrics perfectly.

868
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,220
It doesn't do the subgeniuses any good.

869
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:46,980
They're pretty good.

870
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:46,980


871
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:46,980


872
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:46,980


873
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:46,980


874
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:46,980


875
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:46,980


876
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,400
Probably getting really tired of hearing that band.

877
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:54,280
I've been playing two to three songs by them every show.

878
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,800
But I can't help it.

879
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,520
That's what happens.

880
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,220
Subgeniuses have short-duration personal saviors.

881
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,520
Sometimes they last a year.

882
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,120
Sometimes they go away and come back again.

883
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,720
And that's the same.

884
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,800
That's the Rainmakers.

885
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,440
Rainmaker syndrome?

886
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,840
No, he loved him a long time ago

887
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,700
and he loves him again.

888
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,160
They disbanded.

889
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,540
They disbanded in the late 90s

890
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,960
and then got back together again

891
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,260
after about a 10-year break.

892
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:23,780
It's funny.

893
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,140
I was watching an interview with this guy

894
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,100
and discovered that he and I

895
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:33,620
have an uncannily large number of things in common.

896
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,320
He's only about one month older than me.

897
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,920
So that means we were watching the same TV shows

898
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,900
and the same kids programming in the morning.

899
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,120
You see, he said he's only one month older.

900
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,940
You're only one month older than he is?

901
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,920
No, other way around.

902
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,440
He's older than me by a month.

903
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,760
Yeah, he's older than you by one month.

904
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,580
Now, you know what that means, man?

905
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,400
No, what does that mean, man?

906
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,660
That means he's one month older than you are.

907
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,220
He knows he's a savant.

908
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,760
May I say, how can I put it?

909
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,420
He's very learned.

910
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,760
They have been around the block experience.

911
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,920
He's very high on that level of where, you know,

912
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,900
company...

913
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,820
Well, yeah, he's got a month more experience than I do.

914
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:25,780
Yeah.

915
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,800
And he's much, much, much better.

916
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,160
He's a whole month wiser than you.

917
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,240
Well, he's a better singer, that's for sure.

918
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,660
I'm sure he's a month wiser than you.

919
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,160
He's a really good songwriter,

920
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,780
although he did use a phrase that I thought I came up with

921
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,080
to describe Princess We.

922
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,080
Oh, I see.

923
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,420
Great minds work...

924
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,960
And he used it in a song.

925
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,940
In circles or something like that.

926
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,400
No, it was flirting with the universe.

927
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,440
Yeah, but people come up with the same expressions.

928
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,400
I actually had a song with that title, but it also pops up in a lyric.

929
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,940
But I don't know, it's a good one.

930
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,920
So, you know, when it's time for steam engines, it's steam engine time or something.

931
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:13,440
Yes.

932
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:13,440


933
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,180
Well, that's what...

934
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,860
You would say if you were a billionaire populist.

935
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,240
But if you were one of the drivers or the engineers of that steam engine, you'd say...

936
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,860
I'd say it's butt-wiser time.

937
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,640
You'd say it's butt-opener time because you're an assassin person.

938
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,880
Never mind.

939
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,740
Sometimes you make me cry.

940
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,120
No, Dave, don't cry.

941
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,040
Please don't cry.

942
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,040
Okay.

943
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,880
I'll try to stop now.

944
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,720
Let's do this.

945
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,380
I'm...

946
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:52,880
I've been terribly emotional lately besides our dog boarding the saucers early.

947
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,020
It's...

948
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:00,120
In a way, we're kind of saying goodbye to this house that we've been in for 16 years.

949
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:06,020
And it's like, you know, when you've had a car for 16 years, it's like your kid.

950
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,900
You don't want to part with it.

951
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,940
And we're not...

952
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,460
The house isn't sold and we'll be back in six months.

953
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:13,960
But...

954
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,700
That'll be for the last time.

955
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,820
That'll be to paint it and sell it.

956
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:22,240
And it's hard removing our personality from the inside of the slacker mansion.

957
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,300
The personality is...

958
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,800
It's been wiped clean and all that's left is the dust.

959
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,200
And it's really pretty depressing right now.

960
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,060
It's like a Hindu sage story and stuff.

961
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:40,340
When you're very young, you're rapidly absorbing things one right after another as quickly as you can.

962
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,500
But when you reach a kind of like middle age,

963
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:43,920
especially...

964
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,740
Especially if you're young middle age, you become attached to one or two things

965
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,160
and really focus on them really hard.

966
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,380
And the next thing you know, you know, it's like,

967
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,260
do I really have to go and have a bunch of fun right now?

968
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,880
I was having so much fun by not having a bunch of fun right now.

969
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,140
I was having so much fun just sitting here by myself.

970
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:06,740
Yeah.

971
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:13,280
Well, I packed up the painting you gave us of the devil man that you saw.

972
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,340
That time, the leprechaun man.

973
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,080
That painting is going to Texas.

974
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:25,200
I packed up about 10 pieces by it.

975
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:25,600
Huh?

976
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,640
Did I really have a leprechaun painting?

977
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,540
Well, it was a red-faced little devil man.

978
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,300
He's a scary guy.

979
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,620
But you said you saw him...

980
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,280
It's like a demon.

981
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,220
Yeah.

982
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,800
You know, that's weird.

983
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,080
It's going to Tejas?

984
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:38,920
Yeah.

985
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,520
Jays.

986
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,900
You know, I live in half in a dream world because I thought I saw it.

987
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,440
I saw it the other day.

988
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,160
And that's not possible because it's going to Texas in Cleveland Heights.

989
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:49,680
That's right.

990
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,660
You gave it to us.

991
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,340
It's in a box with a lot of other paintings.

992
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,340
I walked by it.

993
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,220
Well, as my health app said, my record number was 75 floors.

994
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,320
Goodness.

995
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,240
Well, that means I've walked about...

996
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,180
What's half of 75?

997
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,700
That's how many times I saw that painting that day.

998
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,280
Because you see it when you're walking upstairs into my office.

999
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:10,720
Yes.

1000
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,860
You are either making your complete and total...

1001
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,040
Health assured or you're shortening things.

1002
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,600
Why not both?

1003
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,800
By going up and down those steps seven times.

1004
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,340
Actually, Dave, there is...

1005
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:34,820
Just this morning, I put time-lapse movie of us packing and moving over the last couple of weeks.

1006
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,020
It's about six minutes long.

1007
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,760
At the end of it, it's got an eye-popping scene with a clay head getting its eyes popped out.

1008
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,780
Really good.

1009
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,520
And the eyes, too.

1010
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,200
And that's on the YouTube channel called Revstang.

1011
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,060
There's a lot of interesting short videos on Revstang.

1012
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,320
A wealth, one might say.

1013
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,140
But yeah, all the artwork is down off the walls.

1014
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,300
I packed up two paintings by Dr. Lake Gann.

1015
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:12,620
A lot of paintings by A.P. O'Stacey Fnord or Tori.

1016
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,840
Good, good.

1017
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,140
We have a ton of her art.

1018
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,060
That's her sinus infection named Snorf.

1019
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,140
Her one sculpture is still on the wall, I think.

1020
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,020
It's just too complicated to try to pack.

1021
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,420
I know how we can do it, but we have to find the perfect box.

1022
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,600
Anyway, yeah, Dave, it's been...

1023
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:40,820
You know, it's like you see these boxes that the last time you touched them was the first time you moved 45 years earlier.

1024
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,680
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1025
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,460
Yep, yep.

1026
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:42,660
And...

1027
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:46,740
And sometimes I had to empty them out and put them into new boxes.

1028
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,000
And it'd be the first time I looked at this stuff in 40 years.

1029
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1030
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:57,400
So all these memories come flying back like a hot kiss at the end of a wet fist.

1031
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,520
Yeah.

1032
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,620
And sometimes you forget.

1033
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:05,120
You're like, I was gonna go to art school in Baltimore in 1990.

1034
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,600
There's been a lot of that.

1035
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,180
Why did this happen?

1036
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,380
I mean, I flew to Phoenix.

1037
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,740
Why did I fly to Phoenix?

1038
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,900
Yeah, I've found a lot of things like that that are mysteries.

1039
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,240
Yeah, that's...

1040
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,580
That's...

1041
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,600
Mysteries come back on you like you have the flood of memories.

1042
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,300
And then you're like, you don't even know what the hell you're remembering.

1043
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,380
Um, I don't remember.

1044
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,480
I mean, remembering, remembering, not twice.

1045
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,280
Or, I don't know, or without love.

1046
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,280
Don't forget.

1047
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,960
Means don't forget.

1048
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,500
You know, stuff like that.

1049
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,860
But that's the way the baboons play.

1050
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,440
Their minds are like sharp teeth.

1051
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,980
My mind is.

1052
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,440
Their minds are.

1053
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,580
That is a dangerous mind.

1054
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,140
And their teeth are like sharp minds.

1055
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,660
Minds.

1056
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:02,580
I was once a sharp mime, but now I'm a hypocritical pantomimer.

1057
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,900
I actually worked as a mime for about a week and a half.

1058
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,800
Oh, man, you did not.

1059
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,640
Yes, I did.

1060
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,200
Oh, he did.

1061
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:18,480
In a white face, and I wasn't allowed to wear my glasses, and I wasn't supposed to speak.

1062
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,140
And that was during...

1063
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:29,460
I was delivering balloons to sick or sick people in hospitals, mostly, which was kind of a grim job.

1064
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:37,480
And I discovered in the course of doing that that my fellow Caucasians try not to...

1065
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,040
They try to pretend there's not a clown in the room.

1066
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,560
Everybody else, it seemed...

1067
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:48,240
Well, look at you and kind of chuckle or laugh or, in the case of some children, scream,

1068
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,340
especially if they're trapped in an elevator with you.

1069
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,820
But white folks won't look at you.

1070
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:03,700
If you're a mime, because they're afraid you're going to want money or, you know, you're just...

1071
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:10,540
They can't laugh at a clown because they're afraid to get involved or something.

1072
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,980
And that one looks so cool.

1073
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:12,640
I'm probably saying...

1074
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,200
I'm afraid of this, but it was a very distinctive thing that I noticed.

1075
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,960
It was because I was so white.

1076
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,760
You know, I talk about white people.

1077
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,220
I was in white grease paint.

1078
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:30,180
The worst day was my last day when my un-air-conditioned car broke down on a hot Texas day...

1079
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,800
Oh, good God.

1080
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:35,100
...in downtown Dallas in front of the Salvation Army.

1081
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:42,560
And I had to go into this building full of poor people holding my balloons in a tuxedo...

1082
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,700
with white face on and use the phone.

1083
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,160
And all these homeless people were going,

1084
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,460
Could I have a balloon?

1085
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,320
Just one balloon.

1086
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,300
But I had to deliver the balloon to somebody up in the hospital up the hill...

1087
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:55,780
You were working.

1088
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,980
...who was dying anyway.

1089
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,200
Oh, wow.

1090
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,800
It was just...

1091
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,500
It wasn't...

1092
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,220
Oh, God, that was a horrible...

1093
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:09,740
I wrote or rather recorded my very best stuff while I was doing that very worst of all jobs.

1094
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,080
And I'm still getting paid.

1095
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:17,500
For the hate grants that I did back when I was sincerely hateful and depressed.

1096
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,920
I can't do that anymore.

1097
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,600
I can't do hate grants anymore.

1098
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,660
But I'm not full of hate.

1099
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,560
I'm full of slack.

1100
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,960
Duress produced this wonder.

1101
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,080
And sometimes more than just slack.

1102
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,600
Sometimes I'm full of beer.

1103
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,440
But you got to be careful and not overdo that.

1104
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,620
Are you full of beer sometimes?

1105
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,220
Not on show days.

1106
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,200
Only at night.

1107
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,020
Only at night.

1108
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:42,440
You're doing a mission.

1109
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:42,600
I'm doing a mission.

1110
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:42,640
You're doing a mission.

1111
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:42,640


1112
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:42,640


1113
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,460
I always wait.

1114
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,520
But I'm sure there are plenty of them down in Texas.

1115
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,420
I mean, you're going to miss Oktoberfest in the Cleveland area.

1116
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,020
But there's plenty of them in Tejas.

1117
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:52,780
Plenty of what?

1118
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,260
Out!

1119
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:54,860
Oktoberfest.

1120
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,200
Oh, I don't...

1121
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,140
That's not my style of beer.

1122
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:58,720
I don't like...

1123
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,160
It's just not a pre-show thing.

1124
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,960
It's an après-show thing.

1125
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:09,720
You know, usually when it's the end of a show, which it is nowadays, we have to go.

1126
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,040
I usually have a song, but I don't.

1127
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,640
I don't.

1128
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,860
But I could just play this doctor's for Bob.

1129
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,300
Oh, okay.

1130
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:16,880
Yay!

1131
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,260
We are going to save the universe sometimes.

1132
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,920
Dave, we will call you in a couple of weeks from Texas.

1133
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,160
I hope.

1134
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,300
I hope, too, because if not, that would mean you're burning in Hades, you know?

1135
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:33,580
Right.

1136
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,160
Exactly.

1137
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:39,820
But listeners will hear it about two or three weeks after we actually do it.

1138
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,120
And by that time...

1139
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:42,880
Oh, yes.

1140
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:47,340
I was going to discuss Santa Rosa and what a horrible barbecue is going on there, but...

1141
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:47,700
Yeah.

1142
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,180
After all, just water into the fromage.

1143
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,340
It's a tragic situation, so I guess it's not worth mentioning.

1144
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,800
Cut this part out.

1145
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,580
Okay, man.

1146
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,240
We're going to cut out.

1147
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,520
But it's a live show!

1148
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:04,900
Okay.

1149
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,840
We can't cut you out.

1150
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,320
Oh, stay tuned for next show.

1151
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,300
Cool.

1152
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Which, in this case...

1153
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:19,060
It would be radio synesthesia, except Dr. Sinister's car is still dead or non-existent,

1154
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,620
so it'll be crap radio.

1155
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,120
Praise crap.

1156
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,480
It'll be a crap radio version of synesthesia.

1157
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:26,020
Right.

1158
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:27,940
Praise crap.

1159
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:28,860
Praise crap.

1160
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,940
And good night, Dave.

1161
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,860
I'm fading you down now.

1162
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,680
See you next time, Dave.

1163
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,300
I'm fading me down, too.

1164
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:35,920
I'm fading everything.

1165
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:36,380
Me, too.

1166
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,800
I'm fading you down, too.

1167
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,060
I'm fading you down, too.

1168
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:52,940
I'm fading you down, too.

1169
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,700
I'm fading you down, too.

1170
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,200
I'm fading you down, too.

1171
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,020
I'm fading you down, too.

1172
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,980
I am fading you down, too.

1173
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,480
I'm fading you down, too.

1174
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,220
I am fading you down, too.

1175
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,300
I am fading you down, too.

1176
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,000
I am fading you down, too.

1177
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,640
I am fading you down, too.

1178
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:11,780
Bye-bye.

1179
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:23,200
Thank you.

1180
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:47,640
Thank you.

1181
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,600
Thank you.

1182
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,440
Thank you.

1183
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,720
Thank you.

1184
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,660
Thank you.

1185
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,240
Thank you.

1186
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,960
Thank you.

1187
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,300
Thank you.

1188
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,540
Thank you.

1189
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,720
Thank you.

1190
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,300
Thank you.

1191
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,380
Thank you.
