My name's Joe.
Joe Normal.
I'm just an average kid from a regular all-American family.
My mother is preparing me an average early morning snack.
Toast, cereal, juice perhaps.
Looks normal, mother.
What is it?
I don't think I could find a more normal family anywhere in the whole universe.
You're a freak.
You're a freak.
Who said that!
You're a freak?
You're a freak?
You're a freak, you're a freak!
I'm going down to Mexico to start me a UFO religion.

Amy stands cm agent
you
you
I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm normal.
Miss Letitia Van Allen and the Van Allen dancers.
You've got to taste all the fruit.
You've got to drink all the wine.
Hell, jail wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for all those faggots.
There's always some fruit after you.
That shouldn't bother you, Rusty.
Well, the whole idea makes me want to puke.
A man should act like a man.
Know what I mean?
How should a man act?
He should ball chicks, that's how.
But only if he loves them.
Cigars, cigarettes, chewing gum.
Indianas.
What is norm?
Well, it's what everyone does.
I mean, it's what the majority of society does most.
Yeah.
Come on.
Fill a bit.
Do something.
Just for the...
Fill a bit.
Make every point.
While you taste every giant.
On the fruit.
You've got to taste all the fruit.
All the fruit.
Fruit.
All the fruit.
You've got to taste all the fruit.
Okay, Joe.
You've got 60 seconds till lunchtime.
Let's keep everything normal, okay?
Okay.
Five, four, three.
I'm going to make it.
I'm going to make it.
I'm normal.
I'm normal.
Do people think you're strange?
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Are you abnormal?
Yep.
Are you different?
Do you urinate?
That's the important part.
If so, then you're different.


I'm sure you're going to be interested in what I have to say, my friend.
Are you ready to slide down the cutting edge?
Well, in that case, let's make some noise and praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Yeah.
Now, Bob is famous worldwide as the great traveling salesman of jokes, but more than
that, for his own pithy aphorisms.
The primary one of which is the only law, the one rule of our church, which is to keep
your mouth shut.

And I think you know it, friends.
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.
Bob also said the subgenius must have slack.
That doesn't mean you have to get slack.
That means you must already have slack to be a subgenius.
You're going to find out tonight how much slack you already had, especially once you
leave and the noise stops.
Bob also said you should choose the way you're going to get screwed.
Some ways are fine.
Yeah.
He said that, and this will come in handy on the job, my friends, if you act like a
dumb shit, they will treat you as an evil.
And you try that at work and you'll see what we mean.
Pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.
We have two choices.
We can go with the one that represents our opinions.
The one that represents change or the one that represents the economy.
The scared, fraidy Bob is what I'm going to go with.
I'm going to go with the one that represents hope and change.
But we'll keep the fraidy Bob lurking over my shoulder.
Thanks.
You're thinking entirely too small.
You should have a minion to hold it up during the whole.
You know, I'm not going to do that.

The problem with this religion is a serious lack of minions.
And when we do get minions, they're such messed up people, we chase them away.
We deprogram our own cult zombies.
That's the truth.
Or we try.
There are some that you can't deprogram.
I've run into people who I've had to cross my fingers and go, oh, look, this is all just
made up.
Really.
You know.
You really should join some other religion.
Scientology something.
Because we couldn't deprogram them.
It was.
I want to follow you forever.
If you ever look at alt.slack on the internet, you'll see what I'm talking about.
Alt.
Alt.slack.
That's our forum.
It's not moderated or policed in any way because whoever had to do that would go completely
nuts.
But it's not.

You know, I've never heard anything associated with you to be moderates.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You're driving your butt through the damn cell and bonding your soul into a bunch of
pretty bad lacerations, Chloe.
What's the matter?
Wouldn't she kiss you?
Wasn't a kissing mood, doc.
Yeah, man ain't as good as he used to be.
Don't tell me about it.
I don't know, doc.
One man killed by an animal.
Another darn near.
It wasn't an animal that killed Joe.
The same goes for Chloe.
It was a man.
There were teeth in my mouth.











There were marks of an animal on Joe's throat.
She's right about the teeth marks.
What's the trouble, doc?
I think we both are.
What are you talking about?
Well, it had to be either animal or man.
What are the odds on that, doc?
Man, what you're trying to say is just a lot of poppycock, storybook stuff, the things
kids get nightmares about.
I know, I know.
But a witness saw what looked like a man killed Joe.
And Chloe, you're stone sober.
You got answers for it?
Yeah.
I haven't.
There is a word for what you're saying, Jack.
Yeah, I went to school, Amy.
But...
Mom?
But...
If you think I'm gonna put that in my medical report, if this gets in the papers, they're
gonna think we're all crazy up here.
I don't know whether I should take a sedative so I can sleep or drink coffee to stay awake.
Drink the coffee and eschew the sedatives.
You don't want to be normal, do you?
That clip was from the 1956 movie, The Werewolf.
Before that, Preachings from the Winter Star revival of Ought 9 and from the Baltimore
08 one.
And before that, some 1973 clips from the movie Myra Breckenridge and from the Liquid
TV short called, uh, I'm Normal by Stephen Polman.
Our titles were by Lemur and The Large.
And now back to...
Winter Star 09.
First off, friends, will you be my valentine?
Will you marry me?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, we will all get married.
If you remind me, before I show the video, I'll do a public mass marriage, and we can
all get married.
You know, the funny thing is, the first time I came to a winter star, 18 years ago!


Dennis and Linda Murphy walked up to me.
I'd never met them before, and they said, um, we're married now.
I was going, God, these people are really swingers.
But it turned out to be a spiritual marriage, but they were running around marrying everybody.
You remember that?
Wasn't our honeymoon great, Dennis?
Anyway, um, later on that same night, I walked into the drumming cabin, and Dennis and his




friends were dancing around, little candles on the floor, holding fake snakes.
And I was in such a religious mood from being at Winter Star that I thought they were real
snakes!
I thought I'd walked into a bunch of snake handlers.
It's like, wow, it's just like back home in Dallas!
I grew up in Dallas, Texas, and so did Dr. Philo Drummond, who first introduced me to
Bob, actually.
And, you know, when you grow up in a place like Dallas...
You have to pretend that you're like a Christian and even know what the different denominations
are and stuff.
I was actually raised a secular humanist weirdo.
My dad was a lawyer, what can I say?
But, uh, yeah, I...
Anyway, I'm glad, I'm happy that it's Valentine's Day.
Winter Star actually is a special, it's kind of like an anniversary for Princess Wee and I.
So, I'm married into this group.
I don't actually believe any of this bullshit.
And yet, here I am.
Yes, here I am, friends, lecturing to nice people that I consider superstitious.
Here then are my comments to the large crowd at Starwood 28.
Now, the story is...
Speaking of stupidity...
There's some great titles in the Starwood book.
I usually don't have to write much of a sermon for Starwood because there's so much great stuff just in the schedule.
Um, and this is not to put down the subject matter or the people who taught these courses or workshops or whatever.
It's just that they're funny titles.
Like...
This one.
The Drum Circle is not your backup band.
I've seen that.
It's got me to, um...
I was talking with, uh...
Was it you?
I don't know, somebody.
We were talking about the Starwood dumbassery.
The special dumbassery.
It started, go talk to the Brushwood staff.
Some of the things they have to tell people...
Oh, it started with, uh...
Somebody had left a nice delicate glass on the ground in the drum circle.
And somebody, some dumbass knocked a drum over, broke the glass.
So there's glass all over this place where there's barefoot people chomping around.
And, um...
So number one rule is don't leave glasses in the drum circle.
Breakable glasses.
Also, the drums are not chairs for the public.
And you can't just use anybody's drum that you find sitting around.
Now this is one that the...
Brushwood staff has to actually tell people.
It's in the, it's printed in their rules.
Don't set up your tent in the middle of the road.
And you laugh.
But I have seen people start to do that.
And that was before they even started drinking or doing the drugs.
And there's so much stupid shit that happens out here.
It gets to where some people become stupid shit snobs.
Where they don't...
They're only interested in a certain kind of stupid shit.
And there's a...
They look down on the others who are interested in the other kind of, the lesser stupid shit.
Anyway, the, um...
The drum circle is not your backup band.
Men's Sweat Lodge Workshop.
Now...
That just...
Have you ever stood downwind of a hippie?
How inviting does that sound?
I've actually been there.
I've actually...
I know what a sweat lodge is.
I've actually been in one.
But...
Let's face it.
True origins of the ancient Hebrews.
Now, there's a whole division of redneck kookery that thinks that the true Israel are the people who came north to England.
And then moved to America.
And are now racist bastards.
And they're the true Jews.
That means they get...
They're better than anybody else in the chosen race.
And they get decided to lynch.
I don't think that that was what this one was actually about.
But it brings to mind those...
I'm from Dallas.
You know, if you grew up in Dallas, Texas, wouldn't you start your own religion?
They're all telling you you're gonna go to hell.
So we just developed a bigger and better hell.
A much more interesting hell.
A hell that you can design yourself.
In fact, the subgenius...
You have to go through the subgenius hell first.
Just to be ready for the pleasures of subgenius heaven.
Because otherwise it would just kill you with pleasure.
I was hoping that my colleague Dr. Lecune would be here to elaborate on subgenius heaven and hell.
But he might have taken his chill pills.
And he may be in subgenius hell right now.
We'll see.
An audience with the gods.
Well, that's what I'm getting.
You are the gods.
That's what the New Age says anyway.
Everybody is a god.
That's ungodly.
Actually, you are all gods except for the ones who think you're gods.
You are assholes.
You are just all희.
We see the gods all the time.

Oh, there you are.
There you are.
The whole verecimento here.

Let's go see those去
Where did she go?
Mosey Lady Goal.
Is it at you?
Hey, I'm lying.

Damn straight up hot.
how to party. They know the secret of fire and the secret of rhythm, which the subgeniuses
certainly don't. We're working hard on both of those. So, you know, we're trying to learn
from you, but I know the other half are the fundy pagans. They're the ones who aren't
here. And they're the ones you'd like me to make fun of. Fundamentalists are the same
as they were, and they're fundamentalist subgeniuses. We call them bobbies. But we like to say we
put the fun in fundamentalism. We put the duh in fundamentalism. We put the me in fundamentalism.
We put the is in fundamentalism. The ism. The I. The mmm. It just goes. The mental.
We put a lot of the mental in fundamentalism. That must be old. I'm sure everybody here
has already come up with that.
Oh, the food guy. I just thought, now talk about gods. That's a great name for, that's
a great person to be, the food guy. After I, I feel differently now that I've named
him. Getting real, practicing honesty in relationships. That seems like that would just defeat the
purpose.
Toward a nude model for relationship. Oh no, new model. Pagan speed dating and networking.
I like that one. There's another one that's like redneck meth dating and networking.
Prosperity, a money washing ritual. And we're into that. Prosperity, money laundering, brainwashing.
Same guy.
Same guy.
Same guy.
Same guy.


Same guy.

Food is magic. Food is magic. And the products of food are magic if you believe in Jenkum.
Does anybody here know what, raise your hand if you know what Jenkum is. Okay, I'm not
going to go into that. Just forget it. You don't want to know. I could outgross you,
I could do something worse than anything Paul Krasner said. But I'm not going to lower
myself to scatological humility.
I'd make the reservation open about 94 hundred dollars.

I can do this forever and never to see me.
My father told me every day I have to go. IQue I can't tell you what to do now. I don't tell you.
Such a thing could have happened here, here in my own house.
Oh, what a pity.
But I never dreamed such a thing could happen here to us.
Yes, I remember saying distinctly.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Here's another good title.
Quantum Holographic Fractal Universe.
The four least understood words in the dictionary.
But boy, are they handy.
Using those words.
There's like back in the old days, all you had to do to explain a giant monster was say, atomic radiation.
Well, now all you have to say is, to explain anything, including the JFK assassination,
Quantum Holographic Fractal Universe, man.
Homeopathy tips for...
Dis-ease free living.
No comment.
Teen pool party.
I missed it.
Oh, punctuation enhanced meaning.
I was going to mention that.
I was going through this book, and I noticed that some of the presenters obviously write their own blurbs.
And you can tell the ones who feel the most godly because they, their punctuation has the most...


capital letters.
And they capitalize every noun to give it this profundity, this weight.
And especially if it's a noun describing the things that they're expert in.
Things that are normally not punctualized, capitalized at all.
Now, I'm guilty of comic book punctuation, where certain words have all caps all the way through.
That's a type of kook punctuation.
Unless you're a comic book reader.
You're a subgenius.
Then it's comic book punctuation.
And that's cool.
I think that's about it with the...
Oh, The Dark Side of the Moon.
Damn, I missed that.
What a great title.
I bet it was, too.
Ascend was this morning.
Ascend as opposed to front end.
I suppose.
Oh, and our friend Phil Farber had a thing called introduction to math.


It was about meta magic.
And I read up on that, and it was basically the magic of magic.
And I thought, I should do one that's like meta skepticism.
The debunking of skepticism.
Which is not that hard to do.
The art of possession.
Deity, demon, or departed?
Not enough choices.
I think there's a few.
Steve Gaskin was talking about zen of politics and the transmission of mind.
And I think zen is the best way to look at politics.
Because otherwise you'll just go crazy.
I've been studying radical and reactionary politics and extremes for so long that I've been driven directly into the middle of the road.
Which some people say, this is the most dangerous place to be.
But you know what?
Politics isn't really a road.
And there is a meeting in any way.
And generally we tend to try to stay about 15 feet above the road.
So you can look down on it and get an overview of the whole thing.
And at that point you notice that it's a good cop, bad cop game.
But they're all cops!
Just a gag of all the idiotic, dangerous pranks.
I'm not a cop.
I'm a man.















Give me the police.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What do you need the police for?
Please try to understand.
In some individuals, as little as one millionth of an ounce of these experimental chemotherapy compounds can induce a full-blown psychosis.
Hello.
This is Dr. Bernard Anderson.
I want to report that a Mr.
Todd Stiles.
You stupid.
Todd, please.
Just a minute.
Stupid, stupid.
Mr. Todd Stiles is in an induced psychotic state.
He's at large somewhere in the city and is potentially dangerous to others and to himself.
You know, I'm going to do something that we all have to do eight times a day out here at Brushwood, which is change clothes.
It's really hot.
I'm going to take off this televangelist outfit, as shiny as it is.
You know, it's like in the morning.
You get up and have to put on two pairs of pants and a coat.
And then in about an hour, you have to strip down to a T-shirt and shorts.
And then finally, just a T-shirt.
And then later on, it gets cold.
So suddenly, you're back in the coat and the pants again.
And then you do too much.
You take one chill pill too many.
And then you say, you know, you're naked again.
Even though it's freezing cold.
So.
There's no more coffee.
There's no more to Italy.
There's no more anything anymore.
It's over.
What the?
There goes the bottle.
Kind of a funny taste.
Oh, sorry.
I just had to put that in so you could.
Oh, pardon you.
Oh, well, somebody cleaned that up.
What?
Hal, what are you doing here?
I just put that poison in there.
Well, I'm here with a plan to stick it to the.
Man.
Hey, man, wherever you are, you better watch out.
But I'm dynamite.
Check out my move.
What can we expect from him?
Anything, everything, a whole range of human emotions.
Well, there must be some kind of pattern, some basic pattern.
Yes, there is a basic pattern.
I'm sure you can see it.
Even in microscopic doses, these compounds can induce hallucinations, psychotic state,
both temporary but roughly comparable to those of schizophrenia.
Uh-huh.
I see.
Well, I don't.
I mean, what's going on here?
These two idiots here give my buddy a glass of drugs and make some guard of his mind,
and you stand here, and you talk, and you talk, and you talk.
Well, what do you suggest we do, Murdoch?
Stop talking and get out and look.
How?
I don't know.
Just get out and look.
Where?
Where?
That's for you to know.
Well, that's what I'm trying to find out.
Where?
And how?
I'm sorry.
Go ahead, will you?
All right, doctor, go ahead.
Phase one has already taken place.
Yawning, intense drowsiness, sleep, a minute, an hour, depending.
Then, uh...
Explosions, Bill.
As in this case, but not as a rule.
Possibly you had just angered him, a grievance, an imagined grievance of some kind.
It's possible.
It's very possible.
What did I do?
Look, you and you and you, shut up, all three.
Just shut up.
Murdoch.
Stiles should now be in the swiftly transitory phase two.
Patience describe this as a state of confusion, a feeling of helplessness,
a sleepwalking, a nightmare, lost in a great, mysterious cobweb world.
But, doctor, you said transitory.
Yes.
Well, transitory to what?
Trouble.
Following this state, the really dangerous phases begin.
FIRST, The patient becomes euphoric, high, a giant ten feet tall.
FIRST, The patient becomes euphoric, high, a giant ten feet tall.
Unpredictable. Uncontrollably happy.
At one with the world.
How long does that high stage last?
Good question.
Total effect of the compound will last from six to eight hours,
depending on the individual and upon the amount administered.
Six to eight hours?
You've got to find them before then.
Well, we hope to.
In any event, I'd better be with you to administer the antidote.
This will cut short the effect and greatly ease any after effects.
Well, it's a big town, Doctor.
What happens if we don't find them?
After the high period, what then?
What goes up must come down.
Depression?
First paranoia.
Intense.
Terrible.
Unreasoning terror.
Then depression.
In my own experience, I found that...
You say in your own experience?
All of us working in the field have undergone at least 20
and as many as...
40 sessions with the compound.
And in the final phase of depression,
all of us, even the most stable,
have turned potentially suicidal.
40 sessions, friends.
I've done a...
Actually, I've done 150 sessions.
Thanks to Lemur and Mr. Sistar for the cuts
from Route 66 to Mr. Sistar
and to Ace.
In Cleveland.
Which puts on Starwood every year.
They also put on Winterstar in the winter.
And coming up,
some pagan put-on
from what they put on at Starwood.
And we also heard some puzzling evidence show
from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Howell.
Now, back to Starwood 09
and my reviews of my fellow presentars.
Oh, Paul Krasner's thing, Porn Soup.
When I read that title, I thought,
now that's false advertising.
I just know it is.
But it wasn't.
It was for...
He was telling the truth.
I've seen those websites, every single one of them.
He's talking about the scandals.
Terrible.
It's awful, the things that we're doing.
Oh, Ferry Races of the British Isles.
That was just done a little while ago in the lounge.
And I had been wondering about the ferry races.
I heard the...
They were doping the ferries,
and there was a big scandal about that.
They were going to call off ferry racing
because of all the illegal doping.
And...
Oh, and also, experimental...
My friend Beth Rosemary was doing
experimental ferry working.
I thought that the slave trade in ferries
had been maybe illegal.
Ferry working.
How can...
What are they good for?
Tying your shoelaces?
Standing in nowhere.
Well, here I am.
Oh, and here's the...
I'm going to finish with this one.
Kenny Kline's...
This is the most honest title of all of these.
Opinionated history of pagan music.
He didn't say a history of pagan music.
He said opinionated history of pagan music.
And that is...
Honest.
And that's good.
What time is it?
Oh, my God.
Friends, you don't have to sit
and watch this defilement.
Nor do you have to sit and watch
the stupid TV shows you complain about.
Somebody was complaining about
our stupid blather on alt.slack.
And British subgenius,
Reverend Diva Schematic...
Oh, she was replying to somebody who said,
anybody who's really into Star Wars...
is a mental defective who needs to be put down.
It's like, doesn't that describe pretty much everybody?
And she said,
you aren't forced to watch these things, idiot.
If you don't like being fucked up the ass with a brick,
stop sitting on the brick!
So that was the word solidified.
My friend Sodi said,
in the gap between the best possible result
and the best result...
possible lurks slack.
And as Nenslo said,
the Church of the Subgenius
is like steroids on acid.
And then there's Sock-a-to-me.
Yeah, Sock-a-to-me.
Boc-a-lock-a-lock-a-boob-boob.
Bocula? Oh, no, that's a bone inside the raccoon's...
Well, you know, I mean...
Error.
And not just a raccoon, but other...
animals.
Nothing known to contain such a...
device.
Hello.
Honk.
So this is the way you go to school.
This is the way you wear your pants.
This is the way you wash your face.
This is the way you comb your hair.
This is the way you tie your shoes.
And this is the way you make your pants.
This is the way you button your butt.
This is the way you do everything.
This is the way you brush your teeth.
And that's part of everything.
Not upside down.
No.
So, um...
Look at the size of that creature.
Easy enough. Easy for you to say.
The Brontosaurus.
A moving mountain of flesh and bone.
So last week, uh...
Yeah?
The episode was called,


The episode before last.
Now which episode was that? Let me look in my planner.
That was the one you left that...
You started to say that one thing...
What?
At that one juncture. That one...
crucial...
juxtaposition.
Between concept A and...
I suppose...
Extension of concept Q-R-Y...
We have to get into that now?
Exponent Y.
I don't know if it does us any good to recapitulate these old problems...
when we have so much...
before us.
In the future. In the immediate future.
Can you help us call it a go?
Yes.
I'm here, my boy.
This is Reverend Neuromancin calling.
Well, and the top of the morning to you.
Neuromancin, huh?
Yes, Neuromancin. Hi, hello you.
Yes, don't take too much Neuromancin.
And what can we do for thee?
Well, I was just curious.
You know, knowing that, uh...
fanboyism is almost a canon word...
to religiousness...
Uh... idolatry.
What do you think of the new Star Trek movie...
coming out?
Well, obviously, most people wouldn't be able...
to give such an answer, since as you point out...
the movie is coming out, and has not...
come out. Therefore, no one can be expected...
to have seen it. But I, with my...
occult powers, have viewed...
this movie in its entirety.
And I can tell you that it's the...
best reconstituted Star Wars...
I mean, Star Trek movie...
that one could possibly have, according...
to, uh, current trends and such...
Well, such things are inevitable.
Yeah, but, uh...
also, remember, now the fans...
the nerds, all these people...
they are now in control.
They are now a majority, not an isolated subculture.
They will make the movie...
the way they want it to.
Yes, you will die before you see the movie...
version of Star Trek.
I want to spend $500 million on a movie, and I want...
to spend it all on a cardboard set.
Tish Tush, my boy, that is...
chicken feed these days.
$500 million? How about $10 billion?
The entire thing made in front of a green screen.
How about... how about...
infinity billion?
How about vintage?
Then they get on YouTube and instantly it makes money.
Yeah.
Right, that's a great way to make money.
Put everything on YouTube and, man,
the cash starts rolling in.
And when the weekend's over and September rolls down...
Yes, YouTube is the path to stardom, friends, for somebody.
In the meantime,


we at the Subgenius Foundation
have made a bunch of new movies,
or rather,
in some cases, posted
a lot of old movies.
They're animated,
and they offer mind control
over you by us,
if you dare.
YouTube account RevStang
will take you there,
as will any click
on subgenius.com.
Yes, we did a bunch of
animation and music.
But that is not
the most important
thing in life.
The most important
thing in life is dinner.
And that's about to happen.
But first we will show
one of these
brainwashing videos.
These things, by the way,
are meant to replace recreational drugs.
I occasionally find
people using them
with recreational drugs.
And that's like...
Well, too much is always better than not enough.
As Bob said.
But it's almost as bad.
So I guess we will show
part four.
Did you bring any recreation for me?
But this
cerebral reformatter...
Rev. Stang, what is that
one law you were saying there's one law...
Oh, there's one law in the Church of the Subgenius.
I'm sorry, I forgot to mention it.
The one law in the Church of the
Subgenius is...
Fuck everybody, can't take a show!
We'll just show this one.
It's 13 minutes long and then you can go eat.
And it will make you feel
like you're on acid.
I hope.
If you like acid.
Now for a moment, let's consider
an entirely different type of case.
The case of Bob,
one which shows how ambitious men
can get ahead under our American
system of free enterprise.
When Bob graduated from high school,
Bob was surprised to learn
that this Bob Society had created
a special type of life for people
of his type. Right, Bob?
Well, life never was a burden.
In the first place,
Bob's flexible.
Bob can expand or contract.
Now, Bob
has gone far.
Why not profit by Bob's example?
Send the postcard care of this station
to the Bob Society.

Hey

He loves you, Bob.
You love Bob.
You have to.
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?
He'll kill you.
So Bob, you out.
Him, Bob, you out.
She's 24-3 now.
You heard it here first.
You don't love Bob.
You have to.
You have to.
You have to.

Raw meat.
Yeah.
Bob, calm now.
You better investigate.
You may get into trouble.

In that van.
Yeah.
There's something familiar about him.

Bob solvent.
Bob won't solve your problems.
But he will help you to blow them off!
You can't use Bob as a crutch because
he's already using you as a crutch, my friend.
Mr. Pornriver speaking.




Well, gee, it's Bob

Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning. This weekend we commemorate Bob Day.
Bob is a proven leader who has served six presidents, four Republicans, and two Democrats.
And he has shown that he is an agent of change.
And I am deeply grateful for his service.
Clear. Clear. And I pledge to the party.
He doesn't care about your sins.
He comes not to forgive, but to rationalize your sins.
He brings not forgiveness, but an excuse.
And what did you really need?
If you want your sins forgiven, friends, do it yourself.
If you're a subgenius, you're probably already pretty good at that.
Jesus may have died for your sins,
but Bob Dobbs made a damn fool of you.
Of himself.
And of you.
For your sins.
Hello, Bob, and I'm so happy to give my personal testimony.
Fifty years ago, I was a freshman in high school,
and that happened May 10, 1941.
I accepted Bob as my personal savior, and he's never let me down since.
I'm a retired teacher, a widow, I've had cancer and all kinds of stuff,
but he's always by my side.
Thank you so much.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Did Bob and sex go hand in hand?
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex.
Slack can come when you throw good money after bad and bad money after Bob!
And you can do that at our lovely sales table down there.
Bob?
That is a cut from the video soundtrack of Subgenius Igasm Part 4.
By yours truly, Lemur and Norell,
of which you can see a lot more if you check out the Rev Stang pages on YouTube
or Subgenius Igasm on Google.
But these are soundtracks of videos.
Normally we have attractive preachers and we don't need the video as a distraction,
but we'd love to program your mind with the image of Bob.
Incidentally, you see the parts where the picture gets really fuzzy and grainy?
That's where the actual brainwashing code is.
It's not what you think.
It's not what you are consciously seeing,
but it's the fuzzy stuff and the weird little sound effects and things.
That's where the actual brainwashing is.
Morgan.
Newspaper says they found an animal's teeth marks in the dead man's throat.
Morgan, what have you done?
Done?
Accomplish is a better word, Emery.
Someday it will happen.
The human race will destroy itself.
Not quickly, but slowly.
That wolfman is the proof.
Radiation creates mutants, people who become monsters no longer human.
They'll make the hydrogen bomb more powerful, then more powerful again.
Enough to change every person that faced the earth into a crawling inhuman thing through fallout radiation.
Would you really believe it'll happen in our lifetime?
The science of destruction always gains on us, Emery.
It could happen tomorrow, next day, next week.
I don't know.
But it won't happen to us.
Well, how can you be sure?
By a slow series.
By a series of inoculations.
We can immunize ourselves.
And a small select group, just as I'd planned.
When the rest of the world has been destroyed, we will be the only normal thinking persons left.
The perfect science, Emery.
The one that ends all science.
Perhaps it would have been better not to know what's coming.
Ridiculous.
It'll mean the beginning of a new kind of world.
A world that'll start without...
hatred.
And we'll be the ones to give it up.
To the birth.
Who wants to...
Oberon did this one, I guess, yesterday.
Who wants to live forever?
And friends, I don't.
When you're young, not only do you want to live forever, but you think you're going to.
And it's even developed to the point where there's a theory called the singularity, right?
Kurzweil was the guy who came up with this.
The idea that the computers are getting so much faster, and we're learning so much, and there's this curve, right, of knowledge.
And we're now approaching this part of the curve of knowledge, where we're learning so much so fast,
that at some point, the computers will get much smarter than us, and they'll rebuild new computers that are even smarter,
and they'll have the answers to everything, and everything will be perfect in about 50 years.
And that's called the singularity.
So if you can live that long, you might well be able to live forever.
And I think that's a beautiful religious belief.
But what it leaves out is the ideogularity, the opposing force.
As some of you may have seen that movie Idiocracy, which shows the opposing force.
Yes, praise Mike Judge.
He used to listen to our slack when he lived in Dallas, by the way.
And, you know, that's the thing.
It's a race.
It's a race.
Which will we get to first, the ideogularity or the singularity?
And I personally, I think that all of, ever since 1998, I haven't been much for predictions.
I must say.
And Frank Zappa said, you know, we all grow up, oh, yeah, Sylvia was saying,
every generation has its own dystopia.
When I was growing up, at first, the dystopia.
Dystopia was like Planet of the Apes or Road Warrior.
It was going to be a nuclear holocaust and all civilization was going to get destroyed
except for the baddest asses and the gorillas or something.
Unfortunately, I wish.
But then there was the 1984 dystopia, which some people grew up with.
And now the kids have grown up with the global warming dystopia and so forth.
You know, it's different for each person.
And I'm 55 now.
And I'm glad that I probably won't live to, you know, to be 150.
Because I see things getting dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber.
And I used to, my dad used to say, I'd be listening to Jimi Hendrix and go,
that stuff.
Not even music.
It's just noise.
Now I'm starting to hear my own friends that are my age go, that's rap music.
That's not even music.
That's just noise.
Well, they were both right.
But the thing is, you know, you turn on the TV.
The less you watch TV, the dumber it looks when you do watch it.
And it's every time I try to live in my own little ivory tower and talk to nothing but subgeniuses.
And that's depressing enough.
But, you know, I was telling my friend Nikki, it's like, she's 20 years younger than me.
And she'll have to see 20 years more worth of dumb assery than I'll have to.
Now, I might not live to see the free energy thing or, you know, Mr. Fusion.
I might miss out on some good stuff.
But at the same time, I think it's best that we old folks make room for the young ones.
Because I don't think.
I think we're tough enough for some of the crap they're going to have to deal with.
We're in the middle of a species, a mass extinction.
There's been a lot of them.
You know, most people know about the one that wiped out the dinosaurs.
But there was actually a couple before that that were much, much worse.
And there have been some since then.
And we're the latest one.
It's been going on for about 50,000 years.
And it's really coming to a head.
And.
I don't have any advice at all.
I can't tell you what your slack is.
I can't tell you how best you can fight the conspiracy.
As St. Kim Kesey put it, put your good where it'll do the most.
I don't know what your good is.
Maybe your good is voting for Rush Limbaugh for president.
Hell if I know.
But it's, you know, it is up to you.
It's up to you and your slack.
And I'm glad I'm not going to live forever.
And then it's all it's all of subgenius 101.
But I don't think I need to explain any of that to you.
I think you already know everything you need to know.
As my father said to my son, I know everything worth knowing.
And your dad knows everything else.
Oh, by the way, I have to announce, I honestly really thought about this.
I'm a grandfather now.
I'm so old.
I've become a grandpa.
My daughter.
Had got married and then had a child.
It's convenient when it happens in that order.
And I was going to just show slides of my beautiful new grandson for the whole hour.
But I think Judith talked me out of it at the last minute.
Yeah.
Yeah.
By the way, friends, hit those vendor tables.
It's Valentine's Day.
There's somebody you need a gift for.
It may be you.
And the money's not worth anything.
So don't worry about it.
As Onan said in that rant, you already have all the money you're going to need for when you're dead anyway.
That's one way to think about it.
Of course, Onan's only 40.
He's a young fellow by my standards.
Man, my age needs his sleep.
Oh, and could I ask a question, Dr. Howell?
Well, we probably have time to squeeze in one question.
You just did ask a question.
Please go ahead and ask a question.
Oh, excellent question.
Thank you.



Second question.
This is your second question.
Yeah.
Regarding Dr. Wortham's comics and stories, do they still exist now?
I remember back when I was a kid, I did some filler art for it.
And you had your wonderful, wonderful, wonderful insect porn comic.
I'm glad you remember that story.
Of course, it was not considered porn, although insect human sex did take place in the story.
Oh, yes.
Bug.
But of course...
Brr.
Yes.
Well, I'm glad it affected you on a visceral level.
And that comic story is now in obscurity because no one reads those comics anymore.
But I would say that the comic still has the potential to exist.
A potential in embryo, still waiting to be born, endlessly gestating until enough popular interest causes the resurrection and the re-germination of life.
Oh, yeah.
And we who endure the endless winter of public indifference...
Oh, yes. One day. One day.
...must have...
...a little bit of faith that at the end, life once again will germinate in the raw soil and the re-fecund earth will flower in a fluorescence of literature, comic books, and the graphic novels.
And this young man will once again find slack.
Slack.
Or maybe not.
You said that on the radio.
No, thanks for the nice words about my comic book story.
Oh, yes.
I guess he will.
When I got...
When I got into that, I was only about 16 at the time.
I wasn't even legally old enough to read the comic, but I drew for the comic.
Well, and it affected you in some way, you're saying?
Oh, yes. I would say it affected me vitally.
Now, I'll have to tell that to Mr. Saul, who also worked on the same story.
Yes. Thank you so much. I now remember the name. Thank you for that input.
His name was Ron Saul.
Ron Saul.
And the story you refer to was entitled Galloping Insect Phobia.
Yes.
Well, what do you know? There you are. Radio makes connections out of the past, just as if radio were MySpace, YouTube, or...
Brain memory.
Where are that you now?
That's where radio goes now.
Twitter, Flutter, Tatter.
Radio is just like that.
Tatter, yeah.
It's like a thing that makes voices come out of the air.
I know, it's magical.
It's weird.
When I was little, I thought...




There were little people in the radios doing the sound.
LinkedIn, Shutout, YourFace, .com.
And the next thing you know...
And the name of it?
Next thing you know, you've got a big box of chocolates, 30 different kinds inside of it.
A box of chocolate.
You're just going to start at one end and work your way to the other.
And you don't even care what flavor you get.
Well, I care.
And it's definitely hard...
You don't even tell where the caramel is.
You're going to eat them all anyway, so...
But no, I only want the caramel.
But once you open one, you have to eat it, even if it's a chocolate-covered cherry cordial.
Even if it's...

Choke, retch, coconut.
The worst of them all.
Don't let me stop!
How about some whorehound drops?
See, this is a man who for sure makes a candy little child.
Oh, that cocoa butter.
Better like...
Yes, that cocoa.




Cocoa butter has a hypnotic power to put you under my commandment.
Oh, yes.
And then after years of inactivity, I can reanimate these sleepers with a special code word that comes in that 3 a.m. phone call.
And if he does it once...
You pick up the receiver, and while you're still groggy, before you have a chance, before your mind can make a defense, I give you...
Sigm...
Similacrum...
Sim...
Seven.
Seven.
Seven?
And if he does it once, he can do it again?
That's right.
I can do it any old time I want.
But if he does it once...
Yeah, I might not choose to do it, so you gotta treat me nice.
You have to do it at least once.
At least for the first time.
What was that?
Speak into the rectifier.
Rectifier?
Oh!
Not that close.
My rectal voice can only be so high.
Well, uh, you...
Do you have a large collection of these comic books?
I did.


I had one. Then I got burglarized, and most of them went poop.
So, burglars took them, eh? A likely story.
Yes.
Burglars took them.
I only have what's in my memory.
Burglars took his comic books.
Burglars took my mind.
Burglars would want comic books.
Like your mom took your comic books.
I had a junkie take my comic books.
Oh, my mom got me into the comic books. Don't get me started.
My mom...
She flattened him between the comic book pages.
My mom took my comic books and threw them in the trash once.
Dad gave my dog one.
Oh, my mom used to be a editor...
And I snuck out there and got him back.
Good for you.
And Milo the Overman turned to rock and roll.
And you...
Praise God!
Praise God!
Hail God!
Hail God!
