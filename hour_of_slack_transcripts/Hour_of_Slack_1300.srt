1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,280
While Nick television used ta-da-sody Snap up a telenovela!

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,580
Tell me I'm

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,640
a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,200
One man, one woman,

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,980
one man.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,340
How's that?

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,280
You're a wish-not.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,380
Ah-ho!

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,140
Well,

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,560
aren't you a Bobby Dazzler?

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,460
How's that?

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,580
You're a wish-not.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Ah-ho!

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,340
Well,

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,980
aren't you a

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,320
subgenius?

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,400
Yes, I am.

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,120
Now, I can't stay but a minute,

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,960
but here's a welcome home pie for you.

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,260
Oh, thank you.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,180
Where are the kids?

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, they're out in the backyard with Bob.

23
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,520
I know he's going to break his neck.

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,860
How are they doing?

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,660
Um, they're much better now that we're back at home.

26
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,220
Oh!

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,660
Bob for the fan, yes!

28
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,100
Yeah!

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,120
Whoa!

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,320
We win!

31
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,300
We win!

32
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,680
Me next!

33
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,020
Me next!

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,800
Oh, I think I'm getting too old for this stuff.

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,300
Yeah!

36
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,880
Oh, please, Daddy, please.

37
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:21,640
Oh!

38
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,500
Oh!

39
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,980
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:45,220
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,220
Oh!

42
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:47,980


43
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,840
Oh!

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,380
Oh!

45
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,980
Thank you.

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:52,180
That music was by Sodi from Music for Imaginary Monster Movies.

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,060
And the upper parts were by The Large.

48
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,280
And the background music here is a great band called Electric Junkyard Gamelon,

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,520
who we saw play live at Starwood.

50
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,780
This is the Hour of Slack number 1300,

51
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,680
which doesn't quite spell Bob, but we're getting there.

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,220
And it happens that for this episode, 1300,

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,180
we're doing a special on last year's Starwood 30.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Starwood's been around for 30 years,

55
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,020
and number 31 is coming up directly after the world ends at Wisteria.

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,120
Same place in southern Ohio as X-Day is now held,

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,680
and where almost all of the following was recorded,

58
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,400
except for the parts from Radio Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland,

59
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,620
where we called in right after arriving back home at the Slacker Mansion,

60
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:01,420
still just a bit toasty from doing both the Subgenius and Starwood festivals in a row,

61
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,860
as we might have to do this year.

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,800
We begin with Princess We Are Doe and I starting to explore the new Starwood site,

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,940
very late on Wednesday night.

64
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,960
It's almost like a 1-18th of a Burning Man.

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,140
This one guy in a little PVC dome swinging a torch around.

66
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,880
That's only thanks to the other Ivan.

67
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,740
If it wasn't for the other Ivan, we wouldn't have that.

68
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,840
That looked like an Ivan dome.

69
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,720
It must be one.

70
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,840
This truly is an outdoor hippie festival,

71
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,040
with chemical toilets,

72
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,980
and pickup trucks and tents.

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,660
I suppose it could be a biker convention or a rock and roll concert.

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,640
It's Starwood is what it is.

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,920
It doesn't look like Starwood.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,020
It's in a different place.

77
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,320
It sounds like Starwood.

78
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,820
Yeah, it does.

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,840
There's a little candlelit altar,

80
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,340
and a tent lined with colorful Christmas lights.

81
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,360
It's a pretty big bonfire there, isn't it?

82
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,380
Yeah, there's a nice sized bonfire, and that's not the main bonfire, right?

83
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,260
No.

84
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,280
That's going to be the bonfire site later?

85
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,700
No.

86
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,240
No.

87
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,440
Because they'd have to build it.

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,420
That's Paw Paw, I bet.

89
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,340
Paw Paw?

90
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,580
Yeah.

91
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,860
Is that the Paw Paw Patch?

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,260
Yeah, Paw Paw Patch.

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,240
Are there naked hippie chicks there?

94
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,180
Probably.

95
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,220
Or at least topless?

96
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,540
Probably.

97
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:37,980
Maybe.

98
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,320
Oh, oh, oh, see?

99
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,100
Look up there.

100
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,580
The Puffer Dome.

101
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,120
Look at that.

102
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,880
The Puffer Dome.

103
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,200
Oh my God, it's beautiful.

104
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,180
It's Waking Dream.

105
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,620
It's Waking Dream and their psychedelic Puffer Dome.

106
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,400
There's sexy movies projected all over the outside in crazy patterns.

107
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,560
Hello.

108
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,540
Finally, there's some hippies.

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,220
This is the first hippies we've seen the whole time we've been walking up this road for ten minutes.

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,640
We saw the hippie camps.

111
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,020
Now, where's the witches?

112
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,940
I've seen hippies.

113
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,660
Where are the witches?

114
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,080
I see the bikers.

115
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,840
I see the...

116
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,500
I never saw the trailers.

117
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,560
I've never seen the...

118
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:17,800
The losers.

119
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,300
I see the lame brains.

120
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:19,820
I'm real confused of where we are because I never saw the trailers yet.

121
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,740
But where's the witches?

122
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,620
I'm real confused of where we are because I never saw the trailers yet.

123
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,920
And that's my orientation spot.

124
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,120
Well, there was a...

125
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,420
Like the shower place back there, right?

126
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,540
Yeah, that's a...

127
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,000
That's different.

128
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,480
So you're lost.

129
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,660
You're already lost at Starwood, at the new Starwood site.

130
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,020
Yeah.

131
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,000
Princess Wee is lost.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000


133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000


134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000


135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000


136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000


137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000


138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000


139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,580
I'm lost at Starwood.

140
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
I'm lost.

141
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,100
This reminds me of walking around crazily tripping at Burning Man, except we're not

142
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,640
tripping and it's not Burning Man.

143
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,060
But the domes full of multimedia shows look the same.

144
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,220
So now you know, Bob, Slack the Conspiracy.

145
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,560
How does that apply to the Starwood tour guide?

146
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,560
My favorite document of the year.

147
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,980
This year, Princess Wee are dozed.

148
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:23,220
I'm going to go through this and look at the names of the workshops and stuff.

149
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,840
If you happen to be giving one that I make a sarcastic comment on, believe me, I'm not

150
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,760
really commenting on your workshop.

151
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm commenting on my quirky first...

152
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,780
idea when I saw the title.

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Now there's one, Creating Your Own Tarot Layouts.

154
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,880
It so happens that for all of a sudden this year, there is a subgenius tarot deck.

155
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,380
For 30 years, that's been a running joke.

156
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,000
Every new subgenius has to say three things.

157
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,800
Hey, did you know Bob spelled backwards is Bob?

158
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,200
Hey, I got a joke for you.

159
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,100
Bob, damn it.

160
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,940
And the third one is, hey, what about a subgenius?

161
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,840
What about a subgenius tarot deck?

162
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,860
Finally, somebody did one.

163
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,840
And I was the fool.

164
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,160
They had me as the fool.

165
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,440
Okay, anyway, I see we have a course in the horned god.

166
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,800
We have, believe it or not, there's people who hate the Church of the Subgenius and consider

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,620
it really dangerous, huge, because it's part of the...

168
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,660
Because they...

169
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,640
They...

170
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:38,920
They...

171
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


172
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


174
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


175
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


176
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


177
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


178
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


179
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


180
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


181
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


182
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


183
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


184
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


185
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


186
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


187
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


188
