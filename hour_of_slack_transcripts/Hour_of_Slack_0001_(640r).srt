00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
This is Doug Smith, radio operator. I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,120
I'm in a bus! Like it!

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,320
No trouble. Get set, get going.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,100
According, everything's going fine. No trouble.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,280
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:25,980
Bob?

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,100
Bob?

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,780
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,860
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,040
What about slack?

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,780
That's your key phrase. It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,620
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,080
Sponsored by...

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,140
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:09,140
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,160
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,900
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:27,760
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of Salem on planet Earth.

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,620
The message is now live and available.

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,540
Are we controlled by secret forces?

21
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,620
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

22
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,880
Do people think you're strange?

23
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,260
Do you?

24
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,740
Then you may be on the right track.

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,360
Are you abnormal?

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,080
Then you are probably better than most people.

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, your time shall triumph!

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,440
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,520
This is it.

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,920
The only faith that promises.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,860
Action, thrill, success in sex and business.

32
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,020
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,780
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,220
Bob is a way of life to millions.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,600
Yet half of them don't even know it.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:25,140
He's the one true living Slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

37
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,720
He is the one real shortcut.

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,840
The shortcut to Slack.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,020
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

40
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,320
This fear, the stark fist of removal no longer.

41
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,100
Become physically attractive overnight.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,460
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,260
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,000
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

45
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,700
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

46
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,700


47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,940
And coming right back.

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,780
And coming right back.

49
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,880
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,760
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

51
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,540
To turn conspiracy and kind of personality disorders around.

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:21,400
And channel them into an illusion of creativity that will fool normals and get you sex.

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,500
This is the Closed Cerebrovirus Podcast.

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,340
Welcome to the broadcast.

55
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,140
This is KNON 90.9 FM, Dallas, Fort Worth.

56
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,440
And this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

57
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,140
Buck.

58
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,220
Pastor Buck, naked, and I are....

59
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,380
Oh yes.

60
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,060
So glad.

61
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,160
So glad to be back on the air in Dallas.

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,260
You know, because it's about time that this city got the word of Bob.

63
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,960
Because these are the end times, folks.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,480
And the time's running out.

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
But in the meantime, oh, it feels so good to have the power.

66
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,760
The power.

67
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:28,360
The sheer power over men's minds that comes with this amazing and very difficult to technically operate.

68
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,800
You can hear me switching the little wellmans around here.

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,260
This is a completely digitally controlled show.

70
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,340
May I make a request of our listening audience?

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,640
Yes, brother naked.

72
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,200
Please do.

73
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,820
If any of you out there are DJs at this station,

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,960
and if you know where to find that Violent Femmes record,

75
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,200
where I can play Blister in the Sun on it,

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,740
I'd sure play it.

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,200
I'd appreciate it.

78
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,460
So give us a call at the station.

79
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,480
If you're a DJ here and you know where that record, Violent Femmes, is stashed.

80
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,540
And remember, folks, only on KNON can you hear the kind of, well, what you're going to be hearing.

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,240
Those other stations, those neutered stations, they can't take, they cannot take the uncensored word of Bob.

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,860
They thought that they might be able to use it.

83
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,360
But when they found the full truth, they couldn't take it.

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,480
Plus, they can't take it.

85
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:20,740
They can't take it.

86
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:20,740


87
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:20,740


88
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,660
So many edits and cuts, as you're going to be hearing on this show.

89
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,800
This will probably have more edits and cuts per hour than any other show in Dallas or possibly world history.

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,700
Also, we've got sports later, too.

91
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,700
Table sports.

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:34,960
That's right.

93
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:43,920
Sports and a lot of music and media barrage tapes and lessons in Slack that will bless your heart and anoint your gland.

94
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,100
And right now, I think Pastor Naked, if you're ready with the band over there,

95
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,020
is going to play an inspirational...

96
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,960

, say from bob in the room that you told me about things we're going to do together living at Jack in the Operation, . Just beware. I think we may have a few things to talk about before we get to your ketchup cup, let me know. I've always thought at all of the time and whatnot. Do you want to hear about it? No, we've been talking for a while. I'd rather be sadder, moreated into nostalgia question, 47 nineties. б Here

112
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,640
uh yes

113
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,300

that was a beautiful hymn and that did

117
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,440
anoint my gland

118
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,740
I must warn everybody that I have

119
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,460
a cold tonight it's sort of a

120
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,300
it's the subgenius virus

121
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,360
and anybody who

122
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,680
hears my voice

123
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,580
while listening has a chance that you

124
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,680
may catch it it depends on what kind of radio

125
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,260
you have and whether you're in the car

126
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,460
but you should be in headphones if you can

127
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,440
get your headphones on and your tape decks ready

128
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
if you're the kind of person that tapes

129
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,420
stuff that you can't ever hear any

130
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,240
other place because there are going to be some

131
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,360
stereo rampages

132
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,620
and uh audio whip arounds

133
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,140
unlike anything you've ever heard

134
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,140
some pretty abnormal material

135
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,420
coming up here so uh first thing up

136
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,200
this is uh we got a

137
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,500
we got this record in the mail from this

138
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,100
this guy named Zug's

139
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,400
Rift Zug's Rift

140
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,360
in Los Angeles

141
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,140
this is some of the most

142
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,220
beautiful music I've

143
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,960
ever heard

144
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,740
rock with me

145
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,200
do the hourly thing

146
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,980
do the hourly thing

147
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,660
do the hourly thing

148
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,440
do the hourly thing

149
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,740
time to put it away and move on to a new

150
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,360
type of

151
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,940
it's so dead to me

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
it's no laughing matter

153
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,260
it's no laughing matter

154
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,340
that's as if I'm willing to make value judgments

155
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,300
which I'm not

156
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
it certainly ain't no permanent

157
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,820
solution

158
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,060
oh she got home

159
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,140
who knows when another one

160
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,840
will come along

161
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,040
I can't stand no

162
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm not going to stand

163
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,420
you're the master

164
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,320
you're the master

165
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,860
you're the master

166
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,120
you make me cheese

167
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,900
cut me no

168
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,820
not that I need to say anyhow

169
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,480
it's the voice of the

170
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:07,840
it's the voice of the

171
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,660
it's the voice of the

172
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,980
you're the king of the jungle

173
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,920
difficult insignify

174
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,680
walls

175
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,500
big walls

176
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,080
that it's be

177
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,220
like what

178
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,260
that it's be like

179
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,260


180
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,260


181
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,260


182
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,260


183
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,260


184
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,840
lubrica

185
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,440
You are fat!

186
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,540
What will I do?

187
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,760
You're fat as a possum crab, Jocko!

188
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
That was so in the previous video!

189
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,580
Then it never begun!

190
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,840
They're a ladies present!

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,220
I found an again for the first time!

192
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,520


193
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,520


194
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,060
Sit down!

195
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,180
It's a pleasure to be here!

196
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,380
This is a replica of a real fan!

197
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,600
You are proud of me!

198
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,220
I think you are going to ruin it!

199
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,860
You know why I have money!

200
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,100
You know that!

201
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,340
You're trying to steal it for the morbid curiosity!

202
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,860
I don't know what I'm doing!

203
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,540
I'm trying to make a meter wave!

204
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,500
You're not going to make it!

205
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,600
This is not going to work!

206
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,540
What is this shit?

207
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,580
Why do I have to hear this?

208
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,220
He's his mom!

209
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,420
Great!

210
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,160
He's the one who lost it!

211
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,200
It's all in you, honey!

212
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,600
It all comes to life!

213
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,920
Welcome to my worldly treasures!

214
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,440
Where did you get this whole thing?

215
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,580
You were holding this all day!

216
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
It's because you're sick!

217
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,100
They say there is no in between!

218
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,660
Afraid of heights?

219
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,100
But then you're too far gone!

220
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,140
I'm wide open!

221
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,600
Time to cut off your allowance and make your life a little dangerous!

222
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,140
You're asking me to change it, aren't you?

223
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,120
We're all in this together!

224
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
Time to slip into something more comfortable!

225
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,540
None of them are monthly rates!

226
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,400
This is if the money is really in your hands!

227
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,400


228
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,400


229
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,400


230
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,400


231
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,400


232
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,400


233
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,660
No, they never happened.

234
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,900
Getting harder to swallow.

235
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,620
Maybe you just find it pertinent to the execution

236
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,360
of your duties.

237
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,540
Bad day at Black Rock.

238
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,880
You thought you could foresee what was to transpire.

239
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,460
But you're just beating around the bush.

240
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,560
No, Dizzy, Dizzy, how do you imagine?

241
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,580
Something's moving inside.

242
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,160
It's a sure thing, Daddy-O.

243
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,120
Time to settle.

244
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,020
Rustle us up some grub.

245
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,960
I just discovered I'm gonna die once more.

246
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,500
I'm not too crazy about more of you.

247
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,780
I can't remember being dead before.

248
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,820
But remember, the end of the world may be much worse.

249
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,560
.

250
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,920
And take much longer than you thought.

251
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,700
The mere act of sitting in your home watching everything

252
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,880
fall apart on TV may be too much for even the stoutest brains

253
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,600
to take.

254
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,380
In fact, the more alert and intelligent you are,

255
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,160
the quicker you'll likely be driven to suicide

256
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,360
by the sheer hideousness of what you'll be seeing.

257
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,100
Will you be ready?

258
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,560
Will you still be safe?

259
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:00,360
Will you be sane enough to laugh when that which must come to pass comes to pass?

260
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
Will you ever get slack?

261
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,480
Break out of that glass box.

262
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,540
And join the Church of the Subgenius.

263
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,020
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution,

264
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,000
anything is likely to develop.

265
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,920
Enter the Church of the Subgenius,

266
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,140
billing itself as the weirdest cult on Earth.

267
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,660
What do they believe in?

268
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,220
Everything.

269
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,560
. Who do they believe in?

270
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,740
A mysterious character named Bob.

271
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,960
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired

272
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,160
throughout his long and slackless history.

273
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,460
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

274
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,840
And to you, young man.

275
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,760
Bob founded the Church mainly to help unmask the conspiracies.

276
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,540
And we're talking about the conspiracies.

277
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,240
What's that?

278
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,660
Just believe in the power of the dogs.

279
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,460
I believe.

280
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,920
Believe in Bob.

281
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,440
I believe.

282
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,680
Reach out for him.

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,640
I believe.

284
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,400
Feel the healing power.

285
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,260
.

286
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,100
.

287
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,440
Oh, calm acts.

288
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,660
He will leave us.

289
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:55,860
There they go.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,660
.

291
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,040
.

292
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,040


293
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,100
It says there's one, both and two.

294
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,520
Now hear why that.

295
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:07,520


296
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:07,520


297
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,540
the carrying of power r three radies.

298
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,260
Grrrrrrrrr.

299
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,180
.

300
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,240
I believe God is amazing.

301
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,380


302
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,380


303
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,800
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .ıyor

304
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,720
That's what the conspiracy is all about.

305
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,800
The conspiracy is a patchwork of different things.

306
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:39,400
Some are nations, some are products, some are hypnotic television shows, some are bad pills.

307
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,440
You'll find this if you find Bob! And you better find Bob right now!

308
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,900
And no one has ever met Bob. The leader of our church, no one has ever met.

309
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,120
Because as you know, all cults, their leaders are usually pretty hard to find.

310
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,660
And Bob is no exception.

311
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,200
Bob will help you. Dig your own weirdness.

312
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,880
I was getting messages in the back of my brain.

313
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,720
And I just kept hearing the word Bob, Bob, Bob.

314
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,300
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

315
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,900
They said your mind is in this jar and then they poured it down the sink.

316
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,700
So geniuses are the class of people who can't be classified.

317
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,040
Bob has taken rhinos on the street and turned them into millionaires.

318
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,100
By the same token, he has taken millionaires and given them the slack they always needed all along as rhinos.

319
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,940
We are the first non-tax exempt church around. We're the first industrial church.

320
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,940
And we're not disputing any of your belief systems because we believe in just about every one of them anyway.

321
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,200
Wow.

322
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,780
Got it dead center.

323
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,160
Those primitive peasants didn't believe our story.

324
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,760
But they believed it when the mushroom cloud blasted them off the island.

325
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,660
And we've got to ask you about that.

326
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,560
By the time I asked him, I asked him, why are you alive?

327
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,060
Whoa!

328
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,920
Hold on to the phone.

329
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,340
Scared away that caller. Come on, guys, let's drive down Chattic Avenue real fast.

330
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,960
This station's hard to steer.

331
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,380
Check orange light sequence two.

332
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,140
Yeah, well, at least out here in Staten Island.

333
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,100
We're in a space where we don't talk about nothing. There's lots of continuity.

334
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,820
Check emergency override switch.

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,760
But don't worry, little subgeniuses.

336
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,880
This war that we're trying to start on the Earth right now isn't for you.

337
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,740
Oh.

338
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:35,960
More?

339
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,920
More book. More book.

340
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,360
You are absolutely amazing.

341
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,480
Yeah, I know. Want some more book?

342
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:43,860
I don't know.

343
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,920
It's got some nice big fat places you can just blast your fist right into it.

344
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,780
Holy crap!

345
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,060
Yeah, we paid for them bombs. Why couldn't we?

346
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,280
And we paid for the schools.

347
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,420
And we get the thrill of pushing the button.

348
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,720
That's right. If I paid for that school, how do you want it?

349
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,180
I'll blow it up.

350
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,500
Well, what if I go anyway and I can pretend?

351
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:57,960
You can.

352
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,100
Because, you know, after something's happened, all you have left is a memory, so you can just pretend and convince yourself.

353
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,580
Oh, I wouldn't worry about the memories none.

354
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,120
But then I won't have the Kodak.

355
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,380
No, it was just a dream. It was just a bad dream that, you know, you never went to school.

356
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,200
It was just a bad dream that, you know, you never went to school.

357
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,400
That would be awful.

358
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,280
And let's have an awful little song.

359
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,420
Your memory.

360
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,620
I think you didn't expect me to be listening tonight.

361
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,960
Your memories are fading.

362
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,740
I heard you guys came in.

363
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,320
Oh, your memories are fading.

364
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,580
I've got to wake up tomorrow.

365
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,120
Even as you speak, your memories are fading.

366
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,920
Oh, your thoughts are gone.

367
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,020
There are people floating about unregulated, you know.

368
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,180
They're not your own.

369
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,500
Everybody's floating around now.

370
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:39,820
Oh, your memories are fading away.

371
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,900
Now we're in the morning after the bomb.

372
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,800
Where do I come from?

373
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,900
You come from the show.

374
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,040
What am I doing here?

375
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,360
You come from the show.

376
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,600
The nuclear bomb.

377
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:50,980
You're talking!

378
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:50,980


379
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,100
I did not ever imagine the nuclear bomb would use anyive what was in my head.

380
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,640
I had that time.

381
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,680
I hope I did.

382
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,800
It was Music Station for ainterview.

383
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,160
Here I am, poultry flounder.

384
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,780
Was this my dream?

385
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,280
Yeah, a little tiny bomb.

386
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,060
And you had it?

387
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,740
Along the bridge across the river's bank, a makan stick found and whispering in the

388
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:00,740


389
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:00,800

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,040

What do you do?

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,780
Roll up to your crew for the art dress.

438
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,740

What do you do for the art dress?

00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,340
Do you want to look great?

445
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,680
At the nuclear beauty parlor.

446
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,460
Up there, my child.

447
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:36,920
Up there, my child.

448
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:36,920


449
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,260
There dwells the one true God who created all living things.

450
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
There dwells the one true God who created all living things.

451
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,800
The true God, the moon.

452
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,940
The true God, the moon.

453
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,420
The new Antillius.

454
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,000
Bob is fill in the blank.

455
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,820
I am Bob. I'm not Bob.

456
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,900
You are Bob, we're all Bob.

457
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,860
We are all Devo, we are Bob.

458
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,920
Bob will protect you.

459
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,680
Bob is protecting the genetic future.

460
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,480
Let him. Let him into your life.

461
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,960
Let Bob protect you. He wants to protect you.

462
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,540
He must protect you. He has to protect you.

463
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,060
Jehovah 1 says Bob will protect you.

464
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,380
If you send a dollar to the green.

465
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,820
And I have so much I would like to say, but I don't know how to say it.

466
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,380
So please bear with me if sometimes this doesn't make much sense.

467
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,520
It's realistic.

468
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,400
The second question is what?

469
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,620
What's happening?

470
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,380
Is this a miracle?

471
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,960
What kind of a miracle?

472
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,740
Is this a parable?

473
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,820
What's the point?

474
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,560
Lay your hands on the radio.

475
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,940
Lay your hands on the radio band at home, and we're going to look to God.

476
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,680
I love you, boss.

477
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:41,680


478
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,900
I'm going to date you if I keep moving.

479
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,860
I'm going to kill you.

480
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,640
All right, man, stop it.

481
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,120
Get moving.

482
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,280
Keep going now.

483
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:56,160
If the last 50 years made such a change, just imagine the New York of 1980,

484
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,420
when everyone has a number instead of a name,

485
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,680
and the government tells you whom you should marry.

486
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,540
Just imagine 1980.

487
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,460
Thank you.

488
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,240
Thank you.

489
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,840
Thank you.

490
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,080


491
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,880
Thank you.

492
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,040
And people will have a number in their hands and in their forehead.

493
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,900
They'll be given a...

494
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,800
Okay, your code number once more.

495
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,540
237.

496
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,580
237, and you're calling from Dallas.

497
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,520
Okay, thank you.

498
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,600
And without it, you can starve.

499
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,200
I'm coming out of this.

500
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,540
Amen.

501
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,760
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

502
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,040
Praise the Lord.

503
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,960
And these times are not going to get any better, my friends.

504
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,120
Amen.

505
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,440
They're going to get worse and worse.

506
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,940
Opium is still the primary plan that the United States has

507
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,240
for dealing with its people in the event of a nuclear attack.

508
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,040
There have been six cases of breast cancer,

509
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,180
one bladder cancer, and one throat cancer.

510
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,660
There's a God who is a God of love,

511
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,680
and there is a God who is a God of judgment.

512
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,980
Two sides.

513
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,140
Mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

514
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,340
And I challenge you to point out national talk shows

515
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,320
that do not belittle sexual fidelity, purity,

516
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,360
that they do not belittle the marriage union and the family lifestyle,

517
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,840
that they don't literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

518
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,600
I mean, I challenge you to show me a talk show that doesn't make light of God.

519
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
The Subgenius Foundation.

520
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,120
Yes, friends, this is one of those talk shows.

521
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Pastor Naked here is...

522
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,320
Ted Stack.

523
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,380
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

524
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,760
Pastor Naked had to step out, and we've got Ted Stack is here

525
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,180
with some sort of a sacred sports report.

526
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,800
Take it away, Ted.

527
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,260
Thank you, Doug.

528
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,480
Thank you, Doug.

529
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,220
Yeah, Ted Stack with the sports.

530
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,340
And in the Table Football League,

531
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,440
the Dallas Assassins posted the first tournament sweep,

532
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,560
posted ever by the Assassins,

533
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,100
and the Assassins have won every game.

534
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,080
That was Friday night at the George Westby's Pub

535
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,240
that the Assassins entered.

536
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,780
The Assassins won the gold again,

537
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,020
the 10th career gold for the Dallas Assassins.

538
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,180
And the Assassins just looked tough the other night.

539
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,100
I'll tell you, I was watching the bowl myself,

540
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,420
and I just couldn't stand it.

541
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,740
Anyway, number two was the Midway Thing.

542
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,980
The Midway Things entered twice and come in second twice.

543
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,580
Then number three was the Mexican Mafia,

544
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,660
and number four was last time's champion, the EJ Express.

545
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,060
Back to you, Doug.

546
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,080
Thanks.

547
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,800
And what have we been playing?

548
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,100
At one point, you heard the Nuclear Beauty Parlor

549
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,620
by the Nuclear Beauty Parlor.

550
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Beautiful song there.

551
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,240
And, of course, Zug's Rift.

552
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,840
And a little bit of Firesign Theater.

553
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,980
That was the wrong piece.

554
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,680
I wasn't trying.

555
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,000
At every step of the game,

556
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,920
I've stumbled over the equipment situation over here.

557
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,740
And it's great.

558
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,000
There is a path to slack.

559
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And there's a path to slack in Terror.

560
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,920
And so we'll go back to the back once again

561
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,280
to what we originally wanted to play.

562
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,080
Thank you.

563
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,560
This is the chinchilla show.

564
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,720
No, they don't bite.

565
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,000
And, uh...

566
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,940
But then, as you know, chinchillas,

567
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,280
or mutated chinchillas like these,

568
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,080
blue mutants, we call them...

569
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,640
Is that because of their peculiar coloration, Brad,

570
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,660
that makes them so rare?

571
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,340
Uh, no.

572
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,060
They were first crossbred, or introduced, as we say,

573
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,340
by Alistair Blue, a munitions... a mutations expert,

574
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,240
who's been into the raising of these little sweethearts.

575
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,460
Oh, oh, oh, careful there.

576
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,060
Is he getting... is he getting away?

577
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,760
Uh, that's all right.

578
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,180
We got a lot more of them.

579
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,780
And they do that, and that's part of the fun of raising them.

580
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,540
And they're very clean, clean animals.

581
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,860
I wouldn't ask about that.

582
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,940
They're very clean.

583
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,700
And if they do mess, as we refer to it,

584
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,400
they'll do it in their little cages,

585
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,660
and it doesn't make any difference.

586
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,960
And they dig a little hole for it.

587
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,060
Is that what this one's doing here?

588
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,020
Can we... can we get a close-up of that?

589
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,520
No, no, no.

590
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,220
Oh, this one's just trying to get away.

591
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,940
That's... that's his mate over there.

592
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,980
That's the one they're trying to catch.

593
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,980
Oh, look at that.

594
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,760
They just caught it.

595
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,680
Oh, that's...

596
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,240
Our floor manager just told me they stepped on it.

597
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,080
Oh, that... that's a... that's a female.

598
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,220
That's a squirrel, as we say.

599
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,860
Those bright colors around the snout.

600
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,620
Nose rings, we call them.

601
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,200
They differentiate between them.

602
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,700
And, of course, you just cover them up with this nair guard,

603
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,540
and they won't breed.

604
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,380
They can't breed?

605
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,440
No, no, no, they can't breed.

606
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,160
There's one crawling up my leg.

607
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,340
But, seriously, Brad, Ken,

608
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,140
we want them to breed as much as possible,

609
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,580
and this guard is only used, of course,

610
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,520
when you're away on vacation, you know,

611
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,880
and it becomes inconvenient for them to...

612
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,200
Uh-huh.

613
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,080
Uh, Brad, now, how...

614
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,700
Let's go over to that demonstration you told me to go.

615
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:53,860
Oh, sure.

616
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,580
Well, I'm gonna show you how absolutely trouble-free

617
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,880
these little animals are.

618
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,640
Back here.

619
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,520
If you have kids like I know I have,

620
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,960
you'll want to watch this very carefully now.

621
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,140
We got a big close-up right there of the little animals.

622
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,200
If you'll just stay still here.

623
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,960
Now, I'm gonna put out this lighted cigarette

624
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,160
on this chinchilla now.

625
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,120
There.

626
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,140
Now, you...

627
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,300
See, you can see I'm just letting it burn there.

628
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,280
It doesn't harm the coat at all.

629
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,500
Oh, that's amazing.

630
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,760
Yeah, it certainly is.

631
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,680
Well, how...

632
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,440
It's still smoking there, right?

633
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:26,700
Yes.

634
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,480
Well, how is this possible, Ken?

635
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,300
Well, Brad, this chinchilla is entirely synthetic.

636
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,060
That's fantastic.

637
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,020
And with these little fellas raised in your spare time,

638
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,540
in the playhouse or the garage or the slaves' quarters,

639
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,480
you'll be making hay while the sun shines

640
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,820
and at midnight, too, with mutant flu.

641
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,460
Well, thank you. Thank you, Brad.

642
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,240
And you two little... What's his name?

643
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,600
He doesn't have a name. They're all his names.

644
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,720
Oh, well, thank you.

645
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,100
Just a moment. We'll tell you the numbers to call.

646
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,440
One, two, three, four.

647
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,680
Right now.

648
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,440
I am an antichrist.

649
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,320
I am an anarchist.

650
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,120
Don't know what I want, but I know how to get it.

651
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,740
I want to destroy passersby

652
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:33,220
because I want to be an addict.

653
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,800
No dog's body.

654
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,420
Anarchy for the UK.

655
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,380
It's coming sometime, maybe.

656
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,560
Give the wrong time, stop a traffic light.

657
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,340
Your future dream is a sharp and steam

658
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:03,740
because I want to be anarchy.

659
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,220
Here's a break, boys.

660
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,640
How many ways to get what you want?

661
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,660
I is the best when I lose the rest.

662
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,000
I is the best when I lose the rest.

663
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
I use the enemy.

664
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,080
I use A-N-A-R-Y

665
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:51,880
because I want to be anarchy.

666
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,220
Is this the N-P-L-A-R

667
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,540
Or is this the U-T-A

668
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,040
Or is this the I-R-A-L

669
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,380
I thought it was the U-K-R-J

670
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,480
Another country

671
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:34,760
Another country

672
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,060
Like a song

673
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,360
Cause I

674
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,180
Wanna be

675
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,700
Anarchy

676
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,840
Once again

677
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,700
Cause I

678
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,560
Wanna be

679
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
Anarchy

680
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,220
I get pissed

681
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,780
Wanna destroy

682
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,880
Hi girls, it's Pastor Buck Naked here.

683
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,020
Well, we just heard a cover by some friends of ours,

684
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,060
the Swinging Erudites,

685
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,040
of that famous Sex Pistols classic,

686
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,900
I Wanna Be Anarchy, or actually Anarchy in the U.K.

687
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,460
is what it's really about.

688
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:34,940
It's a great song.

689
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,300
It's a great song.

690
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Well, I'm gonna tell you a little bit about our devival.

691
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,540
We're gonna foist on you at the Twilight Room.

692
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,520
It's called Circle A Ranch, for those in the know,

693
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,160
but most people think of it as the Twilight Room.

694
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,360
It's strictly in downtown Dallas,

695
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,080
right at about ground zero of downtown,

696
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,720
right at Central and Main.

697
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,340
So how more downtown could you get than that?

698
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,920
The scariest club in town.

699
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,060
The scariest club in town?

700
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,040
It's where the down-home-for-real people go.

701
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,460
That's right.

702
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:04,560
That's right.

703
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,340
None of this...

704
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,660
You see the Batmobile more often there than anywhere else in town.

705
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:09,860
That's right.

706
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,980
And we're gonna have us a devival down there,

707
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,460
the subgenius Scary Ball.

708
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,760
We got my band, More Drunk Cowboys,

709
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,180
Reverend Buck with More Drunk Cowboys,

710
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,120
and Doctors for Bob.

711
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,560
Hang on to your legs, kids.

712
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,080
That's right.

713
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,940
Doctors for Bob is gonna be there.

714
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,920
Plus, the Reverend Chastity Belt,

715
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,940
and I'm sure a lot of you folks will be wanting to see Miss Belt,

716
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,900
or Reverend...

717
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,440
Sister Belt.

718
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,520
Belt, I guess we'd call her.

719
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,540
She's gonna...

720
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,160
I think we can say...

721
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,260
Remember, this is a masquerade ball, disguises only.

722
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,600
This is the weekend before Halloween, October 26th.

723
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,940
Be there or be damned for eternity.

724
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,900
Yeah, that's right.

725
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,040
Mayhaps.

726
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,660
That's right.

727
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,040
And I'll tell you something else.

728
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,980
If I know who you are, when I see you, you can't come in

729
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,760
because you've gotta be in such good disguise

730
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,440
that even I won't be able to whiff you.

731
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,000
I won't even be able to smell who you are, much less see who you are.

732
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,880
So I want you to disguise your smell.

733
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,480
Your...

734
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,640
Your...

735
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,860
Your sigh stench, the stench of your mind.

736
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,080
I don't even want to...

737
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,340
Want to know how you think when you get in there.

738
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,120
I don't want to know how you look, and I don't want to know how you smell.

739
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,500
And I don't want to have to smell your thoughts with my third nostril that's behind the other two.

740
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,660
Because I've been to Dobstown and had the sacred surgery and had my third nostril...

741
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,700
Oh, yes, our jungle settlement.

742
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,920
...opened up, yes.

743
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,800
And it's becoming more like a city in the jungles every day, and they...

744
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,820
Oh, it's great to see all those young zombies at work.

745
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,860
They call me...

746
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,420
They call themselves zombies. That's not a derogatory term.

747
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,060
Zombies for Bob.

748
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,580
They stay bought. They bought the operation.

749
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,580
Some of them come back time and time again to be killed and reborn again in Bob, because it feels so good.

750
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:45,860
And re-killed. Re-killed.

751
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,420
Re-killed in Bob.

752
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,820
Burned in the fire of his mighty pipe. They let Bob smoke them.

753
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,040
You know, Reverend Stang, we've been talking about slack and, you know, taking a break here or there.

754
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,380
Uh-huh.

755
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:03,140
But, you know, when the word of the death of Bob came through, that one time when Bob was killed, it didn't last too long,

756
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,980
but Bob was killed in Frisco a while ago.

757
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,220
Well, he's still dead, Buck.

758
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,200
Well, he's still kind of dead, but, you know, his pipe came back anyway.

759
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:18,100
Yeah, Bob can't... I mean, just because Bob's body is in Lucite, preserved in Lucite at the top of some nameless skyscraper downtown...

760
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,540
...doesn't mean...

761
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,060
...his pipe lives on.

762
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,960
...that he ain't still watching you subgenius members out there, you members of the church, who think,

763
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:31,060
Oh, Bob's dead. Well, he ain't looking now. I can quit sinning. Oh, I can go get a job and work for the conspiracy, because Bob's dead.

764
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,120
Well, anyway, while that... while that...

765
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,780
...was happening, when Bob was killed, I was not in San Francisco where they killed him. I was in Malaysia. I was in Dobstown.

766
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:47,560
And, uh, right when the word came through, it was really eerie. I was flapping up in a little temple with some other ministers and, uh, you know,

767
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:54,440
folks who work in the temples, or sort of slack off in the temples, we should say, and it was weird. This big racket started up down the street.

768
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,280
We went to look what was going on, and when they heard that Bob had got killed, everyone started working.

769
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,480
Oh, it's a disgusting...

770
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:02,980
Yeah.

771
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,100
...it's a disgusting...

772
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,060
...it's a crooked and perverse nation, folks. And if you don't know what we're talking about...

773
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,160
Yeah.

774
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,060
...it's too bad.

775
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:08,880
It's...

776
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,240
It's...

777
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,540
It's...

778
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,140
It's too bad.

779
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,940
It's... because we're on the air and you're not.

780
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,180
That's right.

781
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,060
You can look at it that way.

782
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,320
Yeah.

783
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,820
And, you know, it's a crooked and perverse nation. Little girls...

784
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,720
You paid five bucks and we're getting five thousand.

785
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:26,580
Little girls, they... they take... they take... little girls and they... they make them dress up nasty, and you can see every little wrinkle, every line, and every little, uh, cleavage, everything.

786
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,060
And their parents tell them to dress like that in their schools, because they tell them...

787
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,540
It's because of TV.

788
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,900
...because they tell them it's... it's humanistic.

789
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:53,460
Well, it's gonna come a judgment, and the... the... the fish... the flying, stark fist of removal is coming down on this nation, and I'm gonna be glad, because I'm gonna be escaping into the escape vessel rocket ship, and y'all can fry for all I care, because I... I'm tired of y'all, and you don't want to hear about Bob...

790
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,060
Pastor Necker, let's get back to this, uh... let's get back to the inspirational side of the message here, and just quit bad-mouthing the lost.

791
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:00,980
Yeah.

792
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,520
We tend to...

793
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:01,520


794
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:15,980
We tend to preach to the saved all the time, and I imagine there'll be some people who may... if they listen closely to the... to the lessons that we're about to continue playing, they will get... they will be able to forge through the density of the mix to the incredible Captain Beefheart song, which we'll play at the end.

795
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,740
Oh, okay, but I... I'd like to speak to...

796
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,380
Oh, by the way, wait, one... one very important thing.

797
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,240
I do want to say this...

798
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,520
Go ahead.

799
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,960
...to the conspiracy dupes, though.

800
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:28,580
Please, don't stop me on the street tomorrow and start blaming all the troubles of the world on the subgenius church. I mean, you guys had your chance, so...

801
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,000
That's right.

802
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,580
...let's get real, okay?

803
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,240
Okay, this is KNON.

804
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,520
Okay.

805
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:41,160
90.9 FM in Dallas, Fort Worth, and this is another media barrage tape from the Subgenius Foundation. We'll be reading our address for information at the end of the broadcast.

806
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,260
Yeah, Doug Smith says we're different.

807
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,880
Doug's right, Virgil. We are different, thanks to Jesus, the genetic engineering corporation of American states.

808
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,860
Mommy, too?

809
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,340
Yep, the whole family.

810
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,020
Is everybody like us?

811
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,300
No, son, but we're working on it. Round the clock.

812
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,800
Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies.

813
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,760
Wowee. I want to be a genetic engineer just like you, Pop.

814
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,920
You will, Virg, if you don't baggy. It can lead to photon confusion.

815
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,820
Don't baggy. For a healthier, happier biosuperior.

816
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,180
Hi.

817
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,320
Hey, Pop.

818
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:28,380
You say you're looking for excitement. And Rachel, isn't this opportunity a real nice place to raise the kids?

819
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,940
Well, explore more.

820
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,520
Well, explore more.

821
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,260
We're there already. Let's visit the world of the future.

822
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,100
World of the future.

823
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,220
Yes, this bustling world of a thousand moods reflects the dreams of its ambitious inhabitants,

824
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,220
dreams already realized of man's triumph over nature.

825
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,540
Where humans no longer suffer self-inflicted pains.

826
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,360
Where one is made to enjoy life.

827
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:10,000
All the signs point to serious health damage. There are no winners in a nuclear war.

828
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,120
The minute you have another war, there's not going to be any war left, I don't think.

829
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,100
Because we're going to blow up another species.

830
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,200
Because in this day and time, we don't know where we're going to come to.

831
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,920
There's not going to be anything left for the kids. I mean, there's not going to be a world left.

832
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,000
And we're all going to end up digging our own holes.

833
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,340
As soon as we dig them, they're going to fall in on us.

834
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,880
I don't think anybody would know what to do, even Austal, the President.

835
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,940
And only truth is, guns!

836
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,040
We're going to create our own reality.

837
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,940
If I had a gun, I'd create my own reality.

838
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,400
And what is the church's priorities? What's important to you guys?

839
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,160
Mainly the quest for slack.

840
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,920
The casting out of false prophets.

841
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,940
And controlling time. Those are our three main goals, I guess.

842
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,560
Slack?

843
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,660
Slack, slack is something we all need. Slack.

844
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,680
I know that lots of people out there listening right now are feeling a terrible shortage of slack.

845
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,840
A shortage that you can't get enough of.

846
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,300
That's right.

847
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,580
And we can help them to get slack, George.

848
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:13,700
Man, the world is filled with a bunch of kooky ideas and concepts about the Bible.

849
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:20,340
And I can't believe the weird things that people get in their heads and start...

850
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,500
Ashley Bob just uses me as an instrument.

851
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,020
That's what I like about the Word of God.

852
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,920
There's nothing fakey about this thing, man.

853
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,980
And you talk about telling it like it is.

854
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,180
See, it hangs the dirty wash right out the front bay window.

855
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,340
For everybody to see.

856
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,100
And you know they got the spirit of fire moving down in their soul, yeah.

857
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,880
The worst thing that ever happened to Johnny.

858
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,540
Alert, alert, alert.

859
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,120
Greetings, Bob.

860
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:54,660
Hello.

861
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,740
This is Bob.

862
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,400
Nice to meet you.

863
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,820
The following program is transcribed in Spanish for our Latin listening audience.

864
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,960
Atención, compadres queridos.

865
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,460
Habla Santo Antonio del culo a la mano.

866
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,440
Y tengo algunos nuevos muy importantes.

867
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Escuchame bien.

868
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,640
¿Qué quieren ustedes en la vida?

869
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,760
¿Un auto nuevo?

870
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,920
¿O una mujer preciosa?

871
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,100
¿Un amante tan profundo y guapo?

872
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,980
¿Una casa grande?

873
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,900
¿Y una educación cariñosa?

874
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,000
¿Una casa de caras?

875
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,820
¿Quieren ustedes a cambiar su suerte?

876
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,960
¿O aprovechar en sus negocios?

877
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,080
Amigos y amigas, se puedan ustedes a tener esas cosas y mucho, mucho más.

878
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,460
Con facilidad.

879
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,660
Voy a explicar.

880
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,120
¿Conocen ustedes J.R. Bob Dobs?

881
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,900
¿Están informados con la iglesia del subgenio?

882
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,440
Yo pensé que no.

883
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,420
He's the one and only Bob.

884
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,640
He's the same Bob.

885
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,660
And Bob is not changed.

886
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,420
And Bob does not stop changing.

887
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,600
He come on down.

888
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,780
Yes.

889
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,640
These humans will not wake up.

890
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:13,040
Only the return of Jesus or intervention by some cosmic super intelligence can save us now.

891
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,120
And only Bob can bring about either one properly.

892
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,100
If you don't want to boil your brains in the zombie business corridors of empty pinkness or grinding poverty.

893
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,620
If you don't want to feel the meat cook off your bones in a nuclear.

894
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,860
Or you don't want to feel your oven that was once your hometown.

895
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,940
You'd better drop your mental candy bars and step out under the blinding light of the sun and make witness to what you really are.

896
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,840
Yes.

897
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,900
You'd better be ready to jump.

898
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:45,440
From the econocataclism of those who knew how to climb up the conspiracy job tree and better know how to climb back down again.

899
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,480
You're gonna be stuck up there when the heat rises.

900
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,320
Look around you.

901
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,220
The signs are everywhere.

902
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,180
The signs are everywhere.

903
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,820
The social patterns have already gone way too far.

904
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,000
The family is all broken apart.

905
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,360
Morals have degenerated into a venereal TV swamp.

906
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,280
Drug abuse and perverted sex are taught in schools.

907
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,340
Just like the Roman Empire before it fell.

908
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,020
Collapse is nearly total now.

909
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:26,160
It may become in the final few years will mutilate our children beyond measure.

910
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,160


911
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,980
And our wildest nightmares.

912
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,540
Yes, it's everywhere.

913
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,640
The money changers.

914
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,380
The beast.

915
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,420
The masters of pink.

916
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,360
Purveyors of all that is sheepish and soft in the world.

917
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,660
They're just setting us up for a massive 1984 white week resurgence.

918
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,960
Which in turn allows the great witch burning.

919
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:54,300
Look! There! We already have demon infiltrated normalcy shock troops.

920
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,200
Going by the hellishly ironic name of moral majority.

921
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,000
Good God! Are these supposed to be Christians?

922
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,220
They've got Jesus and the devil all mixed up.

923
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,500
Make no mistake.

924
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,560
Subgenius Foundation is with Jesus.

925
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,720
The fighting Jesus.

926
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,820
Not some long haired mush mouth.

927
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,640
We're with Brother Roll-Up and Free Enterprise in America.

928
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,060
We're no communist tools of Satan.

929
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,600
They, with their influence of God, are the ones who make Slack.

930
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,460
You're not, uh, yes.

931
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,240
You're listening to KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Fort Worth and Plano.

932
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,060
We've, uh, we do listen to your calls.

933
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,140
Hour of Slack is taking your calls.

934
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,780
We cannot take them over the air live.

935
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,420
This radio station is so fantastically powerful now.

936
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,160
The FCC will no longer let you cuss on the air.

937
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,520
But I've been listening to a few folks and I've got a few things to say over the air.

938
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,560
So please bear with me if sometimes this doesn't make much sense.

939
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,980
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

940
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:07,280
Herzen-Dude called and asked us if the, uh, subgenius church recognizes the Discordian church.

941
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,540
We have not only recognized the Discordian church,

942
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,840
but we've incorporated their entire belief system into ours.

943
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,740
And, uh, Reverend Stang, would you care to comment anything on Discordianism?

944
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,220
It's realistic.

945
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,900
It is realistic.

946
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:29,180
Okay. And, uh, also, DDT Agent called and, uh, offered to rip off, uh, the record Violent Femmes for me

947
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,600
because I've just gotta play that song Blister in the Sun for you.

948
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,500
If not tonight, then next week.

949
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,700
Remember, Hour of Slack is on 1130 to 1230 on KNON, the voice of the people.

950
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,560
But the DDT Agent...

951
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,640
Oh, fantastic things have already happened.

952
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,540
DDT Agent, I'd like to say to you, if you want that record in the record store, just take it.

953
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,080
It belongs to you. You earned it.

954
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,240
That's right. Legalize pornography and ban work, my friend.

955
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,380
This is because the planet on which you are residing has entered the space age.

956
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,560
Hi, hi, girls.

957
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,400
The farmer screams and breathes the sky off the mountains.

958
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,540
Ice sockets look down on the chest bone that always, in the sun, drop down.

959
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,180
In the moon, flannel.

960
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,360
His inmates and elders hear his chokes.

961
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,320
In all the commons, driving through the dust.

962
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,740
For fear they be seen.

963
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,140
In the sky turned white in the middle of the night.

964
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,360
In the sky turned white in the middle of the night.

965
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,720
And the big floppy boots started down into the ground.

966
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,260
And the red fire then took the boat, folks, into the hut.

967
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,800
You hope that hurt.

968
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,560
And the red fire then took the boat, folks, into the hut.

969
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:53,780
Ha!

970
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,840
The boots go down.

971
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:55,720
Ha!

972
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,180
The farmer jumped in a circle and went his chuck right down.

973
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:01,420
Ha!

974
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,420
The boots go down.

975
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:04,720
Ha!

976
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,120
Doe sit doe, the devil show show down.

977
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,520
He broke off his horns and climbed down the roof.

978
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,460
Through the fog.

979
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,940
In the farmer's flock he boots stomp down.

980
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:18,940


981
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:20,680
In the land he stomp down.

982
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,760
Rick's tails squamed, the hot lake kicked.

983
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,640
And the fire leaped and leaked.

984
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,240
Rick's tails squamed, the hot lake kicked.

985
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,180
And the fire leaped and leaked.

986
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,200
And when the boot came up the fire went out.

987
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,020
And hell was just an ice cube melting off in the ground.

988
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,380
The boat caught down, poked into the hoop.

989
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,080
And the boat caught down for the doodle-doodle-double-doodle-down.

990
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,280
And the boat caught down for the doodle-doodle-double-doodle-down.

991
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,800
Through the fog hung a holly, with standards of control.

992
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,180
Was that bunged-up bandage broken bone?

993
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,380
It fell in the wrong circle.

994
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,260
He had a sore red tail.

995
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,200
Once went red, now was pale.

996
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,560
Feet full of five-pound, he was summoned up from hell.

997
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,640
Rooted down a spell by a square-dancing farmer.

998
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,980
By a square-dancing farmer, well.

999
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,200
That old bum was sticking out his thumb when the farmer drew up.

1000
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,620
Said, listen, son, in the horse can pat his hooves.

1001
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,080
If you fall in my circle again,

1002
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,780
I'll tan your red hat and dance you on your tail.

1003
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,960
You from now to now.

1004
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,880
Hit you from now to now.

1005
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,760
And the hot lead kits in the fire are leaped and lit.

1006
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,380
And the hot lead kits in the fire are leaped and lit.

1007
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,500
And the hot lead kits in the fire are just leaped and lit.

1008
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,240
And the hot lead kits in the fire are leaped and lit.

1009
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,180
And the hot lead kits in the fire are leaped and lit.

1010
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:10,180


1011
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,760
Ah, yes, dear friend.

1012
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:53,360
Okay, that was Stop Floppy Boots Stomp by Captain B-Part.

1013
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,240
Saint Captain B-Part.

1014
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,820
All right, now, I want to tell you all a few things.

1015
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:03,280
First of all, that you're listening to KNON 90.9, Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington.

1016
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,600
And I'd like to say a few other things.

1017
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,740
We've got some great shows on KNON.

1018
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,000
You're listening to the debut of The Hour of Slack right now.

1019
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,980
We're on 1130 to 1230 on Sunday nights.

1020
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,600
By the way, Sunday is not the true Sabbath.

1021
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,520
The true Sabbath is Wodan's Day, Wednesday.

1022
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,360
That's right.

1023
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,820
I would like to tell you all that we've got some other great shows.

1024
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,740
The Dharma Wheel, which is on the weekdays.

1025
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,720
I'm not sure exactly what time.

1026
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,640
We've got a schedule over there.

1027
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,600
He'll find out for me.

1028
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,760
The Dharma Wheel, Robin's show.

1029
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,340
And we've got Stare Hard, Saturday afternoons from 2 to 4.

1030
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,840
And from 4 to 5, my friend Cave does a little thing called Audio Abuse.

1031
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,460
And we've got a little promo for you to hear right now.

1032
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,200
If you're bored of the same music day after day and need a change,

1033
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,700
listen to Audio Abuse, Saturdays 4 to 5,

1034
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,020
when you'll hear the best in hardcore and other alternative type music.

1035
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,400
So listen to Audio Abuse, Saturdays 4 to 5.

1036
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,700
Remember, it's noise, not music.

1037
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,180
Okay.

1038
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,460
Audio Abuse.

1039
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,500
Audio Abuse.

1040
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,280
All right.

1041
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,400
That was great.

1042
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,380
Man, I enjoyed the heck out of that.

1043
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,960
We would have played that anyway, even if it wasn't anything to do with the station.

1044
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,020
I enjoyed the hell out of that.

1045
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:33,500
You know, the doctor music trend and anti-music has a lot to do with noise, not music, too.

1046
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,600
I know, but the problem with doctor bands and anti-music bands is sooner or later,

1047
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,300
they learn how to play those instruments.

1048
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,520
Dang it, dang it, cat!

1049
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,300
And then you end up being able to dance to them like you can dance to Doctors for Bob

1050
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,360
and more Drunk Cowboys at the Twilight Room coming up October 26th.

1051
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:56,580
Well, in the meantime, friends, I'm afraid that our time is starting to run out,

1052
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:02,600
and it's sad that we only have one hour for each of these religious broadcasts,

1053
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:07,260
but it all balances out in one great religious evacuation.

1054
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,960
And I would recommend reading Prescriptures 16, 14, 17, 18,

1055
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,700
and you can write for information on how to order these precious tapes.

1056
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:23,700
And we need blankets, my friends, for these precious boys and girls at the Home for Slackless Children.

1057
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,040
Your contributions also keep those we hate starving to death.

1058
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:32,780
I command you to spill your gift seed pledge of 100 pounds of dollar bills in my lap,

1059
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,120
for this will buy modeling clay and transformer toys for these poor children.

1060
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,200
Dobbs will bless you for planting this seed, Faith.

1061
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,160
Ah, yes. Amen.

1062
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,420
And now, my friends, the announcer will give our mailing address, for you can write for information.

1063
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:54,440
That's Church of the Subgenius, Post Office Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1064
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,360

1065
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:04,000
PO Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1066
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,700
Not a fan, not a church, but a whole new way of life.

1067
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,680
Thank you, folks.

1068
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,640
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

1069
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,100
and Pastor Buck Naked of the Church of the Subgenius,

1070
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,660

1072
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,060
Praise Bob and Naked.

1073
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,640
Ah, yes.

1074
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,200
Watch them VU meters now, Pastor Naked.

1075
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,640
He's a fighting preacher, I'll tell you.

1076
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,520
It's a squirting universe.

1077
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,980
And praise Bob, and let there be slack.

1078
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:40,520
Yeah.

1079
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,700
Drinking Budweiser

1080
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,260
Watching Bob on TV

1081
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,020
Swallowing red man

1082
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,100
The day my coon dog died

1083
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,440
Reading the pamphlet

1084
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,300
Over and over again

1085
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,360
I was drinking Budweiser

1086
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,740
And Bob was on TV

1087
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,200
The day that Uncle

1088
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,460
Got kicked by a mule

1089
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,620
I was with Cousin Junior

1090
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:37,840
The DNA backfired

1091
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,900
I was drunk

1092
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,060
I was lonely

1093
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,860
I was plastered

1094
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,980
I was drinking Budweiser

1095
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,420
And Bob was on TV

1096
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,720
Drinking Budweiser

1097
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,020
Watching Bob on TV

1098
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:03,600
Drinking Budweiser

1099
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:03,600


1100
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:03,600


1101
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:03,600


1102
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:03,600


1103
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:03,600


1104
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:03,600


1105
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,960
Swallowing red man

1106
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,880
Today my coon dog died

1107
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,380
Reading the pamphlet

1108
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:20,100
Over and over again

1109
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,920
I was drinking Budweiser

1110
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,300
When Bob was on TV

1111
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,280
I was drinking Budweiser

1112
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,600
When Bob was on TV

1113
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,140
I was drinking Budweiser

1114
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,120
When Bob was on TV

1115
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,320
I was drinking Budweiser

1116
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,900
Step right up

1117
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,860
Step right up

1118
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,660

Bargains galore

1122
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,380
That's right you too

1123
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,260
Can be the proudest

1124
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,080
Owner of the quality

1125
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,980
Goes in before

1126
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,540
The name goes on

1127
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,760
One tenth of a dollar

1128
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,680
One tenth of a dollar

1129
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,060
We got service

1130
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:43,980
After the sale

1131
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,740

We got perfume

1133
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,160
How about an engagement ring

1134
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,840
Something for the little lady

1135
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,740
Something for the little lady

1136
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,720
Something for the little lady

1137
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,400
Three, four dollars

1138
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,740
We got a year-end clearance

1139
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,140
We got our white sale

1140
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,880

You tired of kitchen drudgery

1150
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,600
Everything must go

1151
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,800
Going out of business

1152
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,500
Going out of business

1153
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,520
Going out of business sale

00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,540
Skip the middleman

1156
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,120
Don't set up a lesson

1157
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,160
How do we do it

1158
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:26,840
How do we do it

1159
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,580
Volume, volume

1160
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,520
Turn up the volume

1161
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,920
Now you got running advertisers

1162
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,160
Don't hesitate

1163
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,260
You can start in your third

1164
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,260


1165
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,260


1166
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,260


1167
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,260


1168
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,260


1169
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,260


1170
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,260


1171
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,260


1172
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,340
Don't be caught with your drawers down

1173
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,220
Don't be caught with your drawers down

1174
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,280
Step right up

1175
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,100
Step right up

1176
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,320
That's right, it fillets and chops

1177
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,080
Dice and slice, it never stops

1178
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,100
Lasts a lifetime, most of it long

1179
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,820
And it most of it long

1180
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,120
And it picks up the kids from school

1181
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,760
It gets rid of unwanted facial hair

1182
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,080
It gets rid of embarrassing age

1183
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,260
It delivers a pizza

1184
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,860
And it lengthens

1185
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,520
And it strengthens

1186
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,680
And it finds that slipper that's been at large

1187
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,820
Under the chaise lounge

1188
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,260
And it plays a mean rhythm

1189
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,560
As it makes excuses for unwanted lipstick on your collar

1190
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,020
And it's only a dollar

1191
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,420
Step right up

1192
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,200
It's only a dollar

1193
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,100
Step right up

1194
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,080
Cause it forges your signature

1195
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,020
Not completely satisfied

1196
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,140
Nail back unused portion of product

1197
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,020
For complete refund the price of purchase

1198
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,660
Step right up

1199
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,220
Please allow 30 days for delivery

1200
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,700
Don't be fooled by cheap limitations

1201
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,420
You can live in it

1202
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,720
Live in it, laugh in it, love in it, sleep in it

1203
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,960
Live in it, laugh in it, love in it

1204
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,160
Remove embarrassing states

1205
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,020
Change the contour sheets

1206
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,500
That's right

1207
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,160
And it entertains visiting relatives

1208
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,060
It turns a sandwich into a banquet

1209
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,240
Tired of being alive with a body

1210
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,240
Change your shorts

1211
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,140
Change your life

1212
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,500
Change your life

1213
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,900
Change into a nine year old hindu boy

1214
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,960
Get rid of your wife

1215
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,580
And it walks your dog

1216
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,160
And it doubles on sacks

1217
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,780
Doubles on sacks

1218
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,800
You can jump back jacks

1219
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,500
See you later alligator

1220
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,500
See you later alligator

1221
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,500
And it steals your car

1222
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,780
It gets rid of your gambling debts

1223
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,560
It quits smoking

1224
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,180
It's a friend

1225
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:02,840
It's a companion

1226
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,140
It's a friend

1227
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,140


1228
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,480
It's the only product you will ever need

1229
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,660
Follow these easy assembly instructions

1230
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,760
It never needs dining

1231
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,440
Well it takes weights off hips

1232
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,960
Busts, thighs, chins

1233
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,380
Midriff gives you dandruff

1234
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,100
And it finds you a job

1235
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,880
It is a job

1236
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,060
And it strips the bone covered

1237
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,800
It pre-tapes and you file exchange

1238
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,660
And it gives you denture rather

1239
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,160
And you know it's a friend

1240
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,840
And it's a companion

00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,040
And it gets rid of your traveler's checks

00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,140
It's new, it's improved

1243
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,900
