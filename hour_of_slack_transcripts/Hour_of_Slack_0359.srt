1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Friends, you know, they're out to do something to you.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,700
I ain't gonna say just what.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,000
I know it's not kiss you.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:18,840
They don't want to kiss you, though they may want you to kiss something on them.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,960
You know, in the Middle Ages, there was a...

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,000
They called it the obscene kiss.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,420
Kissing the devil's bum was the way a witch was initiated.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,220
And today, of course, we have a corporate butt kissing.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,120
And it's the same thing in the office, in the school.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,600
They're still kissing the posterior of the devil.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,000
Selling out.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,140
The bottom line is, friends,

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,420
the work ethic is satanic.

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,720
The Church of the Subgenius.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,420
Well, all I can say about them is that anybody

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,360
who hides behind blasphemous humor

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,460
and doesn't have the guts to come out in the open

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,960
and identify who they are or what they are

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,980
and allow anybody to interact...

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,460
on any kind of an intelligent level with them

21
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,020
is just plain idiotic and cowardly.

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,420
And I think Bob's a great name.

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,840
And you can see through women's clothing.

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,480
It saved my life.

25
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,040
It saved my life.

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,520
And it can save your life, too.

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,660
The Subgenius Hour of Slut.

28
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,120
We are an ugly religion.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,820
We pick our noses.

30
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,160
We pyroflagellate to the gods.

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,060
And sex is messy.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,920
Now, pray for messy sex.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,640
Now, we've done the first step to technomagic.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,980
We've taken the time.

35
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,900
Now, this is the second part, and I need your help.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,460
Because I need to explain to you why you need to give money to this church.

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,640
Because I have seen Reverend Stagg

38
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,540
work.

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,640
I have seen him get down on his knees,

40
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,480
beating his little fingers to the bone

41
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,060
to cut you an hour of slack every week.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,600
And all he asks is the money.

43
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,120
All he asks for is the money.

44
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,940
Pope Michael has stressed his bleeding little head blind

45
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,520
putting up this hip roar.

46
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,420
And get roaring.

47
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,140
Hoo!

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
Kind of event.

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,640
Whatever that means.

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,140
And he's worked.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,380
These people don't practice what they preach.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,640
Because they're not the kind of men they're preaching to.

53
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,600
But they have reached into the void.

54
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,120
They have taken their time.

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,280
And they have done the sacred mantra of the Church of the Subgenius.

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,140
Which, if you send your $20 to Bob, we will give you.

57
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,860
But because of the kindness of my heart,

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,300
I'll give it to you free tonight.

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,120
Hoo!

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,880
There's always a catch when you're dealing with kindness.

61
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,500
I'll expect your help later.

62
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,500
Now, oh, thank you so much.

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,840
I'll hold you to it.

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,380
You don't know what you want.

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,260
Oh, my God.

66
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,220
And what I have sort of grudgingly told you is.

67
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,660
When I look at a woman I miss much...

68
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:20,660


69
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,380
And the only place I really consider as true the miracle of like,

70
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,380


71
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,380


72
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,660
I really let go off that damnedlyし jesteśmy overweh ,

73
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,120
because of that relationship we have with our Lord

74
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,500
and for him to solve our, our problems is really revolutionary.

75
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,840
And, and right this,

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,560
I said what I said compared to what you said,

77
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,540
because they've never heard of the Church of the Subgenius,

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,900
so maybe you would like to enlighten them for a moment.

79
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,180
Make it quick.

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,920
What the Church of the Subgenius is about is finding peace through forgetting about Jesus,

81
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,260
because what Jesus has caused on this earth is religion,

82
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,400
and what religion has caused is wars and strife and problems in everybody's life.

83
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,120
That's right. Let's all blame it on the...

84
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,980
Are we ready now?

85
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,040
Christians!

86
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Well, not just Christians. I'm not just picking on you, Bob.

87
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,320
Yeah, Rob. You want to let people in on that inside joke?

88
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,160
Oh, well, the founder of the Church of the Subgenius is J.R. Bob Dobbs,

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,240
and he had had a vision of the subgenius.

90
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,360
I am the first person to make this fabulous journey.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,880
Suspended in the timelessness of inner space are the thought waves of my first impression.

92
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:30,440
They will be our only source of contact once you have passed beyond the limits of normal.

93
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,640
Magnification.

94
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,880
Magnification.

95
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,120
Magnification.

96
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,140
Magnification.

97
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
And what is going to happen is there are some zists,

98
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,780
which are extraterrestrial creatures that are going to appear here on July 8, 1998,

99
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,560
at 7 o'clock in the morning, and the people who...

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,660
Oh, it isn't either. It's just 7.03.

101
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Well, 7.03. I'm just trying to explain briefly.

102
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah.

103
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,300
And the people who have Bob in their hearts,

104
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,460
which I believe you possibly could be, since you're Bob.

105
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,060
They're both wrong.

106
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,980
You're a candidate for this.

107
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,080
And we will take off from Earth just in time to miss the destruction of the Earth

108
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,440
in their pleasure saucers,

109
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,620
and we will be taken back to their planet, which is Planet X.

110
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,120
They call it because they don't want to reveal what planet they're from

111
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,540
until we're there, and we'll find out,

112
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,980
and we'll live in peace and harmony with them.

113
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,960
Now, I hate to disappoint you,

114
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,980
but my truly christened name by my mother is Bobby.

115
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,720
Now, I hate to disappoint you because I realize you had this deep spiritual respect for me

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,660
as the result of what you said in terms of the appellation applied to me,

117
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,220
but it truly is Bobby.

118
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,040
Now, in Alabama, I get along great.

119
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,600
In Nebraska, it wasn't so great.

120
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,940
It's great being raised as Bobby, okay?

121
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,400
Okay.

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,480
But, but, sir.

123
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,220
Yes?

124
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,940
To reduce the problem of evil and the reality of grace

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,980
to some kind of sick, silly joke is not only pathetic,

126
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,240
it's a waste of time.

127
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,840
And I cannot, for the life of me,

128
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,380
find out what you and the rest of the people in the so-called Church of the Subgenius

129
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,180
want to spend so much time doing absolutely nothing about nothing

130
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,400
when there are very serious and real problems in this world that need resolved

131
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,640
and no Bob can solve them.

132
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,140
Bob can solve them.

133
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,140
Bob can do lots of things.

134
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,400
Bob can do lots of things, dear friends.

135
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,400
And he did do lots of things.

136
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,840
Oh, he did some bad things, I'm sure.

137
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,480
And he did.

138
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,820
He did some real bad things,

139
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,280
or at least inspired some bad things at the Subgenius Convention.

140
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,140
God, it was two weeks ago,

141
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,460
and I'm still just barely recuperating from it.

142
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,980
In Chicago, the Subgenius Convention,

143
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,740
the conclave of the believers,

144
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,640
and we're going to play some more tapes from that tonight

145
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,060
of that fantabulous band,

146
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,780
the Swingin' Love Corpses,

147
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,900
the sizzling Sister Mary Squared preaching,

148
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,600
as well as the Subgenius Convention.

149
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,380
As Sister Velveteen Sly,

150
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,280
and I know, well, we get fan letters about Velveteen Sly.

151
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,800
They say, more pictures of Velveteen.

152
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,800
More pictures of Mary Square.

153
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,620
And G. Gordon Gordon will be on these tapes.

154
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,820
The conspiracy panel discussion continued.

155
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,220
And, of course, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

156
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,720
Ah, yes.

157
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,000
But interspersed, for obvious legal reasons,

158
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,420
are these wonderful clips.

159
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,740
These are the clips of tape sent by Reverend Michael Allen

160
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,020
way, way out there on the fringe,

161
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,260
in the frontier zones,

162
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,080
where he captured...

163
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,820
In fact, let me read you this letter

164
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:11,340
from this devoted and really talented Subgenius.

165
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,640
Reverend Stang, I finally spoke to Bob Larson on tape.

166
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,620
And slackfully, while I was on hold,

167
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,320
some other guy named Steve from Michigan

168
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,560
got on the air,

169
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,960
and started preaching for Bob Dobbs.

170
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,060
That's why I have to have this on tape.

171
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,220
Reverend Allen was just sitting there

172
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,320
waiting to tape himself,

173
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,000
and somebody else beat him to it,

174
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,640
praising Bob.

175
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,760
That was a trip, he says.

176
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,120
Then, when I got on the radio,

177
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,700
he just let me talk for a minute.

178
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,240
Before I even got to make any points,

179
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,500
I, um...

180
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,160
had cut me off.

181
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,460
And he's had some insults,

182
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:53,660
and I've had some insults for him.

183
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,080
Anyway, it's a great show,

184
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,900
and you can haunt those airwaves, too,

185
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,420
dear friends.

186
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,280
But, uh...

187
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,060
Oh, yeah, and I should mention,

188
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,400
there are several other...

189
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,920
If you enjoy the suggestions of the material

190
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,280
that you hear on this show,

191
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,540
there are some more coming up here and there

192
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,340
around the country.

193
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,460
Akron, October 7th.

194
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,760
Cleveland, October 10th.

195
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,880
Atlanta in November, the Phenomicon.

196
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,440
And...

197
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,920
There's somebody setting one up in Kansas City,

198
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,380
December 7th.

199
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
And, uh...

200
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,060
There's a new club opening in Dallas called Club No.

201
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,000
And it sounds like on New Year's,

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,140
there,

203
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,180
and, uh...

204
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,580
Like I said, December 7th, Kansas City,

205
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,760
and in November at Phenomicon,

206
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,140
there's gonna be the Swingin' Love Corpses,

207
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,840
Mary Squared Au Contrere,

208
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,920
uh, G. Gordon Gordon,

209
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,420
the whole hideous sort of thing,

210
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,240
and a whole crew of subgenius preachers.

211
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,440
It's almost like, uh,

212
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,480
a regular little traveling floating crap game or something.

213
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,340
It's just great.

214
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,740
Uh...

215
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,280
Oh, well, let's get back to these tapes.

216
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,360
You've gotta hear all of this stuff

217
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,740
from Bob Larson's show.

218
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,300
It's just fantastic.

219
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,520
So let's get back now to, uh,

220
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,720
talking about, uh, fornication.

221
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,000
I mean...

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,760
I'd like to change the subject

223
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,220
from fornication to cattle mutilation.

224
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,740
Are there any recent developments

225
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,820
on the cattle mutilation conspiracy?

226
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,480
Well, now, for some of us,

227
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,700
there's a good connection

228
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,080
between cattle mutilation and fornication.

229
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,720
Have you ever...

230
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,320
Because those things don't rot.

231
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,460
Those things lay there cut open,

232
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,680
and they don't rot, you know?

233
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,360
They core out a pretty good size.

234
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,360
Now, just what could have happened

235
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,580
to get such a piece of tripe?

236
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,960
I just noticed there's been no correlation

237
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,720
between cattle mutilation and Jack the Ripper.

238
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,920
Yeah, what about...

239
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,980
What's the correlation between

240
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,860
cattle mutilations and Jack the Ripper?

241
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,860
Actually, the cattle mutilation,

242
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,300
according to Tom Warner,

243
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,500
were done by those same two old guys

244
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,000
who did all the crop circles.

245
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,580
Uh, the 13,000 crop circles.

246
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,480
Praise the old guys.

247
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,100
Yeah, praise the two old British farts.

248
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,640
They practiced in the U.S.

249
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
on their vacations

250
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,280
doing the 20,000 cattle mutilations.

251
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,020
And all they used was a board

252
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,100
and a piece of string.

253
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,440
And a cup.

254
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,960
Is there any correlation

255
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,820
between the Nissan commercial and Bob?

256
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,940
Of course.

257
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Of course.

258
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,360
It was a connection.

259
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,120
But it was a connection that Bob set up, not us.

260
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,200
We know for a fact that the guy

261
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,460
who wrote the Nissan commercial

262
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,700
with the parking for Bob only and so forth

263
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,660
was not aware of the church of the subgenius.

264
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,120
But obviously, he was also not aware

265
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,960
that J.R. Bob Dobbs was doing the typing

266
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,200
when he wrote that ad.

267
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,540
So, that happens quite a bit.

268
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,620
I mean, Bob is prominent all over the earth.

269
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
And what you're doing

270
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,560
is exactly what Bob would want you to do.

271
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,800
You have the name of Bob

272
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,300
and you're ministering in his name

273
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,280
and you're helping people.

274
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,260
That's the subgenius helping out right now.

275
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,220
No, no, no, no, no.

276
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm ministering in the name of Jesus Christ.

277
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah, but you don't know.

278
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,620
You're covering it up as Jesus Christ.

279
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,200
But really, subconsciously,

280
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,180
you haven't been awakened yet.

281
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,180


282
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,600
You haven't been to this subgenius level yet.

283
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,160
You don't know it,

284
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,080
but you really are ministering

285
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,160
in the name of the subgenius.

286
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,980
You know, I'll bet if you

287
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,040
and the people of the Partridge Family Temple

288
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,280
ever got together,

289
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,100
along with the Electric Hellfire Club,

290
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,380
you people could eat cotton candy

291
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,360
and Hostess Twinkies all day long

292
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,660
and really party down.

293
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,180
Well, yeah, that sounds fun.

294
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,480
Not.

295
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,360
Anybody got a new friend?

296
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,120
Oh, thank God.

297
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,260
It's, oh, oh.

298
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,760
Let me cut your belly open.

299
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,900
Cut my belly open?

300
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,160
And show you the black stuff inside.

301
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,160
Why would I want to show you the black stuff inside?

302
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,280
I'll show you the black stuff inside.

303
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,500
What would ever possess me to want to show my,

304
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,940
disembowel myself from an audience?

305
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,860
Show the black stuff.

306
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,840
I'll show you, you, and you

307
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,580
all the black stuff inside.

308
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,660
No black stuff from here.

309
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,620
Oh, at this point in the

310
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,680
Swingin' Love Courses show, dear friends,

311
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,580
Sister Mary Square got up there in her underwear

312
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,860
doing a sort of bump and bump.

313
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,000
Hey, pull your pants up before I give you a wedgie.

314
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,680
Oh, he was talking to Sphinx at that point.

315
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,440
Young Sphinx.

316
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,500
He got stuck like that one time for about six weeks.

317
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,200
We had to haul him around.

318
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:13,960
He went to work.

319
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,960
We had to build a special chair for him at work

320
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,380
just to be able to sit like that.

321
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,460
Yeah.

322
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,820
Oh, now he's going to act like he's hurt.

323
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
You watch.

324
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,740
Tonight he won't load any equipment.

325
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,480
He'll say, my back's bothering me.

326
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,140
He does it every time.

327
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,780
We've got something to remark.

328
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,060
Now, this has never happened before.

329
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,200


330
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,420
At this point, Dr. Drummond, I think, does cut Sphinx's belly open

331
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,160
and show him the black stuff inside.

332
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,300
And Sphinx lays down and he's dead.

333
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,060
Black stuff is showing.

334
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,700
It's not working, even for ours.

335
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,360
And Sister Mary is inspired to bring him back to life

336
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,560
with this incredible bump and grind over his prostrate body.

337
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,000
And he starts bumping sort of from the floor upwards

338
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,820
and slowly finally makes it up to where they're both well.

339
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,540
We don't even pay her to do that.

340
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,860
She just likes it.

341
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,960
Chiropractic and health.

342
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,360
Is this the last song?

343
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,980
No.

344
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,060
No.

345
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,360


346
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:47,760
No.

347
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:56,680
This is the last song before our 15 or 20 obligatory encores

348
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,060
we know you'll call us back for.

349
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,980
So, I mean, we can stop now and play like maybe, you know,

350
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,700
depending, five more songs.

351
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,080
That be good?

352
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,800
Yeah.

353
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,560
Five.

354
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,720
Three.

355
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,640
Ten.

356
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,200
We don't know ten more.

357
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,680
Now, we've done two steps.

358
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,260
We've taken the time to ground and fender ourselves

359
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,320
and think about what we truly want

360
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,340
so that we can be true to our truth.

361
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,920
True Yeti heritage and lineage.

362
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,040
And remember, we are genetic supremacists

363
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,860
and there is such a thing as genetic memory.

364
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,360
So we better start thinking while we can.

365
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Now, we've set out the calling,

366
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,240
which, if you'll remember in our key,

367
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,060
is kind of symbolized by that little crucifix type

368
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,360
adulation, modulation, put two and two together.

369
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,800
And it does equal four, but a five will get you ten

370
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,160
if you know how to work it.

371
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,540
And if you can understand that,

372
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,060
and you can understand that I'm getting to it,

373
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,320
somebody's going to wind up walking out of here rich as hell

374
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,420
if we all play along.

375
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,960
Now, there's, it's a threefold concept.

376
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,400
And in techno magic, you've got a triangle there,

377
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,220
which is the most stable force in any kind of mathematical,

378
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,560
religious type organization.

379
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,260
You can find trees anywhere.

380
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,700
And the force faces the void, which we can't avoid.

381
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,100
But we can annoy it.

382
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,300
So, now we put our hand into the void,

383
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,640
into the force face here.

384
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,780
All right, we don't know where we're going.

385
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,240
We're diving head first into the abyss.

386
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,060
Look if you like, but you're going to have to leave.

387
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,400
And we've set out the fact that we want money.

388
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,260
Now, the third, the third key to this is that we've got to put money into the void.

389
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,760
Now, does anybody have a hat?

390
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,300
Yeah.

391
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,600
Thank you, brother.

392
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,320
And there's money in it.

393
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,480
I heard.

394
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,560
Now, all I'm asking to prove a point, and you don't have to do this,

395
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,160
is if you can take a one dollar bill, one dollar, and place it into this hat.

396
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,060
Can everybody do that?

397
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,040
If everybody doesn't, then everybody will have a chance to see what will come out of the void.

398
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,060
Come on, give to the hearts.

399
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,680
You don't know the truth like this if you're not doing it.

400
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,680
Give to the hearts.

401
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,180
Get up.

402
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,320
It's one dollar.

403
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,300
Taxi cab driver will rip you off for more words of saying that we want to play now.

404
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,100
Thank you, Dr. Lequeu.

405
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,060
The true brother Kevin to me.

406
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,520
Oh, thank you, brother.

407
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,520
Thank you, Reverend Clay Animation.

408
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,000
Thank you, Reverend Gray.

409
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,260
Oh, thank you.

410
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,860
Thank you, Dr. Lequeu.

411
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,840
Thank you, shoulder man.

412
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,200
Drinking cider and Kool-Aid and we gamble on the other talk.

413
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,680
Anybody else want to give?

414
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,660
We got a whole lot of money.

415
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,080
We got a half of the money right here.

416
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,180
Everything you got.

417
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,180
Thank you.

418
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,060
Thank you.

419
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,360
You can always give more, but too much is always better than not enough.

420
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,340
Always remember that.

421
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,100
Thank you.

422
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,280
Now, the folks that have put into this void, please stay up here.

423
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,860
Now, we got a half full of money, right?

424
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,740
Right.

425
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,720
All right.

426
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,180
We have put the time and the money into the void.

427
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,140
Pass it up.

428
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,140
Hurry up.

429
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,520
Pass it up.

430
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,180
Pass it up.

431
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,200
It's coming around.

432
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,760
It's only coming around for a long time.

433
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,820
It's a big hat full of money.

434
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,860
We'll come again.

435
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,840
This is a pretty big club.

436
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,240
There's a couple of hundred people in there.

437
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,900
I think it's probably about 40 or 50 bucks.

438
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,800
There were 20s in there.

439
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,200
Now, we have put everything into the void and the concept in this Technomagic is that

440
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,120
when you put into the void and you can't control when it's in the void, it's going

441
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,120


442
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,120


443
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,120


444
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,120


445
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,120


446
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,120


447
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,120


448
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,120


449
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,960
it'll put out, but when you put into the board, there is a three-fold give-back return.

450
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,020
Now, when Reverend Stag works, and when Pope Flores works, and they put money and time

451
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,960
into these events, and into making their hours of slack, they're giving you the keys for

452
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,620
your own techno magic to show you personally how to pull the wall over your own eyes, relax

453
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:46,220
in the safety of your own delusions, and get rich off the plane's stride.

454
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,420
All right, now that we've had this little humorous exchange, bottom line, Steve, why

455
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,260
does this idiotic, stupid stuff appeal to you?

456
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,660
Well, because I look, I see, it's just, I look at it as another religion.

457
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,900
All religions in the world, to me...

458
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,460
Oh, you don't look at this as another religion, it's a joke.

459
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,500
All religions seem to be stuffed with...

460
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,180
Just pain and trouble and strife.

461
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,680
No, it's your way of making a joke out of the reality of religion.

462
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,400
I've got more respect for a Hindu and a Buddhist than I do for you.

463
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,740
I've got more respect for a Hindu and a Buddhist than I do for you.

464
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,960
Hey, everybody, I think it's time to say, we can't put up with things on this way.

465
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,360
We've got to turn around and turn it inside out, because the power of the laser ain't

466
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,600
enough.

467
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,300
Monsters become nicer than people that you trust, and they fall to pieces, even diamonds

468
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,980
turn to dust.

469
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,100
State of emergency!

470
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,660
State of emergency!

471
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,060
State of emergency!

472
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,660
State of emergency!

473
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
Go on, get tough, get tough, get going.

474
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,900
Step on the accelerator, get the mother rolling.

475
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,380
Out on the back streets, you see them coming round.

476
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,840
Hot times are troubled, man, you're going down.

477
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,400
But they're moving forward, they want to conquer all.

478
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,820
But they go up, one pass them all.

479
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,120
State of emergency!

480
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,460
State of emergency!

481
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,960
State of emergency!

482
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,460
State of emergency!

483
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,960
State of emergency!

484
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,060
People like to think that they've got it made.

485
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,380
It's only good till the last thought is played.

486
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,020
Six or one, half a dozen, let the other, it's not so bitch.

487
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,320
The bitch is a monster.

488
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,800
A monster be ribboned over and he

489
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,880
wants, once and g quer qu' a lot.

490
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,020
Who wants a stake over and wants a zmall.

491
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,640
There will be no mercy!

492
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,920
It's all urgency.

493
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,460
State of emergency!

494
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,480
State of emergency!

495
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,800
It's all urgency!

496
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,820
State of emergency!

497
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,020
State of emergency!

498
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,300
State of emergency!

499
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,520
State of emergency!

500
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,580
State of emergency!

501
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:31,580


502
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:31,580


503
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:31,580


504
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:31,580


505
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:31,580


506
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:38,260
state of emergency!

507
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,960
There's a definite correlation between tornadoes and trailer bars.

508
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,320
Exactly.

509
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,580
That has been made over and over again.

510
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,800
These metal boxes are foregone energy of chemo.

511
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,260
And this is why we have them.

512
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,740
Praise right.

513
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,440
Praise.

514
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,700
Too much orgone is always better than not enough.

515
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,840
Unless you live in a metal trailer.

516
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,300
Suck some tornadoes out of the sky.

517
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,700
Yeah, there's subgeniuses that can suck the tornadoes back.

518
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,360
With reversed orgone spin.

519
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,320
By the way, Connie is capable of the tsunami orgasm.

520
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,420
A tsunami is the word for a Japanese hurricane.

521
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,880
Now, if I can get all of you lovely gentlemen,

522
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,420
and ever so fine, Reverend Janina Grinder,

523
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,260
and your gorgeous looking legs.

524
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,460
I hope you have your fishnet stockings on tonight.

525
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,540
To sit down or squat down in clear space,

526
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,260
I'm going to turn, put the microphone down,

527
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,760
or turn it over to Reverend Stang,

528
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,100
and we're going to go back.

529
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,860
We're going to go back to our mantra.

530
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,780
All right?

531
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,680
And I want you to really mantra like you have never mantra'd before.

532
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,020
I want you to sit down and say,

533
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,820
Oh, my, please pat me, Molly.

534
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,860
And you better have your eyes closed,

535
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,680
because you can't see where I'm going,

536
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,220
or where I'm coming to.

537
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,520
I slip in and out whenever I like.

538
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,920
All right?

539
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,720
Can I ask everybody to sit down,

540
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,820
or at least close your eyes.

541
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,500
Stand where you are.

542
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,640
Why don't you just stand where you are,

543
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,340
and start your mantra.

544
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:30,800
Oh.

545
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,500
Come on.

546
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,940
Come on.

547
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,200
Come on.

548
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:33,600
Come on.

549
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:33,760
Come on.

550
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:33,800
Come on.

551
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:33,800


552
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,540
Now, Sister Mary Squared goes into this subgenius convention

553
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,880
crowd gathering,

554
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,880
while she's looking for a stranger to give the money to.

555
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,260
And I build up to the money-burning ceremony.

556
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,800
I only burn one dollar.

557
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,160
While this miracle is about to happen,

558
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,780
we have to make sure that the exes,

559
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,040
the men from Planet X,

560
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,360
know,

561
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,040
that there's something on this planet still worth saving.

562
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,580
And we're going to send this message to people in the world.

563
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:13,280
So I, as presiding priest, burn a dollar bill.

564
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,300
And Sister Mary...

565
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,480
You could be more deaf. I bet you have $20 in here

566
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,260
to buy yourself a fully certified membership to the church.

567
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,820
She has presented the money to a stranger.

568
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,900
Yeah. If you put it into the void, you can pull out.

569
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,680
And you owe all of these people right here a threefold return.

570
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,280
And you don't have to give back the money, although you can,

571
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,960
because then you'll get it back threefold, and it's kind of like a lottery.

572
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,720
Or you can just give it back to them mentally

573
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,860
and bless them and charge the money for your blessings.

574
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,660
Or actual slack. What have you.

575
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,140
But I bet you've learned a valuable lesson in the search for the sub-genius.

576
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,580
Give till it hurts.

577
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,300
The young man then throws the money into the crowd,

578
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,880
throws the money back into the crowd.

579
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,120
A true bomb, ladies and gentlemen!

580
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,160
A true bomb!

581
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,640
Prize bomb!

582
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,380
Now, I'm wondering why the rest of you didn't give,

583
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,880
and I'm not going to praise you for giving,

584
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,700
because God knows I give till it hurts,

585
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,380
and sometimes I just can't give anything.

586
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,800
Squeeze, though, amen.

587
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,660
I did!

588
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,200
And I bet there are all kinds of excuses running through your heads,

589
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,560
like, oh, I just didn't feel like it,

590
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,080
or I didn't know what she was going to do,

591
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,400
or she's just going to keep it for herself,

592
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,080
or all she's got is a thick, down bra,

593
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,100
and oh, I probably won't be the one to get the money.

594
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,980
That excuse is so lame, even Bob couldn't make it walk.

595
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,320
But Tom was so good.

596
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,300
We are a sound sex that is selling sex,

597
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,840
and there is no one except this church that can sell sex like we can.

598
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,160
Yeah!

599
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,720
I bet you never thought aliens looked like this before.

600
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,040
Well, did ya?

601
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,440
And there are many of us here tonight.

602
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,080
There are many sisters of the Yeti,

603
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,800
uber women and priestesses to the umpteenth degree.

604
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,640
No one here enough.

605
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,080
Oh, but they're big enough to go around.

606
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,280
Whoa!

607
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,560
We are well-rounded priests.

608
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,960
We give you all kinds of interesting curves,

609
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,180
and angles, and so on.

610
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,300
Always have a girl.

611
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,860
Oh, yeah, now that's where I should stop in

612
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,560
and remind you all, dear friends,

613
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,640
that you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry

614
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,100
Hour of Slack,

615
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,260
a presentation of the Church of the Subgenius,

616
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,440
and with tapes from the recent Subgenius convention,

617
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,940
interspersed with some nice media birds,

618
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,200
and some nice garage clips by St. Joe Riley.

619
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,540
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

620
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,600
And I should identify the station here.

621
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,820
I see him walking close to me.

622
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,040
Let it be.

623
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,700
Whoo!

624
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,380
Okay.

625
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,000
Now that we are all truly grounded

626
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,980
and caught up inside our heads,

627
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,280
and now that we've gotten rid of our bull,

628
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,140
we can fully admit that what's going on within us

629
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,060
is gonna go on with Alice, whether we like it or not,

630
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,080
so we better happy up and have a good time.

631
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,540
Start getting ready to get rid of our chickens,

632
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,220
and look at our absurdities, and say,

633
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,020
we are an ugly religion.

634
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,660
We pick our noses.

635
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,840
We pyro-flagellate to the gods.

636
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,980
And sex is messy.

637
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:57,940
Whoo!

638
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,020
Now, praise the messy sex.

639
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,520
Praise the messy sex.

640
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,100
All right, now.

641
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:42,580
Can you get this thing out of here this rickety,

642
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,520
Tingle official?

643
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:46,640
Mom.

644
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,080
This is the way the conspiracy gets you distracted off into the little conspiracies.

645
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,340
You start working on, you get obsessed with one of them, like Kennedy assassination.

646
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,440
Of course, if there's any good one to be obsessed with, it's JFK assassination.

647
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:18,520
Because even if there was no conspiracy to kill John Kennedy, the information you find

648
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:25,660
out investigating that indicates that there could so easily have been one that that alone

649
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,400
is cause for alarm.

650
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,120
And that's what people have never seemed to bother with.

651
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,860
And the time control factor involved with that too, getting you to focus on researching

652
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:42,220
the Kennedy assassination conspiracy when there are past incidents that are now.

653
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,880
Right, they got you complaining about Star Wars program when they're actually spending

654
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,500
the money to make slaves on it.

655
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:48,980
They're the worst people on the moon.

656
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,300
Don't laugh.

657
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,500
Are you sure?

658
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,280
I saw a TV show that proved it.

659
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,920
I read a paper called Alternative 3.

660
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,960
I read this in the church.

661
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:08,060
In the church, we like to believe everything, every cheap paperback we read.

662
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,880
And if you will accept these things unquestioningly, they could kind of stay in your mind a little

663
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,860
longer and you start to see the connections between all of them.

664
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,480
And sometimes they do.

665
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,400
Sometimes they're connections that not even the craziest crackpot kooks have stumbled upon, and yet we find them.

666
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,400
Ah, what does that tell you?

667
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,280
We're crazier than they think they are.

668
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:30,720
Aha!

669
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,560
More observance.

670
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,160
Everything you know is right.

671
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,260
That's the scariest thing about it.

672
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,920
Unless you misprove it yourself.

673
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,540
Then that's what the frappy is for.

674
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,180
I mean, if you can't prove anything, it's good practice for the next one.

675
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,260
That's right.

676
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,200
I mean, if it's not one conspiracy, it's going to be another one.

677
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,040
I mean, I figure Vietnam was just practice for the wars on Mars.

678
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,480
Or Venus.

679
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,580
It'd be more like Venus.

680
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,740
Vietnam was practice for South Pepsi Cola in Southeast Asia.

681
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,260
That's right.

682
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,380
Venus has, as we know from Ray Bradbury, Venus has this dense rain and jungle.

683
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,560
So Vietnam was practice for that.

684
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,260
But, uh...

685
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,240
The Gulf, the Gulf, the Persian Gulf was for wars.

686
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,220
That was for wars.

687
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,420
Excuse me, Reverend Stang, I have a question.

688
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,400
Now, y'all have been stirring the issue all afternoon long.

689
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,820
Well, we were paid to.

690
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,380
Hi, guys.

691
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:29,880
Hi, guys.

692
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,440
Hi, guys.

693
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,700
I am in control.

694
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,620
I hold the compact.

695
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,760
And I am confident.

696
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,940
Worship of Connie is central to the church.

697
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,520
Yes.

698
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,280
For, in fact, I've got control of all of Bob's needs.

699
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:56,780
.

700
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,580
Yes, I knew you were somewhere.

701
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,840
I have Bob's car keys.

702
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,060
.

703
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,280
I'm in charge of the checkbook.

704
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,120
Yeah!

705
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,680
You're right.

706
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,100
You're right about the credit cards.

707
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,500
It's more control.

708
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,040
Right in here.

709
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,340
Also, all his CDs, his personal computer code.

710
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,180
Whoo!

711
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,700
All of his cash.

712
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
He needs more cash.

713
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,320
.

714
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,500
.

715
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,420
Dangerous woman, Connie.

716
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,560
You can quote me, Connie.

717
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,240
When the going gets tough, the slack mix cocktails.

718
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,280
.

719
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,000
I've got more respect for a Hindu and a Buddhist than I do for you.

720
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,440
At least they believe something.

721
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,500
Yeah, we just believe in having a good time while you're here.

722
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,860
Until the time has come.

723
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,380
And when you die?

724
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:42,740
.

725
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,220
Well, if I'm one of the redeemed ones, I will never die.

726
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:47,680
.

727
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,720
If I'm lucky enough to zip off in a pleasure saucer, I'll never die.

728
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,020
.

729
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,960
Can't you see the de-evolution of our society?

730
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,580
I have more respect for Anton LaVey than I do you.

731
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,200
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

732
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:11,700
Yeah, I really do, because at least he is a Connie Barker-turned-Satanic-Hunkster who knows he's ripping off the public with an absurd ideology.

733
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,820
.

734
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:21,960
But you, at 16 years of age, have the evil arrogance of trying to assume that there's some legitimacy to this gobbledygook you're talking about.

735
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,200
Well, I want to tell you, God is not named Bob.

736
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:25,940
.

737
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,040
Don't worry about me! Kill the bastard!

738
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,820
.

739
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:33,820
.

740
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:33,820


741
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:33,820


742
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:33,820


743
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:33,820


744
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:33,820


745
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:33,820


746
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:33,820


747
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,320
.

748
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,320


749
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,380
.

750
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:35,500
.

751
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,180
.

752
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,260
.

753
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,460
.

754
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:38,480
.

755
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:38,660
.

756
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:38,660


757
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:38,660


758
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:38,820
.

759
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:38,820


760
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,080
.

761
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,160
.

762
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,460
.

763
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:39,460


764
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:39,460


765
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:39,460


766
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,680
.

767
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,280
.

768
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,280


769
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,280


770
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,280


771
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:17,500
Okay, we're back at the subgenius convention in this incredibly hot bar or stage, and the swingin' love corpses are in the throes of their song, State of Emergency.

772
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,900
Guitarist Ray Hay has fallen to the ground holding the guitar.

773
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,440
.

774
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:31,720
The other band members cluster around him and begin playing his guitar with their instruments.

775
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,080
He has had some sort of spasm or something. He can barely play.

776
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:49,520
And the other love corpses are pounding the guitar with their saxophones, their accordions, their synthesizers, their drums.

777
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:59,660
A huge fan is brought up by Princess We Are Doe and is used as a pick, I suppose you could say.

778
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,100
I started using my video camera for a pick.

779
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:11,180
Sister Mary Squared was nailing Sphinx Drummond to a huge upright cross on stage with real nails.

780
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,900
But I think he dug it. He was getting into it.

781
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,900
There was live sex going on in the audience, dear friends.

782
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:30,220
It was truly, it turned Chicago's froth theater, 1992, into California's Hollywood Bowl, 1967,

783
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,260
where four English dudes were playing some type of music.

784
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,000
And the most important being how they

785
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,060
tired the heat that by disappointing the band a full house without設ging or clamping

786
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,100
motherfucker on Senator

787
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,520
But if he kinda still held the floor and weren't a cop, that was the Only Experience necessary to be endeavors.

788
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:07,740
Oh, good question.

789
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:07,760

806
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,840
flew down into the audience there.

807
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,240
Perhaps in evidence of Bob's participation,

808
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,260
these good subgeniuses, dollar-spending subgeniuses,

809
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,520
were not smashing the head,

810
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,340
although if that thing had hit someone on the head

811
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,880
and critically burned them,

812
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,800
I'm not going to mention that there have been brain cells

813
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,220
they do not need anymore.

814
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,480
Other religions, man, they're trying to take all of your money.

815
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,220
We might trick you into giving us your money.

816
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,860
We might trick you into doing it like the sister marriages do.

817
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,120
But you'll get it back.

818
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,360
You'll get your money's worth.

819
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,120
On next day, you'll be going,

820
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,960
oh, it's too bad my buddy back there didn't want to spend $20

821
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,040
on literally everything he might ever want for eternity.

822
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,780
Something is implanted, an instinct,

823
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,420
a blind compulsion to act for them.

824
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,140
But Quatermass, if you're right, what's going to happen?

825
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,320
What's the ultimate object?

826
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,880
I hesitate to guess, Inspector.

827
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,660
First, a few of these things came here at random, scattered,

828
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,660
and then expended themselves to a purpose.

829
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,620
A year ago, phase number two, the concentrated attack.

830
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,580
When the going gets tough, the slack mix cocktails.

831
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,160
I'm convenience incurrent,

832
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,320
even as I am the creatrix of catastrophe,

833
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,520
cryptic, chaotic, cataclysmic.

834
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,780
It has been confirmed that all can be cured

835
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,120
through the power of Akani.

836
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,280
Of course, Akani can be worshipped.

837
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,380
Yeah.

838
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,480
Praise God!

839
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:44,620
Praise God!

840
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:45,100
Praise God!

841
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,740
Praise God!

842
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,880
There are many ways for men to worship me,

843
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,220
but I prefer them on their knees.

844
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,160
Oh, okay!

845
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,040
Now, I hope you understand what this program's doing

846
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,320
is educating you the stuff that's going on out there,

847
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:08,820
letting you know the reality of deception that's in our world.

848
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,480
And there's more than one face of evil.

849
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,600
What this young man was talking about is just as evil,

850
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,120
because you know what the ultimate evil is?

851
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,520
It's separating man from the goodness and love

852
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,020
and atonement of Jesus Christ.

853
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,200
And whatever it takes to do it,

854
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,540
the devil will have accomplished his goal.

855
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,480
Satan wants to separate you from the truth.

856
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,360
Jesus Christ loves you and came to die for your sins.

857
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,620
We got Michael on the line at Fort Worth.

858
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,000
Michael?

859
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,340
Bob, I can't believe that you sat there on the radio

860
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,280
and you called Bob Dobbs evil.

861
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,560
Because, you know, really, you're the one that's evil

862
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,940
because that's why everyone listens to your show.

863
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,120
Because they like to listen to the evilness

864
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
that's on your story.

865
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,100
You know, Destroyer and all that crap, you know.

866
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,140
Those are demons, sir.

867
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,040
Don't make a light of it.

868
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,220
Well, that's why I'm listening to it,

869
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,260
because I like evil.

870
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,220
Yeah?

871
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:56,880
You know?

872
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,420
What do you do?

873
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,820
And you sat there and you called Bob Dobbs evil?

874
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,320
Yeah, that's just stupid.

875
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,240
The Church of the Subgenius is stupid.

876
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,420
No, see, but that's why I'm saying,

877
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,020
you don't believe in that,

878
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,900
but how can you believe in something like,

879
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,960
you know, like the Bible or something?

880
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,620
Sir, sir, I have a 1,300-page book here

881
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,440
that I said a moment ago,

882
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,340
I've got to give five of these away to people who,

883
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,380
give 2,2312 in their credit card.

884
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,300
This is a 1,300-page, 7x10 reference work

885
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,480
with 2,400 articles and 1,500 biographical entries

886
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,280
that deals with just the history

887
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,800
of Christianity in America.

888
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,240
All right?

889
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,780
Then this other book over here that we're giving away

890
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:45,620
is 688 pages cataloging 2,000 years

891
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,500
of the influence of Christianity.

892
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,240
Now, I've got these two books here,

893
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,040
and I've got them sitting side by side,

894
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:52,700
and I'm looking at them,

895
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,460
and we're talking like about five inches worth of books.

896
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:56,840
All right?

897
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,740
But I'm not going to say...

898
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,320
No, no, no, just listen to me.

899
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,440
Now, that's reality, sir.

900
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,740
That is history.

901
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,180
That is fact.

902
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:05,780
To you.

903
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,060
That is flesh and blood of what has actually happened

904
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,940
in the history of humanity for the last 2,000 years.

905
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,000
And you're going to tell me

906
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,500
that you're going to stick something in there?

907
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,040
I'm a jerk.

908
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:18,760
Hey, man.

909
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,080
With a name like Bob up as some fake god,

910
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,280
and you're going to take five inches worth of books here

911
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,480
of the reality of Christianity's influence on history.

912
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,940
What I want to tell you,

913
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,000
you are ignorant and you are arrogant.

914
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,440
But I think you are those two.

915
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,360
Ah, get a life.

916
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,200
Just get a life, okay?

917
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:40,920
Get a life.

918
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,480
Come on, grow up and get a life.

919
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:43,840
You're always telling people...

920
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,860
Nah, grow up, man.

921
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,500
Get a life.

922
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,680
This is serious history.

923
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,500
This is the reality.

924
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,580
There are 2,000 years of recorded history

925
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,300
of what Christianity has contributed to this world

926
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,700
and millions of people involved in that contribution.

927
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,640
So get off this idea of some pleasure craft

928
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,500
coming to take you to Planet X on July the whatever in 1998.

929
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,160
Grow up, get yourself a life,

930
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,760
and wake up to the reality

931
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,940
that this silly little joke you consume yourself with

932
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,800
will damn your soul to hell.

933
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,480
No, see, I don't believe in...

934
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,080
in hell.

935
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,480
I don't believe in any of that.

936
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,400
So I'm not worried about that.

937
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,220
See?

938
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,280
Sir?

939
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,800
Sir?

940
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,440
That's like telling the people of Somalia

941
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,800
not to worry about starvation.

942
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,040
Hurricane!

943
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,260
This is Louisiana!

944
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,400
Florida!

945
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:39,880
Hooks that Florida!

946
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,300
It's a bummer!

947
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,460
It's a bummer!

948
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,560
It's a bummer!

949
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,460
80 million people died on Earth.

950
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,200
Earthquake in China!

951
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,520
It's a bummer!

952
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,280
Bummer!

953
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,280
Trillion dollar deficit!

954
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,920
Bummer!

955
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,560
Sort of a beautiful thing, though, don't you think?

956
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,300
Trillion dollar deficit.

957
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,280
George Bush for president!

958
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,560
Bummer!

959
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,640
Bill Clinton for president!

960
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:13,800
Bummer!

961
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:14,260


962
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,500
Ross Perot for president!

963
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:17,800
President!

964
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:19,200
Bummer!

965
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,040
Senator Bob Donovan for president!

966
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,680
Not a bummer!

967
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,820
Not a bummer!

968
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:28,820
That's a bummer, too.

969
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,920
You wouldn't want him as your president!

970
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,820
You wouldn't want him as your president!

971
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,460
It would be a bummer!

972
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,800
This guitar isn't loud enough!

973
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,120
Bummer!

974
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,680
Final point, all the guitar solos from now on.

975
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:51,880
Father!

976
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,660
That's like telling someone

977
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,540
who has Carposius sarcoma

978
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,020
not to worry about dying from AIDS.

979
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,880
One of the things that's very frightening about you, Michael,

980
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,780
and a lot of kids today

981
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,560
is to get up on these idiotic flights of fantasy.

982
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,360
And believe me, there are enough people

983
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,360
who are rip-off artists out there

984
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,060
who are willing to sell you any kind of bill of goods

985
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,500
to get you to believe in something.

986
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,780
And Michael, there is 2,000 years of recorded history

987
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,240
of what Christianity has done for this world.

988
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,780
We're talking about real flesh and blood lies.

989
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,180
We're talking about the reality

990
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,980
of God's work and God's power.

991
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,740
I am also talking right now

992
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,140
about 162 obscene and harassing phone calls

993
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,080
and only two people sharing 22312.

994
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,480
Beautiful band!

995
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,740
Now they've got themselves a colony.

996
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,820
And all this went on for a year and nobody said anything?

997
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,060
But who knows how many infected people they've got in high places.

998
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,060
What about here? Can you be sure of all your stuff?

999
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,000
I think so else.

1000
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:16,940
I think so else.

1001
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,800
I think so else.

1002
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,080
I think so else.

1003
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,760
I think so else.

1004
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,740
Okay, you've been listening to the report

1005
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,440
from the 1992 Subgenius World Convention

1006
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,340
Subgenius World Convention

1007
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,160
Chicago, Illinois.

1008
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,280
And not to mention the beautiful Bob Larson clips.

1009
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,580
Thanks to Reverend Michael Allen for those.

1010
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,160
And you know, there's still more from that Worldcon to hear here.

1011
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,900
So don't forget to stay tuned for that.

1012
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,120
And for more information about the Church of the Subgenius

1013
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,960
and everything we do for you,

1014
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,980
just write to that post office box for that free information.

1015
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,460
And of course, that post office box number is

1016
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:23,320
post office box number 140306

1017
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,580
right here in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1018
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,600
75214.

1019
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,960
Post office box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

1020
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,080
75214.

1021
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,160
Not enough of you have been writing into that, so write into that.

1022
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,600
And stay tuned for even more.

1023
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,820
Praise Bob.

1024
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,440
The Baptist broke into subgenius H&M and stole big red straps.

1025
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,080
Oh my God.

1026
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,280
No, it was the altar, not the...

1027
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,160
No, well, that was an exaggeration.

1028
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,580
Actually, we sold them the big red straps.

1029
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,540
Praise Bob.

1030
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,220
And for a steal.

1031
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,800
It was for a steal.

1032
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,360
We were trying to, you know, get them...

1033
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,600
But see, they won't admit what they were using those big red straps for.

1034
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,600
You know, they weren't going to talk about the dildos strapped onto their heads or anything.

1035
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,040
See, in their church,

1036
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,660
you know, if their preacher gets caught fooling around,

1037
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:22,500
he gets fired, gets defrocked or whatever.

1038
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,140
And whereas if they had been subgeniuses...

1039
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,520
If Jimmy Swaggart had been a subgenius,

1040
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,040
he'd be number one.

1041
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,060
He'd have been number one.

1042
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,360
And so would Deborah Murphree.

1043
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,580
Praise Deborah.

1044
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,140
She was the hooker that he was...

1045
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:45,940
He was caught.

1046
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:50,680
And there was excellent photography of her in Penthouse.

1047
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,140
It was Swaggart's high view.

1048
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,220
Penthouse ran an art pictorial.

1049
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,100
It was like, what Swaggart paid to see.

1050
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,860
It actually was not a very pretty sight.

1051
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,000
But it had that dirty, sort of...

1052
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,420
That forbidden, nasty, bad aspect.

1053
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,940
And that was what he was going for.

1054
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,760
Praise the forbidden, bad, nasty...

1055
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,860
That's right, Mama.

1056
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,220
I got a diamond cutter.

1057
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,240
A blue fainter.

1058
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,880
With a shiny, shiny head.

1059
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,880
Hey, hey, stay.

1060
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,200
Hey, stay.

1061
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,940
Hey, stay.

1062
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,960
You dancing with us?

1063
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,400
They have programmed us to think that we...

1064
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,300
That you...

1065
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,420
That you're a human is an evil word.

1066
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,620
And that what comes naturally for us is evil.

1067
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,460
And that we must disempower our true abilities.

1068
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,460
And if we can...

1069
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:02,600
Like a great horned one, a great stag like Bob,

1070
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,760
then we can rule the world.

1071
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,120
And they've taken that away and said,

1072
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,720
no, no, what makes a great ruler is how much money he has

1073
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,220
or who he's connected to.

1074
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,980
The sword and the stone, the whole mythology in point,

1075
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:19,580
of that whole mythos has been stripped from our minds

1076
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,980
and they've put up this society

1077
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,740
where they make you think you have to work to please the female.

1078
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,700
The female has to get down on her knees from you.

1079
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,660
When really, if you're working to please each other,

1080
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,660
getting the other person off is going to get you off

1081
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,560
as much as possible.

1082
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,360
Instead of getting up and getting on,

1083
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,920
it's the greater glory of mankind.

1084
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:45,060
What has been lost in this society and this world

1085
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:45,960
is that we have to get up and get on.

1086
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,360
And that's why we have forgotten that there is a yin and a yang

1087
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,920
and that there are male and female energies of power

1088
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,200
and they have only given us one aspect to focus on

1089
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,820
and lost the other,

1090
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,960
which is why we no longer have withstanding principles and theories.

1091
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:02,760
Well, I don't know.

1092
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,520
On the other hand, there's those who would argue

1093
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,320
that the women have the biggest conspiracy

1094
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,480
and have been controlling everybody for thousands of years.

1095
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,720
They had to because they were taken away

1096
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,540
from the power of the human.

1097
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,100
From their innate ability to control.

1098
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,900
They were forced to manipulate and become bodies.

1099
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,200
Oh, for the old patriarchal days.

1100
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:30,320
It's so nice to have lived in that period for a brief time.

1101
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,920
Not that I got to take much advantage of it.

1102
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,160
We know who wears the pants in the Dobbs family.

1103
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,280
Well, we know Bob may wear the pants,

1104
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,360
but only Connie can take them off.

1105
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,200
Rock King.

1106
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:48,360


1107
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,020
.

1108
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,920
It goes.

1109
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,460
.

1110
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,220
Pumpkin-filled mariners made out of mud

1111
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,860
Pore-ends made out of muslin' blood

1112
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,460
Muslin' blood and skin and bones

1113
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,100
Combined as weak but a back that's strong

1114
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,740
Those 16-tons, what do you get?

1115
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,380
16-tons, what do you get?

1116
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,980
16-tons, what do you get?

1117
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,560
Another day older and deeper in death

1118
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,280
St. Peter's coming cause I can't go

1119
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,880
Where my soul and company stole

1120
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,520
I bought one more when the sun didn't shine

1121
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,160
Picked up my shovel and I walked the line

1122
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,740
16-tons, look up my toe

1123
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,340
Lost my spirit, well bless my soul

1124
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,940
16-tons, what do you get?

1125
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,540
16-tons, what do you get?

1126
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,160
16-tons, what do you get?

1127
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,760
Another day older and deeper in death

1128
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,380
St. Peter's coming cause I can't go
