1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
Yeah, this is Reverend Tanya and I live in Leipzig, Germany and believe it or not

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,100
I listen to WCSB all the time. Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,560
I see no reason for violence. If however you are confronted you may result

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,780
in some genius.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,060
Bugs.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,020
So now we can hug our fleas and ticks too.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,140
American Ticks.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,660
Don't kill flies with our nostrils.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,120
It sounds like an American concept.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,100
Really too much. Americans always overdo things.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,140
Well, strangely enough it's pretty worldwide to tell the truth.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,060
In fact we're going to Germany in a month just because some fans wanted to see what makes us tick.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,340
Or maybe they want to kill us. I don't know.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,280
I want to see the last places on earth.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,000
Why are you here?

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,700
We're looking for the Marifesa Lupino Lumino.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,640
A strange flower which grows only in Tibet and which it is said takes its life from the moon.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,380
Is there really such a flower, Father?

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,260
There are some things it is better not to bother with.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,080
Our coolies tell us the valley we want to visit is filled with demons.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,540
Then we're right. This is the place. Get the ponies.

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:14,840
Right.

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,600
You are foolish.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,840
But without fools there would be no wisdom.

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,800
Pax vobiscum.

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,320
My name is...

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,560
Ich heiße...

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,060
Ich heiße...

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,620
Ivan Stan.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,800
Prinz V.

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,940
Ich heiße...

32
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,820
Ich heiße...

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:37,700
Ivan.

34
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,600
Ich heiße V...

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,480
Ivan.

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,940
Ich heiße...

37
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,540
Ich heiße...

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,760
My name is Dr. Weideberg.

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,980
The German alphabet.

40
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:54,500
The German alphabet.

41
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,220
Now we've done the alphabet.

42
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,480
Ich heiße Heisenberg.

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,680
Please repeat the German names for the letters of the alphabet.

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,900
Ich heiße V. Heisenberg. Dr. Heisenberg.

45
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,220
Ah.

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,480
A, B, C, D, U, S.

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,140
Practice spelling these words in the pauses.

48
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,160
A, B, C, D, U, S.

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,800
Wuster, Machten, Etchen.

50
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,500
V.

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:13,620
Machten.

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,660
We're going to start from the beginning.

53
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,480
My name is...

54
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,680
My name is Kälber.

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,840
And...

56
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,440
And...

57
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,620
My name is...

58
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,860
My name is...

59
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,540
My name is...

60
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,700
My name is...

61
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,940
Kälber.

62
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,580
Kälber.

63
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,160
My name is...

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,540
My name is...

65
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,000
Kälber.

66
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,260
My name is...

67
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:43,860
My name is...

68
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,500
Kälber.

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,840
Praise Bob.

70
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,840
Praise Bob.

71
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,460
Do I understand you to say that we met in Tibet?

72
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,120
Yes.

73
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,460
And unless I'm mistaken,

74
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,080
we were both on a similar mission.

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes?

76
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,920
Would it be intrusive if I should ask you

77
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,640
if you were successful?

78
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,760
In what?

79
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,940
In obtaining a specimen

80
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,740
of the Mariphesa lumina

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,580
the phosphorescent wolf flower.

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:16,800


83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,600
Why, you know,

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,260
it blooms only under the rays of the moon.

85
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,700
This flower is an antidote for...

86
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,280
This flower is an antidote for...

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,600
for what?

88
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,400
Werewolfry.

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,300
Lycanthropobia is the medical term

90
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,600
for the affliction I speak of.

91
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,320
And do you expect me to believe

92
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,840
that a man so afflicted

93
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,680
actually becomes a wolf

94
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,440
under the influence of the full moon?

95
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,440
No.

96
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,180
The werewolf is neither man nor wolf,

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,880
but a satanic creature

98
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,300
but a satanic creature

99
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,960
with the worst qualities of both.

100
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,180


101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,960
I'm afraid, sir, that I gave up my belief

102
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,600
in goblins, witches,

103
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,660
personal devils,

104
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,620
and werewolves

105
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,100
at the age of six.

106
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,180
But that does not alter the fact

107
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,300
that there are two cases

108
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,760
of werewolfry known to me.

109
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:10,980


110
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,600
And, uh...

111
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,960
And how did these unfortunate gentlemen

112
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,560
contract this, uh,

113
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,540
this medieval unpleasantness?

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,620
From the bite of another werewolf.

115
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,980
These men are doomed,

116
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,120
but for this flower,

117
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,680
the marifasa.

118
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,420
Exactly what do you want of me?

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,020
Two blossoms

120
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,700
of the marifasa flower

121
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,280
in there

122
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,620
will save two souls tonight.

123
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,620
Tonight?

124
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,280
But I thought you said the marifasa

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,940
was a cure.

126
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,760
No. An antidote.

127
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,440
Effective only for a few hours.

128
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,140
But remember this,

129
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,040
Dr. Glendon.

130
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,600
The werewolf

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,540
instinctively seeks

132
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,240
to kill the thing

133
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,480
it loves best.

134
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,980
And, friends,

135
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,080
we are back

136
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,540
from our expedition

137
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,240
to Viseria.

138
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,060
Where we went in search

139
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,200
of the rare habifrop,

140
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,220
zippulops, marifasa, lumina,

141
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,740
lupino.

142
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,600
Which we did not get.

143
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,340
But, uh, we did find some

144
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,020
Bavarius marmosa.

145
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,100
More about that later.

146
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,780
Or maybe next show. I don't know.

147
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
The first half of this show will be

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,980
some recordings from our expedition.

149
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,360
Uh, hey!

150
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,140
I can't find the German drinking songs

151
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,660
CD, Princess Wynne.

152
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,200
Oh, no!

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Yeah, that's from the library.

154
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,420
What shall happen to us if we don't have the German drinking songs?

155
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,020
We got a bunch, we got a bunch.

156
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,880
We can say things like

157
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,100
Guten Morgen.

158
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,940
Guten Abend.

159
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,260
Auf Wiedersehen.

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:02,720
Guten Nacht.

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,560
Guten Nacht.

162
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,220
Guten Nacht.

163
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:10,960
Echt

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,580
Echt

165
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,500
Eifelstein.

166
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,620
Du bist ein Schwein.

167
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,040
Ich hier ein

168
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,700
Eifelstein.

169
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,940
Ich hier ein Prinzess Wynne.

170
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,020
Die haben

171
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,580
die Welt gekampft.

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,480
Präs...

173
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,980
Präs Bob, bitte.

174
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,160
Bitte Präs Bob.

175
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,600
You better praise Bob. That's what that means.

176
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,120
Bitte Präs Bob.

177
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,080
You better praise Bob.

178
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,760
We gotta learn the German

179
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,480
for praise.

180
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,740
What is German for...

181
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,880
No, don't tell me, Dave. You'll get us in trouble.

182
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,540
No, yes, don't tell us, Dave.

183
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,560
Say it again. Say it again.

184
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,880
Huh? Praise Bob.

185
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,620
Um, okay.

186
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,220
In German.

187
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,920
Versen Wobet.

188
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,500
Versen Wobet?

189
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,860
Versen Wobet?

190
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,180
I made that up. I couldn't think of a word for

191
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,760
praise in German that was funny.

192
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,340
Dave made something up.

193
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,320
Well, man, well, wonders never

194
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,800
cease.

195
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:13,820
I can...

196
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,000
shine all day.

197
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,840
Okay, um...

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,200
That sounded really authentically German, Dave.

199
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,320
All I gotta do is just, you know,

200
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,300
get in there and really stupefacken

201
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
and figure out the right...

202
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,200
I know it's a bit...

203
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,540
Okay, well, enough Sturm und Drang.

204
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,700
But you've got the Schledens really well.

205
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,980
Enough Sturm und Drang and enough

206
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,580
Stang und Drummond and

207
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,920
Lonesome.

208
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,980
German has some additional sounds

209
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,040
and letters. In German,

210
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,980
two dots called Umlauts

211
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,880
can be placed over the

212
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,840
vowels. However, the

213
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,760
Umlaut changes the pronunciation.

214
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,880
A Umlaut is

215
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,160
pronounced eh, O Umlaut

216
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,740
is pronounced ö, and

217
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,300
U Umlaut is pronounced ü.

218
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,500
Please practice

219
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,620
saying these German umlauted

220
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:02,960
vowels.

221
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,000
Eh. Eh. Eh.

222
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,440
Eh. Eh. Eh.

223
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,860
Eh. Eh.

224
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,960
Eh. Eh.

225
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,520
Eh. Eh. Eh.

226
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,560
Eh. Eh. Eh.

227
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,360
Eh. Eh. Eh.

228
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:25,840
Eh. Eh.

229
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,500
Eh. Eh. Eh.

230
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:26,500


231
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,740
Eh. Eh. Eh.

232
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,660
Good brochkin.

233
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,060
You don't know anything.

234
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,440
Nussbester span.

235
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,580
Nussbester span.

236
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,640
Grossbind, Grossbellar.

237
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,520
Grossbildbellar.

238
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,960
I'm Belskyn's killer.

239
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:40,940
I'm Belskyn's killer.

240
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:51,560
I'm Belskyn's killer.

241
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,240
Stefan Stank had coffee.

242
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,260
And I had chocolate.

243
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,820
Yeah, we're learning how to use the money

244
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,140
and say please and thank you and stuff like that.

245
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,840
And basically look like dumbasses.

246
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,020
They can instantly tell when they spew out a bunch of words at you

247
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,720
and you stare at them blankly like a dumbass.

248
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,380
They go, oh.

249
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,300
Oh, it's un Americaner.

250
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
Un taub.

251
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,120
Which means deaf.

252
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,440
I'm ready at all times to say,

253
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,640
Ich bin Amerikaner, un taub.

254
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,560
But I haven't had to yet because they can tell.

255
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,620
They just instantly can tell.

256
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,960
Probably by the fact that I'm dressed like a peasant.

257
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,780
As usual.

258
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,320
Although I do have my amino acids shirt on,

259
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,020
so if there's any amino acid fail.

260
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,840
I swear there was.

261
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,760
We were walking by the Thomas Kirch.

262
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,400
And this guy kept shooting.

263
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,820
He looked like a tourist.

264
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,200
He kept giving me the thumbs up.

265
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,360
And I looked behind me to see if he was maybe pointing to somebody else.

266
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,200
I couldn't figure it out.

267
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,840
I remember that.

268
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,440
Yeah.

269
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,880
I thought, maybe he's an old guy.

270
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,900
But still, so am I.

271
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,460
He could be some dude from Detroit.

272
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,560
Or a subgenius fan who's watched lots of amino acid videos that I shot.

273
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,040
You never know.

274
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,460
I've noticed a lot of attention being shown to that amino acid shirt of yours.

275
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,040
Really?

276
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,480
Yes.

277
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,120
People turn around and look at it.

278
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,920
Well, since it's on my back, I don't see it.

279
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,260
Right.

280
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,040
But it has bowling pins being knocked down on it.

281
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,120
Maybe that means something here.

282
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,580
You never can tell what means what.

283
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,680
No.

284
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,580
No.

285
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:05,800
No.

286
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,860
No.

287
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,160


288
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,500
No.

289
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,180
No.

290
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,820
No.

291
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:08,820


292
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:08,820


293
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:08,820


294
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,820
No.

295
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,360
No.

296
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,440


297
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,500
No.

298
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,080
No.

299
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,100
No.

300
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


301
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


302
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


303
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


304
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


305
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


306
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


307
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


308
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


309
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


310
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,100


311
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,840
No.

312
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,520
No.

313
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,540
No.

314
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:18,560


315
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:18,560


316
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,880
No.

317
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,160
No.

318
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,300
No.

319
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,300


320
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,300


321
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,300


322
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,300


323
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,300


324
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,540
No.

325
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,140
I just finished feeling up a naked lady carved in marble.

326
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,560
There are naked ladies carved in marble all over the place, along with the...

327
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:37,820
All over the place.

328
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,820
...horrible baby.

329
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,920
the scary babies and muscle men and lions and stuff.

330
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,920
But most of them you can't reach.

331
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,140
They're up kind of high.

332
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,640
They're on building facades.

333
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,940
So all you can do is take pictures of them.

334
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,700
You can't feel of them.

335
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:04,420
But this big statue we just saw had three babes just a little larger than life,

336
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,440
and you could definitely feel of them.

337
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,900
They chopped off all my hair.

338
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,260
They chopped off all my hair.

339
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,640
They chopped off all my hair.

340
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:25,240
They gave me a bob.

341
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,040
I trust that this look will hopefully get me more squash in the future.

342
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,260
I think you're, like, total genius.

343
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,520
No way, man.

344
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,940
Let me tell you something.

345
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,180
You.

346
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,240
are genius.

347
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,940
Oh yes, dear friends, that collage was by The Large, who is here with us despite this

348
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,300
wind in Leipzig.

349
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,280
Leipzig.

350
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,120
Leipzig.

351
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,900
Praise Bob.

352
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,660
Leipzig.

353
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,560
Leipzig.

354
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,840
You pronounce it all wrong, man.

355
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,940
You pronounce it all wrong, man.

356
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,420
I'm deaf.

357
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,280
You never got it.

358
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,160
No, no, it has nothing to do with it.

359
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,280
You're just plain stupid, man.

360
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,440
That may be true.

361
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,320
We didn't call it the Church of the Genius.

362
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,600
Well, we're here with Reverend Tanya and Reverend Bucky Argyle.

363
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,940
Our hosts here and our guides know the language and the way around.

364
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,960
They know everything worth knowing, and The Large knows everything else.

365
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,780
We're out for a rainy, sunny walk on a rainy, sunny day.

366
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,720
This is one of those primitive cities.

367
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,220
This is one of those cities where the cars aren't allowed.

368
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:15,760
This ancient cemetery we're sitting in is, well, it's older than the ones we walked through

369
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,460
in Cleveland.

370
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,300
Mm-hmm.

371
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:25,740
These guys here that were born in 1790 and died in 1950.

372
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,820
I don't get that.

373
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,260
It must be all the healthy food, the good cheese.

374
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,700
The Large said he only came here for the cheese.

375
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,300
That's all he wanted.

376
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,560
That's the only reason he goes to Holland, not for the pot, for the cheese.

377
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,000
For the cheese.

378
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,400
Yeah.

379
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,940
It's so good.

380
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,320
We've been here, oh, what, less than a week.

381
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,200
Today's Thursday.

382
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,980
Oh, it's my birthday.

383
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,020
Yeah.

384
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:03,240
I turned 161 today, and we're going to go eat at a really fancy restaurant called the

385
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,520
Auerbach Skeller.

386
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,680
Which is our favorite.

387
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
which is our box.

388
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,480
Cellar.

389
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,140
Cellar.

390
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,920
And it's 400 years old.

391
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,180
Although I'm sure they've replaced some of the plates

392
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,680
and silverware and stuff.

393
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,780
Probably.

394
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,860
There's going to be some kind of a subgenius party

395
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,680
later in the week on Saturday night.

396
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,400
We're expecting at least four people besides us.

397
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,360
Bucky and Reverend Tatiana.

398
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,700
Reverend Tatiana is German and Russian.

399
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,220
And she sounds really sexy when she talks German.

400
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,720
She sounds really sexy when she talks in any language.

401
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,960
And Reverend Bucky is from Austin, Texas, pretty much.

402
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,300
So he and I are the dumbasses

403
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:58,600
accompanying royalty as they walk around Germany here.

404
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,840
But now Bucky is from Leipzig.

405
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,880
Yeah, I guess so.

406
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,660
He must have a green card and everything else.

407
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,320
He's trying to be from Leipzig.

408
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,320
Yeah.

409
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,840
This town is about as big as Cleveland.

410
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,380
It's the 12th largest city in Germany,

411
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,740
which I think Cleveland is now about the 12th largest city in the U.S.

412
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,500
And it used to be an industrial center

413
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,020
that was really rich but really polluted,

414
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,180
just like Cleveland.

415
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,220
Then the industry collapsed, just like Cleveland.

416
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,800
Also, unlike Cleveland,

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,680
it was under communist rule.

418
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,680
It was under communist rule for a long time,

419
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,240
and it went to hell.

420
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,020
But around 1989, all that changed,

421
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,580
and it's been dressed up like Cleveland

422
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,200
and fixed up a lot since then.

423
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,680
And it's full of great museums.

424
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,280
We went to the Anthropology Museum inside the Grassy Museum,

425
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,880
which isn't really very grassy at all.

426
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,240
No.

427
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,160
And only made it about halfway through before it closed.

428
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,680
Then we went to the Art Museum and saw a beautiful painting

429
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:04,680


430
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:04,680


431
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,080
by Flemish and Dutch masters and stuff from the 15th and 16th century,

432
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,720
back when people knew how to draw and paint everything except babies.

433
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,880
We must have seen a million baby jesu in paintings yesterday

434
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,160
that were all crappy.

435
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,900
They can paint women and men and tortured Jesuses.

436
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,540
We must have seen 190 tortured Jesuses yesterday.

437
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:32,780
Easily.

438
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,280
But there were that many baby Jesuses,

439
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,620
and they were all deformed.

440
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,940
Every single one of them, just scary looking.

441
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,000
They kind of, a lot of them looked like a bean

442
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,720
with arms and legs attached.

443
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,900
Yeah, really hideous.

444
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,160
And then there were the baby heads flying around

445
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,140
with little wings in some of the paintings.

446
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,520
Oh, the angel bugs.

447
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,200
Yeah.

448
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:50,880
Yeah.

449
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,940
So we have a lot more museums to go see.

450
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,480
It was really impressive.

451
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,540
It was immense.

452
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,120
The ceilings in that place were like three stories high.

453
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,760
Well, that's art museums for you.

454
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,100
They're a big waste of space if you ask me.

455
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,720
And especially the modern art section

456
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,880
with all the splatter crap, Jasper Johns type garbage.

457
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,380
It wasn't garbage.

458
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,660
I liked that stuff.

459
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,120
Garbage.

460
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,120
That stuff, any kid can do that.

461
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,200
But I can't say that I could do a hideously deformed baby

462
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,900
any better than those Dutch masters.

463
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,180
Or a tortured Jesus.

464
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,540
Man, there's a lot of tortured Jesus in there.

465
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:33,840
Mm-hmm.

466
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,680
But this is a pretty Christian town,

467
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,720
considering that they were under communism for a long time.

468
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,540
And the commies dynamited the big church at the university.

469
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,100
It's since been replaced by a much bigger

470
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,480
and more obnoxious church,

471
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,120
as if to say,

472
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,800
screw you, Ruskies.

473
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,080
You know, we could drive to Russia from here.

474
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,720
In fact, we could drive to Beijing from here.

475
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,800
You could drive just about,

476
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,600
I think you could drive to South Africa from here

477
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,680
if you took a ferry at one point.

478
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,300
Oh, it's interesting.

479
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,480
My feet hurt again.

480
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,440
God, my feet hurt.

481
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,240
It's such a walkable city, that's why your feet hurt.

482
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,000
We've been walking and walking and walking.

483
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,080
We didn't have to walk up the,

484
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
how many stairs?

485
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,580
500 stairs?

486
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,060
Yeah, and the new rat house,

487
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,860
which is not where they keep the new rats,

488
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,160
but the, actually the new town hall or city hall.

489
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,060
Where they ratify laws.

490
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,320
There's a high tower that we tried to get into today,

491
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,200
but we were late.

492
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,980
We have to go back at 14 o'clock,

493
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,500
or blow it off.

494
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,840
That's in a little while.

495
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,960
40 minutes, right.

496
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,300
Yeah.

497
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,980
But this cemetery is peaceful.

498
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,380
And incredibly ancient.

499
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,800
You can't really read most of the inscriptions

500
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,060
because they've been worn away.

501
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,180
Except for the really rich guys.

502
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,400
They got marble inscriptions instead of stone or concrete

503
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,860
or whatever they're using here.

504
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,120
Sandstone, it looks like.

505
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,880
Yeah, so whatever erodes the fastest.

506
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,160
Yeah, it's funny to walk around a place that has a building,

507
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,760
like an old hotel that Peter the Great stayed in,

508
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,980
right next to a Woolworths.

509
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,900
Yeah.

510
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,940
And a Burger King across from the Thomas Kerche,

511
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:40,540
where Johann Sebastian Bach played and ran things for 20 years.

512
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,220
He was the cantor.

513
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,120
Yeah, everything's all Bach-y around there.

514
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,400
In fact, to make it really sound like Leipzig,

515
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,080
we'd have to mix in some background street band playing Bach

516
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,000
or Schiller or something.

517
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,480
Or jazz or rock.

518
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,320
Mendelssohn lived here.

519
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,980
Richard Wagner was born here, but he didn't like it.

520
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,940
And he had nothing good to say about his childhood home of Leipzig.

521
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,720
It's similar to New Orleans in that you hear every style of music

522
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,240
as you're walking down the street.

523
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,400
Sometimes classical, but at St. Thomas Kerche, of course, yes.

524
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,340
Well, there's a lot of oompa music here.

525
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,900
Yes.

526
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,980
There's a certain amount of oompa stuff, it being Germany and all.

527
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,120
So, oh well.

528
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,580
I guess that is our testimony for now.

529
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,220
It's only 1320 in the afternoon.

530
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,660
See, I'm starting to get the hang of this foreign time telling.

531
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
Foreign slash military time.

532
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,700
Yeah, next I'll be measuring things in centimeters and kilometers.

533
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,620
And degrees in Celsius.

534
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,460
I haven't mastered that one yet.

535
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,960
Converting euros to dollars in my head has been kind of fun.

536
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,840
A cup of coffee was only about a buck fifty.

537
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,140
And the Bockwurst was about 220, something like that.

538
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,240
This is actually a pretty cheap town if you stay out of the really fancy restaurants.

539
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,740
Which we're going to go to tonight.

540
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,620
Hehehe.

541
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,420
And have lamb.

542
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,240
No, lamb is at the...

543
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,540
Hookah bar that we're going to on Saturday.

544
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,220
The subgenius party.

545
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,100
Yeah.

546
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,720
Okay.

547
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,860
Six to an even, over and out.

548
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,920
Oh, this guy was hilarious.

549
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,720
I'll take your word for it.

550
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,080
This taxi driver was hilarious.

551
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
He smelled everything that you should not do as a taxi driver.

552
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,880
Drive like crazy.

553
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,780
Insult other...

554
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,020
Well, here at least.

555
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,520
Insult other people on the street.

556
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,840
Smell like garlic.

557
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,820
And breathe heavily while driving.

558
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,840
So he was the perfect cab driver.

559
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,300


560
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,420
That's more of what I'm used to.

561
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,200
Driving crazy, breathing heavily, smelling like garlic.

562
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:21,940
Oh, yeah.

563
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,500
Yeah.

564
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,380
That's...

565
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,880
That's...

566
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,260
You know, I have to admit, once you go outside the ring, it looks just like Cleveland.

567
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,680
Yes.

568
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,020
Only with more white people.

569
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,300
Okay.

570
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,760
One, two, three.

571
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,660
Okay, good, good, good.

572
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,200
Hello.

573
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:40,680
Hello.

574
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,780
Hi, how are you?

575
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,500
Good, how are you?

576
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:42,940
Nice to meet you.

577
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,140
Hi, how are you?

578
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,260
Hi.

579
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:45,540
Hello.

580
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,240
Hi.

581
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,840
Please.

582
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,960
Oh, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

583
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
Reverend Rasta.

584
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:53,860
Reverend Rasta.

585
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:53,860


586
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,060
I'm sorry we were so late.

587
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,320
Hello.

588
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,460
Great to see you, man.

589
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,720
Great to see you, too.

590
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,900
You're taller.

591
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,160
No, that's just the shoes.

592
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,700
How are you guys?

593
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,540
We're good.

594
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,340
Younger.

595
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,020
You're younger.

596
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,900
How did that happen?

597
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,820
I found the secret to the universe, actually.

598
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,700
If you have five minutes of your time or something, I could share it.

599
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,180
I don't mind.

600
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,660
Okay.

601
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:16,720
Great.

602
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,280
Yeah.

603
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,420
Let's not forget.

604
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah, let's just not forget.

605
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,500
Yeah.

606
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,860
I've never been in a car.

607
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:23,860


608
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:23,860


609
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:23,860


610
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:23,860


611
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:23,860


612
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:23,860


613
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,660
I've never been in a hookah bar.

614
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,440
Me either.

615
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,580
You guys want to drink anything?

616
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,700
Houses, roses, Moses.

617
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,320
When I was a little boy, they let me smoke in the office while I was working.

618
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,760
I could make politically incorrect jokes and nobody would sue me.

619
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:44,900
Yeah.

620
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,900
Times are hard.

621
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,700
One thing I forgot to mention.

622
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:59,940
Similarities between Leipzig and Cleveland is they're, I think, about the same latitude.

623
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,920
Is that right?

624
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,660
I think so.

625
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,080
It's about as far north.

626
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,380
The weather is almost exactly the same.

627
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:12,380
It was unseasonably cool for once in Cleveland when we left, and it's the same way here.

628
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,480
It's probably about 70 degrees right now.

629
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,100
It's really, really nice.

630
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,800
So we lucked out in that respect.

631
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,940
Very much so.

632
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,300
Yeah.

633
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,760
We lucked out, period.

634
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,420
Yeah.

635
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,460
We just lucked out.

636
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,480
We really did luck out.

637
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,980
Praise Bob.

638
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,100
Praise Bob.

639
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,160
Praise Bucky.

640
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,200
Praise Tanya.

641
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,320
Yeah.

642
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:41,260
Yeah, I told somebody we won a trip to Germany, but I didn't tell them that we won the trip

643
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,420
by being funny on the radio or something.

644
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,160
Being a freak show, anyway.

645
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,100
Yeah.

646
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,180
Yeah.

647
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,460
Yeah.

648
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,080
Yeah.

649
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,540
There, that's the sum total of my German so far.

650
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,280
Ja, Kinder.

651
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,400
Ja, mein Kinder.

652
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,540
Actually, I've been picking up a lot of stuff.

653
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,000
I can order Rotwein or Weisswein.

654
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:05,600
Weisswein.

655
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:06,920
Weisswein.

656
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,360
Und Wienerschnitzel.

657
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,240
We haven't actually done that yet.

658
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,140
Another Skellington.

659
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:20,160
An actual...on this tombstone we're looking at, there's an actual...a skeleton.

660
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,680
Skull head with crossbones, but it's in 3D and the head is turned.

661
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,740
Yeah, and there's a bat over it.

662
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,040
Yeah.

663
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,000
Bat wings instead of angel wings.

664
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,920
That's pretty cool.

665
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,380
And today you saw a poster of Der Frankenstein.

666
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:41,520
Well, I was kind of hoping to see Frankenstein's castle, but I think that's in Switzerland.

667
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,260
Also, I think it's entirely fictitious.

668
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,320
Oh.

669
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,040
Oh.

670
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,560
Oh.

671
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:47,940
Oh.

672
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:59,220
And here's Peter, work again ...

673
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,960
Pink tranquility.

674
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,400
Black帽 sia, pink Betsy bails.

675
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,780
Some of these black Louisa shoes.

676
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,840
продолжается

677
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,480
MoreSUCCESSES

678
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:17,920
Now I think I'll just take one and let it rock through here.

679
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:17,920


680
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,080
built to look like they were 400 years old. Yes. There's a certain amount of

681
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,340
cheating done in these towns. For a fact. Plus, you know, in any given German city, about

682
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,680
half of the buildings got reduced to rubble during the war. So they rebuilt

683
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:41,280
them. Sometimes real modern, super modern. Sometimes they try to duplicate what had

684
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:50,480
been destroyed. So it looks old, but it's fake old. It's still kind of old. Older

685
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,180
than me, that's old. I'm a year older now than I was yesterday.

686
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,780
Here are real German, Austrian and Swiss cities which use umlauted vowels.

687
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,540
Practice saying the name of these cities.

688
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,880
Shevavish Hall.

689
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,400
I've never heard of that one. Shevavish Hall.

690
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,020
Shevavish Hall.

691
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,360
Shevavish Hall.

692
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,200
Shevavish Hall.

693
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,320
Shevavish Hall.

694
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:28,980
Shevavish Hall.

695
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,480
Shevavish Hall.

696
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,400
Shevavish Hall.

697
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,980
Shevavish Hall.

698
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,440
Okay.

699
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,260
Princess, we were live just in case you were confused by what was going on.

700
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,760
What was tape and what was us.

701
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,760
Me? Confused?

702
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,020
Well.

703
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:53,680
That's preposterous. And besides, we're being called to the great mass. Can't you

704
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,240
hear the bells?

705
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,400
Is that what that is?

706
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:55,760
Yes.

707
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,940
The great mass?

708
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,460
Yes.

709
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,460
A mass of what?

710
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,080
A mass.

711
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,060
Yeah.

712
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,700
It's a thing that happens in a cathedral, dear.

713
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,320
Oh, I thought that was what Dave makes when he comes over for dinner. A big mass.

714
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,280
No. No.

715
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,360
It's different from that.

716
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,820
These are the bells outside of our lodgings, right?

717
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,600
Yes.

718
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,840
At Tonya and Bucky's place?

719
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:39,300
Yes. One Sunday morning as they were going on and on and on, I picked up your recorder and I held it out the window for a moment. Actually, this was through the window. There's one moment during it where the volume increases. That's when I opened the window.

720
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,860
I opened the window for just a moment and the volume pops.

721
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, they had a great apartment.

722
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,500
Oh, amazing.

723
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,820
We didn't know what we were going, what we were going to be in for. And it all paid off. It was just great.

724
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,080
Oh, fabulous.

725
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:07,000
They're right in the middle of the coolest part of town. And their apartment is like, if you ever saw that movie Hostel, that's the way it is. And they have a Venus fly trap.

726
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,220
Yes. And I caught a flying feather.

727
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:16,040
I read it one day. And then I got to watch each day as the plant absorbed more and more of the fly.

728
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:34,100
Like, that's what Bob will do with us all someday. Just absorb us. And it's true that Reverend Bucky and Reverend Tatiana listen to WCSB, not really all day, but a lot.

729
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,720
Practically 24-7, 365.

730
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,700
They're listening right now.

731
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,860
Their machine is connected.

732
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,000
They're using VLC player to stream.

733
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,600
I can tell because it's, see, we can look at, we see you guys from here. See?

734
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,040
We can see you.

735
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:58,240
Our special WCSB live stream status is a two-way thing. As you can see, I didn't shave for this.

736
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:09,120
But it wasn't bell music from the 5,000-year-old bell and all the, God, they must have a great hunchback's union in that town.

737
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,820
To keep those bells ringing all the time.

738
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,600
But at times you could hear three different bands out of their window.

739
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,900
Playing three different kinds of music.

740
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,460
Hey, look, I see, speaking of music, let's see if this is Dave.

741
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:24,960
Hello?

742
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,580
Hello?

743
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,440
It is.

744
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,020
Hello?

745
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,700
It's Buf and Fomfenstein.

746
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,300
Was ist das?

747
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,840
Buf and Fomfenstein just called in.

748
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,240
Ah.

749
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,100
I see.

750
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


751
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


752
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


753
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


754
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


755
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


756
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


757
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


758
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


759
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


760
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


761
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


762
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


763
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


764
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


765
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


766
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,680
Not.

767
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,660
You refer to this as poppycock?

768
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,540
Which is a strange word.

769
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,760
Ja, ja. Ja.

770
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,760
How about a little jam session on the nose?

771
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,700
I was just kidding.

772
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,280
I wondered if you, since you returned, if your welt bekommt?

773
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:05,520
We can't, I can't understand you very well, but yeah, whatever you ask, the answer is probably yes.

774
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,620
Hey, uh.

775
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,460
I was wondering if I could call you back since I can hardly hear you right now.

776
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,140
Really?

777
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,760
Yes, well now I can hear you.

778
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,300
That's strange.

779
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,900
Well, yeah, just shove your ear closer to that little device.

780
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,220
Was it the church?

781
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,580
That's what all the listeners are doing.

782
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,120
Was it the church bells that were drowning us out?

783
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,700
No, I will have to call you back.

784
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,440
Oh.

785
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,080
Because you guys just, what you sounded like to me was, I don't know.

786
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,140
I think he's trying to tell us what we sound like.

787
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,560
Oh.

788
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,900
Can I give it a try?

789
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,860
Sure, Dave.

790
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,100
Shooter, call us back.

791
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,340
Try it again.

792
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:51,340


793
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,220
I'll try.

794
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,160
I'll try the other line now too, perhaps.

795
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:05,880
I'll listen to that beautiful background music in, uh, from, uh, our trip.

796
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,760
At one point, Princess, we heard a stink.

797
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,060
A string quartet doing the Lord of the Rings theme music.

798
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,240
And a few minutes later, uh, it was a clarinet player jamming with a didge player.

799
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,320
Yes, he was doing jazz riffs off of Happy Birthday to You.

800
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,760
Oh, that might pop up in this background music at some point.

801
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,100
This was a concert.

802
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,580
This was a concert right next to us, right, right in front of the big statue of Bach.

803
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,160
Bach.

804
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:44,340
I like the better, I like the statue of my hero, Gottfried Leibniz, uh, who's the Dr.

805
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,440
Howell of Germany.

806
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,180
And also, I like the stack of ancient cannonballs, because I like balls.

807
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,800
Oh, speaking of balls, let's see if Dave is back again.

808
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,220
Is it better?

809
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,660
It's fine with me.

810
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,760
Sounds good to us.

811
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,780
You guys are like way, way padded down on both phones.

812
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,800
I use the insignificant phone that the foreigners gave me.

813
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,300
Back when they first, you know, back in the first baptism, when you almost drowned.

814
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:17,500
I mean, back in the first, uh, when you almost drowned in the, remember?

815
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:25,280
You're gonna have to just turn the sound on your phone up, because we can't turn the sound of the radio station up any louder.

816
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,000
It's as loud as it's ever gonna get.

817
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,440
I know, maybe I'm just going deaf in the ear that's not responsible.

818
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,300
That's right, you're gonna have to pay that ear more.

819
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,780
Hey, uh, you know those cards?

820
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:36,780


821
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,780
The collages that we play on this show sometimes that are by The Large?

822
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:49,240
Well, The Large and his girlfriend Suvi came to visit us in Leipzig, and we met The Large.

823
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,660
And he is, in fact, tall.

824
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,140
I expected him to be fat, but he's not.

825
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,940
He's kind of skinny.

826
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,440
He's not fat.

827
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,480
He's large, and he's very, very weird.

828
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:04,620
Like all, I've heard that all Finns from Finland were weird.

829
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,200
But, uh...

830
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,480
They are weird.

831
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:16,880
This, The Large, we ended up renaming him for our own purposes, Reverend Lonesome Angry Cowboy Larry Talbot.

832
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,720
And Suvi is Reverend Suvi the Fluvi.

833
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,040
Because The Large, they speak really good English, with kind of a Finnish accent.

834
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,260
Got a nice Finnish on it.

835
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:31,940
But...

836
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,620
I can understand that, I heard that many times before.

837
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,480
He can...

838
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,080
Throughout my childhood.

839
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:44,840
This guy can do Finnish versions of dozens or hundreds of American and British accents.

840
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,780
And he even imitates you, Dave.

841
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:48,880
He does.

842
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,460
Yeah, he even, and he quotes you.

843
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,880
Hippahei.

844
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,980
No, that's...

845
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,620
The Finns used to always say hippahei.

846
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,400
Oh, really?

847
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,080
And they called my mother, their name for mother is Aitik.

848
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,260
How do you know these things?

849
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:08,740
Because there's a large fin population, the Sumalainen, sons of the Suomi.

850
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,960
Do they really...

851
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,380
In this town here.

852
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,900
Do they really have fins?

853
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,180
Yes, they used to have like ten sauna baths.

854
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:17,860
Wow.

855
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,340
You know, regular normal ones.

856
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,440
Yeah.

857
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,920
With normal signs and normal people hanging over the top.

858
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,360
Oh, I don't know about those kind of things, Dave.

859
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,280
Well, you're not required to anymore, that's why.

860
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,040
I don't know nothing about this normal.

861
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,540
Helsinki masker, or whatever you call them.

862
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,140
The large.

863
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,260
Yeah.

864
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,740
He's large.

865
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,320
Yeah, he can imitate you imitating other European accents.

866
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,140
And it's amazing, he actually pulls it all off.

867
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,140
It's just befuddling, but he does.

868
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:58,340
Well, the next time you see him, say mita kulu, or mita kulu, or mita kulu.

869
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,160
One of those three words.

870
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,260
Yeah.

871
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,920
Mitakulu.

872
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,380
He's probably listening now.

873
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,660
Mita, hey, mita.

874
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,080
Palio, mita.

875
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,360
Gitos, palios.

876
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,280
I have no idea what...

877
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,120
This is the clarinet and the didge.

878
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:15,020
...that's the stuff they say when they shake hands and argue with each other, you know,

879
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,400
when they...

880
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,460
You know what I mean?

881
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,440
Like the ordinal numbers.

882
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,380
The cardinal letters.

883
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,420
But...

884
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,840
We're listening to the didge and clarinet jam.

885
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,700
Of the large?

886
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,260
Of the large.

887
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


888
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


889
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


890
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


891
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


892
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


893
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


894
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


895
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


896
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


897
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


898
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


899
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,260


900
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,680
No, it was of just some street musicians that...

901
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,800
This town is...

902
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:43,800
They don't have cars in the touristy old town, but they do allow musicians everywhere.

903
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,780
And as we walked through, every time I heard one, I turned my recorder on.

904
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,500
Yeah.

905
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,380
Well, do they have the...

906
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,320
And then she didn't pay him.

907
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,140
...what they call the bald poopy knees?

908
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,820
And I didn't pay.

909
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,260
You know, like when you take...

910
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,240
When you wear a scruffed up blue jeans and you make sure that the knee comes out.

911
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,240


912
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,240


913
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,920
And your knee looks like a bald poopy.

914
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,860
Well, there was a lot of people sitting around waiting for you to give them money because

915
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,900
they had a dog and punk hairdo.

916
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,880
It's like...

917
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,480
Dog buskers make good dough.

918
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,680
I guess so.

919
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,140
There were a lot of them there.

920
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,120
There were...

921
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,280
You know, I sure noticed a lot of white people in that town, but they were some exceedingly

922
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,980
weird looking ones.

923
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,500
You know, they're like purebred...

924
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,220
And I think that you understand that they're...

925
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,220


926
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,260
I think that's the reason we done fought World War II in our American history.

927
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,600
Oh, man.

928
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,540
I got some great...

929
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,940
Some people gave us some great advice before we went.

930
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,600
Still one time.

931
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:47,100
Our friend, Reverend Pease, said that when you go to Germany, grab your crotch a lot

932
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,420
when you talk to the Germans.

933
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,480
It's how you make them respect you.

934
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,640
Now, is this true?

935
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,160
No.

936
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,680
I think that's baloney.

937
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,220
He also said, buy some leather shorts and one of those hats with the boars' hats.

938
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,920
The boars' hair thingy at the airport you'll want to blend.

939
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,660
And lederhosen.

940
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,840
You forgot the most important part of it.

941
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,400
I'm making sure you're wearing nice stockings.

942
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:11,980
Lederhosen.

943
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,880
I actually saw a lot of lederhosen in the stores, but it's very expensive.

944
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,800
Very expensive.

945
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,260
Very fancy, Doug.

946
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,880
And beautiful dresses for women that are traditional as well.

947
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,140
And they're also expensive.

948
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,880
What the hell's a drudgeon, Wayne?

949
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,260
Pardon?

950
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:28,680
No.

951
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,140
You said drudgens for women who are over 100 years old, like a corset or something?

952
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,860
Drudgens?

953
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,160
No, dresses.

954
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,280
We're all so deaf that we're just pretending to know.

955
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,620
We're all taub.

956
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,880
We're taubed out, and we're just pretending to know what each other are saying.

957
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:53,240
So you were faking German over there, and you're actually, was ist der time, meine Freund?

958
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,780
Ist es das Vier o'clock?

959
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,540
Well, you may have missed the earlier parts of the show.

960
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,720
Yeah, we kind of did.

961
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,540
Yeah, we did.

962
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,420
Especially in Prinzess.

963
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,780
We get drinks, the Weisswein, she starts speaking.

964
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,900
But you don't sound Weltbekomft.

965
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,180
Do you know what Weltbekomft means in Deutscher?

966
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,540
I don't know what Weltbekomft means.

967
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,420
You do?

968
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,180
I don't.

969
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,720
Oh.

970
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,520
It means world-weariness, or just when the world, like, makes you go, oh, man.

971
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:25,760
Oh, man.

972
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,280
I wish there was a slightly better world.

973
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,200
Which we know that is the hypothesis behind your frontal lobotomy.

974
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,000
Well, yeah, but it didn't work.

975
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,700
Not like it's cracked up to be.

976
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,680
Well, they're not supposed to work.

977
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,360
You're talking about the trepanning, right?

978
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:50,560
Not the frontal, it's not exactly a lobotomy, but it was a trepanation that went wrong.

979
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,060
Trepanation gone bad.

980
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,300
I always go wrong.

981
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,900
I reiterate.

982
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,620
You would.

983
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,420
It's never gone right one time past a six-month trial period.

984
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,440
And you know that deep within your heart of hearts.

985
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,740
Here's some more advice we were given by Reverend Pease.

986
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,560
He said, use the exit for all the attractions.

987
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,820
Oh, by the way, Ausfahrt means exit.

988
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,040
It is not the largest town in Germany.

989
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,840
No, not just the road.

990
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,880
But he said, use the exit for all the attractions.

991
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,180
And when confronted, say, I'm an American and all this stuff should be ours.

992
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,740
It lets them know you're a man to be reckoned with.

993
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,080
But with your blending in clothes from the airport, your confronter would most likely have thought you a German.

994
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:46,180
Once corrected in this manner, the said German will cheerfully give way and allow you to continue on your way.

995
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,620
I believe that's in their constitution, he said.

996
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,860
But they can't seize your land and property and put you in a camp.

997
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,620
At the moment's notice.

998
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,220
Well, that's in their...

999
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,600
You forgot.

1000
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,760
They ran the communists out.

1001
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,780
It's not in East Germany anymore.

1002
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,520
It's unified Germany now.

1003
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,860
I screamed.

1004
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,940
Oh, and it said...

1005
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:18,320
I was told, do not, under any circumstances, say anything about Nazis ever.

1006
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,640
Because some are still hiding out and they can be cantankerous when exposed.

1007
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,380
Or...

1008
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,220
I've said too much already.

1009
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,140
That's what my friends...

1010
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,460
It's a national sore spot.

1011
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,540
Just like the front of your head after the trepanation.

1012
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,820
It's something that is there.

1013
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,280
It won't go away.

1014
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,520
It's painful.

1015
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,800
But nobody...

1016
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,120
Everyone refuses to acknowledge it.

1017
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,440
My brain, you mean?

1018
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,360
No.

1019
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,160
The past, man.

1020
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,200
No, comrade.

1021
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:47,820
My friend.

1022
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,800
The past.

1023
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,420
Ja, comrade.

1024
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,380
But you're talking about that.

1025
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,100
No, see?

1026
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,800
They don't like stuff like that.

1027
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,100
When you make the little big hi-ho salute and...

1028
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,240
Oh, no, no.

1029
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,520
Pretend like you got a funny mustache.

1030
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,400
They think you're mocking them or making fun of them.

1031
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,740
Well, some...

1032
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,120
You know what?

1033
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,980
They actually do say Gesundheit.

1034
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,240
Yes, they do.

1035
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,000
And they're not kidding.

1036
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,940
Yeah, but we still invented it just like cheese and rich crackers.

1037
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,420
Like tacos and pizza.

1038
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,120
They don't really do that over there.

1039
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,880
Fishmongering.

1040
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,380
Mongering.

1041
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,720
Now, I was told...

1042
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,680
Now, here's something weird.

1043
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,860
Over there, Bud Light is a fancy import brand.

1044
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,300
But, as my friend said, as Reverend Peace advised us, beer is free.

1045
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,780
But in order to promote national health, it is customary to run from where you got your

1046
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,540
beer while the server chases you for a few blocks.

1047
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,300
This keeps everyone in shape and is great fun.

1048
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,100
I'm so sorry.

1049
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1050
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1051
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1052
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1053
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1054
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1055
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1056
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1057
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1058
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1059
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1060
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1061
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1062
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1063
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1064
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1065
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,100


1066
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,100


1067
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,160
Somehow I just don't trust Reverend P's advice.

1068
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,120
Oh, I don't know. He said German food is heavy.

1069
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:06,920
I would eat once on arrival and then weekly until you return to a more civilized part of the world.

1070
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,120
I have never seen a more civilized part of the world.

1071
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,840
Everything in Germany is engineered smarter.

1072
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,720
We all know that German cars are...

1073
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,200
Even the simple things like cups, they're incredibly over-engineered.

1074
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,080
I'm talking about things like washers and dryers where there's no dryer vent,

1075
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,420
but the water is collected in a little vessel inside the machine.

1076
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,180
I'm talking about typer clips.

1077
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,380
The Volkswagen factories have only two guys in them.

1078
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,580
They turn out thousands every day, some huge number.

1079
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,240
They're hardworking.

1080
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,240
They're electric and stuff.

1081
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,920
And all this stuff's transparent.

1082
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,400
I mean, not only as far as their mission and all that commerce stuff,

1083
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,280
but also you can see all the way everywhere.

1084
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,180
It's like wide open.

1085
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,480
It's wide open and stuff, and machines do most of the work.

1086
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:59,060
I just don't see how you can say that it's not civilized.

1087
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,240
You have toilets that have special engineering,

1088
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,680
so you push one button for the little load and another button for the big load.

1089
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,940
That's the toilet you're talking about, right?

1090
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,840
That's the toilet I'm talking about, yes.

1091
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,800
It's the bidet, actually. It's the aggressive bidet.

1092
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,460
What about a really big load?

1093
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,520
Then you have to use the washer and dryer, right?

1094
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
No.

1095
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,700
No, you use the high-tech paper clips.

1096
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,900
Everything there is super well built.

1097
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:36,060
Everything from the coffee machine to the refrigerator to everything that I saw.

1098
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,460
Door handles, keys.

1099
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:44,040
Now, Princess, we didn't see all of Germany.

1100
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,440
We were just in Leipzig, which was voted the best city to live in.

1101
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,860
In Germany.

1102
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,820
Yes, I know.

1103
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,740
We did spend...

1104
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,780
How was the food, by the way, since I missed that part?

1105
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,020
Was it delightful?

1106
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,620
I mean, I know it's not good in Sauerbraten, but...

1107
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,640
Well, I'll tell you what.

1108
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:11,960
We had a meal at this 500-year-old restaurant that is so old

1109
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,260
that it's featured in the beginning of the novel Faust,

1110
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,220
or the play, I mean, Faust.

1111
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:18,500
Faust.

1112
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:18,500


1113
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:18,500


1114
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:18,500


1115
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:18,500


1116
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,020
The first scene of Faust takes place in this.

1117
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,180
Yeah, in the Auerbach Stella.

1118
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,820
Now, the cool thing about this restaurant is,

1119
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,760
because it's featured in a story about the devil,

1120
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,400
it has fabulous artwork by all kinds of people of times and places of the devil.

1121
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,540
And that helped to soothe our feelings

1122
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,600
after being exposed to millions of pictures of Jesus being tortured,

1123
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,300
or the hideous baby Jesus.

1124
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,260
Because the devil...

1125
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,040
He looked pretty good most of the time.

1126
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,380
He's talking not just...

1127
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,560
He's talking not just...

1128
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:54,720
Yeah.

1129
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,080
Not just about artwork.

1130
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,940
He's talking about enormous murals that are painted all around the room.

1131
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,040
Actually, there's giant murals painted all over the place.

1132
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,660
But there's like...

1133
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,600
The Marriott is covered with full-color cartoon people.

1134
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:10,500
Yes.

1135
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,700
I mean, a giant building covered with thousands of cartoon people.

1136
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,960
Like 20 stories high in brilliant colors.

1137
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,220
And there's some graffiti artist named Snow

1138
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,200
who managed to sign whole dilapidated buildings.

1139
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:25,980
Yes.

1140
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,800
Way up high.

1141
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,280
Yeah.

1142
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,440
Wow.

1143
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,040
What a piker.

1144
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,460
What a fishmonger.

1145
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,800
Did you go to see...

1146
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,060
Hey, do you like German Expressionism?

1147
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,660
Did you go see any artworks?

1148
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,040
Those cats, I think, were pretty hip.

1149
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,600
I really do.

1150
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,240
The German...

1151
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,180
And they...

1152
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,280
Did you know that they influenced Wachli Kandinsky?

1153
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:47,620
Yeah.

1154
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,160
Yeah.

1155
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,240
Yeah.

1156
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,240


1157
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,240


1158
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,240


1159
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,240


1160
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,240


1161
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,240


1162
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,180
And others?

1163
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,720
I believe you.

1164
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,060
Yeah.

1165
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,720
If Dave said it, then you better pick up on it.

1166
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,460
We did go see the art museum, and I really enjoyed it.

1167
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,820
Reverend Stang didn't like the modern part.

1168
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,240
No.

1169
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,140
He liked the rest of it.

1170
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:03,780
No.

1171
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,320
I like the stuff, the landscapes and things that look like things.

1172
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,520
And people that look like people.

1173
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,180
Unless they're tortured Jesus.

1174
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:11,200
Oh, yeah.

1175
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,880
Der Fuhrer's kind of art.

1176
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,320
Not German Expressionism.

1177
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,960
No, he goes for Der Fuhrer's type of art.

1178
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:16,740
Yes.

1179
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,060
It's a very nice-looking...

1180
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,520
It's a very nice-looking building.

1181
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,220
And...

1182
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,040
Yeah.

1183
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:21,860
Right.

1184
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,120
Yeah, I like that.

1185
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,000
In fact, if I ever got a time machine, I'd go back in time and buy Hitler's art.

1186
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,260
But then if he had a customer, he wouldn't have become a Nazi.

1187
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:33,780
That's true.

1188
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,160
It's self-defeating.

1189
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,560
It's that time travel paradox.

1190
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,620
I've discussed this before, I think.

1191
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,780
Yes, you have.

1192
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,720
The Harold and Maude and Kumar meet Hitler.

1193
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,660
But then when they get back to their time,

1194
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,620
his artwork doesn't sell because there never was a World War II

1195
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,660
because somebody bought his artwork, finally.

1196
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:59,220
Now, just think if somebody bought even one piece of Van Gogh's art,

1197
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,960
he would have quit...

1198
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,120
Wait a minute.

1199
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,720
I don't know why.

1200
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,960
His stuff wouldn't be worth anything now.

1201
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,620
If it had sold back then...

1202
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,800
If Van Gogh weren't become a dictator and his lopped-off ear

1203
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,860
would have been kind of like his monogrammed little mustache and stuff,

1204
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,460
and rather than going in these big ranching diatribes,

1205
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:17,640
and saying, you know, I'm going to sell this stuff,

1206
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,240
stuff like that, he would just go up to the podium

1207
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,280
and he would just glare at the audience for a while

1208
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:22,940
and then go...

1209
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,580
And then take his pants and run away.

1210
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,000
It's not how they do it nowadays.

1211
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,620
That's how they do it nowadays.

1212
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,440
That's how...

1213
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,220
Sorry.

1214
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:44,280
Oh, one big difference between Saxony and Thuringia

1215
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,960
and Ohio and Texas,

1216
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,060
is that between the cities,

1217
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,300
it's just farmland,

1218
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,920
but there's no billboards.

1219
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,860
None at all.

1220
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,960
There's no ads.

1221
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:57,860
It's like...

1222
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,480
How can you call that country civilized

1223
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,540
if they don't have commercials everywhere?

1224
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,640
It's like being in an endless park.

1225
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,140
I know, Dave.

1226
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,400
You're just being resentful because of that time they...

1227
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,500
That Hogan's Heroes episode that confused you so much.

1228
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,560
Yeah, but just think how much they get paid.

1229
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,040
You know, they get all the vacations all the time.

1230
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,940
They still have producers.

1231
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,260
And with less solar energy,

1232
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,340
I mean, with less solar stuff,

1233
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,440
they're going mostly solar energy now

1234
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,340
and stuff like that

1235
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,740
and kicking butt at it and everything.

1236
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,880
There are solar panels on many buildings here.

1237
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,540
Even most of Europe that we think of as poor

1238
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,760
is a lot better than that.

1239
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,740
I mean, it's a lot better than us.

1240
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,100
Why didn't you move to Russia then?

1241
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,080
If you don't like it here, huh?

1242
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,680
Why didn't you move to...

1243
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,620
Why didn't you move to...

1244
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,200
Deutschland, there, Schicklgruber.

1245
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:51,620
Yeah.

1246
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,140
Yeah?

1247
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,640
Yeah, Schicklgruber.

1248
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,320
That's what I...

1249
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,620
Whatever that...

1250
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,000
I shouldn't say things like that

1251
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,720
because I don't know what it means.

1252
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,060
You don't know what it means.

1253
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:00,900
You could be...

1254
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,120
All I know is...

1255
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,460
We're in very big trouble.

1256
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:07,420
The president of the USA is named Schicklgruber.

1257
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,940
That's an old fire sign.

1258
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,660
Obama's secret name is Schicklgruber?

1259
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:11,900
No.

1260
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,640
It's not Quasimodo?

1261
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,420
No, that's no.

1262
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,300
Obama's secret name is Obabo.

1263
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:16,760
Obabo.

1264
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,420
Yeah.

1265
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,400
Obabo.

1266
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,420
He's the preseserp of Uninu.

1267
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,560
Well, that should be a boon to the church of the subgenius, I would say,

1268
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,700
if the president is named Obabo.

1269
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,900
Well, it's not...

1270
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,140
It's spelled O-B-A-B-O.

1271
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,960
Like a liquid soap in the 1960s?

1272
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,600
So you gotta kind of stretch it to get the Bob...

1273
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,060
Yeah.

1274
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah.

1275
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,040
What, uh...

1276
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:42,920
Makes me...

1277
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,520
Yeah.

1278
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,040
I don't know.

1279
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,240
It makes me tingle inside.

1280
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,080
Obabo.

1281
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,080
Makes me feel patriotic.

1282
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,200
What's the matter?

1283
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,380
You don't like Obabo?

1284
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,820
Are you racist?

1285
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,240
Are you anti-presidential?

1286
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,720
Do you have duck-webbed feet?

1287
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,920
I have duck-webbed feet.

1288
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,800
And fins, because I am a Finlander.

1289
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,900
Yeah, the feet already have the skis on them.

1290
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,920
So when you go to sauna, that way you can go right through the snow, see?

1291
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,700
That's where mermaids come from.

1292
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,700
Finland.

1293
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,500
How do you know?

1294
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,580
Because I looked.

1295
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,160
Yes, you know why they call him the large now, huh?

1296
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,420
Yes.

1297
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,300
You saw him wear his fins.

1298
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,840
You saw where the fins are.

1299
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,380
No.

1300
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,920
Lined up along that thing.

1301
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,800
As Reverend Tanya so brilliantly said,

1302
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,060
the large, when he said,

1303
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,240
you ladies, you know what the large refers to.

1304
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,520
And it took her two beats to say,

1305
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,420
you must be referring to your nose, right?

1306
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:55,900
Yeah.

1307
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:02,260
So is there a human body or an erectile like the dysfunctional comments I just made?

1308
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:07,900
Yeah, actually, the large is a foul-mouthed fin.

1309
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:13,480
But if my reading of thriller novels is right,

1310
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,300
they're all foul-mouthed like Australians.

1311
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:17,900
Yeah.

1312
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,900
Yeah, I know how Australians are.

1313
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,240
They're large and they like to cause bar fights.

1314
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,280
And Mexicans also like to cuss.

1315
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,680
No, they like to cuss.

1316
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,700
Not like you or me.

1317
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,200
No, no, no.

1318
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:33,980
Or on the radio.

1319
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:34,900
No, no, no.

1320
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1321
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,720
Dr. Sinister has entered the room.

1322
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,780
Yeah, I have.

1323
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:43,780


1324
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:43,780


1325
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:43,780


1326
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:43,780


1327
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:43,780


1328
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1329
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,460
Yeah, I've been here.

1330
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,420
I hope he's wearing, I hope he's dressed like the guru,

1331
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:52,340
the guru Swami Deva with the weird, you know,

1332
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,480
yellow toga thing going down there and sandals and everything.

1333
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,800
And he's like making some kind of sign.

1334
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,880
I live in Cleveland Heights.

1335
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,320
Heights.

1336
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,640
I'm a Heizer.

1337
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,320
Did you know when that really means?

1338
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,940
I'm really a, I am a beer belly.

1339
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,280
Yeah.

1340
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:27,320
You always, you know, you think you're ordering Wiener Schnitzel all the time and you've actually

1341
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,860
been asking for anal sex.

1342
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:39,660
You know, I think about, I think about what would have happened if, if World War I and

1343
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,300
World War II had gone a little bit differently, then Vienna could have been.

1344
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,920
The capital that ended up getting divided after a war.

1345
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,160
And if JFK had gone to Vienna instead of Berlin, he would have said Ich bin ein Wiener.

1346
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:50,860
Wiener.

1347
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,660
Well, that really happened.

1348
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,260
Did you know that?

1349
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,780
Wiener.

1350
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,480
When he said Ich bin ein Berliner, he meant he should have said Ich bin Berliner rather

1351
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,680
than Ich bin ein Berliner, because that means I am a Berlin sandwich.

1352
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:11,180
And that's where the joke from the hot dog got going and inspired you to create that

1353
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:11,800
Wiener joke.

1354
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,120
Okay.

1355
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,120


1356
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,600
Okay.

1357
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,640
Okay.

1358
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:18,640
You told me that where is the restroom is said, wo ist der Schlafzimmer?

1359
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,300
Schlafzimmer is bedroom.

1360
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,340
Uh-huh.

1361
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,160
I was afraid that I was being set up.

1362
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,620
You know, where is the.

1363
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:27,340
Scheißhaus.

1364
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,660
The bordello or yeah, where is the der Scheißhaus?

1365
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,860
Du musst nicht im Schlafzimmer scheißen.

1366
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,140
Das ist nicht gut.

1367
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:37,880
Schlafzimmer scheißen.

1368
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,180
Was du isst.

1369
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,840
Du musst nicht im Schlafzimmer scheißen.

1370
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,680
Ich bin ein Berliner.

1371
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:45,680


1372
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:45,680


1373
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:45,680


1374
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:45,680


1375
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:45,680


1376
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,860
I'm told not to do foreign language stuff on the radio when I don't know what it's

1377
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:49,940
being said.

1378
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:49,960
No.

1379
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,280
Not when you don't know what it means.

1380
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,680
Especially when subgeniuses tell you to say it to someone.

1381
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,400
Well, that's why you have your, the original subgenius cunning linguist right here who can

1382
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,600
translate these things for you.

1383
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,660
Don't forget the power of Google, by the way.

1384
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,480
Well put.

1385
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:13,340
Oh, I had the bright idea of Google Glass with, set up with a translator program.

1386
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:13,620
I was just thinking, I'm just going to go through the whole thing.

1387
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:13,620


1388
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:13,620


1389
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,520
Like a speech, a speech to text, like it's, and then a translator so that you could actually

1390
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,260
have subtitles.

1391
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:19,760
Yeah.

1392
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:24,300
Now I could use that for English personally, but yeah.

1393
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,140
I keep the, uh, the closed captions on my TV.

1394
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,120
Uh, you know, I, I don't want to, you know, everything, the speech is so quiet and the

1395
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,000
music and the sound effects are so loud and I don't want to wake up the neighbors.

1396
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,300
So I always keep the closed caption.

1397
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,260
You don't want them to see the closed captions either because that would cause like a total

1398
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,420
panic on the West side or wherever you are.

1399
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,260
Right now, people would just like, it would freak out, man.

1400
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,680
It would be dangerous.

1401
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,500
We're on the air side right now.

1402
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,060
Yes.

1403
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,880
And we're approaching the end.

1404
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,080
We air on the side of caution.

1405
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:56,660
Yeah.

1406
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,360
We're airing out now.

1407
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,740
We're going to air out.

1408
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:05,140
We've got about one minute left and this is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

1409
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,320
number 1,482 this time.

1410
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,220
And most of those weren't reruns either.

1411
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:12,660
Yeah.

1412
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:21,160
And if anybody needs the information that they need, it's at subgenius.com and I could

1413
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,380
calmly put us back on the recordings.

1414
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,300
I think I will.

1415
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,660
So Dave, Dave,

1416
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:35,380
Well, I'm going to miss you guys because I want to, after I get done going to the bathroom,

1417
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,940
I'm moving to Germany.

1418
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,480
By the way, my phone doesn't work at home.

1419
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,040
So, well, that's just too bad.

1420
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
Well, Dave's gone.

1421
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,760
Auf Wiedersehen, Dave.

1422
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:47,820
Auf Wiederhören.

1423
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:54,680
Well, we're going to go see the Stasi Museum, I hope, because I need to have lots of helpful

1424
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,960
hints for how to survive when the Tea Party takes over the USA.

1425
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,780
Why are you mocking President Obama?

1426
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,580
You're, don't you like your country?

1427
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,700
Don't you like freedom?

1428
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,500
Why do you hate freedom?

1429
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,380
Why do you hate freedom?

1430
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:12,460
Why do you hate freedom?

1431
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,240
You don't like Obama?

1432
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,460
What's wrong with him?

1433
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,580
Praise Obabo, the prez of Serb.

1434
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,260
That's the one we worship.

1435
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,940
Obabo, the prez of Serb.

1436
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,380
He's an AI that exists on the internet.

1437
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,220
He's not a Kenyan communist.

1438
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,020
He's not from Kenya.

1439
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:30,880
He's not a communist.

1440
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:31,840
He's not a socialist.

1441
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:32,680
He's from Nigeria.

1442
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:33,400
He's a scammer.

1443
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,740
He doesn't have funny big ears like Jerk W. Bush had.

1444
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,380
Right, no, Obabo is from Nigeria.

1445
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,320
He does email scams.

1446
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,980
And he has a birth certificate from Nigeria.

1447
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,360
The paving in these towns makes me feel like I'm tripping.

1448
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:52,820
Cobblestones.

1449
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,980
I was going to say it looks trippy.

1450
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,780
Yeah.

1451
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:56,380
Because it looks.

1452
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,280
It is.

1453
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,600
That's why.

1454
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,140
That's why.

1455
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,980
Sire, there is no more money.

1456
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,420
We gotta get some money.

1457
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:09,340
That dirty Purgish harker, that flacky wharton, Philip Duncan Burton, Perkaluma Burton, doesn't

1458
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,220
wash the night away.

1459
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,940
Beep, beep, beep.
