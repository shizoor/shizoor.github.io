Remember, people watch the line on drinking to make sure you have alcohol and fire on every level of your home.
Remember, if someone in your household smokes or is under the influence of fire, you must be aware of Ontario.
Remember, I'm a dangerous drinker.
Remember, there's more to responsible drinking than alcohol and fire on every level of your home.
Remember.
Our All-Swab.
Oh yes, our testing is working out fine so far as we test, test, test all of our little microphones and our background music.
Is that okay?
Sounds good.
Tarzan's radio station has now been assembled successfully.
Thank you.
At the Dockstock Mountain House, Dracula's Castle, Stang Ranch, Stangsville, Stang County, Texas.
Huh.
Now all we need is a show.
A show.
Oh, hey, hey.
I would love to be a part of this.
Oh.
Hey.
On the ground too
Yeah we got high
So high
On the ground too
We ate lots of mushrooms
To commune with nature
How are we to know
We got to move our nature
500 colors
Flash into my brain
My cell division occurred
In three or four planes
My brain was blasted
My head feeling thick
My eyeballs protruding
But I didn't get sick
We packed up our kids
But we kept seeing dots
Yeah we found that the peak
Had gotten all the best spots
So we got high
So high
On the ground too
Yeah we got high
So high
On the ground too
Yeah we got high
People were happy
They were all having fun
While Dr. Stripop
Was farming skulls in the sun
The corpses were swinging
Their love did abound
The average corpse
Floated a foot off the ground
The band that dared not
Was speaking its name
While the doctors on the flint
Show were claiming their fame
Sparked on explosion
And
We'll be right back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It looks like beer, too, until you examine the fine print on the bottle.
And there's a lot of beer been flowing around, and I think that's why there's so many dragging subgenius feet around.
There's been a lot of good local beer, too.
Some friends of mine who distill spirits, you know who they are, Baby Bear, have friends who also distill spirits, and they distilled hard liquor out of beer.
And that stuff is delicious.
I'm afraid I drank it all.
And there isn't any more.
I've been told that you can run Kamchatka vodka through a filter.
And that's already distilled.
Yeah, well, it's...
I mean, have you ever had it?
Wow.
It's horrendous, but it's very affordable, and you can turn it into better alcohol.
One generation away from Pruno.
I just never really drank that much liquor, and only a little bit of beer.
I found myself to really enjoy non-alcoholic drinks.
But Frop is made up.
The other side of that world.
So in all of those ideas, you know, I've been able to sample all of these props from around the planet so far, and...
As long as you don't feel you're being shortchanged or short-sheeted at X-Day.
Not at X-Day.
No, no, no, no.
It's been flowing freely.
It's just popping out of the grounds here.
Like black gold.
That a lot of people don't realize that they're dropping so much.
It grows without stems or seeds.
It's a miracle.
It bursts forth.
It bursts forth.
From the daydoll soil of Wisteria.
Where the froth bushes grow like weeds.
I'm heading away where we fop all day.
And there's Fairyland also.
Oh, Stang's just getting drunk now.
That's the entire idea.
Kingdom of the Fairies on the other side of the pond.
Oh, I'm not going to do anything.
I'm just going to...
Oh, look at this guy.
He's making a spectacle of himself staggering around.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Somebody should do something.
Look at him.
He just gets to slack off while we sit up here and do this.
Somebody call the authorities.
Oh, work.
Grandpa's sauce again.
Selfish, selfish Stang.
Someone should just tie you to a chair and just leave you there to think about what you've done.
You're setting a terrible example.
Please, not in front of the children.
Really?
I mean, for heaven's sakes.
Live it or live with it.
That's the cousin of Nipplebot there.
It is?
Yeah.
Look, it just doesn't...
It's Nipplebot's nippleless cousin.
Without the turbo nipples.
Is Nipplebot here?
Dr. Cosmack?
I can't hear anything you're saying.
He says yes.
It's here.
Yes, it's here.
Making an appearance.
Nipplebot is here.
Present.
At the convocation.
And accounted for.
I blame the Nipplebot for last year's failure of the saucers to arrive.
Because I honestly believe that...
Blame some poor old robot.
Yeah, blame the new guy.
Fuck you, new guy.
Hey, we can do this one on the podcast, right?
Perhaps inattention.
Not enough worship was paid.
I forget which words I can and cannot say.
A subgenius zebiba was never developed.
You can't say any of them.
I'm already using words I'm not allowed to say.
Like word.
Well, you're welcome for me giving you something to rebel against.
You're already here.
I think nobody can do anything at this stage.
I'm not a rebel.
I'm just an idiot.
Well, there's no point in denigrating yourself.
I think you deserve some credit for making it.
This far.
To the center of the world.
X day.
You can't say the seven deadly words of Christ.
Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.
Yeah, you can't say any of those.
Or bears.
You guys, I've...
I've...
You know...
Usually I feel pretty popular when everyone's talking about that.
But, I don't know.
You don't feel popular when...
It feels like everyone's talking about me behind my back.
We've made a spectacle of you.
Please, no.
A tabloid item.
Not at X day.
Dear God, no.
Lagoume told some story and got around.
Nobody look at me.
On stage.
With a microphone.
Avert your eyes.
They're too entranced by the sounds that they hear.
At night she becomes a small quadruped.
To associate them with any human creature.
Sniffing through the trees for truffles and honey.
But I thought she became a winged avian.
And, uh...
Glided silently above the campground.
Well, uh...
That would explain all the big splotches on the ground, then.
They're not, uh...
What you call...
House-trained.
They're free spirits.
You lose all sense of house-training after transformation.
That's why werewolves can, you know, leave, uh...
Big piles in the corner when they're done.
Did you hear that?
With all else they do, no one...
There's werewolves around here right now.
There's well...
There's werewolves around here right now.
There's werewolves in these...
In these woods.
I heard them howling.
We've got Mothman.
Mothman is in these woods.
And I've heard rumors of...
Of, uh...
Of, uh...
Bipedal wolf creatures.
Well, they shouldn't bother us because, according to my notes, uh...
The, uh...
Moon reaches its perigee, uh...
Today.
At, uh...
Already has at 2.40 a.m.
And so, uh...
That we're the opposite of a wolfy, uh...
Moon.
You know, as the moon goes...
As the moon grows more and more full, your werewolf gets more and more...
His-stute and ravenous, um...
It gets wolfier by the...
Shifting moon.
Or the reshapen sign.
And, uh...
The full blown werewolf...
They're just real jerks.
Is really hard to stop.
There's not much that can be done about a...
A werewolf at the peak of its fierceness.
I've got silver bullets that, uh...
I've got silver bullets that, uh...
Somebody gave me, but, uh...
Really, they're hardly any good at all.
Uh...
Silver melts as the bullet is fired.
And your silver bullet tumbles in its trajectory.
So your werewolf has to be six feet close to you or...
Thereabout to fire the...
The bullet.
And that's too close.
Because the werewolf can kill you and rip you even as it's dying.
Uh...
If you're lucky enough to hit it in the first place.
And then these damn things are too small caliber.
Why didn't they give me larger silver bullets?
Still, I'm lucky to have the ones that I've got.
We need to give everybody more...
You know, we wouldn't have these problems if more people had silver bullets.
Well, they're good for a lot of things.
Larger... Larger...
So, yeah, and not just for werewolves.
Silver kills bad things like vampires and werewolves.
But, uh...
Fairies...
Filling in your teeth.
Hate the touch of iron.
And, uh...
Post-bronze...
Bronze age, uh...
Metals.
You touch them with that and they fade away or flee away.
I would think silver, uh...
How you doing?
Crossbow bolts.
Don't blame me.
That's good.
Yeah.
Silver crossbow bolts you could drive from a distance.
The whole problem is trying to get mechanized in the 20th century with anti-werewolf technology.
These kids these days...
Yeah, crossbow bolt...
That would be a good...
If you come across a...
With their new fangled...
A werewolf kill though...
Their rap music...
You can collect that wolfbane.
And their...
There's usually lots of fresh wolfbane...
Their internet...
That you can, uh...
That we'll process into smoothies.
Well, the wolfbane is supposed to keep, uh...
Werewolves...
Away.
As well as, uh...
Other things including the malevolent spirits of the Norse gods.
No.
No, no, no.
Can of beans.
Has beans.
Well, I'm out of stuff to talk about, you guys.
Welcome to Extant.
I'm not firing on all cylinders today.
Oh, I think you've been extraordinarily helpful.
Because I saw the dawn this morning and that makes for a bad brain next day.
A lot of us were up last night until it was today.
I hope it was a beautiful roseate dawn.
And then most of us have been draggingly, uh...
Uh, pulling ourselves across.
And then we had the, uh, the impromptu noise set.
The impromptu noise set.
The impromptu noise set.
The impromptu noise set.
The impromptu noise set.
The impromptu noise set.

What?
Uh, the impromptu noise set.
The impromptu noise.
People Reichstatt.

Ah, yeah.
Their babies are clarify-
S pesos.




S pesos.
S pesos.
��루.
I need a pyroflatulitis. Anybody got a lighter?
I got you a lighter.
I got you a lighter.
I actually literally do.
Oh, it went away. I can't do it now. Everybody's watching. I can't do it in front of everybody.
You won't like it if people are watching.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
You first.
I love watching SwagTube with a big old bucket of scrum.
Deep fried nuggets of joy.
Scrum. Available in three different flavors.
Scrum. Available now through these participating readers.
I'm a big failure.
You ready to rock?
I used to be a house in 10.
Upset with my possibilities and my future and my things.
I used to have a problem with how my life was going.
Now I just give up and have a good old suit full of scrubs.
A big old bucket of scrubs.
A nice, warm tub full of another scrub.
Everything is fine now.
It's a miracle!
I'll be a snow wolf!
We need to... I think if there's anything we need to do right now...
We need to invoke the power of Bob to take away your ability to walk.
I love you Bob.
Conspiracy be gone!
Be gone from this man!
Can I get some leg removal music please? Thank you.
Fox, you need to put your hand on this man's face.
I'd like to! I'd like to know if there's anybody out there in the audience tonight!
You need to put your hand on this man's face!
Who really feels the grip of the conspiracy on their ass, on their soul, on their mind, their heart, their dick, their genitals, their secondary sexual characteristics, whatever.
Is there anybody out there who wants to come up here and have the conspiracy cashed out on them?
I'm ready!
They're already up here!
Nobody?
Really?
Everybody here is just fine?
No conspiracy problems?
Can't see if there are actually any up here if everybody's left.
It's quite dark.
Somebody step forward!
Cast! Cast! Cast!
Cast off your conspiracy shackles!
Was the dawn lovely, or was it...
I don't know.
It was bleary-eyed?
I just saw the fabric of the tent change different hues throughout the morning from...
As it billowed out unspeakably.
From grey to blue to greyish blue to more blue.
And then kind of grey for a little while, but now it looks like, uh...
Old Mr. Sun's peeking out and saying,
Yes.
Hey, you basement-dwelling losers, come on out!
After that last raingasm, it's now clear.
And perhaps will continue fair through the next day.
I didn't mind the rain as long as the sun was not out.
I liked it. I was startled to see it.
But then I realized it had been mentioned in the booklet.
And it was said precisely that it would fall on this day.
Did you get your...
I said it. I warned you.
We looked up the weather on the way in and I warned everyone, but they didn't listen.
Did you get your, um, booklet?
Oh, no, I didn't get a booklet.
I haven't gotten my book yet.
Well, they're right over there.
And not only can you get a booklet which has pieces of art tipped in,
at least the top ones do in the pile,
but there's also a comic paper from Portland, Oregon,
of people who are now drawing comics.
They haven't learned that that's the route to the poorhouse.
So there are new underground cartoons in those free giveaway papers.
Yes, you walk away from X-Day with a lot of stuff besides memories of a beautiful occasion.
Well, you don't walk away from X-Day.
We've walked away from past X-Days.
We're flying out this year.
Oh, perhaps when you land and you walked into the Port Authority building on Planet X.
Intergalactic customs.
You may remember the diagram which I made in Revelation X,
the Bob Apocryphon showing what happens when you land at the other end of X-Day
and ascend through various universes until you reach the punchline.
Speaking of comics, five minutes.
I found a Chick track in the wild.
Which one?
It was in a hospital and they left the hospital one.
The one where the guy goes to the hospital and his friends are all like, you know,
they're all like bad guys.
Like they don't care about.
They're trying to draw him away from godly things.
Is he all burned and everything?
No, I think he's just sick.
And then like his roommate in the hospital is like, you should learn about God.
Hey, wake up and learn about Jesus.
And his friends come in there like, what's wrong with you?
You're talking like an idiot.
And he's like, but God.
Hey, sicko, what you dying for, idiot?
Learn about this Jesus feller.
He'll help you out.
I thought it was pretty jacked up actually.
So to speak.
I always think it's interesting that churches, especially in Florida,
a lot of our hospitals are run by religious organizations.
Seventh-day Adventists.
Imagine your surprise when you get there.
And you arrive and you just keep wondering, well, you know,
all these Bible verses on the wall kind of make me think,
why'd I have to get sick in the first place?
Sorry, we're Christian Science here.
You'll have to heal yourself after you learn about Jesus.
Lock yourself in this closet and think about what you've done, you cancerous fuck.
Well, they don't put it that way because that lacks the blessed gift of charity.
But they have a lot of good stuff.
They mean it just the same.
Jack Chick, you've got to hand it to the guy.
He is a kind of underground cartoonist, an alternative cartoonist,
whose little comic books go out all over the world
to send his confusing message of hate and fear.
I always enjoyed tiny shoes.
I just hit the microphone.
I don't even know where I am right now.
What's going on?
Well, that made a pleasant bumping sound.
And there you have it.
Thanks, Dr. Howell, Reverend Baby Bear, and Reverend Fox,
live at X Day 19, well, canned, but in front of a live audience.
Before that, we heard some confusing material
from what we might call Thorazine Urine Pod Crust,
a loose, and I use that term loosely, consortium of weirdos
who have a pod crust, Thorazine Urine Pod Crust.
And you should Google that and check it out.
It sounds a little different than the live version at X Day.
And now, before Dave calls in or something,
let's listen to a little bit of Reverend Experimental Please
doing a song called God Bless Hydrogen.
God bless hydrogen.
Time and weight are one.
Not to preserve it, nor to turn it.
From the pain to get it deep by the bone.
From the ground to the base, to the oceans,
all out clouds.
Bless hydrogen.
Good.
This is a Derf
which is suitable for you to wear
thread-free
and prevents大哥
yellow to
red.
JEFFREYTER
turn to the prairies turn to the oceans
fall out clouds of god blessed hydrogen
my dead wish was found
of god blessed hydrogen
that i made out of heaven
now i'm a observer
now a detourer
find the way to get deeper
down to the prairies
turn to the oceans
fall out clouds of god blessed hydrogen

I want to change you
I didn't wish
And that was Reverend Experimental, please.
And that really is his name, he says.
That's what he wants us to say.
And we're okay.
Now the big experiment comes.
Calling Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
We'll see how this works.
Oh, it's so exciting.
We've never done this before.
I've never made a phone call.
I've only ever gotten phone calls.
Yeah, I hear it. I hear it.
I can hear the ringing.
Yes?
Dave!
Dr.?
Dave!
I hear Dave!
Dr.?
You don't sound very good, Dave.
I don't sound very good?
Well, you were...
You sound sick.
Sick, Dave.
Well, I am sick.
See, there I hear that Aaron buzzening my...
Buzzening in my head.
There's a buzzling in your head?
Can you hear the buzzing of the phone?
Uh, no.
Good.
Then it's just on this end.
Yeah, I'm not...
I'm actually not hearing anything too terrible aside from you, Dave.
And then you can actually hear something terrible now.
That you've had part of your brain...
removed.
Which was the least important part of your body as far as I remember.
Well, it depends on which part of your brain, doesn't it?
Depends on which part of your body.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gee.
There...
Well, then...
There's your brain.
And there...
Yes, and the...
The, uh, human, like the mighty dinosaur, is famous for having a secondary brain lower down in its body to control its massive bulk.
Does that really...
Like the mighty stegosaur.
Is that...
What's the name of the stegosaurus?
The stegosaurus?
Is it two brains?
Is that really true or is that just something I learned in the fifth grade and forgot and wasn't true after all?
You got...
That's correct.
You learned it in fifth grade and it wasn't true.
Yep.
You know, I need to mount this Dave mic, also known as an iPhone, on something up high.
Princess, we could...
Oh, oh, there it is.
I mean, the box.
Okay, friends, I'm gonna describe Tarzan's radio station.
Okay.
And it's current location here.
I keep forgetting which to talk into, the phone or the mic.
Why not both?
Well, it's terrible because you can't mount them.
Why not both?
For...
I don't like the idea of staying mounting anything, at least in a public earshot.
There's a bear head not far from my head.
A mounted bear head.
Uh, Pappy...
Well, you could wear one of those like an Indian, like a Native American shaman.
Oh, kind of.
I mean, I've...
Pappy killed him a bar when he was only three.
Oh.
That's...
Pappy, Pappy, Pappy.
There is even a mounted goat head, a really big goat.
Well, that's the ritual.
Reverend Jessica, do you know anything about the, the, uh, that goat, Big Red?
I heard that that goat was a rapist.
That's what I heard.
Okay, I just, I didn't want to put any, any ideas in your head.
No.
Yeah, that's why he was beheaded, apparently.
Yeah.
Uh, he was a pet.
He was one of the first goats.
Before there was a goat ranch here, there were a couple of goats.
Mammy brought into the house in Richardson, they, where they made quite a mess, and she
would, she would drive them out here every now and then.
Apparently, when, when the real goat farm started, the gr, the greatest of all time,
uh, goat ranch.
Goat farm.
Goat ranch.
Greatest of all time spells goat, friends.
G-O-A-T.
Grp, grp.
Uh, but, but somebody already had goat.com, that was the problem.
Uh, anyway, they, a Big Red, who was a, thought he was special, because he was a pet, uh, became
a rapist of other, uh, goats.
He was a bad billy goat.
And I guess he had to be put down like a wild animal.

Uh, my niece Jessica is here in, in the area.
Maybe studio as it were.
But, well...
Although, this isn't really a stud, this, this studio used to be my dad's control
module, where he'd sit and watch TV.
And now it's got Tarzan's radio station on it.
Uh-huh.
It's just as cramped as all the other Tarzan's radio stations.
Well, I'm, I'm confused about what Tarzan's radio stations are.
It's my portable, uh, mixing kit.
It's, it's got three mics, a CD, a phone.
I thought you were talking about that.

And the entire listening audience.
I thought you were still talking about rapist billy goats.
That's part of the station now.
This is a station that has goats.
There's goats at the new station.
Actually, most of them are way down the hill, but I've got a telescope so I can watch them.
But the house goat is overseeing the entire broadcast.
Yeah, the dead, mounted, decapitated house goat.
There's also a jackalope.
An actual mounted jackalope head.
It looks like a jackrabbit head, but he has antlers.
Right, because jackalopes aren't real.
They're a figment of the western imagination.
Oh, really?
Well, when you come here and pet this little dead jackalope on the head, you might change your mind about that, Dave.
There are many strange things in this world.
I might even become a Buddhist.
So what are you talking about?
You already did.
No, I haven't converted yet.
I've been, well, I've been feeling strange.
You were already in the wobbly cult, right?
That's just about like being a Buddhist.
Yeah, but you don't have to get a shaved head or any kind of funny beard or anything like that.
Well, you do to join the Church of the Subgenius.
It doesn't matter what funny beard or shaved head you get.
You just got to have something weird.
Yeah.
Or we'll kick you out.
You better be really weird, too, because, you know, we're sticklers for that kind of thing.
We're conformists of nonconformity.
I'm glad, too, because who else is not, or are, is?
There's nobody that we know of that makes nonconformity such a high art.
It's so very, very, very, very, very, very important.
Well, and the strange thing is, there's actually no such thing as normal.
Although it's a good shorthand for something.
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what that is.
Recording, everything, everything's fine.
I guess that's why the word was normal to my sister-in-law, because she just could never say normal.
She said normal.
Her mouth revolted at the word, huh?
Exactly.
She's overcame my wishes to true within.
Normal! It doesn't normal!
Right.
Well, Dave, we wish you could be here.
You're here with us, but when we're in Cleveland, we wish that, too.
And Ashtabula, apparently, is just as far from Cleveland as it is from deepest Texas.
Well, not really.
But in many ways, yes, you're right.
You told me that the great man, Donald Trump, came to visit you in Ashtabula today.
He came. I wasn't home.
He left a note on the door, hand scribbled.
He said, Donnie, boy.
He said, I'll be around looking for you.
Wow.
And he never came back.
And I guess he went to some famous institution for the megalomaniacs.
And there's many, many pictures of him taken by the same morphers I work for, of him standing in front of crowds of people.
And I noticed I've actually seen some of these people before in my life that had their mouths open and were screaming and yelling for the great one.
And you've seen him do that in the supermarket?
Markets and convenience stores of Ashtabula and Geneva.
Of course.
Right.
With their tails on fire.
But not with, you know, in a regular position.
It's a sick place.
Well, you live, you're, right now, you're hanging out at another sick place.
Oh, we're hanging out at a wonderful, peaceful place.
It's...
I know, but I mean the statehood.
Oh, it's the state of Texas.
Well, yeah.
Texas politics.
Good boy.
I'll tell you, I'll tell you, if anybody's elected this election, I'm leaving this country.
I'm just leaving the country.
I don't care who it is gets elected.
If anybody at all gets elected, I'm leaving.
I'm out of here.
Got my passport.
I'm going to Portugal.
Portugal?
That's near Antarctica, isn't it?
Somewhere around there.
The reason I say Portugal is our friend G. Gordon Gordon and Mrs. Gordon have already...
taken up residence there.
Yes, they've boarded that saucer.
We might join them someday.
Well, yeah, it is quite nice to see most of the Mediterranean and the other areas of the Latin-speaking world are very, very nice.
Many say that it's fun to go to Italia because people just sit around and drink wine and talk about politics,
but they don't hurt each other.
They don't, you know, they're not...
Well, I'm not...
afraid to hear.
You would think that rural Texas would be Trump country, but actually this is Cruz country, so they don't really like Trump.
We honestly, we haven't seen any Trump signs in the whole town.
No.
I haven't really driven around looking for them.
Haven't seen any Hillary or Hillary signs neither.
Thank goodness.
Hillary, Hillary.
I love those signs.
Let's see.
Oh.
But we really have changed our residence for the winter,
and I'm going to give the subgenius post office box for the winter months.
Now, this doesn't mean that the Cleveland post office box, the one I've forgotten,
that doesn't mean we've forgotten it or anything.
But you can, if somebody wants to order stuff or write to me,
I mean, it's what I mean.
We have to do the ad after the broadcast part for the internet.
Yeah.
If somebody wants to send us their band on a CD or something,
it's, they can send it to stang or subgenius at, got that pencil ready?
P.O. Box 807.
That's right.
It's short.
It's only three numbers.
P.O. Box 807.
That's how big this post office is.
And the town...
The town is, well, we live in Stangsville, but Stangsville doesn't have a post office.
So the town is Glen Rose, Texas.
Two words.
Glen Rose, Texas.
Glen as in Glen and Rose as in Rose.
And the zip...
All one word though, right?
76043.
No, not all one word, Dave.
Two words.
I did the zip the way people do it on my answer machine.
The zip is 76043.
76043.
Uh-huh.
And Glen Rose is one word, correct, Lowe?
No.
Alamondis is one word.
No.
It's two words.
Glen with a capital G, R with a capital Rose.
Yeah.
And feed it with an obstructorata.
Right.
To follow.
Right.
And when in beautiful Glen Rose, you can also visit the Creation Evidences Museum,
the Dinosaur Valley State Park,
the Destructionist Evidences Museum,
which we'll be opening up ourselves soon,
when we finish the dinosaur tracks.
My niece Jessica wrote an essay about the Creation Evidences Museum
that was very sarcastic.
I did.
I had to see it for myself.
You know, I still haven't seen it.
I have never been in there.
I might be remembering it wrong,
but I think there's a picture of Jesus flanked by velociraptors.
Oh, is that where that's from?
Is Jesus aboard a velociraptor?
Uh-oh.
Picture of Jesus aboard a velociraptor.
That's a great picture.
It's probably done by the great Western artist Bob Summers,
who is our neighbor.
These are like the swiney pig ornaments
we're supposed to wear at all concurrent junctions, you know?
And it's so nice to know that somebody's actually had the mutton chops
to pull off such an orangutan ordeal.
You took the words right out of my mouth, Dave.
And I spat on them.
Now I spat on them.
Oh, God.
Oh, gross.
Hey, man.
Say it.
Don't spray it.
You got that right.
I was drooling like a hawk.
Well, when we get...
But listen to these girls.
Isn't the laughter of girls wonderful?
They say that women laugh more than men.
And I envy them that,
but I wouldn't want to have their tubes and their products.
Listen to these...
God, man.
Okay.
Well, I mean, emotionally,
they're having more fun than we are most of the time.
Yeah, well, that's why I'm not having more fun.
I'm jealous.
Irritates me.
They're all giggling and tittering.
Yeah, that...
Strange noise.
Oh, that was...
Damn it.
We gotta...
That's another thing.
You can...
Dogs are allowed in this radio station.
Yes.
It's dog-friendly.
They make great receptionists, too.
You may hear the rattling of his ears
when he shouts.
He shakes them.
Kind of goes...
Yeah.
And his...
His tags are very loud in my hearing aids.
Anyway, yeah,
here in Glen Rose area,
there's a state park devoted to dinosaur tracks,
and there's private lands
and just riverbeds that have dinosaur tracks on them,
and we have such a creek bed.
It's not really a river,
even a named creek.
It's a secret place
that my brother and father used to call Tanglewood Canyon
because it was so rugged.
And Princess, we and I didn't know that name.
We called the area King Kong's Grotto
because it looked so dangerous.
Parts of it really do.
These huge fissures in the earth
with these giant insects swarming way down at the bottom.
Really gross.
And actual King Kong trees
falling down across the ravine
so that, you know,
you can start walking across on the tree
and then some monster's going to show up on the other side
and shake the tree,
shake you down to be bug-free.
But Princess, we and I spent the last two weeks
frantically driving down to the dinosaur tracks
now that you can drive there,
and casting them in plaster,
which is much, much, much harder than we thought.
And it was so hard that I ended up making
a whole half-hour documentary,
which isn't on YouTube yet,
but it will be by the time anyone hears this.
And it's called
The Subgenius Must Have Track.
I thought about calling it The Hour of Track,
but it's not an hour.
It's half an hour.
Why don't you use both and say, like,
slack track, slack?
Track.
Track, slack.
Well, when we do our ad for the Destructionist Museum,
of some wag, Reverend Apostate cracked
that heroin use was what killed the dinosaurs
because there's so many track marks.
You can only hope.
No, I thought it was pretty funny.
I'm sorry.
I wrecked it.
I wrecked it.
I'm sorry, Reverend Apostate.
And, Princess,
Reverend 80 says that we're a track team.
Aw.
Because we go down there and...
I like that.
And cast tracks and pearls.
That's a good one.
We are a track team.
And swines.
We just cast them.
Now, if you're a track team,
who's pulling up the rears?
And who's the agent for the entire augmentation?
I was going to sell the show, so to speak,
and bring it on Broadway
where you can pick your heels up and make noises
and any noise you feel like it.
Yeah.
Whatever you said.
I don't know who was saying that,
but that just got challenged with my body.
But this music in the background kind of goes with it.
It's very relaxing.
This is Cyber Chump.
Cyber Chump?
Yeah, Cyber Chump.
Now, that's the only thing that I'm missing
is I can't hear Cyber Chump.
Right.
Or any other chump.
Right.
And I was hoping that I could get,
like, huge, like,
it is exciting watermelon music.
Or it is the music from
Flash and Andy Burr
and Sinbad and the Seven Sailors
and stuff like that.
Well, you know,
this hasn't been the kind of dramatic music
that makes you suddenly launch into a rant.
Like Herman.
Like Bernard Herman.
Right.
You'd know if it was.
Oh, no.
This is very serene,
misty, wonderful.
I'm sorry, listeners.
We'll get something worse.
Meditative, kind of almost new-agey music.
We'll get something worse next time.
Or as Reverend Stang would say,
new-age music.
Well, we played a bunch of Thorazine Urine Pod Crust music
earlier in the show
to satisfy the subgenius listeners.
And now this will balance it out.
My mom took Thorazine before I was born.
And that's one of the reasons I have.
I think we're at...
What?
They give your mom Thorazine?
Well, to calm her down
because she smacked the other individuals in the club.
Actually, it was not a club.
It was kind of a self-enjoyed intercalation party.
And everybody had to show up, you know,
and most of them were bare naked.
Which you can imagine for people in their 70s
walking around bare naked.
It was not fun for anything.
Well, maybe it was.
I don't know.
We're about to find out pretty soon, aren't we, Dave?
Yep.
Next week should be sometime.
Well, not the actual time,
but something should happen.
Oh, speaking of sad and death and stuff,
earlier in the show,
they were talking about the Jack Chick comics.
You know, those little Christian comics
you find in laundromats.
Yeah, Blatty died.
Yeah, Jack Chick up and died.
And...
That's a good thing, too.
And now we can make a funny biblical comic book about it.
Daniel said to his children,
children,
and his wife, Lorthal,
that if the Lord would come down from the hill
and give him a smiling handshake,
he would certainly do his bidding.
Well, Jack Chick comics are much more exciting than that.
They've got the Catholics cast as demons
and the Pope as Satan himself, practically.
There were wonderful hate pamphlets.
Funny thing, there was mostly hate in other Christians
more than anything else.
Yep.
Well, it's the same with any religion.
There's a lot of subgeniuses the same way.
Are they really spending their time
hating Muslims or Christians?
No, they're hating other subgeniuses.
The Palmerian headlaunchers hate the Trevino's,
especially now, because Arnold Palmer died
and Trevino's still alive.
The Jack Chick subgeniuses, you know,
hate the anti-Jack Chick subgeniuses.
Now, there's some of us...

Yeah, Jack Chick...
As Dr. Howell pointed out,
was an underground cartoonist
and the most successful of all of them.
And we do owe him a lot.
We've gotten a lot of mileage off of Chick publications
over the years.
But most of them were self-produced, weren't they?
Didn't he have them?
Exactly.
That's what I mean.
He was self-publishing.
He was a real underground publisher
and he gave them away practically for free.
You know, you could buy...
He would buy sacks of them for 20 bucks or something.
He was interested in bringing the word of the Lord
to the people around him.
Well, and he put Bob in quite a few of them.
He did?
Yeah, yeah, he did.
He didn't mean to, but you know how Bob is.
He gets into everything.
In fact, it's a shame.
I'm pretty sure that Chick never got around
to doing the anti-subgenius comic book,
which he was sincerely and truly planning to do.
If he had time after he finished his life work,
which was oil paintings of everything in the Bible.
And I think he may have finished.
But the reason I know this is because
my good buddy, Father Joe Mama,
the subgenius preacher,
in disguise as a human,
befriended Jack Chick himself,
the elusive, reclusive Jack Chick,
and made a documentary about his life.
And told Chick about the evil subgenius cult,
which had not been on his radar.
And he promised to do something about it
when he finished his project.
Yeah, just as he does with other social phenomena
that aren't right-wing, extremely evangelical,
bizarro Christians.
So bizarre when you call.
Some other cultists are so weird.
He takes a pen to that he disliked in his day.
That's why I'm saying,
we anti-Christians do not hate Jack Stinks.
The only disargument with him is for his belief system,
which is not, and not nice.
If you can stand for it.
Well, Jack Chick was God's cartoonist.
And that's the title of the wonderful documentary.
Directed by, quote, Kurt Kursteiner, unquote.
Who is really Papa Joe Mama, not Father Joe Mama.
You always call him Father Joe Mama,
but it's really Papa Joe Mama.
No, it's really Father Joe Mama,
but everyone just said Papa Joe Mama,
and he got used to it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I apologize.
I didn't know.
Okay, Mr. Genius History Expert.
Yeah.
Wasn't he at one time king of all the Susquehanna monkey
or some sort of great bishop or something like that?
No, you're thinking of Mama Joe Mama.
She was quite...
Queen of the apes.
Madres.
Yeah.
The old apos.
Yeah.
Those were the days.
Days.
Days and days and days.
I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know.
I don't know.
Dave, is your on-air sign lit?
Ours is.
Is it my air sign lit?
Of course it's an air sign.
I'm a Librazerian, buddy.
Yeah.
He didn't see the red light because he doesn't have a studio.
He has only the phone.
I have an internal red light studio of my own.
He has such an imagination.
I would imagine his on-air light is really brightly glowing right now.
Oh, it is.
It flickers, actually.
It's very intermittent.
And sometimes it just shorts out and goes real, real bright and breaks.
You have to replace the bulb.
The Dave bulb.
There's a World War II submarine ooga-ooga sound that goes along with it, usually.
Which I think is much more inventive and creative than just having what you describe,
which is only part of it.
It's a micro-skew portion of the entire thing,
which induces real alarm in the Soviet Republic.
I mean, in everybody.
Well, any pictures of the inside of you are going to be scary, Dave.
Well, at least there's not a fried egg in my brain.
The doctors have a lot of pictures of us now, don't they?
Yeah, they do.
And that means the NSA has the same gross, disgusting proctology pictures.
They can see the fried egg in your midbrain.
Right.
They can see the polyps in your midbrain.
The polyvinyl clorox.
You know, one of those baggies.
Yeah, it's true.
Dave and I both...
We both have been in and out of doctor's offices.
So has Princess Wee.
Yes.
It's age, you know.
Yeah, they constantly have to check us and recheck us and replace stuff.
You know, change the filters.
You need a colonoscopy every week.
Every week.
Right, every week.
Once a week, you need a colonoscopy.
God.
Well, I like the pills they give you with that.
The pills are great, but the colonoscopy part, I don't know.
Well, I get to where I kind of like it, you know.
Yeah, I can understand that.
I can see why some people are into that.
Reagan was really into it.
In fact, he was the only president who always insisted, I don't know if everyone knew this,
but he insisted on a coldest speculum the doctors could provide.
He wanted it cold.
He liked it that way.
He was a great president relative to some things that might be precedents.
Well, I wonder what kind of spatula Mr. Temple...
Oh, that's right, because we don't know who the president is right now.
Everybody listening to this show does.
Yes.
Soviet tanks in the streets of Washington, D.C.
Soviet tanks in the streets of Ashtabula.
Yep.
And Glen Rose.
I look out my window at which...
Great fear and trepanation every morning.
Not trepanation, trepanation.
Trepanate, fear and trepanation.
Hey, there's a good novel title for you.
Fear and trepanation in Ashtabula.
By the great Gozo, a form of Japanese ravioli.
Gozo.
Gozo.
Well, Dave...
Believe it or not, the show is over.
We have to end the show.
Oh, well, then I'll go take some pills now.
We're going to...
We'll play one last piece of music by the Psychoskeletons to take us out.
But don't hang up, Dave, because as soon as I cut, we're going to then be free to talk to the Internet.
Okay?
Okay, bye.
Say bye, but don't hang up.
Say bye, but don't hang up, and I'll go get my pills, all right?
Bye.
Praise Dave.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.

just ready to jump in bed with anybody well some of those things are true she is really pretty and
sexy and she's really really funny and uh and friends that's why you must join the church of
the subgenius get the real thing yeah exactly
the most invaluable of a trick-or-treat bag is when you think of all the things you've gone through
in your subservient lives out there waiting for one day the next for something to change or happen
this will actually change your life friends i don't mean to call you friends speciously because
i'm not in that form of mood i'm a nice person i could just easily say something very vicarious
