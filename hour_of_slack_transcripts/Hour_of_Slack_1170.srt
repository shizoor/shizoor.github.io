1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,260
I do wish we could chat longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,960
Get you vegetables every day?

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,040
You know I can't make that promise.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,640
The Self Genius Powerhouse.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,220
Shoot that dog up!

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,280
I bid you welcome.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,280
What do you believe in, huh?

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,920
What do you believe in?

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,660
I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,320
a stranger.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,620
Give a man a free house and he'll bust out the windows, put his family on food stamps.

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,200
Now, he's a big spender, no food on the table and the bills ain't paid

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,560
cause he's spending on cigarettes and PGA.

14
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,240
They'll turn us all into beggars cause they're easier to please.

15
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,140
They're feeding our people that government cheese.

16
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:33,240
Give a man free food and he'll figure out a way to steal more than he can eat.

17
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,140
Cause he doesn't have to pay.

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,200
Give a woman free kids and you'll find them in the dirt.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,180
Learning how to carry on the family line of work.

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,380
It's the man in the White House, the man under the steeple.

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,240
Passing out drugs to the American people.

22
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,380
I don't believe in anything.

23
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,200
Not a word.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,200


25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,180
Nothing is free.

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,200
They're feeding our people that government cheese.

27
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,440
Government!

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,320
Cheese government.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,240
Cheese government.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,540
Get out!

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,860
Declined.

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,820
Ball.

33
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,180
Declined and balled.

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,220
Fall down baby.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,340
Declined and balled.

36
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,800
I said fall way down now.

37
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,380
Declined and balled.

38
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,260
Come on, fall down little mama.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,480
Declined and balled.

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,360
Oh, decline and fall.

41
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,100
Give a man a free ticket on a dead end ride.

42
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,180
And you'll climb in the back even though nobody's trying.

43
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,360
Driving too goddamn lazy to crawl out of the wreck.

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,280
And he'll ride a while he waits up for the welfare check.

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,920
Gone to hell in a handbag.

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,280
Can't you see?

47
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,260
I ain't gonna eat no government cheese.

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,340
No government cheese.

49
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,320
No government cheese.

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,280
No government cheese.

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,480
No government cheese.

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,420
No government cheese.

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,400
No government cheese.

54
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,220
No government cheese.

55
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,460
No government cheese.

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,040
No government cheese.

57
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,280
No government cheese.

58
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,280
The Rainmaker, with Reverend Bob Wackenhorst.

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,280
And this is hour of slack number 1,170.

60
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,340
Most of which is a copy of the live broadcast from the Brushwood stage.

61
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
With Dr. How, Priestess Pisces and yours truly.

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:03,060
Reverend Ivan Stang from 11X Day, punctuated by some new music from this year's devotional cover album, as you will soon see.

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:18,240
Well, we're still counting down to three o'clock, but we have much more to impart here with our live broadcast from beautiful Brushwood, New York, on the day before X Day.

64
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,760
Rest assured, your money is safe.

65
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,000
Oop!

66
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,180
And I thought my jokes were bad.

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
So, friends, don't be a...

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,700
We want you to be a Bobby when it's time to be a Bobby.

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,780
When you first get into Bob and start seeing those...

70
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,740
A bright apple cheek little lad.

71
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,040
Synchronicities everywhere.

72
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,760
That's fine.

73
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,660
A beaming Bobby.

74
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,080
Yeah.

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,140
First spring.

76
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,320
up and rushing about to tell everyone the news of Bob, but the old, creaky, tired, and

77
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:06,240
sagging subgeniuses have heard it all, and they are apt to be a mite grumpy when interrupted

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,820
from their lawful pursuits with this early, due-fresh Bobby stuff.

79
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:20,060
But then there's the next phase where you really decide that it's stupid, and you've

80
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,760
outgrown it.

81
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,500
And I don't know why I sent those people so much money.

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
And they're rude to me.

83
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:32,540
I posted my hilarious comedy thing on alt.slack, and the only ones that even responded made

84
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,380
fun of me.

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,440
How dare they?

86
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,820
Mockers.

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,260
How dare they?

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,100
And so there's always that phase, and that one also always ends.

89
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,640
They always come back.

90
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,460
Invariably.

91
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,580
I've seen them drift so, so far away.

92
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,520
There was a subgenius who...

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,480
He became a Christian missionary and went to work for Ted Turner.

94
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,640
And yet he returned to the fold in the end.

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,240
He knew where the real slack was.

96
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,100
So we don't worry.

97
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,940
We're not insecure.

98
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,440
Bob's not an insecure God like so many others that demand lip service.

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,800
Bob says, go ahead and kill me.

100
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,520
Throw my picture down on the ground and pee on it, if that's what it takes to free you

101
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,880
from my...

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,440
Mind control.

103
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,340
But you have to.

104
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,620
Because he doesn't care about your mind.

105
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,240
He doesn't care about your soul.

106
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,540
He cares about the same thing that you most care about.

107
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,880
Your checkbook.

108
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,360
That's right.

109
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,280
Your bank account.

110
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,100
Your what's in your purse.

111
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,280
Because that's what's real, friends.

112
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,720
All this frippery and foo-for-all about heaven and hell and so forth.

113
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,960
It doesn't matter if you ain't got the scratch for old scratch.

114
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,740
And now that the dollar is developed...

115
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,560
Does Dobbs have a preference?

116
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,440
Does say he prefer euros or the Japanese yen?

117
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:56,680
No.

118
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,820
As the great preacher, Reverend Carter LeBlanc, pointed out last time, so what if the dollar

119
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,980
has lost some value compared to those other countries' money?

120
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,600
That's just...

121
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,880
We did that so we can sell them more shit.

122
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,640
Ah.

123
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,520
If the dollar gets weak next to the damn euro, that just means they're going to be buying

124
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,740
more shit.

125
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,940
They're going to be buying more crap from us.

126
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,140
I was concerned because I...

127
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,960
It's a circular...

128
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,280
It's a circle of lies.

129
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,120
It's like when a cat has its little kittens and then devours two of them.

130
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,700
The great chain of being.

131
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,160
I was really worried, Stang, because I saw you had gotten involved in Water Bear Futures

132
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,120
and I thought maybe you were a prize of some secret investment plan.

133
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,420
Oh, sure.

134
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,940
I'm an investor, but I'm not worried about it.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,140
That stuff goes up and down, up and down.

136
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,540
How are the water bears doing?

137
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,940
Great.

138
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,720
Oh, good.

139
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,120
Good.

140
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,440
They're always going to meet a need for water bears.

141
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,280
Because they're a part of nature.

142
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,780
You know, the most important creatures on this planet are really the worms.

143
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:57,780
Yeah.

144
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,260
They keep...

145
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:05,080
As far as living animals go, without them, the grass would not grow.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,820
True.

147
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:16,720
As it was finally figured out by the scientists of Alt Slack, dirt is mostly shit and shit

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
is mostly corpses.

149
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,420
Well, that's the difference.

150
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,860
If you realize that, it kind of takes you down a notch just a bit.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,620
And plants.

152
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,640
And at the same time, it does bring up the truth of the circle of life.

153
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,780
As you die and go to the ground, become worm food, then you somehow...

154
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,760
Another person arises and gives their money to Bob.

155
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,840
Bob will always have customers.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,900
If every life form on the surface of the earth was wiped out, there still remain those heat

157
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,560
vent worms.

158
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,380
At the bottom of the deepest trenches that live off of no oxygen at all, but just heat

159
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,000
and sulfuric fumes.

160
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,680
More than that, there's the underground life.

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Their descendants will be building cities, polluting the air, wiping out all other creatures

162
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,480
and causing great extinctions, and buying subgenius memberships.

163
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,020
Because that can never end.

164
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,020
That is the part of the cycle that cannot end.

165
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,460
Life...

166
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:26,960
Could end almost, but only in so much as there was still enough to buy salvation from

167
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,400
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

168
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:37,660
The biomass of the subsurface life exceeds in weight, could it be weighed, the biomass

169
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,100
of all life on the surface, including oceanic life.

170
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,580
That's right.

171
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,540
Those worms and microbes outweigh everything bigger than them.

172
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,440
Because there's so much more of them.

173
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,760
That's a lot more souls to save.

174
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,140
Sayonara.

175
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,180
I will be fire.

176
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,460
I will be fire.

177
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,300
I will be fire.

178
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,660
I will be fire.

179
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,220
I will be fire.

180
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,340
I will be fire.

181
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
You're telling me you've got a problem

182
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,460
A nervous sort of contraction

183
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,840
A mindless kind of reaction

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,180
You never get no satisfaction

185
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,140
Here's to you

186
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,840
I know you've really got a problem

187
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,900
A nasty kind of reflection

188
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,340
A dangerous sort of destruction

189
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,280
That makes it difficult

190
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,440
Makes it hard to reach

191
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,060
Takes it all away

192
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,040
From what you had in mind

193
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah

194
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,240
Here's to you

195
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,040
I know you've really got a problem

196
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,040
A nervous kind of distraction

197
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,540
A mindless sort of reaction

198
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,880
A nasty sort of contraction

199
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,300
You never get no satisfaction

200
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,540
There's a big black hole that you seem to be missing

201
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,660
And it's driving you to destruction

202
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,380
But it doesn't seem to stop you in the least

203
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,780
A heartless obsession got you rolling on back

204
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,360
Week after week

205
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,760
Day after day

206
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,420
Hour after hour

207
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,840
From where you came

208
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,460
For more of the same

209
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,340
Yeah, yeah

210
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,560
other than peace

211
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:43,880

213
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,640


214
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:54,680
I guess, as has the great writer Robert Anton Wilson, heard here in this interview from

215
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,900
right where you are sitting now, a CD from MaybeLogic.com.

216
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,140
What do you perceive as the greatest threat to our freedom?

217
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,460
The stupidity of the population.

218
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:14,260
As Schiller said, against stupidity the gods themselves contend in vain.

219
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:22,840
Do you feel that the American population is more stupid in some way than any other population?

220
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,600
Well, in lots of ways.

221
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:35,100
In Europe, the owners, the capitalists, the entrepreneurs, the managers, they all believe

222
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,980
the more intelligent the workers, the better their work will be.

223
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,820
So they believe in giving good educations even to the working class.

224
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,800
In this country, the capitalists seem to believe the stupider the population is, the easier

225
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,900
it is to manipulate them.

226
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,820
So why waste time by trying to educate them?

227
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,620
And there's been a deliberate dumbing down since the 60s.

228
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,220
Every decade I see more college graduates who don't seem to know.

229
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,220
They not only don't know anything, they don't even suspect anything.

230
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,020
Fortunately the internet is working in the opposite direction.

231
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,120
I wanted to ask you about that.

232
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,880
You know, many people claim that technology is going to, you know, especially the internet

233
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,860
and computers are going to be used to enslave us in some horrible way.

234
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,140
And you hear an equal number of people arguing just the opposite, that it's bringing about

235
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,960
all these new types of freedom or new vistas of freedom.

236
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,340
How do you feel about that?

237
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:34,860
Well, to take it by a curious path, when I was working on my historical novels, my wife

238
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,920
used to collect an old encyclopedia.

239
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,160
Every time she was in a bookstore that had a set of old encyclopedias, she'd buy it.

240
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,240
So we had about eight different sets of encyclopedias in the house.

241
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,860
So every time I wanted to look up a historical detail, I'd look it up in three or four of

242
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,920
the encyclopedias.

243
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,160
And always it took, it didn't take as much as three.

244
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,660
Usually only two I'd find a disagreement.

245
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,800
If I went through all eight encyclopedias, I'd find eight different.

246
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,400
Like when did, how old was Mozart when he wrote his first symphony?

247
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,800
He was either seven or eight, depending on which encyclopedia you look in.

248
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,100
How tall was the Bastille?

249
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,520
90 feet, 100 feet, or 120 feet, according to three encyclopedias I consulted.

250
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,280
This is what provoked me to what I call Wilson's 22nd Law.

251
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,000
Certitude belongs exclusively to those who only own one encyclopedia.

252
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,500
If you own more than one, you begin to encounter a certain amount of doubt and uncertainty

253
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,100
about things in general.

254
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,020
More and more people are doing research on internet.

255
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,760
I wrote an article a few months ago, which I didn't open a single book.

256
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,900
All the research I had to do I did on the web, on the world.

257
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,860
Everything I wanted was on the world wide web.

258
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,740
That certainly wasn't true 10 years ago when I first got online.

259
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,020
I did a whole article without once leaving the computer.

260
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,320
Everything I wanted to look up I just go to the world wide web and I could find it pretty

261
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,780
fast.

262
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,820
So more and more people are doing research on the web.

263
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,140
And the one thing you find out when you do research on the web is what?

264
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,360
You find out if you own eight encyclopedias, which there's no one reliable source.

265
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,260
There are a dozen different sources all claiming to be reliable.

266
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,740
Yeah.

267
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,760
And then you've got to use your own ingenious mind and your own talent for analysis and

268
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,860
skepticism to try to figure out which one of these guys really sounds like he might

269
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,180
know what he's talking about.

270
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,180
Which one should I bet on?

271
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,600
Whose source is every act of perception should be regarded as a gamble?

272
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,880
And from the experiments I've done and the experiments I've led in my workshops and seminars,

273
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,980
that has become overwhelmingly obvious and true to me.

274
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,080
Every perception is a gamble.

275
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,240
Just think.

276
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,640
You're walking down the street in a big city.

277
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,540
You see a face half a block away.

278
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,300
You think it's a friend of yours.

279
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,020
You get a little closer, it's a total stranger.

280
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,980
All perception operates on gambles.

281
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,600
You pick up a few details, you fill in the rest, and if the guy never comes any closer,

282
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,120
you're not sure whether you saw an old friend or somebody who just looked a little bit like

283
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,800
an old friend.

284
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,780
How does that relate directly to our political freedom, though?

285
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,220
The main trouble with Marxist parties is they think that thus capitalizing on the political freedom of the world is a good thing.

286
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,220


287
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,220


288
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,220


289
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:14,740
The major problem with the United States is that about 50% of the population at least thinks the Bible has all the answers in it.

290
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:23,420
And then there are libertarians who think Ludwig von Mises has all the answers, except for the ones who think Ayn Rand has all the answers.

291
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:30,480
If you think there's one book that has the answers, you're never going to really discover anything and you're never going to think an original thought.

292
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,000
If you find out there's 12 books with different answers, you're almost forced to start thinking.

293
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,220
You're never going to think an original thought.

294
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,220


295
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,220


296
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:44,720
So I feel Internet is forcing more and more people to do something they've never done in their lives before, which is try to make an independent judgment, how to judge between alternatives.

297
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,540
The Rainmaker

298
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,680
The Rainmaker came to town

299
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,220
And the people got what they wanted

300
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,220


301
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,220


302
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,220


303
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
The Rainmaker came to town

304
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,700
And everybody got what they need

305
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,980
The Rainmaker came to town

306
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,640
And everybody got what they need

307
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,400
Well, the people wanted power and reputation galore

308
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,840
So they became a bunch of bullies in the assorted size of war

309
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,080
And they sailed around the global block

310
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,400
Looking for some heads to knock

311
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,220
And most of them came home heroes

312
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,220
Heroes in a box

313
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,060
And the Rainmaker came to town

314
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,440
And the people got what they wanted

315
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,680
The Rainmaker came to town

316
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,880
And everybody got what they need

317
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,720
The Rainmaker fought

318
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:04,820
The Rainmaker fought

319
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,700
And the people got what they needed

320
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,180
There's a lot of people falling down

321
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,640
Cats and dogs and buckets

322
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,420
And the Rainmaker sailed away on a flood of relief

323
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,480
Hey, hey, hey

324
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,980
Well, the people wanted beauty

325
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,120
And prettiness and all

326
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,640
So they stretched and they dressed and they made up

327
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,520
And put mirrors on every wall

328
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,820
Till they all went to sleep

329
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,400
flying from ice grain

330
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,100
from the thing they wanted most

331
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,220
Now everybody's so isolated

332
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,960
A good looking bunch of ghosts

333
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,760
And the Rainmaker came to town

334
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,180
And the people got what they wanted

335
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,380
The Rainmaker came to town

336
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,480
And everybody got what they need

337
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,940
The rain came falling down

338
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,360
Cats and dogs and buckets

339
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,260
And the Rainmaker sailed away

340
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,180
On a flood of relief

341
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,160
Hey, hey, hey

342
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,080
Well, the women just wanted their food to keep

343
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,300
Instant potatoes and rubber meat

344
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,420
The kids just wanted to watch TV

345
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,120
Now the girls can't spell and the boys can't read

346
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,420
The men just wanted to stay

347
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:33,920
And it's just a dream

348
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:33,920


349
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,720
Now they got to pay the union mob

350
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,800
And everybody wanted to be free

351
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,820
Laws and rules should keep it that way

352
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,420
Hey, hey, hey

353
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,820
Hey, hey, hey

354
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,020
Well, everybody wants to be happy

355
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,100
Everybody wants to be warm

356
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,900
And be loved and liked and wanted

357
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,920
And have some kind of fun

358
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,920
And have some kind of home

359
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,360
But getting it is work

360
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,520
And keeping it is tough

361
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,560
But destroying it's the easy bit

362
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,160
We all got the magic touch

363
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,020
And the Rainmaker came to town

364
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,420
And the people got what they wanted

365
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,600
The Rainmaker came to town

366
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,740
And everybody got what they need

367
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,300
The rain came falling down

368
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
Cats and dogs and buckets

369
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,540
And the Rainmaker sailed away

370
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,420
On a flood of relief

371
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,640
A flood of relief

372
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,740
Now sail away

373
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,120
Sail away

374
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,000
And the Rainmaker came to town

375
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,720
To town

376
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,020
To town

377
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,600
And the Rainmaker came to town

378
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,360
To town

379
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,540
To town

380
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,620
To town

381
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,360
To town

382
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,280
To town

383
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,980
To town

384
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,820
To town

385
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,020
To town

386
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,340
To town

387
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,340


388
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,460
To town

389
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:44,800
To town

390
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:44,800


391
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:44,800


392
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:44,800


393
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:44,800


394
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,900
And then there are those 11 herbs and spices, too.

395
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,420
It's the old, the old, old story of which one means the most to Bob.

396
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,540
The little old lady who only had a quarter left her dame,

397
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,620
but yet she put it in the collection plate.

398
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,560
Or the...

399
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,480
Mr. Moneybags, who could easily spend a million dollars and never miss it.

400
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,040
And he only gives Bob $10,000.

401
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,340
I think we know who Bob loves the most.

402
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,680
The one who makes good eating.

403
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,240
They fuck that little old bitch.

404
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,680
Yeah, not that dried up old thing, but the fleshy capitalist is a far better subject for the grill.

405
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,580
He takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it.

406
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,260
He turns to me and he says,

407
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,940
Why so serious?

408
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,300
He comes at me with the knife.

409
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,940
Why so serious?

410
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,060
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

411
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,140
Let's put a smile on that face.

412
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,060
And...

413
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,980
Why so serious?

414
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,720
Listen to them.

415
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,000
Children of the night.

416
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,120
What music they make.

417
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:24,040
And now, United Front Ministries presents Dial a Story with Aunt Bertha.

418
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,360
This week's episode, Billy and Timmy Go to Hell.

419
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,820
Good evening, boys and girls.

420
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,600
Once upon a time.

421
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,940
In fact, it was last Sunday evening.

422
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,940
Gee, Billy, I don't think we should have taken that LSD.

423
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,460
Don't sweat it, men.

424
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,000
It'll be cool.

425
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
I'm scared.

426
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,660
Don't be scared.

427
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,240
You'll have a bad trip.

428
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,340
Bad trip?

429
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,060
You didn't say anything about a bad trip.

430
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,240
Just don't think about it.

431
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,240
Oh, what if Aunt Bertha catches us?

432
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,500
I don't think that...

433
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,340
Jesus...

434
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,640
Oh, forget about that old Jesus.

435
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,500
What's happening, Billy?

436
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,380
Oh, boy, I can taste colors.

437
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,780
Oh.

438
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,480
Look at the trail.

439
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,440
I'm scared.

440
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,080
I'm scared.

441
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,100
I'm scared.

442
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,340
I'm scared.

443
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm scared.

444
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,440
I'm scared.

445
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,440


446
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,440


447
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,440


448
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,440


449
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,440


450
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,180
I'm scared.

451
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,080
Billy, where are we?

452
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,620
I don't know, Timmy.

453
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,260
It looks like a big cave, and it smells like charcoal.

454
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,140
I can't see through all the smoke.

455
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
We're in hell. I know we're in hell.

456
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:50,240
We're going to be thrown into the lake of fire and beaten up by scorpions and bugs and earwigs and horrible leaves and chickens.

457
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,920
We're in hell. I know it.

458
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,500
I don't know, Timmy. I think it's just one of them hell hallucinations.

459
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,020
It sure is real, though.

460
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,260
Oh, look.

461
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,980
Billy, it's Satan.

462
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,800
I'll bake your bones to make my bread.

463
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,080
Run, Billy. Run.

464
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:20,500
And so Billy and Timmy ran to and fro throughout the hoary netherworld, pursued by the Horned One.

465
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,080
Go on, sucker.

466
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,700
Hey, wait. Wait.

467
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,660
I don't want to be cast into the pit of voppers and spotters.

468
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,480
I don't want to be cast into the pit of voppers and spotters.

469
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,220
I don't want to be cast into the pit of voppers and spotters.

470
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


471
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,440
I have you now, Timmy.

472
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm going to torture you for a thousand years, and then I'm going to throw you into the burning pit of fiery scorpions.

473
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:46,240
But, but, I have tried to study the Bible for many hours.

474
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,840
I, oh, don't torture me.

475
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,280
Ow! Ow!

476
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,940
You should have thought of that before you decided to disobey Jesus.

477
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:55,460
Yes.

478
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,600
Aunt Bertha.

479
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,360
That's right, Timmy.

480
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:07,980
It was I, Aunt Bertha, who prayed and prayed for you to be delivered from that horrible drug.

481
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,160
We're sorry, Aunt Bertha.

482
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,380
We thought Satan was after us.

483
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,440
But it was only you.

484
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,460
And Jesus.

485
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,620
We'll never take psychedelic drugs again.

486
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,700
Say that you don't.

487
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,740
Yeah, I'm having a flashback.

488
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,420
Me too.

489
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,780
And so, Billy.

490
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:39,420
Billy and Timmy prayed and cleansed their bodies with holy water and studied the Bible until the wee hours, until they slept the sleep of the angels.

491
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,280
I hope you liked this story, boys and girls.

492
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:57,020
If you would like to make a donation to the Aunt Bertha KFJC Radio Ministries, get on your phone right now and call 650-941-6808.

493
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,000

494
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,260
That's 650-941-6808.

495
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,480
680-941-6808.

496
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,300
That's 650-941-6808.

497
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,300


498
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,300


499
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,860
Call with your pledge now.

500
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,740
Operators are standing by.

501
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:21,120
That number again is 650-941-6808.

502
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,380
Goodbye now.

503
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,300
Goodbye.

504
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,400
Goodbye.

505
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:37,580
And Bertha, Dr. Hal and Phineas Narco from NationalCynical.com.

506
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,420
And now back to the X-Day Live.

507
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,080
One starred night Prince Lucifer arose,

508
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,220
Tired of his dark dominions,

509
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,380
Swung the fiend above the rolling ball in cloud parts screened,

510
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,560
Where sinners hugged their specter of repose.

511
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,440
Poor prey for his hot fit of pride were those,

512
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,600
And now upon his western wing he leans,

513
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,720
Now his huge bulk o'er Afric's sands careens,

514
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,960
Now the black planet shadowed Arctic snows,

515
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,320
Soaring through wider zones,

516
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,680
That pricked his scars with memory of the old revolt from awe.

517
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,980
He rose to middle height,

518
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,120
And at the stars, which are the brain of heaven,

519
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,360
He paused and sank.

520
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,920
Around the ancient track marched, rank on rank,

521
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,620
The armies of unalterable law.

522
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,960
Flies? Flies?

523
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,300
Poor puny things.

524
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,520
Who wants to eat flies?

525
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,180
You do, ya loony.

526
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,660
Not when I can get nice fat spiders.

527
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,460
Here is a question, Dr. Hal.

528
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,940
It was written, scratched into the paper with the fellow's keys,

529
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,960
And the question is this,

530
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,040
Where are the pens?

531
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,740
Proving once again that this is not a fake subgenius show.

532
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,300
This is the real thing.

533
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,240
When we hand out stuff for you to write on.

534
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,920
There are markers all along right over there.

535
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,900
The question is which pens do you mean?

536
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:40,260
The Sharpie pens or the pens to write these answers with?

537
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,340
You might have to share among one another.

538
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,320
If your neighbor has a pen,

539
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
You must borrow it from your neighbor.

540
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,960
That's simply the way it is.

541
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,320
The pens that people draw with, Princess Wee says,

542
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,380
Are pens that people could also write with.

543
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,520
It's a concept. Multitasking, we call it.

544
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,260
You may have noticed that we leave poster board and pens and things laying around.

545
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,480
We try to encourage you subgeniuses to spew it on out, man.

546
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,660
We want to try to encourage your artistic essence.

547
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,700
We want it to germinate and grow.

548
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,680
Well, I see you've accumulated some questions.

549
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,620
So now we're going to begin the Ask Dr. How thing and probably conclude it very quickly.

550
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,340
But let's have those questions and see if they can help us along our sinusoidal subgenius path.

551
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,460
That farting bob is still irritating my ideas.

552
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,360
We have good audio.

553
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,540
Oh, well, I'll move it farther away.

554
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,200
Hold on. Here, you can answer. Here's our first question.

555
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,860
Could Bob's pipe be considered a yoni slash lingam?

556
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,920
That's a very good question.

557
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,840
Could Bob's pipe be considered a yoni slash lingam?

558
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,520
Well, it is unlikely to be both.

559
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,900
But with Bob, all things are possible.

560
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:21,600
So aggressively used, Bob's pipe is then the lingam.

561
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Passively used, Bob's pipe is the yoni.

562
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:35,780
However, one must make sure that it is not glowing to red heat when given this secondary application.

563
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,880
All right. I'm glad to know that.

564
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,940
Because I had really stayed awake at night wondering.

565
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,660
This question, what is the key, the musical key, of Bob's sails pitch?

566
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,720
Ah, that's very interesting.

567
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:02,600
Well, you know, Bob does have a mellifluous voice, which assists him at being the saint of sails.

568
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,620
The most average pitch is, of course, middle C on the piano.

569
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,740
And this is Bob's standard tone, as we interpret it.

570
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:28,040
But on those special occasions, he can soar into a lilting soprano or sink down below a soothing baritone into a rumbling and authoritative bass.

571
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,560
Here's one you'll like, Dr. Howell.

572
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,280
Okay.

573
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,600
Since dinosauria shares some traits of reptiles and dinosaurs,

574
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,960
I ask, right before you get devoured by the hungry T-Rex,

575
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,120
do you have to face his mighty, throbbing, hemi-penis?

576
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,040
That would be a confused dinosaur, I think.

577
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,180
Dinosaurs know the difference between food and a sexual object.

578
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,620
Unlike some subgeniuses I might name.

579
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:08,240
Subgeniuses have larger brains and a larger and more developed play.

580
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:16,280
We should celebrate our differences, even where we differ from the noble dinosauria.

581
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:26,540
But if you did have to face the throbbing hemi-penis of a rampant Tyrannosaurus rex,

582
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:33,000
it would only be a brief moment before the merging of alimentation.

583
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
Thank you, Dr. Howell.

584
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,220
Sticking to the kind that cockeys lack.

585
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,220


586
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,520
time.

587
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,120
Sweden.

588
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,200
History may also play a role.

589
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,520
A role.

590
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,080
Happiness.

591
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,460
Happiness.

592
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,360
Culture of low expectation.

593
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,500
Doing it every day.

594
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,620
Don't depend too much on the American dream.

595
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,120
I'm Dweeb.

596
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,180
So I had a wife.

597
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
She was beautiful.

598
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,760
Like you.

599
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,920
Who tells me I worry too much.

600
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,620
Who tells me I ought to smile more.

601
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,400
Who gambles and gets in deep.

602
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,340
The sharks.

603
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,020
Hey.

604
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,220
One day they carve her face.

605
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,960
We have no money for surgeries.

606
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,700
She can't take it.

607
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,780
I just want to see her smile again.

608
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,460
I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.

609
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,720
So.

610
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,080
I stick a razor in my mouth.

611
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,060
And do this.

612
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,280
To myself.

613
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,180
And you know what?

614
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,340
She can't stand the sight of me.

615
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,480
She leaves.

616
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,420
And now I see the funny side.

617
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,700
Now I'm always smiling.

618
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,060
Now I'm always smiling.

619
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,060


620
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,060


621
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,200
Here's another one.

622
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,500
This is one I'm sure many of you have wondered.

623
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,620
Who would win in a fight?

624
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,240
Bob or Shatner?

625
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,580
Who would win in a fight?

626
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,800
Boy, you know this is so much like the actual questions.

627
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,760
I get that.

628
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,000
Who would win in a fight?

629
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,260
Popeye or Superman?

630
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,240
You know, that sort of thing.

631
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,220
In this case, who would win in a fight?

632
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,720
Bob or Shatner?

633
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,820
Bob and Shatner could go at it.

634
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,780
And Bob might be down.

635
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,400
But he would ultimately get up.

636
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,680
But Shatner would just be ultimately exhausted.

637
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,120
Shatner is only mortal.

638
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,500
And doesn't really give 100% these days.

639
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,840
The way he used to.

640
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,620
I know you all know the way he used to.

641
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,620
But, you know, he's only frail, mortal flesh.

642
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,740
And besides, he's got everything he wants.

643
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,320
But if you want to see a real Shatfest,

644
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,880
you've got to go to watch The Intruder.

645
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,580
That Roger Corman movie.

646
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,220
The only good movie that Roger Corman ever made.

647
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,380
The only one that ever lost money.

648
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,580
Features William Shatner as an evil, racist agitator.

649
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,500
Who comes into a small southern town.

650
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,340
And works them up into lynchings and other atrocities.

651
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,380
And to film this, they went to an actual southern town.

652
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,480
Full of racists.

653
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,080
And got them all riled up.

654
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,420
It's a terrifying and wonderful film.

655
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:48,460
And in the middle of it, you see Shatner acting his scary heart out.

656
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:55,040
Now that young Shatner might give Bob more time on the field of battle.

657
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:01,680
But I think the fact that we're all here shows that we all know Bob will ultimately prevail.

658
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,960
Right. They had the fight. Bob won.

659
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:13,300
Now this one I've even heard asked at X-Day before.

660
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,980
It's a very common one.

661
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,460
Alright.

662
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,300
Is there anything that Dobbs cannot sell?

663
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,900
Hmm. Anything that Dobbs cannot sell.

664
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,060
Maybe it's not so common.

665
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,380
Is there anything that Dobbs cannot sell?

666
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,860
I don't think there's anything that Dobbs cannot sell.

667
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,360
But there are things that he characteristically does not sell.

668
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,220
You know, there is only a certain amount of inventory.

669
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,780
And until one is blessed with infinite time, one doesn't get to go through all the stock.

670
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,760
Particularly the out of sale items in the back room.

671
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,300
The shop worn items.

672
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,420
These you can sell.

673
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:07,360
But why bother when you can entice them in with loss leaders and the bargains that Bob's special talent of selling.

674
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:13,200
Salesmanship have always made his meat and drink, so to speak.

675
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,220
Dobbs.

676
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,600
Dobbs.

677
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,000
Dobbs.

678
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,780
Dobbs.

679
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,160
Dobbs.

680
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,580
Dobbs.

681
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:16,980
Dobbs.

682
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,260
Dobbs.

683
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,640
Dobbs.

684
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,160
Dobbs.

685
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,580
Dobbs.

686
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:18,600
Dobbs.

687
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:18,960
Dobbs.

688
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,240
Dobbs.

689
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,280
This will be disturbing.

690
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,820
I have a statement.

691
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,400
I am bisexual, a cross-dresser, a homosexual in action.

692
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,120
I use women's restrooms and locker room facilities.

693
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,560
Bath houses, massage parlors, mortuaries.

694
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,340
The sexual confusion of the world is the most common thing that I've ever seen.

695
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,340


696
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,340


697
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,340


698
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,220
I hold still for this.

699
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,220
Admit it.

700
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:46,220
In a restroom, a transgender movement can go into the girls' restrooms?

701
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,520
Is that what that means?

702
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,760
Well, it has to be.

703
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,700
Somewhere.

704
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,800
Spreading.

705
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,680
Leaking.

706
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,560
I am with that.

707
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,020
I am going to stand up next to the mountain and jump it down.

708
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,060
I am going to stand up next to the mountain and jump it down.

709
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,100
I say.

710
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,640
Spreading.

711
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,980
I am going to stand up next to the mountain and jump it down.

712
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,220
I am going to jump it down.

713
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,940
I am with my hands.

714
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,800
Yeah.

715
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,720
Yeah.

716
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,580
Yeah.

717
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,380
Yeah.

718
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:16,800
Yeah.

719
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,040
Yeah.

720
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,280
Yeah.

721
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,540
Yeah.

722
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:17,600
Yeah.

723
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:17,840
Hello.

724
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,480
Welcome to eternal sodomy.

725
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,980
Clean sexual strange flesh.

726
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,480
Lust for one another.

727
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,020
Sodomy is sexual passions.

728
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,860
Men with men.

729
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,240
Women with women.

730
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,960
Sexual burning and lust for one another.

731
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,820
Sexual sodomy.

732
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,300
Practicing homosexuals.

733
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,820
Homosexuals.

734
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,580
Of homosexual, sodomite, lesbian practices.

735
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:40,900
Did you notice?

736
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,180
Homosexuals will inherit the kingdom of dog women.

737
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,880
People can come out if you want to.

738
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,400
Collages by Norrell Preff, when not by Fernanda Nandeli-Murrow.

739
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,360
The booty chop cut up there was by Earth, Wind, and Fire.

740
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:15,220
But now, we go to the 11th stage reel and ask Dr. Howell.

741
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:21,780
Dr. Howell, this is a two-part question, or two questions from Reverend Xanatos.

742
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,880
I can stand the push of your two questions.

743
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,260
Question number one, why is the sky?

744
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,220
Hmm, well, that's a good one, yes.

745
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,440
Why is the sky? Why do we have to have a sky?

746
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,400
Why is there a sky instead of no sky?

747
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:45,520
Why do we not have the icy embrace of outer space?

748
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:52,060
Instead of this atmosphere with its confusing clouds and winds and meteorology.

749
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,120
Well, it's all linked together.

750
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,760
We have a moon. The moon makes tides.

751
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,020
The tides cause the waters of the earth.

752
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,780
The tides cause the earth to move.

753
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,300
Our moon is exceptionally large.

754
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:13,760
Without our disproportionately large moon, we might have a static system.

755
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:20,840
The elements of the atmosphere might congeal or escape off into space.

756
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:28,080
We have a sky, but that sky, as permanent as it seems, is, like everything else, a transient phenomena.

757
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,380
They say there's no such thing as perpetual motion.

758
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,720
And there isn't.

759
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,380
But you can tell.

760
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,020
We push the envelope until, for our purposes, it's almost the same thing.

761
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,380
The sun, eternally falling toward the earth in that regard, is a perpetual motion machine.

762
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,100
Of course, it's getting energy from outside itself.

763
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:58,100
Without the sky, there would be no protection from the deadly cosmic rays, which are sleeting through everything.

764
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,200
And our soil would simply be lifeless regolith.

765
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,360
Like the moon and life.

766
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,760
There's no application of the sun, in addition to the unknown.

767
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,180
But you know, folks, the Earth is organic, which creates soil.

768
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:21,480
It's the presence of shit and death that makes the soil as fecund as it is.

769
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:27,340
And you can start growing in regolith, if you have the elements of it.

770
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,520
Because, when you do so, you're changing regolith into the soil.

771
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:39,060
There will come a time when our sky is not what it is now.

772
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,480
Unfortunately, this time is coming very rapidly.

773
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,240
The entire Earth is going to be closed down.

774
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,660
I don't think anyone is going to get out of it.

775
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,040
It's not just X-Day, too.

776
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:57,740
If X-Day doesn't happen, the world will end anyway.

777
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,720
The oceans are going.

778
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,440
When the oceans go, we don't have the phytoplankton,

779
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:09,580
and our sky, or what we have left of it, will be quite different.

780
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,300
You know, the oceans are being carbonated,

781
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,800
as if the oceans were a large soft drink,

782
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,880
because of the carbon emissions that are being pumped into the atmosphere these days.

783
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,400
And this means that calcareous creatures with shells

784
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,700
will not be able to forage.

785
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,960
They will be able to form those shells, not just coral reefs.

786
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:38,220
All that's going to be living in the oceans in a very short time is bacteria and jellyfish.

787
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,340
And if you think this won't affect Earth's blanket of atmosphere,

788
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,200
you've got another thing coming.

789
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,580
Well, there's another part of this question, which is,

790
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,120
why does the conspiracy value cleanliness so much?

791
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,920
Well, it was John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist faith, who said,

792
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,700
Cleanliness is not cleanliness.

793
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,540
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

794
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,420
And sure enough, it is true, because God, being ex-organic,

795
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,120
does not need to be scrubbed or cleaned.

796
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,880
But, on the other hand, as I have pointed out,

797
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,140
cleanliness is next to the lunar rock,

798
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,000
to lifelessness,

799
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:22,160
to the immortal monument of death.

800
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,780
And now this, I believe, is the last of the questions that I've been given.

801
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,200
Is there a way for us,

802
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,080
to consciously alter the luck plane?

803
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,940
I believe it's alter, affect, I'm sorry,

804
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,420
affect the luck plane.

805
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:42,840
Yes.

806
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,780
That's my answer, yes.

807
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,960
There is a way to alter the luck plane.

808
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,420
First of all, it's a feeling.

809
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,480
It's an instinctive feeling.

810
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,860
Like if you're surfing the luck plane,

811
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,860
you have to be somewhat cognizant

812
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,860
of the sinusoidal nature of luck itself.

813
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,100
These things do not travel in straight lines,

814
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,580
but in waves.

815
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,160
For example, whenever I see a penny,

816
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,380
I always bend over and pick it up.

817
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,980
You may be familiar with these studies

818
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,180
by time and energy efficient yuppies,

819
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,020
who figure their time is so valuable

820
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,800
that it is a waste of their time

821
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,300
to bend over and pick up a penny.

822
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,380
So they let it lie.

823
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,640
Well, what about a nickel?

824
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,080
What about a half dollar?

825
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,780
I find that if you avoid these pennies,

826
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,880
you might be avoiding the fractal tail

827
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,680
of a large sum of money,

828
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,460
which will come your way

829
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,980
if you only grasp the end of it

830
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,360
and firmly pull it towards you.

831
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,760
If you don't believe you're going to have luck,

832
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,340
in other words, your luck will,

833
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,520
or lack of it, will substantiate this belief.

834
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,620
Every time I find a nickel,

835
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,040
pretty soon I make a pretty good financial score.

836
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,060
And on those few occasions

837
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,700
when I've found $20 bills,

838
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,540
and there are such occasions,

839
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,180
I have not avoided picking them up.

840
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,540
And lo, soon after that,

841
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,520
I've gotten good jobs, large checks,

842
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,540
and have been able to devote myself

843
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,140
to personal slack.

844
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,520
Dr. Hell, a subgenius,

845
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,440
just brought me a piece of,

846
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,320
a question with what looks to me

847
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,980
to be a tawdry bribe.

848
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,720
What are you saying?

849
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,680
Let me show you.

850
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,640
Oh, this is no bribe.

851
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,840
This is simply some money for me,

852
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,200
and a perfect illustration of what I was saying.

853
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,160
And here it is, the question.

854
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,000
My son, who is now 20,

855
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,320
is still afraid to come to X Day.

856
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,520
But his 15-year-old sister,

857
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,160
what to be here?

858
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,080
What?

859
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,280
What to be here?

860
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,580
It must mean wants.

861
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,660
Yes, it's written wants.

862
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,740
What do I do?

863
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,940
Well, what you do is you satisfy

864
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,380
the spirit of the yearning proto-subgenius,

865
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,920
and let that child who wishes to come to X Day

866
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,880
come to X Day.

867
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,400
Because who knows,

868
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,780
when it will be too late to come to X Day.

869
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,180
Too late to board the vessel.

870
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,760
Too late for everything.

871
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,180
And then in those last minutes

872
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,680
before you frizzle and fry

873
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,800
in the Holocaust at the end of time,

874
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,020
there will be the added torment

875
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,580
of reproaching yourself

876
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,580
for not acting when you should have.

877
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,780
And like the old cat in the adage,

878
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,260
waiting too long.

879
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,400
It's just Bob is what it is.

880
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,260
It's just, it's literally Bob.

881
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,080
Lingering at the tattered fringe

882
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,160
of your consciousness,

883
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,780
flooding your awareness

884
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,360
with bold new waves of sound,

885
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,140
sweeping you inexorably

886
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,400
toward grand new vistas of being.

887
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,200
The National Cynic,

888
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,560
National Cynical Network.

889
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,300
National Cynical Network.

890
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,760
Now that's one movie of Steven Spielberg's

891
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,700
that he didn't re-edit.

892
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,420
There have been no special editions

893
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,820
of any...

894
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,100
Steven Spielberg?

895
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,480
Steven Spielberg.

896
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:38,840
Oh.

897
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,540
Oh.

898
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,020
There have been no special editions

899
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,900
of those movies.

900
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,600
It's odd.

901
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,860
He's done everything else.

902
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,380
Why?

903
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,160
Why?

904
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:48,860
Why?

905
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,060
Mo?

906
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,700
Why?

907
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:50,780
Mo?

908
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:51,680
Mo.

909
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:21,600
Why?

910
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:21,640
Why?

911
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,680
reverb machine, Marion. Don't look at the reverb machine.

912
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,060
It's beautiful.

913
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,780
It's beautiful.

914
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,660
Keep your eyes

915
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,300
shut, Marion.

916
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,580
No. It's

917
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,100
beautiful.

918
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,360
He keeps saying it's beautiful and then he

919
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,640
blasts himself with white noise.

920
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,680
It's beautiful.

921
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,360
Well, I don't see what's so beautiful about it.

922
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,720
I'll open it.

923
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,280
Yes, Raiders of the Lost Boombox

924
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,760
coming to a theater near you.

925
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:04,820
Boombox?

926
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,660
It's beautiful.

927
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,120
I'm gonna blow up the Sony,

928
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:11,440
Renee.

929
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,320
Blow it back to God.

930
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,320
Phineas Norco and company from

931
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,460
NationalCynical.com

932
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,380
and now back to the

933
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,180
cleanliness of

934
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,600
Dr. Howe.

935
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,720
So there was one question

936
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,520
you missed here. That was the second one

937
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,700
for me. Nope. I got it.

938
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,780
Cleanliness.

939
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,000
Cleanliness, yes. The sine qua non.

940
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,160
Cleanliness. Cleanliness is an illusion.

941
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,100
One cannot be

942
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,060
clean. One can only

943
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,700
remove minor

944
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,660
excretions.

945
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,880
Excessions from the surface.

946
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,940
Inside, it's all

947
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,220
dirt from the standpoint of

948
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,420
robots and crystalline formations.

949
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,020
All salt,

950
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,020
stink and fluids.

951
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,420
But we have to

952
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,120
embrace that portion

953
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:04,840
of ourselves.

954
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,120
Weren't there some aliens that referred

955
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,680
to the humans as

956
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,140
ugly? Squirming bags

957
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,180
of unfulfilled appetites?

958
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,040
No. Ugly bags

959
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,200
of water.

960
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,700
Held up by white sticks.

961
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,540
Sure.

962
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,500
Well, that's their prejudice,

963
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,700
you know. To us, maybe they're

964
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,220
the monster. I suspect they are.

965
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,920
I suspect they're the typical

966
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,340
unthinkable things.

967
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,440
Either bone-dry monsters

968
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,420
from another world, which is

969
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,480
where you get that

970
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,640
prejudice against human squishiness.

971
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,600
Or

972
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,240
gas-based creatures

973
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,060
like those in the clouds

974
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,180
of Jupiter. Those

975
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,600
stink. God, they stink to

976
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,480
high heaven. To me.

977
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,580
But humans are extremely well-suited

978
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,560
for this universe. I'm

979
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,680
going to risk a little bit of bad luck

980
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,240
and point out something here.

981
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,580
That humans are right in

982
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,560
the middle of the possible

983
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,580
size anything can have in the

984
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,660
universe. They are right

985
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,940
at the point between

986
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,440
micro-smallness

987
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,560
and unthinkable hugeness.

988
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,460
They're among

989
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,660
the largest creatures on the planet.

990
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,360
Earth. All the animals

991
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,600
larger than people you can write on a single

992
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,640
sheet of paper. The ones that are smaller

993
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,760
take volumes to list.

994
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,260
And then if you

995
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,860
go on out through the nebulas

996
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,700
and gas clouds

997
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,660
and galaxies, you find

998
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,500
that as you

999
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,940
approach the super-large,

1000
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,460
you're also doing it from

1001
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,760
the middle point.

1002
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,700
The golden mean.

1003
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,360
Yes, those humans are

1004
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,140
placed there.

1005
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:52,240
And also the

1006
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,240
super-larges.

1007
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:18,460
ан

1008
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,060
underpinning this attitude is a proto-theological attitude,

1009
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,700
even a proto-Christian attitude,

1010
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,200
that there should be something devoid of contingency

1011
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,460
is not that remarkable.

1012
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,860
And so to the question, why?

1013
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,940
My answer is now and is always because.

1014
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,700
Accept it. Get used to it.

1015
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,820
You can deny it, but you who deny

1016
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,960
are part of the fabric,

1017
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,980
part of the Baroque complexity,

1018
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,380
and you might as well put your back into it.

1019
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,480
Thank you very much.

1020
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,560
Ah-huh!

1021
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,100
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

1022
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,300
A heen set.

1023
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,180
Dr. Howell from the 11th X-Day Drill Live Tapes.

1024
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,360
The background music here is by Speed Cave.

1025
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,360
And you are otherwise hearing hour of slack number 1170.

doing this classic by Debo.

A sweet romantic place

1044
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,220
Beautiful people everywhere

1045
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,900
The way they show their hair

1046
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,060
Makes me want to say

1047
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,440
It's a beautiful world

It's a beautiful world

1050
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,580
For you

1051
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,700
For you

1052
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,540
For you

1053
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,340
It's a wonderful time to be here

1054
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,900
It's nice to be alive

1055
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,240
Wonderful people everywhere

1056
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,880
The way they comb their hair

1057
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,400
Makes me want to say

1058
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,040
Wonderful people everywhere

1059
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,360
It's a wonderful place

Wonderful things

Wonderful things

1075
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,860
Boy and girl with a new clothes on

1076
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:49,320
And you can shake it to me all night long, yeah

1077
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,400
It's a beautiful world we live in

1078
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,060
A sweet romantic place

1079
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,240
Beautiful people everywhere

1080

The way they show their care

1081
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,060
Makes me want to say
