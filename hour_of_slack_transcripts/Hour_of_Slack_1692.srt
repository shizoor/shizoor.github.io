1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Uh, Puzzling Evidence presents the sub-G news show, Rocket Away.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,080
Here the show is lifting off.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,220
Yeah, like this.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,380
Okay, we've blown one caller right out of the DMA level one data bank.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,620
This show is lifting off.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,160
This act is immutably decreed.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,640
It was rehearsed by ye and me.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,140
A billion years before this ocean rolled.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,000
Millions and millions of years ago, giant dinosaurs roamed the earth.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,640
And the earth was without form and void.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,880
And darkness was on the face of the deep.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,700
And God created great whales.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,120
Look at them go.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,500
The white whale tasks me.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,960
Yet he is but a mask.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,880
It is the thing behind the mask I chiefly hate.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,300
The malignant thing that has plagued the threatened man since time began.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,320
Bob.

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,560
Bob Bob.

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,820
Bob Bob.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
Bob Bob.

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,300
Bob Bob.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,720
Bob Bob.

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,240
The thing that mauls and mutilates our race.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:25,800
Not killing us outright, but letting us live on with half a heart and half a lung.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,020
Bob.

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,180
Bob Bob.

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,440
Bob Bob.

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:29,980
Bob Bob.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Bob Bob.

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,000
Bob Bob.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,400
That whale is as big as a satellite.

33
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,580
It is a satellite.

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,880
It's a giant whale orbiting the earth at thousands of miles an hour.

35
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,460
You're just plain gloomy.

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,000
Moby Dick may be big, but he ain't that big.

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,340
I do not share Moby Dick.

38
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,680
I share the wrath of God.

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,380
The wrath of God?

40
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,040
Bob.

41
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,260
Bob Bob.

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,520
Bob Bob.

43
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,540
Bob Bob.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:57,980
Bob Bob.

45
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,420
Bob Bob.

46
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,480
Bob Bob.

47
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
I spit.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,020
my last breath at thee!

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
Thou dammit whale!

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,740
It gets dangerous sometimes.

51
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,760
You have to be careful.

52
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,360
Praise the G-d!

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,900
And welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of switch!

54
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,500
Is it liquid or is it sod?

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,240
Because further on in the thickness

56
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,320
there comes

57
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,860
the thinness.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,400
For without the thinness

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,660
we would not be able to appreciate the thickness of the pudding.

60
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,900
The pudding which cures.

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,440
What the hell do you think you're doing?

62
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,320
Dragging your butt through the day

63
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,980
selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,100
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them?

65
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,920
Tired of getting all of the guilt but none of the sex?

66
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,000
There is a simple answer dear friend.

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,980
A glowing beacon of slouching.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,740
A black amidst the turmoil and darkness.

69
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,280
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs the living slack master

70
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,900
and his church of the subgenius.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,900
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.

72
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,060
For Bob comes to justify our sins.

73
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,420
To unmask the conspiracy and to get us back

74
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,400
the slack they stole away.

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,200
It's us versus them.

76
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,320
Are you gonna fry in hell on earth alongside the pink boys?

77
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,040
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,980
and accept the fact that you're a slacker?

79
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,220
Put Bob into your mind.

80
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,960
Repent.

81
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,040
Quit your job.

82
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,200
Slack off.

83
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,020
And praise Bob.

84
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,480
Church of the subgenius eternal salvation

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,560
or triple your money back.

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,160
Friends, this hour of Slack number 1692

87
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,740
is a rerun of two old shows.

88
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,160
One from March 1991 and one from 2003.

89
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,620
Both of them during wars that appear to still be happening today.

90
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,900
So let's go back in time and get young.

91
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,020
Yes, sir.

92
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,220
Oh, yes, sir.

93
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,800
That was the subgenius MTV commercial.

94
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,460
With music by Mark Mothersbaugh.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,960
The music in the background right now is by Held Pokes.

96
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:09,480
And this is Hour of Slack number 887.

97
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,200
And most of those have been original shows.

98
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,900
We don't do reruns very often.

99
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,320
I was gonna do one this time.

100
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:25,560
And it's half a rerun from Hour of Slack 275 from March 1991.

101
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,960
Of great hysterical interest in the form of puzzling questions.

102
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,100
ave

103
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,300
Is Your electrical kg

104
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:47,240
Oh, yes.

105
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,700
Oh, and

106
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,280
both really amazing.

107
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,760
Just go to woody.com

108
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:54,760


109
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,000
Ire Band by Eric Bates.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000


111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,320
That is a裡面

112
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,360
Thank you Dave.

113
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,500
It just started spewing out of him, and I've never seen Chaz so excited, really.

114
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,280
It's great to see somebody's skills collide with their good mood.

115
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,440
It's kind of contagious.

116
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,520
So we get to hear that creative process as it happens.

117
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,960
But for the first part of the show, we go to war.

118
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,520
You're listening to Image Interpretation.

119
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,520
Reports are being disseminated now to our troops overseas.

120
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,820
Yeah, and you know how valuable those are.

121
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:35,580
Look at this blurry photograph that was obviously taken by the nose camera of an incoming guided spud missile.

122
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,760
That nose camera, we won't be able to pay for the print.

123
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,560
The heartbeat of America.

124
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,060
I hear that heartbeat now.

125
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,740
Yeah, I can.

126
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,600
It's supported by flash president in the background.

127
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,280
It makes me feel a little bit rocky.

128
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,140
Let me get a test tube, will you?

129
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,700
Well, Hal, let's walk on down Main Street here and see what's happening.

130
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,320
Well, there's Mr. Smith.

131
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,020
Hi, Mr. Smith.

132
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,780
Hiya.

133
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,220
Remember to keep up your observation in fields of fire.

134
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
It's a fine hot day.

135
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,780
It's a fine hot day here in Midvale.

136
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,640
I mean, Plasticville.

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,640
I mean, Spudville.

138
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,900
Where is this?

139
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,700
Oh, I see.

140
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,880
Pinochle, Connecticut.

141
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,900
I'd like to relieve myself here.

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,800
Oh, just go behind that bush while I pop open a tasty Budrow beer.

143
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,060
I feel relieved already.

144
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,660
Give me one of them Budrow beers.

145
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,180
Sure.

146
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,660
You know, these babies have only got 99 calories.

147
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,500
Mmm, yummy.

148
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,660
Then we're going to work on some of those MTD highlifts.

149
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,480
I need an HF processor to get out there.

150
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,200
Lord, those chiefins are going to win that war.

151
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,060
Yes, they will.

152
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,700
They'll win it for Budrow.

153
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:27,860
Budrow.

154
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:27,960
Budrow.

155
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,020
Budrow.

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:28,800


157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:28,800


158
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:28,800


159
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:28,800


160
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,120
Budrow.

161
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Budrow.

162
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,320


163
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,380
Budrow.

164
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,040
Budrow.

165
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,140
Budrow.

166
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,140


167
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,140


168
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,140


169
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,140


170
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,140


171
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,140


172
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,140


173
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,140


174
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,140


175
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,000
How are you doing?

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,300
How are you doing, Ronnie? How are you?

177
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,100
I'm doing good. God bless you and God bless America and our troops.

178
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,380
I got a question for Abdul here.

179
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,740
Just bear with me.

180
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,320
First of all, I want to know what the big stink is about the U.S.

181
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,820
killing 500 civilians who were at a military command and control center

182
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,340
when Saddam Hussein has been a way of life for Saddam for years.

183
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,920
What's been a way of life, sir?

184
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,680
He's killed a reported 7,000 civilians in Kuwait.

185
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,480
Don't you think Saddam has realized his butt is being kicked

186
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
and now he's looking for sympathy from the world?

187
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,020
Okay, all right, let him respond to that, sir, without the vernacular.

188
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,720
Please don't pick up the bad words, kick and other things.

189
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,740
These are uncivilized words.

190
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,720
There have been reports of 7,000 Kuwaitians.

191
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,140
That's not true. That's not true.

192
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
You better check your information.

193
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,520
You better learn your information before trying to spread out this information.

194
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,000
I could tell from the way you addressed me you are an ignorant man.

195
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,140
Our guest is Ambassador...

196
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,920
Ambassador Abdul Amir Al-Ambari, the hack ambassador to the United Nations,

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,520
will be born on March 30th.

198
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,520
And the boy is beginning to die.

199
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,680
I'm sure you'll be able to see the practice battle beginning.

200
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,900
Boy, if this is the practice battle, I'd hate to see the real battle.

201
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,140
Look at the blows given and received by the hearty spectacle.

202
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,440
This war is going to be won on the playing fields of...

203
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,020
Yeah, right. Just remember there's no hiding places in this war.

204
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,720
No, but they're all getting a hiding, though.

205
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,800
Look at those lively lads pound each other with pillows stuffed with styrofoam.

206
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,400
That's good training. It builds strong muscles and backs and helps morale.

207
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,460
And adds a clean, manly sweat to the early morning to flavor the day

208
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:49,640
with a blast of methane that'll guarantee you to flee the locker room in record time.

209
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,300
And here comes the women's brigade.

210
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,200
Let's not forget our fighting women in green and tan.

211
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,780
That's right.

212
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,520
It's an intimate situation there, folks.

213
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:07,760
And this is the Chadar squad, formed specifically as not to titillate the irritation of our fractious Saudi Arabian hosts.

214
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,540
Now, of course, the show comes in a number of variants, this one being the 4-slash-250 Armored Connoisseur Scout Vehicle.

215
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,180
Other shows include the IFV and the Fire Support Motor Carrier, the Missile Tank Destroyer, the Armored Ambulance.

216
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,700
This is the diesel-powered ride.

217
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,160
So we can force patients into any part of the battlefield with the Armored Ambulance.

218
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,760
Yeah.

219
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,260
Diesel ambulances all run on diesel power.

220
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,740
You know, you got some guy wounded and maybe he's losing his nerves, so you take him out into the battlefield and just drop him off in the Armored Ambulance.

221
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,060
Then his body is bagged for future reference.

222
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,360
Criminals, that sort of thing.

223
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,400
Please try it for freshness.

224
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,640
We can tell what they're like by using these remains.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,940
Of course, we don't want others, say, foreign nationals poaching on our preserve.

226
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,800
So we use the total filtration and ventilation circuit seats for the show.

227
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,580
Then pop, it's into the bag.

228
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,120
Wow.

229
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,080
This thing.

230
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,380
This thing's wonderful.

231
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:56,820
Yeah.

232
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,760
It's like, um, I'm normally here.

233
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,440
It works just like a stapler.

234
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,820
You see, it's got this little grip here.

235
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,120
Oh, yeah.

236
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,400
I like the way it just sort of wraps around my hands and allows my feet to tickle.

237
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,120
Boy, if that was a snake, it would have bit you.

238
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,920
Hey, it is a snake.

239
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,180
Get it off your hand.

240
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,120
Oh, I hope it didn't bite you.

241
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,300
I'm afraid he's been stung.

242
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:12,980
Oh, look at his face.

243
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,420
Oh, boy.

244
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,900
What a venomous sting.

245
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,740
Oh, yeah.

246
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,240
It's swelling.

247
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,600
No, that's another region.

248
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,460
Oh, it had a spill there for a while, though.

249
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,320
It's a swell, man.

250
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,480
Let's not move into the other regions because then war will be even worse.

251
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,660
Yes, uh, down in the...

252
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,040
Well, there are new regulations in what we can report on in this war.

253
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,400
...various electronic helpers which tell us how scary things are in the real world.

254
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,660
Oh, no, here come the overhead UFOs that are dispensing the Agent Green.

255
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,520
They're flying in a perfect formation.

256
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,720
Those are just little Arab guys.

257
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,400
I believe...

258
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,520
No, they're flying on their towels there.

259
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,080
Those are referred to as magic carpets out here, Ed.

260
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,640
Oh, of course.

261
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,140
It looks like a nice one there, perhaps an oriental rug variety.

262
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,720
It's an electromagnetic principle that allows these things to float and...

263
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,220
Oh, yeah.

264
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,300
...suspend it in midair.

265
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,460
But our scientists will soon have solved this mysterious puzzle and we'll be flying

266
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,880
on our own fleet of A4 stealth carpets.

267
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,900
It looks like a little enemy, guys, whichever enemy you wish.

268
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,260
Well, they've been working on these for a long time, Hal, but they've had difficulty

269
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,600
meeting the price fixing that the Pentagon had.

270
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:24,100
Well, I don't know if we can afford to discuss national security matters like this without

271
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,600
clearance on an open channel.

272
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,520
Well, they will have to speak in scramble.

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,300
It's Saudi duty time.

274
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,680
It's Saudi duty time.

275
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,900
Any of us with a little bit of Mediterranean juiciness knows that...

276
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,180
...hair is a symbol of macho manliness.

277
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,780
And the more I grow down my neck and down my back makes it easier for me to swim, climb

278
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,040
mountains, and run over people.

279
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,080


280
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,860
The scenery cover in fact allows for regular cross upwards spinning winds just by the

281
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,560
hair of a jealous polar bear, making it more attractive than the naturally

282
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,120
suitable concept of the stupid elephant.

283
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:23,920
People's attention span.

284
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,680
me that's sudden sincere and the enemies are kindly but they're dumb

285
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,760
at the zoo you talking to me

286
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,980
america is issuing issuing this following proclamation a dare and a challenge to the

287
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,920
rest of the world if you can stand up to those khaki flavored pants we're wearing right now

288
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,020
and that ak-47 we stole from the enemy guys which actually fires bad the m16s

289
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,160
if you can stand up like an erect penile front chin and you

290
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,040
to feed the animals at the zoo with your own

291
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,680
yeah feed the animals at the damn zoo or let them go or something you dumb

292
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,700
animals with your own limbless zoo you are a refreshing and figures

293
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,780
it's

294
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,680
there's many names

295
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,540
pornography

296
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,720
that's a that's a war is worse just for not

297
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,400
it is i'll tell you what i had a point real hard time renting my attention away from it

298
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:34,980

301
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,280
teat of horror

302
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,900
the sound print of the american

303
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,700
chicken

304
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,720
woo hoo hoo

305
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,180
there it is

306
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,180
bwaaah

307
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,180
ain't going down in no war

308
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,240
look at the flying light that guy's loose

309
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
look at the flying light that guy's loose

310
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,440
wow i'm gonna turn on the infrared fire control right now and barbecue this devil

311
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,660
and a little eighty by eighty square mile area

312
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,840
and a horrendous magnetic pulse

313
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,740
the American Chicken was marching

314
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,960
of course they had an awful big stick of it wasn't that afraid?

315
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,920
you had a stick of it wasn't that afraid?

316
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:21,940
you had a stick of it wasn't that afraid?

317
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,560
And they're trying to pull him away

318
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,600
Everyone in from each other has their stick in their Pres serving

319
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,240
this stuff in the zero to half loses

320
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,260
Go on bouncing off each other in a space not much bigger than

321
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,720
Yeah, I'm gonna have to get out of here soon you guys if I'm gonna go it's gonna prepare the poison rations for the board

322
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,180
You're over back at is probably the deadliest care you've ever been in your life

323
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,020
Fearless anything that moves don't have the right electronic code is vaporized

324
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,140
He's listening on the phone right now, yes

325
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,960
We want to be very much like a grand repute. Yeah, somebody just like him

326
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,080
I was wondering you can't really tell which ones puzzling evidence

327
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,620
He has 54 shelters and he could be on one of them

328
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,580
Stop it with his Jesus stuff at Bertha. Don't you realize for once and for all we killed that guy?

329
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,720
You want to talk about Kim passenger or something like that

330
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,820
Okay, but this Jesus stuff has got to stop him. Have you ever seen Jesus in a swimsuit?

331
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,640
Jesus real estate can find a birth in the desert

332
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,220
Landmark

333
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:03,840
But when Bob went over to the desert he brought a truckload a whole

334
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,360
C141 full of clappers, you know clap on clap. Yeah

335
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,560
And this is giving so much slack to the troops because all they got to do right now

336
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,960
They hooked him up to those Patriot missile launchers and all they got to do is sit in the tent

337
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,860
And when they hear that scud fly over they just got to clap their hands and the Patriot goes up and gets that scud

338
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,040
Total slack for the troops. It's fantastic. You know, that is one of the

339
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,800
You talk about advanced technology. Yeah, I mean the clapper is where it's at. We are Americans

340
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:42,200
Yes, we are our Americans and with our Yankee know-how and our American ingenuity

341
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:49,220
We can get all the slack you could ever ask for what's even more thing and I think we can get the earth first crowd on

342
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,000
This I think you know earth first in the eco terror is there about the worst force we've got in this country if we sent them

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,540
over there to the

344
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,100
The only thing is that we're not going to get them back

345
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,580
We're going to get them back

346
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,760
We're going to get them back

347
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,300
And with this oil spill going on and you know when they first invaded Kuwait the soldiers ate like 70% of the edible animals in the Kuwait

348
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,360
National Zoo you think they'd be over there right now

349
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,240
Trying to get these spiking me spiking the oil. They wouldn't be able to tree spike

350
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,080
But you know, they could spike the oil field scud launchers. Yeah, they wouldn't like that at all

351
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,300
Well, how come they're not in our all volunteer army?

352
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,840
Well, you know earth first is you know, they're their own little breed

353
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,040
But I think I think we could recruit them for this cause now that we've got the oil spill

354
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:36,860
They are their own little breed. I believe I mean these guys what's the name of that planet better than the special forces, right?

355
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:44,400
Yeah, but uh, well, you know even from Venus. I think we can even get the animal activists on this because I heard today

356
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,620
That in Iraq you cannot teach driver's education and sex education on the same day and that was

357
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Reverend rogue a Navy

364
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,700
whoever Dave you your rant, but I'm a theme of

365
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,260
God and

366
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,380
the Wild West

367
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,560
But also God being an extraterrestrial cowboy. Yeah, right

368
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:39,200
Wearing down whatever you know, you can go young a chandelier maybe a lonesome cow God turquoise buckles Bob

369
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,740
or something here on what a lizard skin boots Denver lizard skin boots

370
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,260
but uh

371
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,540
if

372
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,380
if

373
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,760
When I throw my hand up, that's the script that I go and stay away from your armpits

374
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,840
I got your gage that means that's the chorus coming in

375
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,720
So you can if you know you gotta stop for the course and then go preach all you want on the other part

376
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:11,100
Okay, what's the finger sign for speaking Portuguese? Okay, if I give it a Brazilian flavor if I hold up look hold up my finger green

377
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,460
Then yeah, just go for it, dude. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What if you bend over and spread them?

378
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,540
What does God really tell you cowboy and his favorite people of all that's it?

379
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:22,840
You know

380
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,660
He's on America's side because they were at a

381
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,600
year of Cowboys

382
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,040
Here after he got done, you know messing everything up

383
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,640
I was a big huge blue and then he finally got it right when he made the cowboy God

384
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,920
Finally got it, right?

385
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,320
What if God was Paul Bunyan?

386
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes, God is a cowboy

387
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,880
That means you're his little cow. You know where God's taking you

388
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,100

389

Well, don't you worry about that because he's taking good care of you along the way

392
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,660
He's fattening you up, baby. Yes, sir

393
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,020
You're God's little future hamburger, baby

394

He's gonna sell you the market get a good price

395
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:30,000
He's gonna get you down that trail that Wow tumbleweed ridden

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,120
Rattlesnake sneaking trail. Yes, God has got his

397
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,960
Chaps on that's all he's got on his naked naked

398
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,820
God must be a cowboy

399
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,580
He saw me in a dream

400
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,620
He rode in from my darkness onto my TV screen

401
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,940
From somewhere deep inside me my passion it ignites

402
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,820
That God must be a cowboy

403
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,560
Riding through the night

404
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,420
Yeah, guess we got the job. All right, we're driving them Brahma Bulls back on down to Laramie

405
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,520
Laramie's quite a few fathoms from this here reckoning. It looks like we're gonna have to follow the stars

406
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,420
But the stars we're gonna be following aren't your usual stars you see in the sky

407
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,680
There are the stars you see what God beat you over the head with that

408
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,820
Winchester rifle

409
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,600

416
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,600

Boys and girls, we're going to this slot.

I mean, heaven.

425
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,920
Heaven is where we're going at the end of this trail.

426
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,220

429
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,580
Hey, man. Hey, man.

430
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,400
You're on the wrong...

431
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,860
Hey, wait. You're going the wrong way.

432
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,240
Wait!

433
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,420
Oh! Wait!

434
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,840
Hey, man. You can't ride that bullseye.

435
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,280
What are you doing on the back of that...

436
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,120
Hey, man. Get over there.

437
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,400
Get on. Get on, little doggies.

438
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,700
God must be a bad man.

439
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,600
He's a long train.

440
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,320
We're almost there.

441
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,540
Hyah!

442
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,820
God must be a cowboy

443
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,660
Came to me in a dream

444
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,880
He rode in from my darkness

445
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,640
Onto my TV screen

446
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
But somewhere deep inside me

447
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,560
My passion did ignite

448
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,860
That God must be a cowboy

449
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,680
Riding through the night

450
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,520
Hey, uh, I see the fire's off in the distance

451
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,160
But that don't look like Laramie

452
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
It looks like...

453
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,540
It looks like Pokey Slim

454
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,240
That old Jimmy's campfire

455
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,600
Let's boozy on down

456
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,860
And have some beans and bread

457
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,120
Some cornbread

458
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,760
Oh, I love Johnny Cain

459
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,140
Hey, hey, let's all...

460
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,980
Just wait a minute

461
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,440
Wait a minute

462
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,200
Wait, wait, wait

463
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,420
Those are the fires!

464
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,280
What the hell?

465
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,220
The fires!

466
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,820
The fires!

467
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,920
My legs are on fire!

468
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,960
My legs are on fire!

469
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,980
Left them aboard, boys.

470
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

471
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,000
You're generous, you're generous!

472
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,640
So God must be a cowboy, came to me in a dream

473
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,660
He rode in from my darkness, onto my TV screen

474
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,580
Up somewhere deep inside me, my passion did ignite

475
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,660
That God must be a cowboy, riding through the night

476
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,820
In all my dreams, my dream what?

477
00:24:53,060 --> 00:25:00,560
God is a cowboy, a cowboy so big and big eyes

478
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,760
A bunch of dust and mud, you know where I can put this tripod peg leg I got riding there

479
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,660
In between my huggies, you know where there might be a Sioux City Salt Lake

480
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,980
I got some diseases for you and an infected amputation stump

481
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,040
It's hell

482
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:45,160
Welcome to the town of hell, population of 752

483
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,480
Never alone

484
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:47,640
Never alone

485
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,220
When you have Dave Brainerd, you're never alone

486
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,400
Did you hear that?

487
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,640
748

488
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,020
Dave, he just wants to get home

489
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,320
He's on the wrong goddamn planet, again

490
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,160
How many times has he got to go around that damn universe?

491
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,320
How many lives is he gonna go through before he gets it right?

492
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,020
No

493
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,660
The longer you drive a Brahma Bull, the more lives you're gonna go through

494
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,340
No

495
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,620
How your first life is that?

496
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,240
That trail drive on to Laramie

497
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,540
Your second life is on the way to St. Louis to pick up that check

498
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,000
Your third life is somewhere in Bangladesh eating skirkeys and kudel from off the floor

499
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,680
Your fifth life

500
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,640
You're a plastic model kid

501
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,560
You're a plastic surgeon and your middle eye, your third eye is rancid and rotten

502
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,940
And you need plastic surgery on your own psychic persona

503
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,460
Yeah

504
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,560
Can't go and get off that wheel that easy, Bart

505
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,000
When will you get off?

506
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,280
When will you get off?

507
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,820
Earth first, burn the other planets later

508
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,100
Evacuate

509
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,500
You're yoked

510
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,380
Or vacate the evacuation chamber

511
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,960
You're yoked

512
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,920
Like an ox to the wheel of karma

513
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,320
You can never, never escape

514
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,300
Unless

515
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,620
Unless

516
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,940
Unless

517
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,700
Unless

518
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,820
You will all be sick and rancid

519
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,520
And sick

520
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,560
And rancid

521
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,800
And sick

522
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,560
And rancid

523
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:19,680


524
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,420
Man I gotta put that in there, the opera

525
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,120
Yes

526
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,260
I'll reprise this music

527
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,080
Rock and stick

528
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,380
Yeah, okay great, killer, I need, they're good

529
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,700
Yeah, good, killer, that's another little part

530
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,520
There's lots of many pieces to the puzzle

531
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,260
Avanti Popola

532
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,720
Rock and stick

533
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,720
Rock and stick

534
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,720
Rock and stick.

535
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,900
We not ready.

536
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,840
Man, this is too good.

537
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,420
Ross.

538
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,600
This is great.

539
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,740
This is going to be the greatest rock opera ever written.

540
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,660
Rock and stick.

541
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,000
Oh, what happened to that?

542
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,260
Was that the taggy line?

543
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:04,840
Was that the hook?

544
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,180
Rock and stick.

545
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,880
Everything's made of rock or stick or both.

546
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,820
But what about the elements of fire and air and water?

547
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,760
Don't they consider into the facts?

548
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,200
Are they the ones that consider?

549
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,400
Damn, you're right.

550
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,660
We've been wrong for thousands of years.

551
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,360
Rocks and sticks.

552
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,420
Rocks and sticks.

553
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,660
Fire and ice.

554
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,480
Rain and skin.

555
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,780
Time, yes, time.

556
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,380
Bob and Connie.

557
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,860
The burning of your...

558
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,200
Your hair.

559
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,220
As you dance in the air.

560
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,300
For 30 bucks can I go into space?

561
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm afraid not, my friend.

562
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:55,940
No.

563
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,840
No.

564
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:58,720
No.

565
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,560
No.

566
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,300
No.

567
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,320
We are already in space.

568
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,420
We're already there.

569
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,940
Get on this ship.

570
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,380
We're gonna make everything beautiful for you.

571
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,100
To serve man is our only purpose.

572
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,120
Come on.

573
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,500
Go with us.

574
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,580
We only want to help.

575
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,140
Yes.

576
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,340
Now, if they were to solve all the Earth's problems, see?

577
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,980
They could take out, like, you know, they could just write it off.

578
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,800
You know, build a red-letter list, you know, and go write down,

579
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,720
down the list, starting one, hunger, poverty, so on and so forth.

580
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,220
But now they don't want to do it, see, because you know why?

581
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,880
Because it's the banks.

582
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,860
It's the big banks and it's the big oil companies, see?

583
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,600
And they got all the money.

584
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,700
And they got all the money while you got all the sh...

585
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,800
You ain't got nothing, see?

586
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,000
Hey, you remember that song?

587
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,100
It's a sign, me old world over.

588
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,060
World over, it's a sign.

589
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,400
Rich man takes a credit and a poor man takes a blame.

590
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,840
You remember that song, don't you, see?

591
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,720
It's true.

592
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,320
It's...

593
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
It was Dave...

594
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,780
That was the time he played Tinkerbell.

595
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,500
Tinkerbell and Broadway.

596
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,760
Tinkerbell?

597
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,520
Yeah, Dave made a living.

598
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,020
Lonesome cowboy Dave did not, just Dave.

599
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,720
I was the little girl with the sparkly hair and the waxy blue eyes.

600
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
For $30.

601
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:23,960
No.

602
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,200
No.

603
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,120
They gave him $30 too.

604
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,240
No.

605
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,040


606
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,100
No.

607
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,760
No.

608
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,260
No.

609
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,340
He couldn't even pay his rent.

610
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,520
His little kitty cats were going hungry.

611
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,760
He had to go out in the street and break up pets.

612
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:49,100
He had to go to the

613
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,100


614
00:30:49,780 --> 00:31:00,060
He had to go to the hospital.

615
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,200
I went to

616
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:30,040
You got us all satisfying?!

617
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,040


618
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,040


619
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,320
Thanks, Father.

620
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,820
Help an old altar boy.

621
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,180
What should I spend it on?

622
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,760
To charity, bug porn, or salvation?

623
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,820
I want to go into outer space and destroy the world for only $30.

624
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,080
Yeah, $30.

625
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,580
I could get bug porn instead, or I could give it to that bum over there.

626
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,840
It won't shut up.

627
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Squire, look for grand there.

628
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,120
Decisions, decisions.

629
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,300
I got $30.

630
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,180
You can loan up.

631
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,840
Poor, poor man.

632
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,340
$30 silver?

633
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,040
$30 silver.

634
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,360
I need your wallet away.

635
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,200
I need slack.

636
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,800
I need slack.

637
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,760
I need slack.

638
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,500
I need money.

639
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,800
No.

640
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,060
No.

641
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,420
No slack?

642
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,220
We have bent the universe to our own shaping.

643
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,320
We have succeeded where no one has succeeded.

644
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,500
But has it given us slack?

645
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,580
That is the question.

646
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,320
Are we now slack itself?

647
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,400
Has the idea somehow vanished into our consciousnesses?

648
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,100
If this is slack, then I don't want to live any longer.

649
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:39,980
Has the human race come to a realization through their science that saves them from killing each other?

650
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,720
Do they see through all their visions?

651
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,000
Do they ever learn?

652
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,820
It is your instinct to destroy each other.

653
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,800
See through the vision and through the veil of maya.

654
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,620
Continue.

655
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,940
Do your focus beyond the veil.

656
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,220
You will awake.

657
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,140
The sleeper will awake.

658
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,060
And when he does, he will have one miserable rise on his tokens.

659
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,340
He will require all kinds of powders and ointments and squeakies and other things to make his time.

660
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,300
Unguants?

661
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,680
He will need unguants.

662
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,320
Unguants?

663
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,540
He will need unguants.

664
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,140
He will need many, many unguants and salves.

665
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,020
Is life then just a path to the grave littered with medicines?

666
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,740
And vials and old pills used to keep you going?

667
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,740
Stained diapers.

668
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,220
One more miserable day.

669
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:34,860
Baby powder.

670
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,040
Old pills.

671
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,480
Used.

672
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,040
One more.

673
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,140
Unused condoms.

674
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,760
Tasteless.

675
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,860
Another pill.

676
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,280
Dead flowers bought from a gypsy lady.

677
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,220
Everything will be okay.

678
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:57,800
I would like to place my application at the $40 window for my medical bill.

679
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,020


680
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,020


681
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,020


682
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,820
Go right ahead.

683
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,440
I have heard that the salve will turn into many forms.

684
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,400
Thirty days.

685
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,660
Thirty dollars.

686
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,640
Thirty miles to the graveyard.

687
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,240
Now that's a dollar a day that you can part with, my friends.

688
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,720
That is a dollar a day that will go in the right direction.

689
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,520
So far today you've been going-

690
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,640
Slack, it's only a dollar a day.

691
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,160
Only one dollar a day, friends.

692
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,840
You've been going in the wrong direction.

693
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,820
I can see your sphincter muscle twinkling and twinking.

694
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,020
I can see your left eye dancing around.

695
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,700
You're nervous.

696
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,120
You need help.

697
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,980
You need relaxation.

698
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,320
And what will bring you to the bottom of the conundrum?

699
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,720
A dollar?

700
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,120
That's right.

701
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,840
No, no.

702
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,600
Thirty times that dollar.

703
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,580
One for each day of the month.

704
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,340
You'll give me thirty dollars?

705
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,840
I will give you thirty dollars and you will have slack and the world is at your fingertips.

706
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,360
No!

707
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,480
I never met a preacher like you before, sir.

708
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,320
And you never will again for I am not a preacher, my friend.

709
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,920
I am the red dot in the middle of your forehead.

710
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,120
I am burning a hole deep back through your corpus callosum.

711
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,480
I am on my way to you.

712
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:55,940
It hurts!

713
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,140
It hurts!

714
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:56,720
It hurts!

715
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,120
Get out of my head!

716
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,660
Preacher man!

717
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,520
Okay, we're going to be moving you in and out this time.

718
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,040
Every bad thing that ever happened was a result of experimenting.

719
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,700
Experimenting again.

720
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,420
Yes, we were experimenting.

721
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,500
May the good Lord take a liking to you and blow you up real soon.

722
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,280
Ah, well that's past the end for you, you hideous little leprechaun.

723
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:26,740
What an interesting idea.

724
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,200
What a, uh, so.

725
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:27,860
I'm going to go and get my

726
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,880
I'm going to go and get my

727
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:27,880


728
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:27,880


729
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,720
You guys think you can get the perimeter fire to back down enough for me to get out of the station?

730
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,220
Just wanted you to think about it.

731
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,460
Hey, this is the end.

732
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,680
A lot of people are suffering as we speak.

733
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,700
The Navy versus the Leprechaun.

734
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,500
The latest howlerious sensation from Walt Disney Productions.

735
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,120
Howlerious?

736
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:51,800
You'll howl, you'll roar as the U.S. Navy takes on one particularly feisty little leprechaun, Samus McGregor.

737
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,780
Showing off shows down here.

738
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,360
Oh, all those ships, they're firing at me.

739
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll have to show them some of my evil magic.

740
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,680
Yes, it was a leprechaun from Scotland.

741
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,820
Pink moons, orange stars, green clovers.

742
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,420
Pink intestines, pink moons, bend over.

743
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,100
Blue, blue smart bombs.

744
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,180
And pink hearts all over the landscape.

745
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,680
Okay.

746
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,840
All right, take care, take charge, and take off.

747
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,500
Yeah.

748
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,340
And so, now we're going to get down and dirty.

749
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,720
We're going to do the evil show.

750
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,200
In the last few moments of our program, we're going to

751
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,320
Hey!

752
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,140
We think nothing but corruption of the tomb.

753
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,620
Come down to L.A., April Fool's Day.

754
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,740
L.A.

755
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,840
April Fool's Day?

756
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,740
St. Stupid, we got St. Stupid up here.

757
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:33,840
Home parade.

758
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,540
Okay, the day after April Fool's Day, then.

759
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,200
I'm afraid we'll all be radioactive slag on that day.

760
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,920
What's happening then?

761
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,280
Oh, a big show to end all World War III shows.

762
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,900
How many times have I heard that before?

763
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,140
A few or four.

764
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,880
Yes, so long, Mom.

765
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,060
I'm off to drop the bomb.

766
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,360
Don't wait up for news.

767
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,240
Oh.

768
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,900
Oh.

769
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,200
Because while you're sweating your swell to down there in your shell, I'm going to

770
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,740
do the one and two.

771
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,580
Do we get to, since we paid for those bombs, do we get to keep the shells and the crew with

772
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:02,700
them?

773
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,140
It's part of the old, same shell thing.

774
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,100
We could put flowers in them and use them as candle holders and stuff.

775
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,640
If you can use anything as anything, you'll be ahead of the game when most of your fellow

776
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,160
beings are inert protoplasmic material.

777
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,180
Well, yeah, I've got, I'm starting a horde, so.

778
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,600
It's a weighty responsibility.

779
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,040
Remember to keep fresh water and 200 pounds of water in your hands.

780
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,040


781
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,040


782
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,040


783
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,040


784
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,800
Thanks for reading that.

785
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,960
Thanks for that.

786
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,560
Bye, Dad.

787
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,740
Bye, Dad.

788
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:40,740


789
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:40,740


790
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:40,740


791
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:40,740


792
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,620
But they'll make it stop.

793
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:43,620


794
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,200
Iки has been on a mission recently, and that's to cause a great deal to happen.

795
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,260
Watch it sometime, and I'll show you why.

796
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:46,760
But you're watching Matt Mc spoonful of LATIC allies in the show with Mike Venture, who

797
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:46,760


798
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:46,940
Now we're having to see Mark build something from his master plant.

799
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,320
We're going to see how deep the Afford-UM plant is going to be after we finish each

800
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,500
tok arm.

801
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,020
Well, we're working to coated M Weswe Querras off with the added M T 1992 quadrupole

802
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,020


803
00:37:54,020 --> 00:38:01,720
Since we like to have our food stuffed into little bottles, we call the atomic bomb instant death.

804
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,860
Some people call it instant economic reform.

805
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,140
Eternal father strong to save, whose arm hath bound the restless wave,

806
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,040
who bids the mighty ocean deep his own appointed limits keep.

807
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,600
And here we go.

808
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,780
Thank you for calling operations removal.

809
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,200
Don't mention it.

810
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,500
If you have discovered that this is World War III, press 1 now.

811
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,220
If you find that your potatoes are burning, press 2 now.

812
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,040
If you are not already in Texas, press 3 now.

813
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,760
Which one do I press?

814
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,260
This is happening too fast for me.

815
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,740
If you have pressed too many buttons, press 1 now.

816
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,840
Hey, get your finger off that.

817
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,320
That's my phone.

818
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,360
Isn't that the one I pressed?

819
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,800
Stop it.

820
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,160
Get it out.

821
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,040
Hey, quit it.

822
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,800
Give a guy a break.

823
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,240
If your fingers are losing control, press 5 now.

824
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,200
What'd she say?

825
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,440
Did she say something?

826
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,560
This is out of control.

827
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,080
Press this one down here.

828
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,100
No one's pressed this one down.

829
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,160
If you are such genius, press 0 now.

830
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,600
Well, that zeroed the whole thing out of existence.

831
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,520
Well, that was, uh, yeah, that can happen.

832
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,040
It's an occupational hazard.

833
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,440
And as we contemplate this rather rocky moment in our nation's history,

834
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,120
let us recall that what could have been done was not done.

835
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,380
And what should have been done is not being done.

836
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,560
Yes, it's a brave moment.

837
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,460
From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of, well, the Persian Gulf.

838
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,560
You sent the hour of slack over there, haven't you?

839
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,160
Oh, sure, yeah.

840
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,400
We sent the one you played tonight over there already.

841
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:41,860
Uh-huh.

842
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,900
Yeah, it was great.

843
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,560
I'm sure it'll really give them a charge and make them feel...

844
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,600
The hordes of subgenius military over there right now.

845
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,100
All right.

846
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,580
You got some guys that are, uh, that are crossing the border right now?

847
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,340
Uh, I don't know about that.

848
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,900
But, uh, I know Bob is.

849
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,540
He's heading there.

850
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,800
He's got a frenzy on him, you know.

851
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,560
Well, he's already...

852
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,320
I mean, I saw the headline last week.

853
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,820
It said, uh, commandos deep in Iraq.

854
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,200
And I figured he was one of them.

855
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,260
Oh, well, obviously.

856
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,260
You know, I mean, he's probably already in the bunker.

857
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,800
He's the only man lucky enough to get past all that crap.

858
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,620
He's probably already in the bunker.

859
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,960
Yeah, or at least he's halfway down through the sand.

860
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,320
For sure.

861
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,260
No, he's probably in there.

862
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,400
He's got his own little hideaway.

863
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,660
I hope he brought that, that, um, that wizzo drill attachment for his pipe to get through the, uh, the cement barrier to actually get in the bunker.

864
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,220
Look, you know, I'm not worried.

865
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,160
And giving power and opportunity to the individual.

866
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,200
And Bob is that individual.

867
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,120
He has the power and he is taking the opportunity.

868
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,120
That's right.

869
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,540
He is grabbing hold of destiny and he is making it his own.

870
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,120
Yeah, I do wonder about the...

871
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,900
the military subgenius.

872
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,620
Yeah, well, they are real and, I mean, we are definitely the minority among the subgenius.

873
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,180
Yeah.

874
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,480
But, you know, well...

875
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,740
Just wondering how secretive it has to be.

876
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,700
Slack is a very dangerous thing in the military.

877
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,160
We prefer to skate.

878
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,500
Yeah?

879
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,660
Yeah, skating is...

880
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,860
I mean, slack could kill you.

881
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,320
Right.

882
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,560
I've got pictures that could...

883
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,300
Well, that's what I told you.

884
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,020
Slack can undermine defense, you know.

885
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,480
It could.

886
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,880
And so we prefer to skate.

887
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,180
It's just a much safer...

888
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,000
safer thing for us to be doing.

889
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,260
We know for a fact now that Bob is there.

890
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,820
Yeah, Bob is there.

891
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,220
Right.

892
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,880
I mean, once they...

893
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,080
My messages was a little bit frazzled.

894
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,040
But, you know, recruiters...

895
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,480
recruiters never tell the truth.

896
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,140
And I got that...

897
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,540
that thing about Bob going to boot camp from a recruiter, obviously.

898
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,260
Nobody ever tells the truth.

899
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,080
And especially recruiters.

900
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,800
And, uh...

901
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,900
You've been listening to...

902
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,320
uh...

903
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,740
Dad's New Slacks.

904
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,640
Intercut with KPFA and KZSU.

905
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,820
Papa Joe Mama with, uh...

906
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,540
puzzling evidence and doctors.

907
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:56,980
Puzzling evidence and doctors.

908
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,940
Oh, oh, oh.

909
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,280
Hey, the rotating rack holds rounds and collars

910
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,700
ready to be hand-loaded into the show.

911
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,900
Please stand by.

912
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,500
Here you can see 25-inch mounts on the Battleship Iowa.

913
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,020
Please stand by.

914
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,880
We are experiencing technical difficulties.

915
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,080
Please stand by.

916
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,260
We are adjusting our MK-37 GFCS with MK-25 radar available.

917
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,060
Right on.

918
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,060
Don't go away.

919
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,860
Please stand by.

920
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,020
Hey.

921
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,220
They're standing on my foot.

922
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,180
Uh, oh, pardon me.

923
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,940
Oh, my gosh.

924
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,680
Tell that guy to stand somewhere else.

925
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,860
And now the 40-millimeter grenade launcher is standing too close to me.

926
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,840
The MK-19.

927
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,280
Too much.

928
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,920
Boy, yeah, put your weaponry away.

929
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,760
This is, uh...

930
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,080
This is for decent folks.

931
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
This is, uh...

932
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,360
What about my MK-1 Mark Zero here?

933
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,180
Throw a towel over it.

934
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,240
I just gotta show everybody.

935
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,360
I'm so proud of it.

936
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,920
You may explode all over the microphone.

937
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,660
It fires 20 rounds a minute.

938
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,540
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

939
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,700
Okay, Romeo.

940
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,600
But what are you gonna do?

941
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,200
When the enemy comes straight at you with his, uh, his teeth glittering and his bayonet, uh...

942
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,340
Yeah.

943
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,800
That's about it for you, kid.

944
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,140
You're gonna...

945
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,180
You're dead now.

946
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,220
You bought that bullet bike.

947
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,000
You had to get that crotch rocket motorcycle, didn't you?

948
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,400
You had to go bungee jumping, didn't you?

949
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,720
You had to.

950
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,080
Shit.

951
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,100
You had to.

952
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,900
You had to go skydiving.

953
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,520
You had to get on that entrance ramp.

954
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,120
Yeah.

955
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,640
You had to get on that highway.

956
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,220
You had to come to Axtech.

957
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,400
You had to walk outdoors that day when the meteor shower happened.

958
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,060
That's right.

959
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,540
You had to look into the sun when they told you not to.

960
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,640
You had to take that pill.

961
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,640
Mm-hmm.

962
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,820
Now what are they doing?

963
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,960
Now you're just laying there.

964
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,760
Hey, hey, get me up, man.

965
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,160
Hey, this wasn't supposed to be how it was supposed to happen, man.

966
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,820
I'm too young.

967
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,740
I'm too young to sleep tonight.

968
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,520
Well, we tried to tell you.

969
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,480
We tried to get you to come to Axtech.

970
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,240
They always say, but I'm too young.

971
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,080
Yeah.

972
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,580
It doesn't make any sense.

973
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,880
It's not my time.

974
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,160
Right, yeah.

975
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,340
Never, never, ever.

976
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,960
That's why you gotta...

977
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,300
I was supposed to do such great things.

978
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,840
You've got to live every day as if it were your last day,

979
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,080
which might mean sitting around watching TV all day.

980
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,620
I don't know.

981
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,260
It kind of depends.

982
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:22,920
Yeah.

983
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,800
It might mean finishing that rock opera.

984
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,900
My suicide from the valley.

985
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,420
I hear the muffled cries of them poor people that I left behind.

986
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:41,040
And I, I don't want to sleep no more.

987
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,920
Don't close the door.

988
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,000
Man, this won't stop playing.

989
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,740
Oh, you put me awake and shake me.

990
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,860
So anyway...

991
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,860
Wake me, shake me.

992
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,260
Wake me, shake me.

993
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:52,480
Yeah.

994
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:52,780
Yeah.

995
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,740
So you didn't go last year.

996
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,780
You haven't been there ever.

997
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:02,520
You never went out to the campground where the people are jumping around naked, have you?

998
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,040
Because society told you it was bad.

999
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,860
I'll go to the end of the world next year.

1000
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,400
I'll take my clothes off next time.

1001
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,100
There'll always be an X day.

1002
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,640
They're not going to crack down on stuff like that.

1003
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,320
I don't want to sleep no more.

1004
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,300
I don't want to sleep no more.

1005
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,420
Chaz, we got a somber part.

1006
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,460
Uh oh.

1007
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,160
Friends...

1008
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,380
We're now in fucking D minor mode.

1009
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,880
Now I have to get somber.

1010
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,700
Oh, sorry.

1011
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:36,820
Well, but...

1012
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,240
There's a somber music we can possibly get.

1013
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,360
But Mark, you pointed it out.

1014
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,200
Friends...

1015
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,720
Mr. Rogers died.

1016
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,680
Mr. Rogers died.

1017
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,780
He got off.

1018
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:50,900
He got off.

1019
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,580
But friends, I'm not going to lie.

1020
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:52,580


1021
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:52,580


1022
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:52,580


1023
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:52,580


1024
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:52,580


1025
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:52,580


1026
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:52,580


1027
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,480
Is there any more sure sign that the end times are near?

1028
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,480
When Mr. Rogers leaves the neighborhood...

1029
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,540
We still got Paul and Ringo.

1030
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,240
We still got Paul and Ringo.

1031
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,020
We could bring the Beatles together again with only two more.

1032
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,800
Well, friends, some say death is great.

1033
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,620
It's just another doorway of, you know, it's a new stage.

1034
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,000
Although I've noticed that none of the people who've said that have actually tried it yet.

1035
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,580
And that those who have tried it, they've never tried it.

1036
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:27,180
But those who finally did try it suddenly became very quiet about how great it is.

1037
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,880
So what are they trying to hide?

1038
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:29,440


1039
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,320
Yeah, you get paranoid about that kind of thing.

1040
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,920
But luckily, Bob speaks to the dead.

1041
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:42,060
Yes, Bob can communicate to the dead via the X-Grow Plasm.

1042
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,040
He divines what the dead are saying by studying their droppings.

1043
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,700
Spirit droppings.

1044
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,460
Spirit spore.

1045
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,180
Specter spore.

1046
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,560
Also known as P-Score.

1047
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,600
And he's also known as the Packing Peanuts.

1048
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,580
If you've ever seen those, that's what those are.

1049
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,020
Bob can spread those out and see the future in those little ghost turds.

1050
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:09,120
As Mr. Sister said, I may have laid myself to waste, but Bob recycled me.

1051
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,680
Now what time is it?

1052
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,540
Anybody got...

1053
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,880
This watch is probably...

1054
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,800
What time is it a watch?

1055
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,720
No.

1056
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,100
It's the end time.

1057
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,020
That sniper guy.

1058
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,780
Or those two sniper guys.

1059
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,960
Well, first off, they broke the first rule of sniper club.

1060
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,340
Talk about it.

1061
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,060
Yeah, they broke the first rule of sniper club.

1062
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,940
But friends, it is.

1063
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,380
Sometimes you think this has got to be the end.

1064
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:45,380
The end of so many cultures have predicted it.

1065
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,580
And they crack down on head shops.

1066
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,400
Tommy Chong's website is a terrorist now.

1067
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,640
And you have to wonder, there's smallpox shots.

1068
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,480
Suddenly, people are getting smallpox shots again.

1069
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,660
What nano-box lurked in those smallpox shots?

1070
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,620
What little tiny tape recorders or tracking devices might be in there?

1071
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,300
You don't know.

1072
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,880
Peeing in jars.

1073
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,160
Breathalyzer tests.

1074
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,680
Votalyzer tests.

1075
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,320
Actually, I guess the moral of this whole thing is fuck voting, let's roll.

1076
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,920
But they have a machine.

1077
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,380
They even have a machine now that can tell when you're thinking.

1078
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,320
It's called the television.

1079
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,020
And when it's off, you're guilty.

1080
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,040
The end times, friends.

1081
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,960
The end times.

1082
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,240
I was a couple of weeks ago.

1083
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,360
The King, President, Emperor George was on TV.

1084
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,180
And he actually said, I think I heard him say the phrase,

1085
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,800
The goal of this war is peace.

1086
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,360
The goal of this war is peace.

1087
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,940
War is peace.

1088
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,160
Wow.

1089
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,360
Back in high school, they made me read this George Orwell book called 1984.

1090
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,340
Suddenly, war is peace and work is slack and freedom is slavery and so forth.

1091
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,140
And I thought, well, I guess 1984 was 19 years late.

1092
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,240
Well, there's a good side to that.

1093
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:15,940
Praise Bob.

1094
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:21,120
That means X Day takes place July 5th, 2017.

1095
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,360
And Bob said, the world will end July 5th, 1998.

1096
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,560
And that gives us a little hint.

1097
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,140
The wrath of God.

1098
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:33,780
Bob.

1099
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,720
Bob.

1100
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,020
Bob.

1101
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,540
Bob.

1102
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,000
Bob.

1103
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,280
Bob.

1104
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:37,620
Bob.

1105
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:37,860
Bob.

1106
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,020
Bob.

1107
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,140
Bob.

1108
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:38,360
Bob.

1109
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,280
Bob.

1110
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:53,900
Bob.

1111
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:58,980
Bob.

1112
00:49:59,020 --> 00:49:59,440
Bob.

1113
00:49:59,440 --> 00:49:59,720
Bob.

1114
00:49:59,720 --> 00:49:59,920
Bob.

1115
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1116
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1117
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1118
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1119
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1120
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1121
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1122
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1123
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1124
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


1125
00:49:59,980 --> 00:49:59,980


1126
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000


1127
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000


1128
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000


1129
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000


1130
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000


1131
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,200
Bob.

1132
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:00,640
Bob.

1133
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:00,660


1134
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:00,660


1135
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:00,660


1136
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:00,660


1137
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,580
Bob.

1138
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,700
Bob.

1139
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,900
Laughs the best answer to all the strange in life.

1140
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,040
Yeah, well, just go ahead and chuckle away, mister.

1141
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,240
I don't hear God laughing.

1142
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,340
You will, once he sees your haircut.

1143
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,660
That which does not kill us leaves us alive.

1144
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,260
Alive.

1145
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,920
But maims and cripples us for life.

1146
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,780
Yes, he does.

1147
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,140
Yes, he has his way with us.

1148
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,820
Yes, he loves his little painy wane.

1149
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,420
He's the one feeling the painy wane.

1150
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,460
He's the one sucking the pain.

1151
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,600
He's much like Cthulhu and H.P. Lovecraft.

1152
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,740
He enjoys the suffering of others.

1153
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,320
It brings balm to him.

1154
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,680
I like how the brain pulses.

1155
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,260
It's the balm, man. It's the balm.

1156
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,880
Is that a balm or an oinkment?

1157
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,500
It's a boinkment.

1158
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,360
Oink, oink, oinkment.

1159
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,880
It's a slavvy boinkment.

1160
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,820
Once again, you've been sitting in there.

1161
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,600
Slavvy boinkment.

1162
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,220
Once again, you've been sitting there for the last two hours thinking the radio was on.

1163
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,220
No, man, the radio's not.

1164
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,220
It's the voices in your own head.

1165
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,260
Those many, many, many voices.

1166
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,200
But you don't listen too carefully.

1167
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,340
They will drive you mad.

1168
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,480
Rewind, rewind.

1169
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,680
The Pornere Loco.

1170
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,720
The Pornere Loco de todo.

1171
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,840
Are you listening, sheeple?

1172
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,760
Are you listening to my voice?

1173
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,460
Are you listening?

1174
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,000
You'd better unscrew yourself.

1175
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,420
Help me escape.

1176
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,400
Unscrew yourself from the system.

1177
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,420
Unscrew yourself from the man.

1178
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,520
You have a brain?

1179
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,600
Unscrew yourself from the mountain that is humanity.

1180
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,920
They make me say things.

1181
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,720
They make me do things.

1182
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,260
Help me escape.

1183
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,220
We are only here to help.

1184
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:10,700
I can think. I have a brain.

1185
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,120
Partners away from Stang's throat.

1186
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,280
They make me do things.

1187
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:14,760
Leave him alone.

1188
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,460
They make me do things.

1189
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,600
He's a price specimen.

1190
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,020
They make me say things.

1191
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,280
They make me say things.

1192
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,640
They make me do things.

1193
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,560
They make me do things.

1194
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,500
Open the cage.

1195
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,480
Please.

1196
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,300
They make me say things.

1197
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,300
In the most colloquial way, we can say that God makes us do all kinds of funny things.

1198
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,680
I know what I'm saying.

1199
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:44,080
And one of the funniest things he's made us do so far is to pretend a belief into our

1200
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:51,380
belief systems that somehow he, she, I, we, they, and it are all one with a capital O

1201
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,540
and a capital zero.

1202
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,480
Zero.

1203
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,120
Zero.

1204
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:54,780
Zero.

1205
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:55,100
Zero.

1206
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:55,600
Zero.

1207
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,640
Zero.

1208
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:56,960
Zero.

1209
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:57,980
Zero.

1210
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,480
Zero.

1211
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:02,840


1212
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,600
Zero.

1213
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:04,540


1214
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:04,540


1215
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,640
Zero.

1216
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:05,640


1217
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:05,660
Zero.

1218
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1219
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1220
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1221
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1222
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1223
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1224
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1225
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1226
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1227
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,660


1228
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:12,700
You and me tranquility a little hiding place rock for two on the way to the moon from

1229
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:20,320
the planet Venus if we go right in a dot night sky wouldn't be the first I know what place

1230
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:33,900
where we can go I think you really are to take it to stay by hand and take me to your

1231
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,760
Neverland.

1232
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,180
Every now and then I dream at night

1233
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,840
A lot of space

1234
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,720
For the worlds and fifty-foot girls

1235
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,240
A little hiding place

1236
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,100
Black lagoons and far-off moons

1237
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,800
On this silent earth

1238
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,180
There's just nothing to damn to

1239
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,280
On the planet of our birth

1240
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,540
I know a place where we can go

1241
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,980
I think you really ought to know

1242
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,520
To take me there, just take my hand

1243
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,080
And lead me to your Neverland

1244
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,180
I know a place where we can go

1245
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,700
I think you really ought to know

1246
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,220
To take me there, just take my hand

1247
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,660
And lead me to your Neverland

1248
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,680
Yeah

1249
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,800
Every now and then I dream at night

1250
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,640
Living in the stars

1251
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,200
Living in the stars

1252
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:01,520
Living in the stars

1253
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,020
You and me and destiny

1254
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,120
Rockin' rockin' to Mars

1255
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,960
In our dreams we have the means

1256
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,680
Travel to the planets

1257
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,180
Strap us in and light the fuse

1258
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,100
And grab the throttle and jam it

1259
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,320
I know a place where we can go

1260
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,880
I think you really ought to know

1261
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,320
To take me there, just take my hand

1262
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,740
And lead me to your Neverland

1263
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,400
Yeah

1264
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:32,400


1265
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:33,920
Let's go baby

1266
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,700
Oh yeah

1267
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,840
So Bob is a real god

1268
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,180
Bob is a sex god too I want to point out at this time ladies

1269
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,060
So if anyone is interested in Bob as a sex god

1270
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,260
You can write in for the special sex god material

1271
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,440
To P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214

1272
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,060
And you find out how you can have endless sex

1273
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,840
And endless slack through

1274
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,720
P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214

1275
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,920
The church of the subgenius

1276
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,940
That sounds, you know, exactly what most

1277
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:04,900
What churches should be

1278
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,180
Set up

1279
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:05,380
Set up

1280
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:05,700
Set up

1281
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:05,900
Set up

1282
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,080
Set up

1283
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,780
You gotta pay your money and go to Brushwood

1284
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,740
And get into that swimming pool with Dr. Lagoon

1285
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
God is coming

1286
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,960
Get yourself baptized

1287
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,120
God's looking for you

1288
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,180
July 5th weekend this year, Brushwood, New York

1289
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,220
You got a date with God this July 5th, buddy

1290
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,220
Sister

1291
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,880
Sir ma'am

1292
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,960
Subhuman

1293
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,260
Subhuman

1294
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,300
He's got a date.

1295
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:31,920
He's got it.

1296
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:32,480
He's got it.

1297
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,640
He's penciling in.

1298
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,360
Baby.

1299
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,200
He's scheduled.

1300
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,220
For you.

1301
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,500
You beast.

1302
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:45,100
Are you ready to meet your maker, little doggy?

1303
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,220
You ready?

1304
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:51,700
You ready to make the end of the trail, huh, little doggy?

1305
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,500
You ready to meet the cowboy god?

1306
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,600
That's right.

1307
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,960
Are you ready to ride off into the night?

1308
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,300
Yee-haw.

1309
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,880
Out of the cowboys.

1310
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,180
Yee-haw.

1311
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:05,780
Ow.

1312
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,080
Them horses with their brains still on fire.

1313
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,920
I am the never-understanding favorite cowboy.

1314
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,300
I think backwards.

1315
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,440
I do it for fun.

1316
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,560
Your lips.

1317
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,720
I'll suck my triceratops.

1318
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,020
Your lips moving, but I can't hear what you're saying, private.

1319
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,920
It is a myth that lived for thousands of years.

1320
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,320
The cowboy god.

1321
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,120
My matriarch is a coward.

1322
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,680
He takes his big chaps on.

1323
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,500
He takes the women down.

1324
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,700
Oh, that's for sure.

1325
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,040
Why?

1326
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,380
Hey, well, you can go to www.subgenius.com and find out all about that.

1327
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,200
But God had no bod, and so he was a sod.

1328
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:49,540
And you can go to www.rosencomment.com to find out all about Starwood, which is one hell of a party.

1329
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:56,100
Oh, hey, on May 23rd, Stinking Lizaveta is going to be at Pat's in the Flats.

1330
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,260
That's a big show.

1331
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,840
It's a big show with sexual tension.

1332
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:05,920
The new Lou Reed and Lives of the Saints at May 23rd at Pat's in the Flats.

1333
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,480
Yeah.

1334
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:13,720
That should be an interesting show if you're toxic.

1335
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:14,740
That's right.

1336
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,520
If you're toxic, there's plenty of things to do.

1337
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,420
And, boy, oh, boy, we're going to launch that rocket this year.

1338
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,420
We are going to launch that mother.

1339
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,660
We launched 22 of them three years ago.

1340
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,840
Three years ago.

1341
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,880
We launched 22 of the damn things.

1342
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:32,820
We're putting all our money into one big-ass mother.

1343
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,700
Yes, baby!

1344
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,600
Your spaceship might be made of flesh.

1345
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,120
We might not all get off Earth, but we'll certainly get their attention.

1346
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,820
Your cranium is the view screen.

1347
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,100
Your head is the nose of a missile.

1348
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,340
I came not to bring a thorn, but an obnoxious radio show.

1349
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,180
J.R. Bogdanov.

1350
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,640
Speak softly.

1351
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,580
Speak softly and fall asleep in your own corruption.

1352
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,040
That's me and I stand firmly.

1353
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,500
We burn the other planets later.

1354
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,420
We must get off!

1355
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,540
I want to marry someone with lots and lots and lots of hair.

1356
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,700
I tried to marry a rich man, but it was not there.

1357
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,880
And so I suffered for slack and suffered indeed.

1358
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,820
I was never left.

1359
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,840
I was left off this Earth.

1360
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,800
I was given only greed.

1361
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,740
I was succored by a madman with a funny goatee.

1362
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,240
Maybe keep your eye on Tiger back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.

1363
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,280
His name was Ivan Stang.

1364
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,320
And that's enough for me.

1365
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,180
Unzen combo Dave.

1366
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,420
Rosen common himself.

1367
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,680
Princess we are.

1368
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,940
Do a river and Ivan Stang.

1369
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,620
My name's Ted.

1370
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,280
We'll see y'all.

1371
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,760
Okay, friends on the internet.

1372
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,740
Before I can flog our swag league.

1373
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:56,820
I'm going to do a little bit of a rave.

1374
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:56,820


1375
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:02,500
If you want to help yourself and the church of the subgenius and get a pretty cool package

1376
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:08,340
with like 25 different nifty things in it, like pens and bumper stickers and a real preacher

1377
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:13,680
card, you need to go to subgenius.com and click to become a minister.

1378
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,380
You'll see a photos and a list of all the stuff you get.

1379
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:22,720
And you really do get to go to the scrub genius forum, which is members only.

1380
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,860
And we talk in ways that people don't talk on Facebook.

1381
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:32,360
book. Much, much smarter ways, ironically enough. Isn't that funny? We also have things like t-shirts

1382
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:37,680
and damn near everything you can think of with Bob's face on it. That and a huge selection of

1383
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:45,680
other subgenius graphics on coffee mugs and so forth. And we sell several very weird DVDs and

1384
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:54,440
CDs of the Bob songs and old mp3 stashes of this show. And best of all, from our main online store,

1385
01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:00,600
you can buy the book of the subgenius, which is by far the greatest thing we have ever done.

1386
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:08,140
It's an actual Simon and Schuster book, 22 bucks in print for over 30 years. And every copy that

1387
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:14,600
we send out is signed by yours truly. For that matter, your address on the puffy envelope is

1388
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:23,600
handwritten by me also. Keeps my fingers nimble. That's subgenius.com. And remember, it's only

1389
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,300
money.

1390
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:24,560
Thank you.
