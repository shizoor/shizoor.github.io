1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,020
the

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,040
the

3
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,920
Does your mother know you're listening to the subgenius hour of slack with a somewhat

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,660
sticky rubber diamond stank?

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,440
She's listening with you?

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,980
That's illegal in 24 states, you know.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,240
I'll bet you let your dog watch you undress for a bit, too.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,060
I mean, praise Bob!

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:34,200
I'll bet you let your dog watch you undress for a bit, too.

10
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,100
In beautiful Sweden.

11
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,600
I was arrested and held as an accessory.

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,660
You'll read about it in the probation report.

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,880
But, Connie, why didn't you get in touch with me?

14
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,620
Well, I was so terribly ashamed, I didn't want anyone to know.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,120
Take your hands off me!

16
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,280
You can't treat me the way you used to!

17
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,200
I can, eh?

18
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,360
We'll see about that!

19
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,220
You ever been arrested before?

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,340
Go on, squawk.

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,900
Tell them all about yourself so everybody will know the jam you're in.

22
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,240
Oh, you're not as tough as you think you are.

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
You're both pretty young to be in a racket like this.

24
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,980
You say you talked about some trouble you girls had.

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,540
I can't tell you that.

26
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,220
You mean...

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,400
You mean you're afraid to tell me for fear it might uncover other criminal activities you girls were engaged in?

28
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,880
Everybody's talking about Monica, the story of a bad girl.

29
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,420
Labeled by Time Magazine, Sex on the Rocks.

30
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,300
If you're one of those people who giggles like a schoolgirl when anyone uses the word titillate,

31
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
you're a prime candidate.

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,600
You're a prime candidate to be a registered listener devoted to...

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,880
The Subgenius Hour of Squawk.

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,980
With the prurient river diving stank, Dr. Johnson bets his covenant trademark that it'll do you a world of good.

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,020
Keep listening for tips on how to measure the blockage.

36
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,020
Keep listening for tips on how to measure the blockage.

37
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,020


38
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,720
Ah, yes, dear friends.

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,040
Well, I think we have a fun, fun show for you tonight because...

40
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,280
Well, Bob made a great big B-T-M.

41
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,520
Yes, Bob made a huge...

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,900
And that doesn't mean a bowel-tee Miller.

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,640
It means Bill T. Miller came out with a new CD, friends.

44
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,100
And, uh, uh, kings of feedback.

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,720
And, well, actually two, two new CDs.

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,140
Kings of Feedback and Drum Army.

47
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,420
That and, um, the, uh, X-Day materials that have finally made it into audio only.

48
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,620
And the, the Einstein Secret Orchestra and, and, and Connie and Susie's latest at Con.

49
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,840
And, and, uh, and KPFA, a whole bunch of KPFA.

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,480
Friends, it's just one of those shows.

51
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,800
And so, uh, I don't know.

52
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,920
I'm not sure.

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,160
It's whatever.

54
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
We least expect.

55
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,960
Love hides in narrow corners.

56
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,200
Love comes for those who seek it.

57
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,620
Love hides inside the rainbow.

58
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,380
Yeah.

59
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,300
Love hides in molecular structures.

60
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,440
Yeah.

61
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,340
Love is the answer.

62
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,380
Yeah.

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,620

You're on the air

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,280
We're not on the air

132
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,440
You're on the air

133
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,980
You're in the air

144
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,100
I just wanted to call and see if you could give me a ride from the airport

145
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,300
Or not me actually

146
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
My friend, Cerno, needs a ride from the airport

Okay, okay, okay

150
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,560

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,560


152
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,860
Does this have a lock?

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
All right, let's start the show now

154
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,880

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,820
It appears as though something has happened

161
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,180
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

162

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,240
What do we do?

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,580

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,180


194
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,180
pointed questions

195
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,560
almost on his stomach,

196
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,660
and the side of his head,

197
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,020
and his head was laying on the edge of the seat.

198
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,940
He was laying more on his stomach

199
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,900
than his foot was hanging out over the edge of the car,

200
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,900
upside down.

201
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,420
Don't listen to him, children.

202
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,440
Listen to me.

203
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,720
After all, I'm your friend.

204
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,780
You're special to me.

205
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,780
Special, special, special to me.

206
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,360
See, Arnie loves you,

207
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,980
and Jesus loves you,

208
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,520
and Arnie doesn't like Mr. Pink anymore

209
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,460
because Mr. Pink's a jerk.

210
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
And I think that Mr. Pink

211
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,060
deserves to slide under a cement truck

212
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,220
and die with a mouthful of his own blood,

213
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,180
and all of his parents and his children,

214
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,860
and all of his stinky Hindu friends with him.

215
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,220
Ha ha, Mr. Pink's ancestors all live in dirt huts.

216
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,760
Ha ha.

217
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,160
Woo-hoo.

218
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,380
All right, all right, all right.

219
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,200
Hey, listen, listen, listen, man.

220
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,980
Listen, man.

221
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,520
I don't know how many of you people believe in astrology.

222
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,460
Are you Sagittarius?

223
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,640
Yeah, that's right.

224
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,200
That's right, baby.

225
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
I am a Sagittarius.

226
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,960
The most philosophical of all the signs.

227
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,540
I am a philosophize.

228
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,200
But anyway, I don't believe in it.

229
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
I don't either.

230
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,680
I think it's a bunch of...

231
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,500
bullshit myself.

232
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,780
But I'll tell you this, man.

233
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll tell you this.

234
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,920
I don't know what's gonna happen, man,

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,660
but I want to have my kicks

236
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,160
before the whole shithouse goes up in flames.

237
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,620
All right.

238
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,560
All right.

239
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,140
All right.

240
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,440
This time, let go your consciousness.

241
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,160
Let go.

242
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,400
This time, let go your consciousness.

243
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,460
Now, I have final instinct.

244
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:49,020
I'm not gonna let it slip out of my hands,メ

245
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,820
Dispotional toys

246
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,860
Distort my perception

247
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,060
This No Channel toys

248
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,420
Animated figurines

249
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,660
Animated figurines

250
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,440
Dance in harmony

251
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,260
Love fractures

252
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,300
If rejected

253
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,640
What is reality for sound?

254
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,920
What is reality in terms of space?

255
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,420
What is reality in terms of time?

256
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,320
Trans-historic

257
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,640
Trans-historic

258
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:01,640


259
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,520
Prize cartoons

260
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,220
Streaming endlessly

261
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,600
Brainwaves will process

262
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,660
Your body's electricity

263
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,880
Animated figurines

264
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,140
Dance in harmony

265
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,640
Trans-historic

266
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,160
Trans-historic

267
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:33,700
Zimocast

268
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,640
Cross-posted to your next dream

269
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,460
Oh, that's now. That's real now.

270
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,520
They depend on hallucinations for their philosophy.

271
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,640
This is not a new idea, and it has never worked.

272
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,620
If you want it, you can have it.

273
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,980
Reach out. You deserve it. Celebrate yourself.

274
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,620
We could disconnect the interface and still maintain the input level.

275
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:31,600
We could disconnect the interface and still maintain the input level.

276
00:14:51,640 --> 00:15:01,600
We could disconnect the interface and still maintain the input level.

277
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,180
Neurotransmitters allow brain cells to communicate with each other.

278
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,820
Oh, that's now.

279
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,360
Oh, that's now.

280
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,960
attempted X Day.

281
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,400
Beat me up Scotty, there's no intelligent body out here.

282
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,600
If there was some I'd only get away from it.

283
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,500
Anyway, let's go.

284
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,940
If you want it now, love can give you a whole planet.

285
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,980
Love can give you a whole planet.

286
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,240
When did you say you wanted it now?

287
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,460
You want the whole planet now or you're just trying to get it done?

288
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,140
You can spend 80 days for $30.

289
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,520
$2 a day in restful bed.

290
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,140
It's not bad.

291
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,140
Crazy.

292
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,360
Be part of the in-ear world.

293
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,740
And the beginning of your own new world.

294
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:49,120
And the best thing is, it's a doing yourself new world.

295
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,700
That's right.

296
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,920
But we are in the countdown now, you know.

297
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,220
There's only a little bit of time left before the end times begin.

298
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,660
What does that mean?

299
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,620
They're pounding their airborne badges into the air.

300
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,360
Into their flesh.

301
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,140
Oh yes, we have our jobs, butt wings, ceremony.

302
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,420
That was nothing because they were placing that on their breasts and pounding it in.

303
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,960
Oh boy.

304
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,060
Yeah, you know, whatever.

305
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,400
The actual badge is on our foreheads, my friends.

306
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,180
Some people do it on the end of their nose.

307
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,840
And I've even heard of a perverse sect in San Francisco that, well, I'll just say that piercing takes on a new name.

308
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,480
The rain falls.

309
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,960
And the listeners remain fixed here.

310
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,200
If you come down to the station, yes, you can get that giveaway ticket.

311
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,820
For the sex saucers in the end times.

312
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,660
You won't need drugs in the future.

313
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,600
You won't need anything except that little subgenius pamphlet out your hand.

314
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,060
Wake up!

315
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,480
You can't remember where it was!

316
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,460
Had this dream stopped?

317
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,720
The snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken.

318
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,200
We were afraid to touch it.

319
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,140
The sheets were hot dead prison.

320
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,300
The earth was dark.

321
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,200
The earth was dark.

322
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,960
The earth was dark.

323
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,700
We must get off.

324
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,440
That's... Chaz, I had to tell you.

325
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,700
And Princess Wee and Dave and Leepo.

326
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:26,220
I had a vision today in the car of a bumper sticker that said earth dot dot dot.

327
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
We must get off!

328
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,480
Exclamation point.

329
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,900
Yeah.

330
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,060
Wow!

331
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,080
Out!

332
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,560
Out!

333
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,920
Wait, open up!

334
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,240
Open the door.

335
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,360
I think you got another smash.

336
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,820
It's time to find a way to get a break in

337
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,720
All the good things have been taken

338
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,520
A cover of wings to make certain things work

339
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,600
But I'm dressed in rags I will save all someday

340
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,940
Hear what I say

341
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,560
I'm gonna ride in the subway

342
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,140
No more time spent sweating red

343
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,520
Hear my command I'm blameless

344
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,500
It ain't over yet Hold me down

345
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,580
Stick around

346
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,900
Baby, baby, baby

347
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,900
It's my fight and I'll do what I want

348
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,940
It's my fight

349
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,140
And I'll think what I want

350
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,520
Show me a brawl

351
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,140
Purpose and time

352
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,460
But someday I'll teach you your mind

353
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,480

354
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,440

제 부 재결

371
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,040


372
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,040


373
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,540
IR

374
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:17,540


375
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,660
That was my day

376
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,360
Can you believe

377
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,900
I ain't no sin

378
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,880
Who complains

379
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,260
So girl, go on now

380
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,120
Head on out

381
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,420
But baby, baby

382
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,140
Remember, remember

383
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,300
It's my life

384
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,200
And I do what I want

385
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,260
It's my mind

386
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,340
And I think what I want

387
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,520
Show me I'm wrong

388
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,360
Or there's some time

389
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,380
But someday I'll treat you real fine

390
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,500
It's my life

391
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,340
And I do what I want

392
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,540
It's my mind

393
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,340
And I think what I want

394
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,420
It's my life

395
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,640
And I do what I want

396
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,800
It's my mind

397
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
And I think what I want

398
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
It's my mind

399
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,520
And I think what I want

400
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,800
It's my life

401
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,120
It's my mind

402
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,180
And I think what I want

403
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,800
It's my life

404
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,180
And I do what I want

405
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,500
These are my dreams

406
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,580
Yeah, this is my time

407
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,460
This is my way

408
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,900
This is my time

409
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,040
Yeah

410
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,260
You know I like it

411
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,280
Yeah, I like it

412
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,220
Yeah

413
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,200
We're going to be going outside of the sphere.

414
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,240
The sphere of humanity is...

415
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,220
I've never really cared for it.

416
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,900
You know, I never really gave a crap.

417
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,240
I was always told I was different, weird,

418
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,180
in some vague, unnameable way.

419
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,860
I wasn't, you know,

420
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,120
I didn't have a cleft palate or anything.

421
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,780
But I just knew I was different.

422
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,260
And when I finally found the actual mother church,

423
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,320
I knew that I was home.

424
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,380
Praise Connie!

425
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,100
Oh, praise Connie is right.

426
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,340
You will now realize that Connie is the one living true black master.

427
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,500
Friends, you see,

428
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,140
and I've been jealous of them.

429
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,820
Piss on each other's turf all they want.

430
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,040
But the whole time Connie's menstrual blood washes away the filth.

431
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,440
It washes away the unclean.

432
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,780
The way it is unclean.

433
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,920
Praise Connie!

434
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,120
Praise Connie!

435
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,360
You are out of control.

436
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,260
Don't worry, Ivan.

437
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,380
The bleeding, spurting side effects are part of the treatment.

438
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,800
I can't play.

439
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,320
My mouth won't do it.

440
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,460
It's just that everybody's milk.

441
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,180
You're listening to the subgenius hour of slack.

442
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,800
Too late to stop now.

443
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,740
You might as well go all the way.

444
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,140
Love is love.

445
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,380
If you listen.

446
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,940
You see, we're dealing in opposites here.

447
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,400
Everything's in reverse, you might say.

448
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,580
He's off.

449
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,660
Here I go.

450
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,720
L traveller, what are you trying to do?

451
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,160
Nothing, I got mess you here.

452
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,160


453
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,160


454
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,160


455
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,160


456
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,160


457
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,160


458
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,480
What have you been doing lately, it's to tuck back our yoke.

459
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,580
You don't have time to head out to the Park.

460
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:06,580


461
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,820
Oh my God.

462
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,560
Who are you?

463
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,320
Don't go.

464
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,320


465
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,320


466
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,320


467
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,320


468
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,320


469
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,320


470
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,320


471
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,320


472
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,800
living in a fantasy world and looking for sounds that may not even be possible

473
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,920
Why are you looking for sounds?

474
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,320
There areinteresting sounds !

475
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,320


476
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,340
No ...

477
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,340


478
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,460
More !

479
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:57,460


480
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:57,620
Yes !

481
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:57,980
No !

482
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,320
No !

483
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,980
parent !

484
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,760
反!

485
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,300
fan !

486
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,560
What do you see?

487
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,440
The world of stereo is filled with spectacular sound surprises.

488
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,000
And an evening.

489
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,680
Can you hear it?

490
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,620
This is a madness.

491
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,820
This is a madness.

492
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,560
This is a madness.

493
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,240
This is a madness.

494
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:31,980
This is a madness.

495
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,440
The stream of life is a wave on the ocean of love.

496
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,940
Life is expressed in the waves of love.

497
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,120
And the ocean of love flows in the waves of life.

498
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,680
Dimethicone. What is it?

499
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,760
It's in the food you eat.

500
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,580
It's in the water you drink.

501
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,680
It's in the air you breathe.

502
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,040
Dimethicone.

503
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,960
Where did it come from?

504
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,180
It shouldn't be in the air.

505
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,200
It shouldn't be in your food.

506
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,640
It shouldn't be in your water.

507
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,440
Dimethicone.

508
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,420
Find out what it is.

509
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,340
Find out how to fight it.

510
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,640
This insidious plague rotting out the heart of America.

511
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,360
Dimethicone.

512
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,640
To find out how you can eliminate Dimethicone from your life,

513
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,740
send one dollar to NoDimethicone.com.

514
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,260
P.O. Box 140306.

515
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,980
Dallas, Texas 75214.

516
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,840
Save yourself.

517
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,760
Save your children.

518
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,520
Save your soul.

519
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,280
We're on the Super Highway.

520
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,600
Really the fast lane to that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow?

521
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,620
M-O-N-E-Y.

522
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,420
This here is the Colquitt.

523
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,420
Welcome to the Internet, folks.

524
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,900
Yesterday I couldn't spell Internet.

525
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,380
Today I'm right smack dab in the middle of it.

526
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,760
I am not a geek.

527
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,600
I am a nerd.

528
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,220
I know you are, but what am I?

529
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,320
Nerd.

530
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,720
Woo!

531
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,720
I'm a nerd.

532
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,220
I know you are, but what am I?

533
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,100
Nerd.

534
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,100


535
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,060
This here is the Colquitt.

536
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,060
Welcome to the Internet, folks.

537
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,280
Yes, I'm a nerd.

538
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:13,640


539
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,240
I know you are.

540
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,680
Yes, I'm a nerd.

541
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:14,680


542
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,960
Yes, I am.

543
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,020
Yes.

544
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,500
Yes, I am.

545
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
Yes, I am.

546
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,280


547
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,760
Yes, I am, yes, yes, yes, I am.

548
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,840
I am.

549
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,280
Yes, I am.

550
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,660
Yes, I am.

551
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I am.

552
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:49,640
I am a nerd.

553
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,780
You're a nerd.

554
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,380
I know you are, but what am I?

555
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:23,200
I am a nerd.

556
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:53,240
I am a nerd.

557
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:07,760
I am a nerd.

558
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,820
I am a nerd.

559
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,760
I am a nerd.

560
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,200
I am a nerd.

561
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,200


562
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,720
You're a nerd.

563
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,920
Yeah.

564
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,340
I know you are, so what do you mind?

565
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,420
Yeah.

566
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,360
Friends, this is...

567
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,720
Everybody's making money off the internet except us.

568
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,840
Braze Pop.

569
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,660
Braze.

570
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,360
King of the internet.

571
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:32,800
of feedback friends this is you nerds this is kings of feedback built II king

572
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,840
of feedback king of slack built email

573
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,500
nerd triumphant you see that what it comes down to now man

574
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,080
Oh

575
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,920
and quiet and get up just one sight and try it.

576
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,060
...tiny as little collar in bed, hard to stay awake.

577
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,120
And we understand.

578
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,320
We are all babies inside.

579
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,000
And can you sign my enamel?

580
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,040
You'll just have to squeeze it in with a micron.

581
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,840
And that baby's bombosity is washed off the aircraft carrier

582
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,480
with a high-pressure hose in my movie.

583
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,240
Oh, no, I know this part all too well from military school.

584
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,580
You didn't have one of those things?

585
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
You live with those things.

586
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,460
These things, you...

587
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,280
You learn to poop those things so you can find them immediately.

588
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,880
You literally swallow these things at lunch and breakfast

589
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,780
just in case you get straight in on a desert island

590
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,160
and you want to have a supply of these things.

591
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,980
And the smell of Brasso, that's the only other thing.

592
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,080
Well, he's got the last one I have.

593
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,060
You swallow these things and you wolf them down with Brasso.

594
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,520
Actually, you know, I grew up with those things,

595
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,560
and so I thought they were really cool

596
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,000
because I realized the whole world...

597
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,340
That was like pre-Gaffer's Tape fastener.

598
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,920
That was the one thing that held the whole world together.

599
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,340
But once Gaffer's Tape was instructed,

600
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,360
in about 1941...

601
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,500
These are the little clips, my friend.

602
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,980
Yes, we're...

603
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,960
How old are you?

604
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,740
Let's view those.

605
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,160
We are eons old.

606
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,840
We are not free to say that on the radio,

607
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,020
but suffice to say you cannot add enough zeros

608
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,920
on the end of the number in order to make sense of it.

609
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,520
You're getting nothing for nothing,

610
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,100
so you tell us how old you are,

611
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,480
then we tell you how old we are.

612
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,700
Wait, are you talking Earth years?

613
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,580
I think she is.

614
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,040
I think she's limited to that thinking, yeah.

615
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,120
I'm not at the realm of you people.

616
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,440
The realm of people?

617
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,020
What kind of derogatory remark is that?

618
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,060
I'm saying I'm not good enough.

619
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm just me.

620
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,780
Well, you know, that's probably not for me.

621
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,820
You don't even need to be.

622
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,720
I'm saying I'm just here.

623
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,980
Well, you know, this is the me generation.

624
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,820
So you're right in time.

625
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,840
That must mean you're rather young to be part of the me generation.

626
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,360
I know what you're talking about.

627
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,480
I'm just a kid.

628
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
Well, at least that makes one of us.

629
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:22,920
Hey, look, the car's starting.

630
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,460
Everybody's driving away because that guy wants to meet us at the front door.

631
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,800
There's just some things that we can't really do.

632
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,260
There's a crowd at the door there.

633
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:30,880
There is?

634
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,280
There are about a thousand people out there.

635
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,720
I think you're carrying...

636
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,620
I think it's signs.

637
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,480
They all want to get...

638
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:36,940
Stay high.

639
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,520
The signs are facing the street, but I think they say something with down with,

640
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,700
and then I can't make out the last word.

641
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,300
Down with syndrome.

642
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:43,700
Oh.

643
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,260
He's pressing his nose up against the glass.

644
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,500
Oh, yes.

645
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,100
They're from over there at 10th Avenue.

646
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,500
I forgot.

647
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,160
He's pressing it up against the glass.

648
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,960
I can see it.

649
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,820
That's still one of my favorite moments when you and I are in the elevator with all of the callers.

650
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,320
This is what it's like to be a subjugist walking the streets.

651
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,280
It was so hard not to laugh.

652
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
You know what I'd like to know?

653
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,780
Yes, we had that moment.

654
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,180
What normals are to subjugists.

655
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,980
What the hell is that talking about?

656
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,540
You're just babbling.

657
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,520
We're talking about real life.

658
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,180
That really happened.

659
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,240
Yes, we are babbling, but the wise amongst you will be able to discern.

660
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,300
You wouldn't think so if you had been a more constant listener.

661
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,760
You would understand.

662
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,680
I've been listening to this show for four years.

663
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,220
Four years.

664
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:18,800
I'm in the basement.

665
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,340
Imagine that.

666
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,520
Four years.

667
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,660
Well, of course you're in the basement.

668
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,760
That's where we keep all our listeners.

669
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,320
Now, listen.

670
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,660
I'd like to know...

671
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:24,820
Yeah.

672
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,180
Yeah.

673
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,440
If I come down to the station...

674
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,640
Okay, we're punching in the record.

675
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,840
Will you come down?

676
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,760
Will you come outside?

677
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,480
No, no, I didn't mean...

678
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,880
Literally, this is info world now.

679
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,060
Will you come outside and meet me?

680
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,220
No, why should we do that?

681
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,480
What is this, some kind of playground thing?

682
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,000
I don't understand.

683
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,500
Come outside.

684
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,100
Are you challenging us to come outside and meet you in the street or something?

685
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,700
No, I just...

686
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,180
I'm a big fan of the show.

687
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,520
Well, I know the show.

688
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,460
Well, I'll tell you.

689
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,700
You can listen to it better from the comfort of your home than you can out in the windy, rainy street.

690
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,020
I don't think you want to come down here.

691
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,040
You're much safer in the house than you're at now.

692
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,680
Okay, newest caller.

693
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,860
What do you think we should do?

694
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,740
I'll be a wonderful...

695
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,800
Did you ever see Salem's Lot?

696
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,200
We are outside your window right now, scratching at the sale.

697
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,300
3D stereogram book.

698
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,420
Oh, all right.

699
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,720
And there's only 26 cents left, folks.

700
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,780
Call it right now.

701
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,060
Who is that guy?

702
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,220
If you have to wait, you know, just bear with us.

703
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,340
We're taking Visa MasterCard.

704
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,840
It's not a problem.

705
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,020
Oh, another pledge break.

706
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:11,880
Oh, okay.

707
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,560
Oops, I'm sorry.

708
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,680
That's why we have to gather money for...

709
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,720
What station are we on?

710
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,300
Oh, I forget.

711
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,300
Now, remember, we cannot take your Visa Card out of the air, nor your expiration date.

712
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,780
But we can take it over a phone line.

713
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,660
We're sort of young in our hearts, so whatever.

714
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,760
We can bring you the kind of programming that you, the listener, demand.

715
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,740
So, demand, listener.

716
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,460
It's your phone.

717
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,360
Free to demand on this show.

718
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,780
It's like what demand wanted.

719
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,400
Do you believe in those 3D stereogram books?

720
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,580
Yes, we do.

721
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,640
The kind men like.

722
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,480
They're a hoax.

723
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,500
It's a hoax conspiracy put out by the major eyeglass manufacturers.

724
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,420
No, you just can't read them, son.

725
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:42,680
I don't think so.

726
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,480
If you stare really hard at the 3D books, you'll see the truth.

727
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,140
Just as we, if we look at the science fiction movies, see the truth.

728
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,220
So, it messes up your eyes to force you to buy corrective lenses.

729
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,120
Well, that's true, too.

730
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,260
But that's, you know, that's the same as if you do this too much.

731
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,360
If you want to use your eyes...

732
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,760
If you do what we're doing right now too much, you get hairy hands.

733
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,280
They're all again.

734
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,460
They're suitable for framing.

735
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:01,860
Yeah.

736
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,140
That's what the cops say to me every time they pull me over.

737
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:11,760
Goodness gracious, what a simply horrible patchwork of noise that church of the subgenius is.

738
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:18,620
I listen every week to gather evidence and ammunition for the citizens for normalcy.

739
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,760
Let me tell you, we're not going to get those subgeniuses.

740
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,340
We're going to get them right in the gonads.

741
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

742
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,700
I didn't mean to say that.

743
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,260
I mean, I don't use words like...

744
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,480
I don't use words like that.

745
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:42,840
This tape, all about Satanism, drugs, and rock and roll, is proof positive that this so-called church is going to send the world to heck in a handbasket.

746
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:55,160
All those demented be-ow's-a-bob-kissing-hop-heads make me want to toss my Nestle's dollhouse cookies with their talk of buckets of pills from that low-life pusher J.R. Bob Dobbs.

747
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,520
Boy, they're so high on drugs that they can't even keep any continuity in their tapes.

748
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:06,840
Too many children listen to these tapes and subscribe to the insane doctrines of the subgenius foundation.

749
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:15,380
They're led down a deceptive road to what these weirdos call slack, like that heathenist idea of nirvana.

750
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,780
I say that slack should be taken up like the excess yarn in my knitting and pulled until it sees the light of a normal day like the rest of us do.

751
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,620
So what should any decent-minded American do when faced with one of these zombies for Bob?

752
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,960
Well, first off, give them a bath in Pine Sol.

753
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,280
They usually stink to high heaven.

754
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,840
Then ship them off to the nearest normally accredited deprogrammer.

755
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:52,320
Well, they'll get bombarded with enough People magazines, arid extra-dry deodorant, and Regis Philbin fan club material, so they won't be able to think anymore the way it should be.

756
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:00,100
Then they'll feed them real dogma about the glories of the home shopping club, Wingo, Zingo, and the evils.

757
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,020
The Mandingo.

758
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:08,860
We cannot stand by while our standards and principles are made light of by these possessed fools.

759
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,380
Normals of the world unite.

760
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,720
Oh, dear friends, and quit calling in with those contest answers.

761
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,900
We got all three winners. I can't believe it.

762
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,540
Dave Bales, hey, guy. Great.

763
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,660
Douglas Hooper and, yeah, Reverend Brian.

764
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:30,020
And that was the Citizens for Normalcy tape you just heard. Thank you.

765
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:38,800
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocratons, these pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens?

766
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,180
These normals who have made normality the norm?

767
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:57,340
Pinks. Pinks are but living stereotypes, insensate meat puppets, and mere food tubes who lack and fear the spark of originality that ignites everything.

768
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:58,360
Yes.

769
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Every person bears some good and there's some bad.

770
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,800
And it's a choice.

771
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,900
You choose whether you want to love or hate that person.

772
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,120
And for myself, I just choose to hate most of them.

773
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,540
We want Uranus and we want him now.

774
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,800
We want Saturn and we want him now.

775
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,700
We want Mercury.

776
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,220
And we want it now.

777
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,440
We want the sun and we want it now.

778
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,520
25 hour day for couples and we want it now!

779
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,620
We will enslave the sun.

780
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,500
The sun will be ours.

781
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,160
We will give you for life.

782
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,540
The earth will give a life to you.

783
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,440
For we shall own the sun.

784
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,140
We shall own the sun.

785
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,260
We shall own the sun.

786
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:00,260


787
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:00,260


788
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,740
We want Saturn and we want it now.

789
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,700
We will enslave the sun.

790
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,900
We want Saturn and we want it now.

791
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,160
Gas giants.

792
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,980
We want Mars and we want it now.

793
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,380
We are the asteroids.

794
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,540
We want Venus and we want it now.

795
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,600
We want the sun and we want it now.

796
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,180
Hydrogen reactions.

797
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,280
We want the sun.

798
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,980
Get your hydrogen atoms here.

799
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,020
10 billion year old carbon.

800
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,800
Thanks Bob.

801
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:46,800
It's made of the old ashes from stars that a long ago went dead.

802
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:57,240
If everything was fine, everything comes apart one way or another, Bob said.

803
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,400
You better be glad of that.

804
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,640
You should take the old words and smoke it.

805
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,800
Remember what happens when the ashes rise.

806
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,260
Like a mighty phoenix.

807
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,380
Friends, join the church.

808
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,480
Build yourself a noose.

809
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,220
Build your own spaceship.

810
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,980
Build your own spaceship.

811
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,320
Stick it in your pipe.

812
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,340
Smoke it.

813
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,380
Blast off.

814
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,060
What's the matter?

815
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,760
Are you scared?

816
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,400
Are you afraid of college?

817
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,340
Come find out.

818
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,860
Go on down there.

819
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,560
We want the universe and we want it now.

820
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,760
We want the universe as we want it now.

821
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,980
We want the cosmos and we want it now.

822
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,080
We want the cosmos and we want it now.

823
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,140
What is the law?

824
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,920
The subgenius must have slack.

825
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,360
That is the law.

826
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,020
We are not men.

827
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:05,700
We are evil.

828
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,420
Earth, we must get off.

829
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,000
Wow.

830
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,720
So what are the two possible interpretations?

831
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,700
I mean, just to share with our listeners.

832
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:24,120
Well, in the most obvious one, we're talking about Earth and saying we must remove our

833
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,220
selves from Earth.

834
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:32,400
We must get off of the Earth's surface and migrate as much as we can and as soon as we

835
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:32,620
can.

836
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,660
Even if we must build our own ships, preferably the Xs will come.

837
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:42,660
The other way that the bumper sticker can be meant is all of Earth, listen to me.

838
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,840
We must get off, man.

839
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:13,380
It cannot be done as the Xs will lead us.

840
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,240
Anyway, that's the way I think it's called.

841
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:16,240


842
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:16,240


843
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:16,240


844
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,520
Well, just now, we celebrate the complete forgiveness of our country, come him and

845
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:20,520


846
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,140
They again come and say something like, they say something but nothing.

847
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,100
So it's Ihr reinforcements.

848
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,100

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,720
this sounds like heaven

931
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,940
this sounds like heaven

932
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:30,720
look at that

933
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:30,720


934
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:38,860
The Lord, the lard, the lubes, the lerbs, the lardclothes, the lard.

935
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,080
I can't remember.

936
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,400
Whips.

937
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,540
They will, child.

938
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,820
Have you ever taken orders from a shipmate?

939
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,820
We'll keep you safe till Dos Eque.

940
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:56,980
Yeah.

941
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,840
Well, till next week.

942
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,900
Sounds like the voice of a thousand angels.

943
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:07,640
It's the voice of Arnold Palmer, calling you from another dimension, saying,

944
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,480
give me back my sacred vowel sounds.

945
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,380
Arn-oil, palm oil.

946
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,600
Cornhole, palm oil.

947
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,620
I think it was the third archbishop of Silesia.

948
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,180
He's a minor.

949
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,260
Abner, the palm oil.

950
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,720
Is this the Eddie Arnold version?

951
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:26,520
It is.

952
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,400
Sounds very Eddie Arnold.

953
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,960
Do you guys remember him in Sargent's Four, I think it was, or Rio El Paso, Otto?

954
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,140
No, this is the Rio El Paso.

955
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,260
It's from the consummate Eddie Arnold.

956
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,120
And that was Ernest Borgnine.

957
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:41,980
He played the plumber.

958
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:42,920
Remember that?

959
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:43,820
With the fist?

960
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:44,580
Huh?

961
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,680
With the fist?

962
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,880
Yeah, he had a big fist on the side of his head, right by his neck.

963
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,060
And when it exploded, I think his mom was serving him spaghetti.

964
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,440
Right, right.

965
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,640
Keep your hat on tight.

966
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,120
I can't remember a lot of it right now.

967
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,740
You're back to the wind and you're sack in the saddle.

968
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,820
We'll see you next week.

969
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,840
See you next week there, kids.

970
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,280
But don't.

971
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:02,960
Don't.

972
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,920
See ya.

973
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,820
Reverend Ivan Stang, the Princess We Are Doe, the Reverend Fleepo Abernathy, and lonesome Cowboy Dave.

974
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,880
My name is Chaz, and this is Einstein's Secret Orchestra ESO with Radio The Swamp.

975
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:15,260
Yeah.

976
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,120
There's so many of these children.

977
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,220
And look here, the pumpkin headed.

978
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,980
Build your own ship.

979
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,820
Build your own ship.

980
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,220
Build your own ship.

981
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,440
Build your own ships.

982
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,720
Build your own ships.

983
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,860
Build your own ships.

984
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,300
Build your own ships.

985
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,340
Build your own ships.

986
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:48,000
Even if you must build it from your own shit, we must get off.

987
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,220
Some of the best ships have been made out of shit.

988
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:55,660
Well, actually, you can make some really good solid rocket fuel out of your own ship.

989
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,120
Build your own ship.

990
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,800
Build your own ship.

991
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,040
your own shit. There we go.

992
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:10,840
Claw the bark of trees that is the law.

993
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,720
Drink from the street that is the law.

994
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:26,520
Four legs and run run free four legs and run legs and run legs and run.

995
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:40,160
To spit blood that is the law. We're not men. Praise God.

996
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:49,440
The seven seals shall be broken and the first seven seals shall juggle the great circus of beach ball and park and play.

997
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,940
Have a nice park day.

998
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:59,500
And there shall be plagues, plagues upon the children.

999
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,760
And they've got some pretty damn cool plagues.

1000
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:08,760
You're going to get off on some of the plagues they've got. You'll make the good plagues.

1001
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:13,280
Some of the other plagues, it's a bummer man.

1002
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:25,740
And the great blind press of Jehovah shall squeeze out the stupidity and the dumbassery from the innocent and the guilty alike.

1003
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,780
And the great can opener from Al Jazeera.

1004
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,720
And the great champion of the game.
