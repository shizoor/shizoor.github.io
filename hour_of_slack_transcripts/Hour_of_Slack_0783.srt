1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Due to some violent content, parental discretion is advised.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,040
Are mutants dangerous?

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,460
Somebody ought to belt you in the mouth.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,440
Friction, what is friction?

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,600
You turned me into a criminal.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,540
Believe me, Ovaltine's got what it takes to help you be a leader in your gang.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,040
You filthy criminals.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,860
I'm gonna take this right foot, and I'm gonna whop you on that side of your face.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,400
And you wanna know something?

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,500
There's not a damn thing you're gonna be able to do about it.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,160
Friction is the rub-a-dub-dub-dub-dub.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
I grabbed a dog, and I took him, and I kicked the shit out of him.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,500
Be careful, duck man.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,480
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,540
Nuclear combat, toe-to-toe with the Ruskies.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,620
And I'm the new minister in charge of religious genocide.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,880
And the rub-a-dub-dub-dub-dub-dub is friction at work.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,940
I've got a good mind to join a club and beat you over the head with it.

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:05,960
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAC.

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,340
SWAC

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,880
Let's rock.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,520
Now, shrunken heads for all occasions.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,740
Collect them, swap them, give them to your witch doctor friends.

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,240
Something's happened to my brain. It's all dried up.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,420
It even vibrates.

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,220
It was terrible. It was just terrible.

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,400
I'll never get over it as long as I live.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
You on drugs?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,640
You'd be ashamed of yourself.

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,880
Sounds like it's having a hallucinogenic effect.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,940
Not like a drug which is harmful and wrong and just say no, kids.

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,960
But spacey, nonetheless.

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,320
I won't go schizoid.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,560
Will I?

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
We'll, uh, we'll talk to Bob.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,520
Thank you, Mr. Know-it-all!

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,680
If I were you, Mrs. Gray, I'd get out of here while you still got time.

38
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,300
A few days will put you in Fort Dobbs.

39
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,020
You'll be safe there.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,660
In 182101...

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,600
War was beginning.

42
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,120
What happened?

43
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,380
Somebody set up us the bomb!

44
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,460
We're getting signal.

45
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,100
What?

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,020
Main screen, turn on!

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,760
It's you!

48
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,180
How are you, gentlemen?

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,600
All your days are belong to us.

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,000
You are on the way to destruction.

51
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,200
What do you say?

52
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,740
You have no choice to survive in your time.

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,380
Ha ha ha.

54
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,380


55
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,380


56
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,380


57
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,380


58
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,380


59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,040
Ha ha ha.

60
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,000
Captain!

61
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,620
Take off every zig.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,940
You know what you're doing.

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,240
Move zig!

64
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,280
For grave justice!

65
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,180
Remorse for what?

66
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,060
You people have done everything in the world to me.

67
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,180
Doesn't that give me equal right?

68
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,380
I can do anything I want to you people at any time I want to.

69
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,380


70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,180
Because that's what you've done to me.

71
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,440
If you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth and throw me in solitary confinement for nothing,

72
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,860
what do you think is going to happen when I get out of here?

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,480
Maybe I haven't done enough.

74
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,920
I might be ashamed of that for not doing enough.

75
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,760
For not giving enough.

76
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,540
For not being more perceptive.

77
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,980
For not being aware enough.

78
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,560
For not understanding.

79
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,040
For being stupid.

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,880
Maybe I should have killed four or five hundred people.

81
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,240
Then I would have felt better.

82
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,540
Then I would have felt like I really offered society something.

83
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,040
You've got it stuck in your brain that I murdered somebody.

84
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,840
What do you want to call me a murderer for?

85
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,860
I've never killed anyone.

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,020
I don't need to kill anyone.

87
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,840
I think it.

88
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,780
I have it here.

89
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,260
Uh, this street is my world.

90
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,300
I don't, uh, I don't pretend to go uptown and be anything fancy.

91
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:33,420
I can, but I find more real in the world that I'm in than I do the tinsel.

92
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,100
And the real world is the one I have to deal with every day, you know.

93
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,460
Uh, believe me, if I started murdering people, there'd be none of you left.

94
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,340
Not in any way

95
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,340


96
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,000
Pollution.

97
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,580
It's a Γ newipp deputy league or a athlete.

98
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,580


99
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,580


100
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,580


101
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,580


102
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,580


103
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,580


104
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:17,740
My boat, heyardr.

105
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,540
You got shit uh?

106
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:18,540


107
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,020
A Yukon Eskimo song.

108
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:28,740
Dear friends, bold surrealism from the Or Kill Me Radio broadcasts from the last X Day Drill.

109
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,700
Praise Reverend DJ Schaefer and Reverend Chuglug and everybody else involved in that.

110
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,820
And praise Reverend Patrick Fulkherty for recording it all and sending us CDs of that.

111
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:52,380
Friends, this show is going to involve a lot of bold surrealism from other people's collections.

112
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:01,780
Dr. Philodrum had also sent me a CD compilation of his favorite novelty tunes, which includes a bunch of novelty rap.

113
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,920
And I've plumbed that CD.

114
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,400
And Reverend Christopher Lee recorded The Residence live in Chicago recently.

115
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,940
We've got lots of that too.

116
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,860
To extract.

117
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,260
Oh, and collage material from Dr. Artemiya Salina.

118
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,360
Downloaded from alt.binaries.slack.

119
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:30,980
And I should mention for the Cleveland area listeners and so forth, there's a devival coming up.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,120
May 12th.

121
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,460
Subgenius Devival at the Euclid Tavern.

122
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,820
Friends, starring Einstein's Secret Orchestra, yours truly preaching.

123
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,480
And Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket.

124
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,040
Friends, it's what Bob wants.

125
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,880
To help carry on our important work, I want you to join the secret squadron.

126
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,380
I want your blood.

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,140
And I want your souls.

128
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,320
And I want them both right now.

129
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,420
I want you to get up now.

130
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,760
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.

131
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,380
Yes.

132
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,340
Yes.

133
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,420
Yes.

134
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:16,220
I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell,

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,440
I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!

136
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,200
Until next week, keep your head on tight.

137
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,480
Back to when it's sack and saddle.

138
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,100
We'll be down at the Grog Shop Saturday night.

139
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,440
Rocking out with the Cobra Verde.

140
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,880
May 12th.

141
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
Down at the Euclid Tavern.

142
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,400
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,220
River Nile and Stag.

144
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,420
And Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket.

145
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,640
And Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket.

146
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,780
And Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket.

147
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,940
We'll be in the Euclid Tavern.

148
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,560
May 12th.

149
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
So if you need me, have some courtesy.

150
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,940
Have some sympathy.

151
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,960
Have some taste.

152
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,240
It's all you well-earned volunteers.

153
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,700
All right, there you go.

154
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:09,960
So good.

155
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:10,960
So good.

156
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,220
All right.

157
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,340


158
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,320
All right.

159
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,440
All right.

160
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,880
Get down.

161
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,900
All right.

162
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,720
Come to my watch and it came on one.

163
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,640
So did I.

164
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,700
To my watch and it said two, three, four.

165
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,900
Time sure flies when you're fucking.

166
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,180
To my watch and it was going on five.

167
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,260
Well, the more the merrier.

168
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,280
To my watch and it was six, six, six.

169
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,100
Devil cock.

170
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,920
Great band.

171
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:53,860
Frog.

172
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,660
To my watch and it was seven on the head.

173
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,600
Continuing sound of one of the most precious voices.

174
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:05,760
Years.

175
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,640
DJ Chugga Chugga taking over for the late night radio program show.

176
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,780
To my watch and it was eight, nine, nine.

177
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,020
The number to call for the sperm overdose hotline.

178
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,600
To my watch and it was ten, eleven, twelve.

179
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,520
Hey, what time is it?

180
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,820
Me shall.

181
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,260
Oh, right.

182
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,300
My bell.

183
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,640
Knock on Wolverine.

184
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,560
Booyah, Brad.

185
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,960
To my watch and it was thirteen to fourteen.

186
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,960
That's how I like them.

187
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,060
That's right.

188
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,620
We have some horny DJs up here at this station.

189
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,720
Very horny DJs.

190
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,440
That's all right.

191
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,860
We don't know it yet.

192
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,380
And now.

193
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,380
Oh.

194
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,700
Oh.

195
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,900
Oh.

196
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,440
Oh.

197
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:30,840
Oh.

198
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:30,940


199
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:30,940


200
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:30,940


201
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:30,940


202
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:30,940


203
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:30,940


204
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:30,940


205
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:30,940


206
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:30,940


207
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,200
I want to check this out.

208
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm going to have to make one of these calls.

209
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,780
Let me just look at this.

210
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:42,780


211
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,480
Okay.

212
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:44,680


213
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,600
I have a phone number.

214
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:56,860
I don't know what the phone number is.

215
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,480
I'll just look at this.

216
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,480


217
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,480


218
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,480


219
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,480


220
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,480


221
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,540
Thank you.

222
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:58,600


223
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:58,960
Thank you.

224
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,420
Thank you.

225
00:12:59,860 --> 00:12:59,860


226
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,580
Thank you.

227
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:00,640
Thank you.

228
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:00,640


229
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:00,640


230
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:00,640


231
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Mr. Smith, it would behold you to stay in your room until you are called either by a major studio, Branson, Missouri, or God.

232
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,320
You're missing the most important thing in your life.

233
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,160
That is your dear friend and talent, former star, Jonathan Winters.

234
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Righter side? Two words, who cares? You know, we're only visitors.

235
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,700
Bye-bye, and remember the Prince of Darkness is with us 24 hours a day.

236
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,040
Regardless of light, the Prince of Darkness can deal with it.

237
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,580
Heavy.

238
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:02,240
Mutilated monkeys' meat, little birdies' dirty feet, it's all mixed up with all-purpose porpoise pus.

239
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,740
I made it just for you.

240
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,420
Yeah!

241
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,820
It's great green gobs of greasy, grimy gold forgotten.

242
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:17,540
It's mutilated monkeys' meat, little birdies' dirty feet, it's all mixed up with all-purpose porpoise pus.

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,640
I made it just for you.

244
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,780
Great green gobs of greasy, grimy gold forgotten.

245
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,660
Mutilated monkeys with little birdies dirty feet

246
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,380
All mixed up with all birdies for this bus

247
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,620
And I made it just for you

248
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,680
I am breaking gods up, racing, crying, cold for dust

249
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,380
Mutilated monkeys with little birdies dirty feet

250
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,920
All mixed up with all birdies for this bus

251
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,000
And I forgot my spoon, but I got my straw

252
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,860
The missile knows where it is at all times

253
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,780
It knows this because it knows where it isn't

254
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,160
By subtracting where it is from where it isn't

255
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,320
Or where it isn't from where it is, whichever is greater

256
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,920
It obtains a difference or deviation

257
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,600
The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate

258
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,140
Corrections to the missile

259
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,480
It has interactive commands to drive the missile from a position where it is

260
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,420
To a position where it isn't

261
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,760
And arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is

262
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,980
Consequently, the position where it is

263
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,160
Is now the position that it wasn't

264
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,540
And it follows that the position that it was

265
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,840
Is now the position that it isn't

266
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,100
Come and kill that boy now

267
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,960
Come get some

268
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,480
I am flying like flying

269
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:15,800
And she dares not x- одну

270
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:15,800


271
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:15,900
It isarl

272
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,700
I am flying like flying

273
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,800
I am flying like flying

274
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,580
It isarl

275
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,140
Like flying and underlying water

276
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,140


277
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,000
guitar solo

278
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,140
guitar solo

279
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,300
guitar solo

280
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:29,380
guitar solo

281
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,920
guitar solo

282
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,640
guitar solo

283
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,560
guitar solo

284
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
guitar solo

285
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,860
guitar solo

286
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,080
guitar solo

287
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,840
guitar solo

288
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,940
guitar solo

289
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,720
This is J.B. Smith.

290
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,700
Thanks for calling. Please leave a message

291
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,860
for me and the nature of your call.

292
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,220
Thank you.

293
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,500
Well, the nature of the call is

294
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,740
what to do about

295
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,160
the deficit. I mean,

296
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,720
I can't handle all this.

297
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
I mean, the little

298
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,440
guys, people like yourself,

299
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,320
are going to have to take responsibility

300
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,640
here. You're going to have

301
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,700
to be bitten into, as it

302
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,740
were. And I'm sorry

303
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,500
to see that. I know what

304
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,620
it's like. I've been bitten into

305
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,120
several times in the past.

306
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,720
Uh,

307
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,000
well, I guess you're not there.

308
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,020
We're out

309
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,440
looking at the car, lying under it,

310
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
or, you know, maybe you're under the bed.

311
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,300
Maybe you're back, or the prostate,

312
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,300
or maybe you're writing.

313
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,540
You know, it could be. Maybe you're into research

314
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,340
again. Okay,

315
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,280
I'll try to catch up with you later. The time

316
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,300
right now is

317
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,060
11.45 on

318
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,540
a Tuesday.

319
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,300
Mm-hmm. All right.

320
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,360
Bye-bye for now. Into Luke

321
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,240
a lick. Hello.

322
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,300
Phone message is there by

323
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,360
Saint Jonathan Winters.

324
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,200
And now, more from Dr.

325
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,300
Philodrumon's favorite twos

326
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,400
for the collage.

327
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,060
Oh my god.

328
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,020
Becky, look at her butt.

329
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,560
It is so big.

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,360
She looks like one of those rap

331
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,300
guys' girlfriends.

332
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
But, you know,

333
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,240
who understands?

334
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,280
Those rap guys.

335
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,560
They only talk to her because she looks

336
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,520
like a total prostitute, okay?

337
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
I mean, her butt

338
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,700
is just so big.

339
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,740
I can't believe it's just so round.

340
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,140
It's like out there. I mean,

341
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,240
gross. Look.

342
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,340
She's just so

343
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,420
black.

344
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,500
I like big butts, and I cannot

345
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,740
lie. You other brothers can't deny

346
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,860
that when a girl walks in with an itty-bitty

347
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,480
waist and a round thing in your face,

348
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,480
you get sprung. Wanna pull up

349
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,520
tough, cause you notice that?

350
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
But your stuff, deep in the jeans

351
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,520
she's wearing. I'm hooked, and I can't

352
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,120
stop staring. Oh, baby.

353
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,420
I wanna get witched up, and take your

354
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,580
picture. My whole boys trying to warn

355
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,200
me, but that butt you got makes

356
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,640
me so horny. Ooh, romper, smooth skin.

357
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,300
You say you wanna get in my bins?

358
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,500
Well, use me, use me,

359
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,280
cause you ain't that average groupie.

360
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,020
I seen her dancing

361
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,600
to hell with romancing. She's sweat

362
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,420
wet. Got it going

363
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,360
like a turbo vet. I'm tired

364
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,440
of magazines saying flat butts

365
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,140
are the thing. Had to average

366
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,160
black men and ask him that. She gotta

367
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,880
pack much back. So, fellas,

368
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,280
fellas, has your girlfriend got your

369
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,260
butt? Tell her, shake it, shake it,

370
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,220
shake it, shake that healthy butt.

371
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,200
Baby got back.

372
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,400
L.A. fake with the Oakland

373
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,840
Boonies.

374
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,280
Baby got

375
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
back. L.A. fake with the Oakland Boonies.

376
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,880
L.A. fake with the Oakland Boonies.

377
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,120
I like them round and big.

378
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,260
And when I'm throwing a gig, I just can't

379
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,960
help myself. I'm acting like an animal.

380
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,080
Now here's my scandal. I wanna get

381
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,280
you home and up, double up.

382
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,080
Up, up. I ain't talking about

383
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,060
Playboy, cause silicone parts are made

384
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,100
for toys. I want them real

385
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,160
thick and juicy. So find that

386
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,300
juicy double. Mix a lot's in trouble.

387
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,700
Begging for a piece of that bubble.

388
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,400
So I'm looking at rock videos.

389
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,160
Not any bimbos walking like hoes.

390
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,200
You can have them bimbos. I'll keep

391
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,120
my women like Flojo. A word

392
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,100
to the thick soul sisters. I wanna get with ya.

393
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,280
I won't cuss or hit ya. But I gotta

394
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,440
be straight when I say I wanna

395
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,040
till the break of dawn. Baby

396
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,120
got it going on. A lot of simps won't like this

397
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,240
song. Cause them punks like to hit and quit it.

398
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,960
And I'd rather stay and play.

399
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,020
Cause I'm long and I'm strong.

400
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,840
And I'm down to get the friction on.

401
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,700
So ladies, ladies,

402
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,600
if you wanna roll my Mercedes,

403
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,700
turn around. Stick it out.

404
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,960
Even white boys got the shout. Baby got

405
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,180
back.

406
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,600
Baby got back.

407
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,920
Yeah, baby.

408
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,180
When it comes to females,

409
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,240
Cosmo ain't got nothing to do

410
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,960
with my selection.

411
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,840
36, 24, 36.

412
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,440
Only if she's

413
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
5'3".

414
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,700
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda.

415
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,640
Playing workout tapes by Fonda.

416
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,380
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda.

417
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,360
My anaconda don't

418
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,960
want none unless you got

419
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,080
buns, hun. You can do side

420
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,140
bends or sit-ups. But please don't lose

421
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,020
that butt. Some brothers wanna play

422
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,940
that hard roll. And tell you that the butt

423
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,840
ain't gold. So they toss it and

424
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,020
leave it. And I pull up quick to retrieve

425
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,960
it. So Cosmo says you're fat.

426
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,720
Well, I ain't down with that.

427
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,900
Cause your waist is small and your curves are

428
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,560
kicking. And I'm thinking about sticking

429
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,680
to the beanpole games in the magazines.

430
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,020
You ain't it, Miss Thing. Give me

431
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,900
a sister. I can't resist her. Red

432
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,740
beans and rice didn't miss her. Some

433
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,920
knucklehead tried to diss. Cause his girls

434
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,940
are on my list. He had game, but

435
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
he chose to hit them. And I pull up quick.

436
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,800
To get with him. So ladies, if the

437
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,820
butt is round. And you want a triple X

438
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,580
throwdown. Dial 1-900

439
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,980
Mix-A-Lot. And kick them nasty thoughts.

440
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,920
Baby got back.

441
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,380
Baby got back.

442
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,280
Little in the middle, but she got much back.

443
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,020
Little in the middle, but she got much back.

444
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,800
Little in the middle, but she got much back.

445
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,540
Little in the middle, but she got much back.

446
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,840
Little in the middle, but she got much back.

447
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,500
Give me that donkey butt and them big ol' legs.

448
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,560
I ain't too hard to beg. Ain't no shame

449
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,600
in this game. I'ma break it down to bag

450
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,840

Hello, this is Jim Smith.

512
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,540
If you would leave a message for me and the nature of your call, I would appreciate it.

513
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,200
And I'll return it as soon as possible.

514
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,040
Thank you.

515
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,020
The nature of the call.

516
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,320
Well, it's a call of a very violent elderly person.

517
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,500
Someone who's been in the business for a long time.

518
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:52,500


519
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:52,500


520
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:52,500


521
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,840
Someone close to your age.

522
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:01,560
You realize that just a few months, May, June, July, and August.

523
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,600
In August, you know what you're gonna be.

524
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,880
69.

525
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
Yeah, it's a magic number, you know.

526
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,500
It's a sexual connotation.

527
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,440
69.

528
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,680
Swazanoof.

529
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,120
Well, my friend, it's the last time you'll be that.

530
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,500
Then you go into the business.

531
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,720
It's a 7-0, and just remember, the prince of darkness is really staring on the walls

532
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:37,780
and the halls and the people with the white hair, people with the bad rugs, people bent

533
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:46,140
over, crippled, drooling and scrueling and grueling and stumbling and fumbling using

534
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:52,480
a cane, using their hands, be fewer and fewer sit-ups in a new way, and more and more shit

535
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:52,480


536
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:52,480


537
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,200
you know, push-ups and running.

538
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,340
You'll have stopped running, you see.

539
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Maybe, maybe, maybe in your room in tight circles.

540
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,980
A few little things there,

541
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,020
but the body eventually turns to clay.

542
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,060
You heard the expression, feet of clay.

543
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,880
Well, get ready.

544
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,180
You got that?

545
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,360
Yeah, I got it.

546
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,260
Good, good.

547
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,620
It's 127 at night, you just turned out.

548
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,900
The kitchen light went off to bed to sleep with your wife.

549
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,880
Now your crew went home, you think your life is a gasp.

550
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,340
But fool, I got a wire tap on that ass.

551
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,800
If the wolves had ears, what fool they do?

552
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,460
Cause the FBI is watching you.

553
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,140
If the wolves had ears, what fool they do?

554
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,840
Cause the FBI is watching you.

555
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,940
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

556
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,080
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

557
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,100
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

558
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,520
One, two, three, hit it.

559
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,000
I'll do anything it takes to get your voice on tape.

560
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,740
I got bugs and satellites, whatever, cause I'm a snake.

561
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,940
My surveillance van's equipped with the illest technological advances.

562
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,740
Chronological chronicles of the chances that you took.

563
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,300
In the day you thought you got away, but fool, look out now, high, I got blade.

564
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,080
You thought that hip-flare skew was nice and neat,

565
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,560
but my wire tap sat strapped onto your seat.

566
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,480
By the time that your orders reached the ears of your soldiers,

567
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,140
every syllable.

568
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,960
Bulls in triplicate and federal votes.

569
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm just waiting for the day when you incriminate the Don.

570
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,080
Word has spawned, then you're all gone.

571
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,840
If the wolves had ears, what fool they do?

572
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,500
Cause the FBI is watching you.

573
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,180
If the wolves had ears, what fool they do?

574
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,860
Cause the FBI is watching you.

575
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,100
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

576
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,620
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

577
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,960
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

578
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,780
Pensate.

579
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,880
No pens I make.

580
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,640
Compadre.

581
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,720
It's all in black and white.

582
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,380
I'm super cop and you can't stop me.

583
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,880
Kamikaze consiglieres, both of their prowess,

584
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,600
but they're about to find out who's the cat and who the mouse is.

585
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,100
I call them mice cause my device will catch them all.

586
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,680
Finally, I'll get my promotion after all you all fall.

587
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,560
You can forget about club fed cause you're strictly going upstate.

588
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,540
Become a butt bae.

589
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,420
Write me, tell me how you like that, cup gang.

590
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:11,820
Solo.

591
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,000
Solo.

592
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,120


593
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,680
Solo.

594
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:15,920
Solo.

595
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,420
Solo.

596
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:18,760


597
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:18,760


598
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:18,760


599
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:18,760


600
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:18,760


601
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:27,640
Sorry.

602
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,800
ão

603
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,240
wont

604
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,300
going to

605
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,760
because the FBI is watching me

606
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,500
If the walls had ears, but who they do?

607
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,200
Cause the FBI is watching you

608
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,640
If the walls had ears, who they do?

609
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,020
Oh, Jonathan, I couldn't do much more than that

610
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,800
The FBI is watching you

611
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,160
See how far this girl is coming down

612
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,560
If the walls had ears, who they do?

613
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,460
I got a fine line

614
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,800
If the FBI is watching you

615
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,120
I'll look after your wife

616
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,320
Jonathan, be no scat, I'll play the part

617
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
You know you're going down for a bit of a skate

618
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,840
Don't worry Elmira, how about Sing Sing?

619
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,020
Bring along your servant, make it next summer

620
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,560
If the walls had ears, who they do?

621
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,000
Agent Paul's son, if the walls had ears, who they do?

622
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:46,120
If the walls had ears, dear friends, from Mob Story, a hip-hopera

623
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,080
Uh...

624
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:56,940
Amazing CD by Reverend Lepo Abernathy, Jack Douglas, Hugh Smith, and Eddie Lynch

625
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,400
Uh...

626
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,420
And now a scene from The Planet of the Men

627
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,940
Technical difficulties here at the...

628
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,920
Stargate 2434...

629
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,980
We're visiting a sad planet, a very sad planet

630
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,300
On a routine patrol flight in the Milky Way galaxy...

631
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,280
I discovered on our space sensors an unidentified planet

632
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,360
careening wildly in an eccentric solar orbit

633
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,640
I ordered an immediate investigation

634
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,080
And with much difficulty maneuvered our ship for a temporary orbit

635
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,800
Upon beaming down to the planet's surface

636
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,300
All I could see were ruins

637
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,120
Ruins of some type of civilization

638
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,940
Crumbled buildings

639
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,740
Deserted streets

640
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,080
Charred vegetation

641
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,580
All covered with a thick layer of dust

642
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,180
Which our scanners indicated as intensely radioactive

643
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,560
I proceeded to make a thorough survey of the area

644
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,740
According to my calculations

645
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,140
I could tell that some recent phenomenon or holocaust had occurred

646
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:13,680
And destroyed whatever advanced civilization had existed on the planet

647
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
I thought that the planet was in a state of emergency

648
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,600
I found no sign of life

649
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,860
As I made my way back to the ship

650
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,360
I heard a sound

651
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,740
It came from a cellar

652
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,540
In one of the nearby buildings

653
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,240
Carefully and slowly

654
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,720
I found my way to the source

655
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,420
And discovered a human being

656
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,360
Or rather what once was a human being

657
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,660
A scarred, disfigured man lying in the rubble

658
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,700
When I questioned him

659
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,040
He told me that this had once been a great world

660
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,660
They had abundance and plenty

661
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,420
Intelligence

662
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,000
Beauty

663
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,980
Love

664
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,740
There was enough for everyone who lived there

665
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,120
But the inhabitants were never satisfied

666
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,040
They wanted more

667
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,960
They wanted everything

668
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,280
And they started to quarrel amongst themselves

669
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,940
They could not live in peace

670
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,440
And they tried to destroy each other

671
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,140
In doing this

672
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,400
They destroyed everything

673
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,080
Their abundance

674
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,400
Their plenty

675
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,000
Their own intelligence

676
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,500
Their beauty

677
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,660
Their love

678
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,240
He told me that so far as he knew

679
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,300
He was the only living thing left

680
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,220
But that he knew he was dying

681
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,640
When I asked him the name of the planet

682
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,180
He replied

683
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,360
We call it Earth

684
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,720
Stop

685
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,980
Go to Burning Man

686
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,600
This

687
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,160
Everybody in this campsite

688
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,960
Really ought to check out the Burning Man scene

689
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,340
I say this only because I've been twice

690
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,660
And only because

691
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,220
I really

692
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,340
Truly believe that everyone that

693
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,900
Has dragged me

694
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,160
Has dragged their ass out here to Sherman

695
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,340
Should seriously consider dragging their ass out

696
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,860
To Black Rock

697

723
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,320
Kind of hoping that this

724
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,200
This draws the Exes to a little closer

725
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,820
to the planet

726
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,360
It gets to them

727
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:24,180
These waves, these FM waves are actually being broadcast outward at a speed of 90.5 billion miles per hour.

728
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:32,620
Through your body, through the earth, out the other side, into space, out there, to where the X-ist can hear it.

729
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:39,060
We really want them to know when they pull up just past the moon in part,

730
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:52,720
there's at least a few of us out there who can dig this crazy sound and thus lure them in.

731
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,620
Catch a ride in the pleasure saucers.

732
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,680
By the way, you're listening to Garbled Radio Signal Number 2.

733
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,500
Garbled Radio Signal Number 2

734
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:54,480
When? Why do I wait? You told me to wait. Now he'll never come again.

735
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:04,020
There's a hole in the world like a great black pit and it's filled with people who are filled with shit and the vermin of the world inhabit it.

736
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,020
But not for long.

737
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,800
They all decide to die.

738
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,400
Tell me why, Mrs. Love, tell me why.

739
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,300
Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Love, there are two kinds of men and only two.

740
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,600
There's the one staying put in his proper place and the one with his foot in the other one's face.

741
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,360
Look at me, Mrs. Love, look at you.

742
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,300
No, we all deserve to die.

743
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,940
Even you, Mrs. Love, even I.

744
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:46,780
Because the lives of the wicked should be made brief, for the rest of us' death will be a relief.

745
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,640
We all deserve to die.

746
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:48,660
We all deserve to die.

747
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,140
We all deserve to die.

748
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,840
And I'll never see Johanna.

749
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:04,060
No, I'll never hug my girl to be finished.

750
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,300
All right, you sir, how about a say?

751
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,560
Come and visit your good friend Sweeney.

752
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,140
You sir, too sir, welcome to the grave.

753
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,920
I will have vengeance.

754
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,860
I will have salvation.

755
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,160
Kill me.

756
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,160
Kill me.

757
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,120
Kill me.

758
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,160
Kill me.

759
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:35,900
Kill me.

760
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,020
Kill me.

761
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,880
Kill me.

762
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,720
Come on, come on, come on.

763
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,240
Kill me.

764
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:45,660
Kill me.

765
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,620
Go on.

766
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,020
The Epiphany from Sweeney Todd, actually about X-Day, sung by Christopher Lee,

767
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:38,580
followed by Or Kill Me from National Cynical Network, not from Or Kill Me Radio, which we go back to now.

768
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:56,660
Now the ladies of the harem of the court of King Caractacus were just passing by.

769
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:08,420
Now the noses on the faces of the ladies of the harem of the court of King Caractacus were just passing by.

770
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,580
sing by now the noses on the faces of the ladies of the harem of the court of king garacticus

771
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:33,320
now the boys have put the powder on the noses of the faces of the ladies of the harem of the

772
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,440
the Court of King Airaticus

773

Weren't just passing by

774
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,880

776
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920

Now the fascinating witches have put the scintillating

787
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,000
Stitches in the britches of the boys

Please Don't Go Topless Mother

It's a unique piece of

a plastic

809
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,960

Thank you for calling J.B. Smith.

886
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:33,900
I'm doing a few touch and go's today, so be in and out, and please leave a message for me. Thank you.

887
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:41,160
Hi. It's 11 o'clock. You mean you've gone to bed already?

888
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,400
Well, I can't get you in the morning.

889
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,440
I can't get you at night.

890
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,900
Are you in the car again? Curled up?

891
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,900
What about that car phone? Is it working?

892
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,760
I don't get it. I don't get it.

893
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,380
Elderly people, I guess, I forget. Yeah, they go to bed at about 8 or 9.

894
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,060
It's just incredible.

895
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,260
Or you'll have as much as, what, 9 to 12 hours of sleep?

896
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,760
Remember eternal sleep. Eternal sleep.

897
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,580
That means you don't wake up.

898
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,040
You got it?

899
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:24,620
Yeah.

900
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,940
Maybe the Prince of Darkness is visiting you now.

901
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,440
Well, I had a lot of important stuff I wanted to lay on you.

902
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,300
Yeah, I'm getting ready for a heavy schedule, so I wanted to alert you to that.

903
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,680
I'm going down to Branson.

904
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:42,580
I'm going down to Branson.

905
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:42,580

00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:42,580

908
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,240
And then going to be a guest.

909
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,020
I'm going to be a guest down there on the Wayne Newton show.

910
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:50,160
And I plug the cassette, of course, down there, my cassette that I've done.

911
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,800
And I'm kind of excited about that.

912
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,660
Maybe you ought to save your money and go down there with me.

913
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:03,880
I'm going to have to get down by bus because of the tremendous cutbacks we've had at gridlocks.

914
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,180
So you'll have some thought.

915
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,500
But I'll try it another time.

916
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,000
Apparently, you're in slumber.

917
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:13,420
Ready?

918
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,740
Over and out.

919
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,600

00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,380
Hoo-hoo!

923
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,420
Now get in the line, get in a row, grab your partner, here we go!

924
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,960
Swinger high and swinger low!

925
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,700
Don't step on that pretty little toe!

926
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,260
Now promenade!

927
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,280
Woo-hoo!

928
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,640
Yee-haw!

929
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:43,220
Eatin' food!

930
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,240
Turkey, eatin' cornbread!

931
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,480
Cheese, skinny cheese, real well fed!

932
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,540
Alleman left and Alleman right!

933
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,500
Alleman left and Alleman right!

934
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,860
Now promenade!

935
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,280
Woo-hoo!

936
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,540
Yee-haw!

937
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,400
Woo-hoo!

938
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,160
Yee-haw!

939
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,260
Hoo-hoo!

940
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,200
Alleman right and form a chain now, form a star and circulate to your left!

941
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,740
Ladies chain now, do-si-do!

942
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,340
Alleman and kickball change!

943
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,060
Now promenade!

944
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,680
Woo-hoo!

945
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,140
Woo-hoo!

946
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:12,680
Woo-hoo!

947
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,000
Shake for breakfast, shake for lunch, a sensible meal that you can munch!

948
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,440
Slowest prices all the time, refreshing splash of lemon lime!

949
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,040
They've closed the bars, the factory's through!

950
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,140
Watchers England, it's a rule, we're pretty, pretty like them!

951
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,120
There's no future, no future!

952
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:29,700
Ah!

953
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,800
Ah!

954
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,520
Ah!

955
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,700
Anarchy!

956
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,720
Anarchy!

957
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,420
Ah!

958
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,280
Now promenade!

959
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:36,780
Woo-hoo!

960
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,360
Oh, we got a police car!

961
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,920
Woo-hoo!

962
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,100
Woo-hoo!

963
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,740
Woo-hoo!

964
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:45,900
Woo-hoo!

965
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,240
Woo-hoo!

966
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:48,720


967
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,240
Woo-hoo!

968
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,400
Woo-hoo!

969
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,100
Woo-hoo!

970
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,740
Mr. Data, what do you know of homosexuality?

971
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:54,960
Intriguing.

972
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,160
Accessing.

973
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,260
It appears to be a means of pleasuring between two males.

974
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,860
But I am curious as to why you should ask me such a question.

975
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:09,140
Mr. Data, as your commanding officer, you must obey any order, no matter how deranged or insane, I choose to give.

976
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,720
That is correct, sir.

977
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,220
Federation dictates it.

978
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,220
Mr. Data, I am curious as to why you should ask me such a question.

979
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:21,600
Mr. Data, I am going to take down my Starfleet regulation-issued trousers, and when I do, I want you to, well, drive me home.

980
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,160
I must obey any order you give me.

981
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,060
Make it so.

982
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,000
Engage.

983
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,140
Must stop.

984
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,820
You must stop or you will hurt the captain.

985
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,200
You have killed the captain.

986
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,000
You have ruptured him in two.

987
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,200
He is cleft.

988
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,240
You have ruined him.

989
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,240


990
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,240


991
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,240


992
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,240


993
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,240


994
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,240


995
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,500
I've been all over this continent.

996
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,040
I've been from coast to coast.

997
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,560
I've even been up as far as Quebeck, Mass.

998
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,080
I've fought my way up to the Nile, to the very top floor.

999
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,980
And I've even tracked the polecat to its pole.

1000
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,580
I've had the yellow jack.

1001
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,500
I've been shot full of holes.

1002
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,960
I've even grabbed an army mule plumped by the plumper.

1003
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:20,500
But I've never been so ripsort, highfalutin' mad, as the night I was reclining on my Louis XIV derriere.

1004
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,300
It all started when the telephone tinkled.

1005
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,620
Picking up the receiver, I said, uh, oui, oui.

1006
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,460
You see, it was a French phone.

1007
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,100
The Secretary of State was calling.

1008
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,760
He said, Jimmy, we need you for an important mission.

1009
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,120
Do you know anything about foreign relations?

1010
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,860
I said, foreign relations?

1011
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,620
Why, you're talking to a guy who's got 15 relatives living in Brooklyn.

1012
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,500
How preprosperous.

1013
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,900
So I said to him, sec.

1014
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,120
I addresses him in the subjunctive.

1015
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,320
My regrets, but I never converse business over the phone.

1016
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,220
I'll see you tomorrow in D.C. at P.M.

1017
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:54,720
Shop.

1018
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,960
So that evening, at cocktail time, I gets aboard the Congressional Limited.

1019
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,320
The train was jammed, so what happens?

1020
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,300
I had to share my upper butt with a guy named Joe.

1021
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,200
It was too crowded up there for both of us to get undressed at the same time.

1022
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,040
So, hike comes down, Joe stays up, he takes off his coat.

1023
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,480
Then Joe comes down, I goes up, I takes off my shoes.

1024
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,500
I comes down, Joe goes up, he takes off his shirt.

1025
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,780
Joe comes down, I goes up, I takes off my pants.

1026
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,740
I comes down, Joe goes up, he puts on his pajamas.

1027
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,880
And what happens?

1028
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:28,920
It's morning.

1029
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,980
We've got to start all over again.

1030
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,760
I comes down, Joe stays up, he takes off his pajamas.

1031
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,040
Joe comes down, I goes up, he takes off my pajamas.

1032
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,660
I comes down, Joe goes up, he puts on my pants.

1033
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,960
Joe comes down, I goes up, I puts on his shirt.

1034
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,200
I comes down, Joe goes up, he puts on my shoes.

1035
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,140
Joe comes down, I goes up, I puts on his coat.

1036
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,680
Now I don't know whether I'm Joe or Joe is me.

1037
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,620
It's a case of double identity.

1038
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,040
He gets off at my station, I gets off at his station.

1039
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,880
His wife runs over to me, throws her arms around my neck,

1040
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,340
gives me a kiss and says,

1041
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,160
Congratulations, Joe.

1042
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,640
You're the father of a nine-pound baby boy.

1043
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,820
What a dilemma.

1044
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,120
But what could I do about it? Nothing.

1045
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,520
So I went to Hoboken to forget.

1046
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,240
And then I went to Hackensack to forget Hoboken.

1047
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,900
That's my story, boys.

1048
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:18,260
The Star Trek II mix there was by National Cynical Network,

1049
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,140
sent in by Reverend Phineas Narco.

1050
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:26,260
We also heard Jimmy Durante there at the end.

1051
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:33,160
And friends, you can learn more about this strange collection of subgenius shows,

1052
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,360
The Hour of Slack,

1053
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:41,700
by writing for free information from Post Office Box 140306,

1054
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,900
Dallas, Texas.

Or check out www.subgenius.com.

1057
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:54,400
This music in the background is by Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1058
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,640
with special guest Ron Slate.

1059
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,740
Praise Bob.

1060
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,660
Ladies and gentlemen,

1061
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,340
I'm about to play what I heard

1062
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,980
and what I believe to be the version of Wild Thing.

1063
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,200
This is the first version of Wild Thing.

1064
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,480
This I ever heard as a child.

1065
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,260
And then it, like, disappeared for about 25 years out of my life.

1066
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
And I found it again and was stunned.

1067
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,200
This is the Ventures version.

1068
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,440
And it has this marvelous, wonderful Peter Lorre vocal.

1069
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,860
I hope you enjoy it.

1070
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,160
As well.

1071
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,600
Wild Thing, I think I love you.

1072
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,060
Come on and hold me tight.

1073
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,320
I love you.

1074
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,760
I love you.

1075
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,100
, I love you.

1076
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,260
Wild Thing, I think you move me.

1077
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,400
Wild Thing, I think you move me.

1078
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,000
Come on and hold me tight.

1079
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,760
You move me.

1080
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,340
Wild Thing, I think you move me.

1081
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,060
Come on and hold me tight.

1082
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,860
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows.

1083
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:39,100
Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained,

1084
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,880
it is not sure just where it is.

1085
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:47,060
However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was.

1086
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:51,680
It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice versa.

1087
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:57,680
And by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be and where it was,

1088
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:02,780
it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.

1089
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,500
To푚

1090
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:41,860
And therefore, it returns to the value of mustine information,

1091
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:41,860


1092
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:41,860


1093
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:56,780
I cut my kids' hair like a bowl.

1094
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,740
I smoke big cigars around little babies.

1095
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,320
Why?

1096
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,540
Because I'm an asshole.

1097
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,460
I play with a remote control when you're watching TV.

1098
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,380
I wear my hat to movies so that you can't see.

1099
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,400
I drive really fast when you're in front of me.

1100
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,440
And I drive really slow when you're behind.

1101
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,160
Oh, I am an asshole.

1102
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,620
Me and my stupid friends drive around real late.

1103
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,580
Our Camaros all have bumpers and we think it's really great.

1104
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,600
Whenever your head dances, we make passes at your date.

1105
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,640
But our only real girlfriends are the kind that you inflate.

1106
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,260
Oh, I am an asshole.

1107
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,640
Oh, when you go to the phone booth and you open up the book.

1108
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,660
And the page you want is missing, it's cause that's the one I took.

1109
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,680
That's the one I took.

1110
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:47,780
That's the one I took.

1111
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,020
One, two, one, two, three.

1112
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,820
I'm the asshole in your neighborhood.

1113
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,920
I live right next door.

1114
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,700
I party till I'm naked.

1115
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,140
Then I throw up on your floor.

1116
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,980
Your daughter was a virgin, but she isn't anymore.

1117
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,440
When I play Monopoly, I cheat.

1118
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:07,380
I'm the asshole that you meet when you're walking down the street.

1119
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,200
I'm the asshole.

1120
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:09,360
I'm the asshole.

1121
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:09,360


1122
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,920
I'm the asshole that you meet each day.
