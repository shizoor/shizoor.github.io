1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
This is normally when we play the Hour of Slack, and I'm Dr. Sinister, as you may know.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,800
And as anybody listening knows right now, this is New Year's Eve.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,920
It's the most wonderful night of the year.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,260
It's the one holiday that everybody has to observe, because we're all forced to flip

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,740
the calendar at the same time.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,920
It doesn't matter what religion you belong to, we're all flipping the calendar tonight.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,260
And we have a very special program on schedule for you here.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,300
We're going to have some special guests up here later on tonight.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,380
Jeremy, I just want to tell you that I'm really sincerely glad you're live, because there

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,820
are a lot of people who love you and care for you, and I'm one of them.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,580
And besides, I don't want to lose a customer.

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,080
Although, yeah, I have two questions, though.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,320
If you had died, would I have gotten any of your stuff, and do you have anything that

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,980
I would want?

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,860
I think the only things that I have that you would want are some archived shows from

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,340
the Muhammad's Radio Days that I have on CD.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,940
Hey, stay on the line.

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,460
Stay on the line here.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,840
We have another caller from out of state here.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,640
Oh, good.

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,760
Hello, you're on the radio.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,360
Hello, you're on the radio.

23
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,600
Well, hello.

24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,560
Hello.

25
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,220
Hello.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,800
Quiet.

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm calling from the great state of Texas.

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,600
I think you know a person who belongs in Texas.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,660
You know, one of my exes lives in Texas.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,340
I'm trying to look for Reverend Stang.

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,900
Is he there?

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,360
We have not reached him yet.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,080
He has not yet called in.

34
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,920
No, not yet.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,360
All right, I'm about 14 seconds behind, I think.

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,160
So I'm streaming on the audio.

37
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,200
You can call me Doc.

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,560
Doc.

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,820
Doc.

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,960
Doc.

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,340
Doc.

42
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:00,980
Yeah.

43
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,460
I'm D-O-K, short for doctor.

44
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,380
Oh, okay.

45
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,880
That's me.

46
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,860
Oh, yes.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,360
This town ain't big enough for the both of us.

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,500
I am Dr. Sinister.

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
And it ain't me.

50
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,200
Who's going to...

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,760
Yes, well, I'm Dr. Sinsomniac.

52
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,660
Oh.

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,820
I've been spelling doctor with a K since the 90s.

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,760
I'm trying to muscle it on my turf.

55
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,200
Incorporated with a certain belief system that I have.

56
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,220
Uh-huh.

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,620
And what belief system is that?

58
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm going to try and...

59
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Well, I'm going to try and work with the Church of the Subgeniuses teachings.

60
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,220
Hello?

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,000
Who do we know?

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,240
I can hear you.

63
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,780
Can you hear me?

64
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,300
It's all over.

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,620
Hello?

66
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,940
Okay, somebody hung up.

67
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,280
All right.

68
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
We are bringing another call right now.

69
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:44,920
Can you hear me?

70
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,400
You're on the radio.

71
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,500
Hello?

72
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,400
Hello, you're on the radio.

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,040
10-4, can you hear me?

74
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,340
Roger Dodger.

75
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,520
Hello, 10-4, can you hear me?

76
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,440
Yes.

77
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,140
Hello?

78
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,420
Hello?

79
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,780
Yes.

80
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,140
Greetings.

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
This thing is, in fact, on.

82
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,100
...from the force.

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,800
Hello?

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

85
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,320
Hello.

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,280
Yes.

87
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,280


88
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,680
It sounds like puzzling evidence.

89
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
There's about 16 things going on in my head.

90
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,920
That's what we're all about here.

91
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,180
Exactly.

92
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,180
That's the very definition of synesthesia.

93
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,380
I'm WCSB Cleveland.

94
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,520
All right, I'm back on the air.

95
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
How are we doing this evening?

96
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,540
Well, I have to advise you that portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable

97
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,580
to some members of the audience.

98
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,920
Therefore, WCSB advises solicited discretion.

99
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,240
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily the views of the audience.

100
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,240


101
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,120
The viewers are not intended to represent the views of WCSB or Cleveland State University

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,320
or anybody with their head screwed on straight, for that matter.

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,700
And other people just like you can call in to 216-687-3515 to join our all-star cast tonight.

104
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,140
For the New Year's Eve Extravaganza, we have just 22 minutes, I'm sorry, not 22, 28 minutes

105
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,620
left in this foul year of 2017.

106
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,720
Ooh, yes.

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,540
And we have some awesome people here.

108
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,140
Well, isn't that just fantastic for you?

109
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:55,980
Yeah.

110
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,460
How about, well, yeah, because we're...

111
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,860
Where are you calling from?

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
I'm a time traveler, and you're a concern, I suppose you could say.

113
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,680
Oh, you're calling from a different time zone.

114
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,620
Of course, I'm a year and one hour behind, because I'm a subgenius.

115
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,900
Or you're an hour ahead of everybody else in Texas right now.

116
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,060
Well, I hear that.

117
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm an inch away.

118
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm either an inch away from my skin or a year and an hour and a half away.

119
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:19,900
Ooh.

120
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,620
Amazing.

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,560
Hmm.

122
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,920
Why not both, though?

123
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,440
So, the reason I called, really, was to say, you know, I'm a time traveler.

124
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,440


125
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,320
I think it's a good thing that, of course, we all remember 2016, don't we?

126
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,640
Hmm.

127
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,840
When was that?

128
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,820
Almost two years ago.

129
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,080
Kind of.

130
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,080


131
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,720
Well, it's difficult sometimes to remember things, because I think something is going

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
on in this world.

133
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,640
These Illuminati are taking over Taco Bell.

134
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:45,840
A lot of people are catching on.

135
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,320
They're getting woke.

136
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:47,740


137
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,460
Got to stay woke.

138
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:50,980
Okay.

139
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,720
So, 2016 was terrible.

140
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,440
I don't think there are many people that can fondly look back on that year.

141
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,440


142
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,440


143
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,440


144
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,440


145
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,440


146
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,440


147
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,700
However, 2017, what the hell happened?

148
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,160
I don't know.

149
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,520
Tell us.

150
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,360
The drugs wore off.

151
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,000
I mean, we're looking at a reality show president.

152
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,740
Kicked in.

153
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:18,920
And everything is changing around us, and our heads are spinning so fast that we can't

154
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,720
quite keep track of every distraction that's going on.

155
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,480
Hmm.

156
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,160
So, did anybody catch the...

157
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,440
Hmm.

158
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,520
...soft UFO disclosure that the UFO committee did in the Pentagon, the government?

159
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,720
Anyway...

160
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,460
Yes, I did, and I don't believe it.

161
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,320
I don't believe a word of it.

162
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,980
If the government starts saying that they found UFOs, I am not...

163
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,200
That's the one time I'm not going to believe what the government says.

164
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,440
You can say mischief management.

165
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,720
If they deny it, I'll believe it.

166
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,960
If they deny UFOs, I'll believe it.

167
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:49,780
That's good management.

168
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,320
It's the management of mischief.

169
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,920
It's the management of mischief.

170
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,320
You get some cornball digging around asking too many questions, and then you just steer

171
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,420
it around.

172
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,420


173
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,060
You can't steer him around and use him for your own purposes.

174
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,980
I've got a question for the caller.

175
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,620
Is this caller seeing the movie Idiocracy?

176
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,560
We're living it, aren't we?

177
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,320
Isn't it a documentary?

178
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,180
Well, I guess that's kind of the direction I'm going with that.

179
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,140
Before this election, that might have seemed like a ridiculous movie, and after this election,

180
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,320
does it seem a whole lot more like a documentary?

181
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,620
Well, absolutely.

182
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,060
You can just see it slowly evolving.

183
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,420
I think it's a good thing.

184
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,680
Net neutrality.

185
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,360
Hello?

186
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,280
Yes, you're still here.

187
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,340
And hey, we also have Reverend Stang finally calling in here.

188
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:41,120
We have also some more guests in the studio here, the illustrious Will and a guest of

189
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,340
his.

190
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,440
Oh, and I just hit the wrong button.

191
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,520
I meant to bring Reverend Stang on the air, but I pressed the wrong button.

192
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:46,860


193
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,460
I'm sure he'll call back.

194
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,440
He knows how to do it.

195
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,740
And you know how to do it, too.

196
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,900
It's 216-687-3515.

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
And you are on the radio.

198
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,400


199
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,400


200
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,400


201
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,400


202
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,400


203
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,400


204
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,400


205
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,400


206
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,400


207
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,540
We're living in .

208
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,560
Hello?

209
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,180
Hello?

210
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,420
Hello, you're on the radio.

211
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,260
Hello?

212
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,860
Oh, good.

213
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,960
Oh, this is Reverend Stang.

214
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,280
My ears were itching.

215
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,540
I knew that someone must have been talking about this.

216
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,200
Yes, we were.

217
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,520
Well, I am...

218
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,740
Well, Happy New Year, everyone.

219
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,340
Happy New Year, Reverend Stang.

220
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,400
It's so good to hear from you.

221
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,620
Happy New Year.

222
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,440
I have to say, you've been a big influence on me as well over the years.

223
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,480
It's only been 30 here in Texas.

224
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,260
Right.

225
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,340
Yeah, you're stuck in the past, man.

226
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,400
Yeah, it's crazy.

227
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,400


228
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,400


229
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,400


230
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,400


231
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,400


232
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,400


233
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,740
But then again, I guess the Aussies could tell us the same.

234
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:40,200
We're looking forward to a glorious new year where America will be great.

235
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,120
Again?

236
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,720
From your mouth to God's ears.

237
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,460
Again.

238
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,060
And is that all right?

239
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,860
Did I do it right?

240
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,340
There's a gun to my head.

242
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,860
Uh-oh.

243
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,380
Don't pull the trigger.

244
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,380


245
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,380


246
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,380


247
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,120
Everything will be fine.

248
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,700
Am I screwing up again?

249
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,040
I'm just afraid of it.

250
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,940
It sucks.

251
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,240
Where are we going?

252
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:21,840
No!

253
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,520
You don't want to know?

254
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,380
I just had to change my mind.

255
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,380


256
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,380


257
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,380


258
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,380


259
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,380


260
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,380


261
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,380


262
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,380


263
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:37,060
I changed the first tag on an hour of Slack files on my computer from 2017 to 2018, and

264
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,940
it's such a joke because we don't even know what year this is.

265
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,480
That's right.

266
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,900
We know it's not 1998 yet.

267
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,120
We know that much for sure.

268
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,660
We probably don't really know what planet.

269
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,820
We've been taking their word for it, you know, for everything.

270
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,380
Was there really a World War II?

271
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


272
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


273
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


274
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


275
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


276
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


277
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


278
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


279
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


280
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,200
Was there really a 2017?

281
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,160
Oh, God, I'm afraid there was.

282
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,180
I don't believe there was a World War II.

283
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,900
I really don't believe that for a second.

284
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,700
Well, World War II was actually a false flag operation for when they transferred planets

285
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,640
from planet Mars to planet Earth.

286
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,640
I believe that World War I never ended.

287
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,800
Yeah, try telling people.

288
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,280
That may call you a conspiracy, too.

289
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,280
No, World War I is still going on 100 years later.

290
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,360
Not 100 years later.

291
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,360
The Earth was peaceful and beautiful, but it was actually in the area of Mars.

292
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:40,900
Then we almost destroyed it, and we used the false flag of World War II to cover our transportation

293
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,060
operation to the new planet Earth.

294
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:54,380
Yeah, well, that goes without saying for most subgeniuses, but most of the listening audience

295
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,340
doesn't know what any of that is.

296
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,340


297
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,740
It's what they're talking about.

298
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:57,740


299
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,120
I think it's about what the universe is about.

300
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,680
Oh, what the universe is about.

301
00:09:59,680 --> 00:09:59,700
Oh, yeah.

302
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,840
I think it's about what the universe is about, and to them it's all fake news.

303
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,500
Well, perhaps it's time for people to tune in.

304
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,880
...fake news just happens to be the realest.

305
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,320
Oh, well.

306
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:20,920
So, I guess the best thing to do is just start spewing out news, and the good news

307
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,980
is it's a new year.

308
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,780
We're a ring-

309
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,880
Oh, I thought you said nudes.

310
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,780
A nude.

311
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,340
That doesn't make any sense.

312
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,340


313
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,340


314
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,400
Why not vote?

315
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,580
Oh, yes.

316
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:39,360
It was like X Day a couple of years ago with that deceptive advertising where you said women free.

317
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,640
I went there.

318
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,320
It was a couple of days until I found my free woman.

319
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,760
I thought they'd be at the door.

320
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,700
Well, they didn't have to pay to get in.

321
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,560
You know, sort of like a strip joint.

322
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,760
Exactly.

323
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,820
And we were making a point.

324
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,200
It was lost on everybody, but who cares?

325
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,900
Everybody had fun.

326
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,600
I tell you what, that's a wonderful place to go.

327
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,740
I really found my center there.

328
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,660
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

329
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,760
It's okay.

330
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,700
I realigned it.

331
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,360
It's now off to the left like it used to be.

332
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,720
Oh, good.

333
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,280
I heard you scored.

334
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,520
That's the best.

335
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,200
It happened to a lot of people.

336
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,680
It never happened to me.

337
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,540
I'm married.

338
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,380
Huh?

339
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,420
I'm married on paper.

340
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,400
Hmm.

341
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,900
I was married 24 hours once.

342
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,960
Wow.

343
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,260
Other side of the map.

344
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,380
You know, I never even got it.

345
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,380
You know, all the years I spent going to X Day and participating in the Church of the Subgenius, I never once got a 24 hour marriage.

346
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,120
Even Steve over here.

347
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,700
It was beautiful.

348
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,780
Got a 24 hour marriage once.

349
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,440
Can you remember to what or who though?

350
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,240
Someone who was actually a guest on my show once.

351
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:53,780
Yeah?

352
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,200
Allison?

353
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,020
Hmm.

354
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Uh, I'm not sure about that, but your memory might be better than mine.

355
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:03,940
One time she was up here.

356
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:13,040
She, uh, one time, actually, the last time I had her up here on the air, she gets a little

357
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,600
wild.

358
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,820
No, no, you're exaggerating.

359
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,860
Yeah, which is probably why she got kicked out of X Day.

360
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,200
But, uh,

361
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,740
I'm sure that's an exaggeration too.

362
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,420
That's all I'm imagining.

363
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,600
Chief over there, that microphone you're using, the last time I had her up here, she actually

364
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:25,800
fell off.

365
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:25,800


366
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:25,800


367
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,460
She farted directly into that microphone.

368
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,160
Oh, nice.

369
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:28,900
Yeah.

370
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
Mm, mm, mm.

371
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,720
Yep.

372
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,260
Is that what I smell?

373
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,560
Okay.

374
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,060
Are you guys talking about who I think you're talking about?

375
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,040
I think I know exactly, I think you know exactly who I'm talking about.

376
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,420
Yeah.

377
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,780
When, when, uh, when I was, uh, when we got back to Cleveland, I had to, uh, thank, uh,

378
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,980
our Reverend Stang profusely for, uh, solving, uh, that, that summer's, uh, problem for

379
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,780
me without any, any interaction from, from, from, from, uh, the, uh, the, the, the, the,

380
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:55,780


381
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,360
this is a Jordanianupa.

382
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,580
Yes.

383
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,180
Uh, and sometimes it they're saying nothing but, um, they're, they're saying nothing.

384
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,180


385
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,180


386
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,780
Up there.

387
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,840
You can, you know Berkley was always interested in experiments.

388
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:10,980
Do you?

389
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,480
Oh, of course.

390
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,280
Uh, I, we always go pick those and him.

391
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,260
Uh-huh.

392
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,820
See I told you I wasn't a big fan of Eric inera.

393
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:22,820


394
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:22,820


395
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,920
Has anybody else been to seawater Motel after yesterday's show?

396
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:24,920


397
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:24,920


398
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:25,540
Yeah.

399
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,600
I was actually in a band with her for like a day.

400
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,020
And she was going to be the singer.

401
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,480
And I wanted to call the band Attractive Nuisance.

402
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,480
But the name was already taken.

403
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,320
Okay, now I know who we're talking about.

404
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,560
For sure.

405
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,220
But that was my first...

406
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,000
I seriously doubt she's listening.

407
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,960
But if she is, seriously, I love you.

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,120
Don't take it the wrong way.

409
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,000
She was so beautiful.

410
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:02,000
She was a great improv performer for my wide-angle, wide-screen video camera,

411
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,300
One Starwood Dawn, after the Bond fall.

412
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,420
That can never, ever be on YouTube.

413
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,220
For about 50 obvious jiggling reasons.

414
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,600
At dawn.

415
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,080
At the Starwood Festival.

416
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,160
Privacy.

417
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,040
Yeah, privacy is important.

418
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,480
Man, it's a great little 20-minute, 15-minute...

419
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,200
There was the Discordian Joy Juice was being passed around.

420
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,040
And I had a...

421
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,300
Discordians.

422
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,020
Discordians are all posers.

423
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,660
Anguish.

424
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,080
Anguish elixir.

425
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah, that's right.

426
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,560
It was the Anguish Syringe, I remember.

427
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:52,760
Wow.

428
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:04,660
And she and also Fat Mandy helped distribute the Anguish elixir as kind of an antidote to the Discordian Joy Juice.

429
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,960
And there's this talk about inside jokes.

430
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,440
Old, ancient, fake cult.

431
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,100
But man, it was fun.

432
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,440
It was.

433
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,340
Yes.

434
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,460
And the stuff tasted horrible.

435
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
Oh, God.

436
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,160
It was...

437
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,060
Vanilla?

438
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,180
Flavored vodka.

439
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,780
Vanilla-flavored vodka?

440
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,480
Vanilla-flavored vodka with some kind of...

441
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,020
What was it?

442
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,700
Some kind of juice?

443
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,600
Orange juice.

444
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,160
Orange juice.

445
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,600
Ooh, a flavored screwdriver.

446
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,820
In a nicely labeled jug.

447
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:46,580
And it was being handed out by a pair of nicely labeled jugs of at least two different helpers while I videotaped.

448
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,240
That's nothing...

449
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,140
Again, this is the kind of thing you can...

450
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,120
It's...

451
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,820
We have to wait until everybody...

452
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,100
Everybody's dead before we can release it.

453
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,800
But that won't be that long.

454
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,720
I can tell you the most disgusting thing I ever drank.

455
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,540
Mmm.

456
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,140
The most disgusting thing I ever drank.

457
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,840
And that was the exact diametric opposite of the new year.

458
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,220
It was the dead of summer.

459
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,360
And so we...

460
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:22,600
That reminds us that the arbitrary change of human-numbered dates is about to have a big...

461
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,660
numerical shift.

462
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,720
Right.

463
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,680
You know, I like this one holiday because everybody is forced to turn the page at the same time.

464
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,640
You don't have a choice.

465
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,240
It doesn't matter what god you worship.

466
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,760
True.

467
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,640
We all have to turn the page tonight.

468
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:36,960
Well, no.

469
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,920
I mean, the Chinese have all different...

470
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,360
No.

471
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,560
No.

472
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,020
No.

473
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,500
No.

474
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,920
No.

475
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,540
No.

476
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,020
No.

477
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,220
No.

478
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,440
No.

479
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,520
No.

480
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:43,560
No.

481
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:43,680
No.

482
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:43,740
No.

483
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:43,800
No.

484
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:43,800


485
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:43,920
No.

486
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,040
No.

487
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,320
No.

488
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,480
No.

489
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:44,540
No.

490
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:44,560
No.

491
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:44,780
No.

492
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,780
No.

493
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000


494
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000


495
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000


496
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000


497
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000


498
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000


499
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000


500
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000


501
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000


502
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,160
No.

503
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,200
No.

504
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,780
They have their own Lunar New Year celebration, but no, even the Chinese are going to start

505
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,580
calling it 2018.

506
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,080
In fact, they've already started because they're several hours ahead of us.

507
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,800
They're ahead of us.

508
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,160
Yeah.

509
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,160
In so many ways.

510
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,900
Damn it.

511
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,440
We've got to...

512
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,200
So it doesn't matter what country you're in.

513
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,740
Even countries that have different alternative calendars, they still use the Gregorian calendar.

514
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,260
Everybody on the face of the planet is turning a page.

515
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,340
This day, this night.

516
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,040
And that's why it's my favorite holiday.

517
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,560
After X Day.

518
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,000
We're all together as one.

519
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,660
Amen.

520
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,280
Turning the page.

521
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,040
We're all...

522
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,780
Everybody's going to be writing the wrong year on their rent checks tomorrow.

523
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,820
Yes.

524
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,780
Right.

525
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,120
Well, I'm not going to do that.

526
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,500
2018.

527
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm going to...

528
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,400
I'm going to remember.

529
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,240
Bacon 8 instead of...

530
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,300
Very good.

531
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,160
Well, you know, it's actually easier to make a...

532
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,680
However, with the 7, it is easy to correct because you can draw a line from the top of

533
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,220
the 7 down to the bottom and zigzag it over to the end of the 7 and create your own fancy

534
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,600
8 and say, oh, I meant it to be an 8.

535
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,240
Mm-hmm.

536
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,260
Exactly.

537
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,220
If I make a mistake, I can...

538
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,060
I never have to...

539
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,420
That's what means...

540
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,000
Only your banker knows for sure.

541
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,760
That's how you know it's going to be an easy year.

542
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,220
My God, man.

543
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,980
For you guys, it's only like 15 minutes to the...

544
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,860
Pudge flipping.

545
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,540
I know.

546
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,040
Hard to believe it.

547
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,020
Hard to believe it.

548
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,460
The countdown.

549
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,360
I have these people in the other room I really wish were in here with me now.

550
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,580
That's an hour and a half away.

551
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,300
That's an hour and a half away.

552
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,200
Jeremy told us a hell of a story and...

553
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,020
I'm waiting for the future.

554
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,800
I didn't get to hear nearly as much out of Tabitha as I wanted to hear.

555
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,560
I have Buddha over there who has not said a word on the air tonight.

556
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,060
Aww.

557
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,760
Aww.

558
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,220
We have Will who just showed up.

559
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,540
I haven't heard anything from him.

560
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,880
He's a jolly good fellow.

561
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,660
He hasn't said anything.

562
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,900
Are you talking about me?

563
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,280
Hello?

564
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm talking about a Will who's physically present in the station right now.

565
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,600
I have a question for all the people in the studio.

566
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,640
Okay.

567
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:11,500
In the year 2018, name three people that you think will be dead by the end.

568
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,620
That's a ridiculous question.

569
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:14,960
Whoa.

570
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,820
What?

571
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,040
What, a postulation as to someone's demise?

572
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,820
Oh, my.

573
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,220
The whole Deadpool thing?

574
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,160
I'm not into that.

575
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:29,280
The people that we think will be dead, all of the 104-year-olds.

576
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,140
The vast majority of them.

577
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,440
That's my guess.

578
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,800
By the end of the year, all of the 104-year-olds will be dead.

579
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,140
Mmm.

580
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,620
But I don't believe that.

581
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,420
I don't believe that.

582
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,960
I think a lot of them are going to live.

583
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,340
You know, that's just a...

584
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,780
You know, it's not really that informed.

585
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,500
I don't believe that.

586
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,500


587
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,200
Mmm.

588
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,340
I think the world might lose a queen or a prince.

589
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh.

590
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,640
Are you saying Queen Elizabeth or Prince Charles will die this year?

591
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,800
How about neither of these?

592
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,420
That's what I'm thinking.

593
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:03,800
Yes.

594
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,940
I'd be very surprised.

595
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,900
If it is either one, I'm claiming two of three.

596
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
You know what's really funny?

597
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,900
Like, Prince Charles is an example of, like, why cousins shouldn't marry.

598
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,360
Yeah.

599
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,160
Like, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.

600
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,600
Prince Philip were good-looking individuals.

601
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You know, they were very sharp-looking in their day.

602
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,420
That's because they outsourced their gene pool.

603
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,960
And then they have a child who's as ugly as Prince Charles.

604
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,260
Oh.

605
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,500
That's...

606
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,780
So, my new Star Wars fan theory is that Han Solo and Princess Leia are actually cousins,

607
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,560
which is the only explanation for how they could have a child as ugly as Adam Driver.

608
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,360
That's why he had the helmet.

609
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,300
Yeah.

610
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,220
Yeah.

611
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,580
Could a celebrity die this year?

612
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,480
Could a celebrity die?

613
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,620
Several have.

614
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,420
You mean they're mortal?

615
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,620
You think a celebrity might die this year?

616
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,060
I think we're going to see more than one day.

617
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,220
Could a rock star die?

618
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,980
Might one of them even die at the age of 27?

619
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,360
A classic movie star.

620
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,040
What about a classic movie star?

621
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,800
God, what if that happens?

622
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,820
I have another question.

623
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,700
Everybody's talking about it.

624
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,100
Oh, like the founder of Black Lives Matter just died at the age of 27.

625
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,280
Did anybody hear about that?

626
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,560
I can't remember her name.

627
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,960
Garner's daughter.

628
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,980
Erica Garner.

629
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,860
Yeah, yeah.

630
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,300
She just died at the age of 27 from a heart attack.

631
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:28,800
Hello?

632
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,100
Another 27?

633
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
From a heart attack.

634
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,300
That's hard to believe.

635
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,280
Is the word heart attack in quotes?

636
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,580
I don't know, man.

637
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:44,640
I could start putting conspiracy theories out there that the man is trying to silence her voice,

638
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,240
but I don't really believe that because she had a history of...

639
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,340
I've got a question.

640
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,220
What about that Vegas shooting?

641
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,080
That kind of guy.

642
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,700
That wrapped up quite neatly, wouldn't you think?

643
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,680
Well, yeah.

644
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,620
The guy shot a bunch of people and then the cops shot him.

645
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:56,800
Yep.

646
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,300
Or no, they shot himself.

647
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,560
That's all that happened.

648
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,460
And anybody that said otherwise mysteriously had a heart attack or car wreck or...

649
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,420
I like to joke.

650
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm making jokes, man.

651
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,360
I can believe someone can die of a heart attack.

652
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,760
I can believe someone can die of suicide.

653
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:18,100
I believe all kinds of deaths to be perfectly natural.

654
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,380
Oh, that's a great thought.

655
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,980
Forbidden me.

656
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,300
Every year.

657
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,920
Oh, right.

658
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,700
Death.

659
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,240
I predict lots of death.

660
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,640
What kind of collisions will they come up with the next exciting episode of America versus the world?

661
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:38,440
I predict earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and lots and lots of people dying.

662
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,020
That's my prediction for 2018.

663
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,240
I also predict that a lot of babies are going to be born and they will grow up to ask why,

664
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,840
oh, why parents did you bring me into a world?

665
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,380
like this.

666
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,040
Because it's just going to get worse.

667
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,560
I never asked

668
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,320
that question, but then...

669
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,760
Well, your generation had it

670
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,280
pretty easy.

671
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,800
Aside from the whole Vietnam draft thing,

672
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,140
your generation had it pretty easy.

673
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,200
Oh, no kidding.

674
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,620
Oh, my God.

675
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,740
It's like being an emperor

676
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,640
or a king

677
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,660
in most ages.

678
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,720
Housing was cheap.

679
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,540
College was cheap.

680
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,740
Once it got past that,

681
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,180
wages were higher.

682
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,400
We had total, utter freedom

683
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,760
to destroy every single

684
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,740
people in your generation

685
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,680
to ever depend on.

686
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
You got to have free love

687
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,240
before AIDS came about.

688
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,880
That's true.

689
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,960
A lot of people in my generation

690
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,460
were warning.

691
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,680
They spent their lives

692
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,660
warning about all the stuff

693
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,920
that's going on now.

694
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,880
Hold on.

695
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,260
Hold on.

696
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:48,660
Hold on.

697
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,020
Hold on.

698
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,300
Hold on.

699
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,900
Hold on.

700
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,680
I don't know who hung up.

701
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,300
I don't know who we lost.

702
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,480
Okay.

703
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,640
I'll pick the right button.

704
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,420
Am I here?

705
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,680
Hello?

706
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,660
Yes, you're still here.

707
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,060
So we have...

708
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,740
I am here, but I would like to

709
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,860
ask one question

710
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,240
before I leave on this

711
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,900
wonderful dawn of a new age.

712
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,460
I have one question.

713
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,700
Why not both?

714
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,160
¿Por qué no los dos?

715
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,320
That's the best question.

716
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,780
I've heard this all the time.

717
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,580
¿Por qué no los dos?

718
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,120
Move to the front of the class.

719
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,920
And on that,

720
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,440
I would like to say

721
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,220
thank you for having me

722
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,840
on your show.

723
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,260
All right.

724
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,580
Thank you.

725
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,700
And all the members

726
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,420
of your cast and crew,

727
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,220
thank you for everyone

728
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,340
in the studio.

729
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,960
And I appreciate

730
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,400
every moment

731
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,560
that you've given me

732
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,180
some brief thought

733
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,140
or levity

734
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,300
or some distraction

735
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,520
from the unnamed crap

736
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,700
going on in my world.

737
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,380
Thank you for listening.

738
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,500
Thank you for listening

739
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,180
to your podcast

740
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,780
has made me feel

741
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,520
a lot better

742
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
about a lot of crap.

743
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,200
How dare you call this

744
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,760
a podcast?

745
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,620
This is a broadcast.

746
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,780
Damn it.

747
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,280
Podcasts are anathema

748
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,040
to what we do here.

749
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
I tell you what, sir.

750
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,280
I live in Texas

751
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,520
and your radio broadcast

752
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,600
is fairly difficult

753
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,660
for me to receive

754
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,520
on the regular.

755
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,500
But it's not a podcast.

756
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,960
It's a live stream

757
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,500
in your case.

758
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,980
When I listen to things

759
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,280
from your podcast, sir,

760
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,380
when I listen to snippets

761
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:14,600
from your show...

762
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,240
Oh, my God.

763
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,220
Listen, I don't know

764
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,940
which line you're on,

765
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,680
so I'm going to hang up

766
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,300
on somebody here.

767
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,480
I'm here.

768
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,620
I have found you

769
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,520
through podcasts, sir.

770
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Okay, well, thank you.

771
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,540
And I would like to thank you

772
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,780
for finding your way

773
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,320
to my ears.

774
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,040
Well, it is my pleasure.

775
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,260
And for all the people

776
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,360
that have brought

777
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,240
some entertainment

778
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,880
into my life.

779
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,800
So you all

780
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,340
have a wonderful evening

781
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,940
and thank you very much,

782
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,880
especially Reverend Sting,

783
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,160
for being alive

784
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,120
and near to my heart.

785
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,180
All right.

786
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,760
I'm not sure

787
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,000
which line you're on,

788
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,740
so I might hang up

789
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,660
on the wrong person here

790
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,240
when you hang up.

791
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,800
All right.

792
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,160
Well, I will leave you all

793
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,660
by saying,

794
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,660
All right.

797
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,940
All right.

798
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,740
Let's hope it's

799
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,320
the right button.

800
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,700
Good evening.

801
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,560
And...

802
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,520
Who's still there?

803
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,420
It hurts when they...

804
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:01,960
Yes.

805
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,420
It is.

806
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,080
When they pull out.

807
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,840
Oh, right.

808
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,660
I picked the right line.

809
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,640
Guys, we have...

810
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,500
We have...

811
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,120
How many minutes

812
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,880
until the countdown?

813
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,920
Five minutes

814
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,440
and 40 seconds

815
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,280
left in this year.

816
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,200
Good Lord, man.

817
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,140
Good Lord, man.

818
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,380
It's hard to believe.

819
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,780
It really is.

820
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,740
The days and the years,

821
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,600
they just fly by.

822
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,000
So what's on your mind, Keith?

823
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,980
We haven't heard much from you.

824
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,100
I don't have much to say.

825
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,080
No, it's just another year.

826
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,160
Just another year.

827
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,320
Just another show.

828
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,360
Just another show.

829
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,160
Glad to be up here.

830
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,940
Glad to be up here.

831
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,420
I'm glad to have everybody here, too, man.

832
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,340
Glad to have all the food

833
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,520
and glad to have...

834
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,960
Yeah, the last several New Years,

835
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,360
I've just spent, like, alone

836
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,060
in the dark, so...

837
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,560
I don't know what I've done

838
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,340
the last couple years.

839
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,040
You forgot?

840
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,260
That sounds like Princess We

841
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,780
in the background.

842
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,500
Hey, Princess We.

843
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,440
Hey, Keith.

844
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,580
Oh, I'm so glad.

845
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,240
Always a pleasure.

846
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:48,980
I'm so glad to see you guys.

847
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,340
We're getting all verklempt about it.

848
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:53,900
Uh-oh.

849
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,320
Who's verklempt?

850
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,460
You should steal some

851
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,920
of Shearer's antidepressants.

852
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,960
Yeah, I see Sergio

853
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,200
in the other room

854
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,380
is breaking out the bubbly.

855
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,900
Oh, man.

856
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,500
Wow.

857
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,040
I think we've got some

858
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,440
sparkling cider.

859
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,240
Some fine champagne.

860
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,120
Or something

861
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,280
in the next room over.

862
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,420
Oh, we're gonna have to celebrate.

863
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,000
Is there gonna be a countdown?

864
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
There will be a countdown.

865
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,820
I'm looking at the official

866
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,600
atomic clock right now.

867
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,320
Counting down until our balls drop.

868
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,420
Oh, yeah.

869
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,640
It'll happen in a year right now.

870
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,780
No, man, like, you know,

871
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,820
we'll, you know,

872
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,880
like I said, you know,

873
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,000
Times Square,

874
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,160
they drop the ball once a year.

875
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,160
Is that a sassyism?

876
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,020
Wasn't that his thing?

877
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,520
The balls, like,

878
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,460
balls dropping at midnight

879
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:42,920
or something?

880
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,800
It sounds like a sweet-ass

881
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,520
sassafrasis.

882
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:45,660
There's a long list

883
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,280
of sassies.

884
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,760
I still have.

885
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,980
I gotta be very careful

886
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,960
about violating sassies' words.

887
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,160
Because as we all know,

888
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,880
if you say the wrong thing

889
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,480
at the wrong time,

890
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,660
he might call you up

891
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,720
and threaten to bust your teeth out

892
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,740
and play him like a xylophone.

893
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,420
I believe that there are

894
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,780
certain terms that I coined.

895
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,840
And I don't remember ever

896
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,620
having heard a reference to,

897
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,400
what's the big deal?

898
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,560
They drop the ball once a year.

899
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,740
I drop the ball every week.

900
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,200
I believe I coined that.

901
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,520
Yeah, I've never heard

902
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:18,680
anybody else say that.

903
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,760
That's me, all right?

904
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,200
Like, we're better at dropping

905
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,460
the ball than the Browns are.

906
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,740
Like, it makes it look good.

907
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,180
Good.

908
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,600
And, um...

909
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,020
Also, I can't remember

910
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,400
anybody saying serial caller

911
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,060
before me.

912
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,360
I mean, I...

913
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,240
No, that's been around

914
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,640
for a long time.

915
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,200
That's been a long time.

916
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:35,500
Okay.

917
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:35,720
Yeah, yeah.

918
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,300
Serial callers go back

919
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,600
to, like, Waynestead.

920
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,100
Okay.

921
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,100
Way back.

922
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,320
I've heard the term

923
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,180
being said back then.

924
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,640
There was a time then

925
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,900
when people, uh,

926
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,940
when the expression

927
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,880
fell out of favor.

928
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:46,880
Probably.

929
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,320
Because I,

930
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,560
I did not hear that

931
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,020
in the night,

932
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,960
like, the late 90s,

933
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,420
early aughts.

934
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:50,960
That's because we

935
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,920
developed gluten problems.

936
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,640
Uh.

937
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,540
And serial didn't agree

938
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,160
with us anymore.

939
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,660
Right.

940
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,200
Oh, yeah.

941
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,120
Oh, yeah.

942
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,580
Oh, yeah.

943
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,660
But the one thing

944
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,340
that you said...

945
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:00,600
Oh, yeah.

946
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,160
Como va?

947
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,400
It caught my ear.

948
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,580
You're gonna flip

949
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,280
the calendar.

950
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,960
I kept saying...

951
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,620
Hey, we have, uh...

952
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,860
Is Sassy coming down?

953
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,500
We don't have Sassy

954
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:08,840
here right now.

955
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,600
We have one more caller

956
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,380
coming in here.

957
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,100
You're on the radio.

958
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,180
How's it going, guys?

959
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,020
It's almost a new year.

960
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,160
Almost a new year.

961
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,120
We have, uh,

962
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,880
just, uh,

963
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,760
two and a half minutes

964
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,100
left here.

965
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,620
Oh, my God.

966
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,020
I'm counting.

967
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,660
Yeah, people are

968
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,720
actually not over here

969
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,100
in Cleveland.

970
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,540
All right.

971
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,280
Everybody, everybody

972
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,920
talk at once.

973
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,560
Okay.

974
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,180
I'd be happy to speak

975
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,020
here at once

976
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,220
and, um, say something

977
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,180
and accept...

978
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,560
New caller.

979
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,300
It doesn't work

980
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,020
when I'm the only one.

981
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,680
Oh, okay.

982
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,380
New caller,

983
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,340
what did you want to say?

984
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,660
I don't know.

985
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,380
I just wanted to get

986
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:36,820
in here and talk

987
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,300
with you guys.

988
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,220
All right.

989
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,140
Well, uh,

990
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,420
the program will be over

991
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,560
before too long.

992
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,620
But that's okay

993
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,440
because there's another

994
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,020
one starting.

995
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,580
Exactly.

996
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,680
This is an all

997
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,800
night rager.

998
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,000
Not a rager, really.

999
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,280
No.

1000
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,360
We're actually being

1001
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,720
very neat and tidy.

1002
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,420
Mm-hmm.

1003
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,940
Control your hormones.

1004
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,980
We will leave the place

1005
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,080
cleaner than we found it.

1006
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,840
That's doubtful

1007
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,520
because we can't get

1008
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
access to the vacuum.

1009
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,120
Oh, really?

1010
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,580
Yeah.

1011
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,000
Really?

1012
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,340
We did a vacuum cleaner now?

1013
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,300
Well, I mean,

1014
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,720
it's kind of...

1015
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,860
Two minutes

1016
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,520
to the new world.

1017
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,160
The new age starts

1018
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,040
in two minutes.

1019
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,980
Two minutes.

1020
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,500
It's a new age.

1021
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,020
It's a new age.

1022
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,200
It's a new age.

1023
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,840
I mean, I'll go in.

1024
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
What about the...

1025
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,920
Yeah, what is the age

1026
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,540
of Aquarius?

1027
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,520
Anyway, I think

1028
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,620
that's long past.

1029
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,620
I'm sorry.

1030
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,840
That one came and went.

1031
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,840
It was a little bit...

1032
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,040
It didn't quite live up

1033
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,380
to its rep.

1034
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:28,880
Really?

1035
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,860
You mean astrology

1036
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,920
proved to be incorrect?

1037
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,060
Well,

1038
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,200
well,

1039
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,500
look,

1040
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,120
look,

1041
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,280
the new age starts

1042
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,020
in a minute and a half

1043
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,540
or something.

1044
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
I don't have a second.

1045
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,180
Oh, we have...

1046
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,000
We have one...

1047
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,300
minute...

1048
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,180
left...

1049
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,380
as of now.

1050
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,160
All right.

1051
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,760
So our official countdown

1052
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:53,960
is on.

1053
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,740
Our official countdown

1054
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,120
is on.

1055
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,980
It's the last minute

1056
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,480
of the year.

1057
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,340
WCSB, synesthesia,

1058
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,880
New Year's Eve,

1059
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,060
spectacular, spectacular.

1060
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,320
Ex-crap-a-ganza.

1061
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,580
Ex-crap-a-ganza.

1062
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh, man,

1063
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,580
we got crap

1064
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,220
coming up next.

1065
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,000
Don't you dare

1066
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,760
turn off your radio

1067
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,180
because the festivities

1068
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,800
are continuing

1069
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,800
well into the night here.

1070
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,740
So,

1071
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,480
anything anybody

1072
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,200
wants to say

1073
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,660
before the world ends?

1074
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:16,660


1075
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:16,660


1076
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,700
Any last final,

1077
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,720
really brief,

1078
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,560
brief thoughts?

1079
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,540
Uh, goodbye,

1080
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,160
370.

1081
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,480
If the radio

1082
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,900
suddenly shuts off,

1083
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,680
don't panic.

1084
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,640
Yeah,

1085
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,520
I can't wait

1086
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,800
till this year is over.

1087
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,700
Oh, yes, okay,

1088
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,780
Tabitha, Jeremy,

1089
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,580
back in the room

1090
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,140
here with us.

1091
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,680
This might be

1092
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,520
the year that actually

1093
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,620
is Y2K.

1094
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,520
We're all together.

1095
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,600
We're all together.

1096
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,940
Or it might be

1097
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,320
1997.

1098
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,700
Where's Potsy?

1099
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,480
Where the hell's Potsy?

1100
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,460
He's the dog!

1101
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,720
Or it might be

1102
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,280
1997.

1103
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:41,960
Ten,

1104
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,320
nine,

1105
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,200
eight,

1106
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,340
seven,

1107
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,280
six,

1108
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,480
five,

1109
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,160
four,

1110
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,440
three,

1111
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,340
two,

1112
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,420
one,

1113
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
Happy New Year!

1114
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,240
Yeah.

1115
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,680
2018.

1116
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,220
Anti-regnant

1117
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,740
stuff, man,

1118
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:02,920
yeah.

1119
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,160
Woo!

1120
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,220
We made it.

1121
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,680
Oh, you're not

1122
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:08,940
going to be able

1123
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,340
to play that.

1124
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,400
Did I miss it?

1125
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,380
Did I miss it?

1126
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, missed it.

1127
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,220
Oh, yeah, missed it.

1128
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,160
I saw a fight there.

1129
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,780
Oh, yes.

1130
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,800
Yeah, you're not,

1131
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,440
you're late.

1132
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,840
You're late for 2018.

1133
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,400
Yeah, Sinister,

1134
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,080
you can't play something

1135
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,160
off the computer

1136
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,080
while the audio file

1137
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,400
is going.

1138
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:22,860
Can we repeat it?

1139
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,100
Yeah, hang on.

1140
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,360
Rewind it for Potsy.

1141
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,320
That's okay.

1142
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,960
You can show up

1143
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,400
once on

1144
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:30,960
five,

1145
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,180
four,

1146
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:32,880
three,

1147
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,660
two.

1148
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,700
Tune up Chicago.

1149
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,860
They got a thing

1150
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,480
where they raise

1151
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,400
something instead of

1152
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,680
crying.

1153
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,860
Oh, wow.

1154
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
All right, folks.

1155
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,080
Stars.

1156
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
Thank you very much

1157
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,460
for tuning in here.

1158
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,020
This has been

1159
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,400
Sinesthesia on WCSB.

1160
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,540
Stay tuned for a very

1161
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,420
special episode of

1162
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:48,880
Crap Radio.

1163
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,180
The New Year's Eve

1164
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,620
spectacular

1165
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,500
craptacular

1166
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:52,800
continues

1167
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,980
in just a moment.

1168
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,560
I got to let you

1169
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,340
callers go, okay?

1170
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,260
Have a good one, man.

1171
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,900
Don't go away.

1172
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,800
We'll be back.

1173
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:00,980
Thank you.

1174
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,520
And until,

1175
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,380
until next week,

1176
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,680
until next year,

1177
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,880
whatever,

1178
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,740
keep it surreal.

1179
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,240
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1180
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,140
As you probably surmised,

1181
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,160
that was the last show

1182
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,000
of 2017

1183
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,860
of Dr. Sinister's

1184
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,600
Radio Sinesthesia.

1185
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,040
And we called in

1186
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,140
in the last half hour.

1187
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,920
And now that that's done

1188
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,240
and we want to put it out

1189
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,500
on New Year's Day,

1190
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,260
I needed to fill out

1191
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,140
the rest of the hour.

1192
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,960
And luckily,

1193
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,900
we have a ton of new,

1194
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,700
what you might call

1195
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,400
media barrage

1196
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,380
of media barrage

1197
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:46,380


1198
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:46,380


1199
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:46,920
edits

1200
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,700
that were sent in

1201
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,360
on a CD

1202
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,860
from our old friend

1203
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,320
Cool Hand Chris,

1204
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,360
also known as

1205
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,500
Christian Blatter.

1206
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,620
And he sent some,

1207
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,200
some really weird music also

1208
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,040
and a DVD

1209
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,180
that we haven't seen yet.

1210
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,600
But this is a pretty wild,

1211
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,220
old school,

1212
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,980
subgenius style

1213
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,740
media barrage

1214
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,760
from Cool Hand Chris

1215
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,740
and happy,

1216
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:15,740
whatever,

1217
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,800
year this really is

1218
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,080
to you

1219
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,200
and all our listeners

1220
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,080
and contributors

1221
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,560
and J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

1222
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,440
Price Bob,

1223
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,480
Hail Connie.

1224
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,000
Let's go.

1225
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,560
What do you expect us

1226
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
modern mothers to do?

1227
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,440
Quit trying to be butterflies.

1228
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,060
Get back to the business

1229
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,840
of being mothers

1230
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,860
like your mother

1231
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,540
and your grandmother

1232
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,180
and generations of mothers

1233
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:41,820
before them.

1234
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,700
I haven't been devoting

1235
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,200
enough time

1236
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,140
to just being a mother.

1237
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:45,660
Oh,

1238
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,740
mother,

1239
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,740
it isn't your fault,

1240
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,200
it's mine.

1241
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,560
Oh,

1242
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,900
I've been so stupid.

1243
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,900
It's all my fault.

1244
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,620
I should have realized

1245
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,820
something was wrong.

1246
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,440
What was in that hypo?

1247
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,880
Talk, talk, talk, talk,

1248
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,460
talk a revolution

1249
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,560
and you're out to entertain.

1250
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,820
I have a message for thee.

1251
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,260
Hypocrite.

1252
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,840
Your soul is dead.

1253
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,560
Don't give me

1254
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,540
your political bullshit.

1255
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,560
Something about revolution.

1256
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,980
Put the knife in the back.

1257
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,820
How can you fuck

1258
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,800
the only people

1259
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,380
who have a gift?

1260
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,480
Feels like the guy next.

1261
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,360
Stop it.

1262
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,560
Your whole shit

1263
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,400
sound like coward.

1264
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,900
The world isn't quite as simple

1265
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,760
as we'd like it to be.

1266
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,740
But I hope it makes you

1267
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,580
very rich.

1268
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,680
You know,

1269
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,320
does he really,

1270
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,460
truly love me?

1271
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,440
Oh, no.

1272
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,760
I ain't getting no cut.

1273
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,600
No percentage.

1274
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,660
Zero percentage.

1275
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,480
Zero.

1276
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,660
No dough.

1277
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,340
Bitch of mine

1278
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,200
better not keep it done.

1279
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,220
Life ain't fair,

1280
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,000
you know what I'm saying?

1281
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,740
Done.

1282
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:37,860
Done.

1283
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,140
I had part of the money.

1284
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,400
She had part of the money.

1285
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,580
That's like

1286
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,440
a divided situation.

1287
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,400
There might be

1288
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,320
a rich man or something.

1289
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,280
She don't even know

1290
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,820
how to be around

1291
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,540
this rich man.

1292
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,040
She don't know

1293
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,020
how to act or to seduce

1294
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,560
this rich man

1295
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,340
because it ain't been taught her.

1296
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,980
He might want to

1297
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,760
afford 50 bucks

1298
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,660
or 100 bucks,

1299
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,320
but he come in front

1300
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,880
of my hoes,

1301
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,700
he gonna get broke

1302
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,600
for damn near

1303
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,620
whatever he has.

1304
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,880
What's happening here

1305
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,780
is also happening

1306
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,620
to some extent

1307
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,620
at virtually

1308
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,320
every other

1309
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,340
American installation

1310
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,040
in Vietnam.

1311
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,580
Recent surveys estimate

1312
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,260
that well over 50%

1313
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,940
of the soldiers

1314
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,480
in Vietnam

1315
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,960
use marijuana.

1316
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,200
You get really stoned.

1317
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,740
Then, you know,

1318
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,020
who like,

1319
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,900
who cares about the war?

1320
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,460
This war.

1321
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,080
It is time

1322
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
for an honest look

1323
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,100
at the problem of order

1324
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,120
in the United States.

1325
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,080
So I pledge to you,

1326
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,540
we shall have order

1327
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,860
in the United States.

1328
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,000
Star Wars Gangsta Rap.

1329
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,380
Star Wars Gangsta Rap.

1330
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:15,880
A lie

1331
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,620
Another Dark Jedi

1332
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,860
He will join us or die

1333
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,140
We got Jeff Start

1334
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,500
We got Jeff Start

1335
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,640
We got Jeff Start

1336
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,740
We got Jeff Start

1337
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,940
We got Jeff Start

1338
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,180
We got Jeff Start

1339
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,340
We got Jeff Start

1340
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:28,460
We got Jeff Start

1341
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,460
We got Jeff Start

1342
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:29,960
Jeff Start

1343
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,900
Man you know that we got it

1344
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,360
Jeff Start

1345
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,180
Man you know that we got it

1346
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,480
Jeff!

1347
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,040
Get your ass over here right now

1348
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,920
from hooking around

1349
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,340
with that damn Lance Beard.

1350
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,160
Weren't the two droids

1351
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
I asked you to clean, boys?

1352
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,280
Clean your room!

1353
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,220
My Lord,

1354
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,540
My Lord,

1355
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,500
Is that legal?

1356
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,740
I won't let it little.

1357
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:44,140
I won't let it little.

1358
00:38:44,540 --> 00:39:14,520
I won't let it little.

1359
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,800
Show you I will.

1360
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,320
You take a little butter.

1361
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,040
It's just going to be you and me.

1362
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,720
And make it all real nice.

1363
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,520
Red leader, red leader, fuck it back.

1364
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,960
Add a little bit of the force.

1365
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,560
You know it feels alright.

1366
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,900
Five, red five, stand by.

1367
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,760
Three, two, one.

1368
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,840
Yee-ha!

1369
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,660
Alright kid, let's blow this thing and go home, alright?

1370
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,760
Stay on target.

1371
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,400
After the spell.

1372
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,280
Everything is back to normal.

1373
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,520
I think, I think I can go back to normal.

1374
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,600
I'm trying to destroy the world again.

1375
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,700
Would you consider yourself a revolutionary?

1376
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,840
Well no, but I do believe corporations rob us of our dignity and independence.

1377
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,540
And that these systems must be ripped down, burnt down, or leveled by any force necessary.

1378
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,700
Everyone stay calm.

1379
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,000
Because we're all doomed!

1380
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,800
I don't make monkeys, I just train them.

1381
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,020
Thank you, you are cleared through voice print identification.

1382
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,960
Goose-stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burn.

1383
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:28,380
This is a hybrid, this is across bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, featherbed bent, and northern California, Sinsomea.

1384
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:38,080
The amazing stuff about this is that you can play 36 holes on it in the afternoon, take it home, and just get stoned to the bejesus belt that night on this stuff.

1385
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:44,520
It would appear that the government at the moment is practicing a lot of this wrong.

1386
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,920
It's a religion in absentia for many folks.

1387
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,120
It was a trendy thing.

1388
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,900
Well we're actually the conspiracy, you've always heard of the conspiracy, right?

1389
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,260
Yeah.

1390
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,020
Well we're the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

1391
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,460
And we've decided to come out in the open.

1392
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,620
You're the unnamed source.

1393
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,760
That's us.

1394
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,280
Well you certainly have heard of the Public Criminization Society.

1395
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:12,340
The conspiracy has been trying to squelch abnormality since time began, practically.

1396
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,500
It goes so far.

1397
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:24,260
It goes so far back and it's so ingrained in our culture that it's gotten to where the conspiracy leaders don't have to do anything because it's an endless cycle of normalcy.

1398
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:39,700
Even kids with latent subgenius genes are born, but they're raised by the conspiracy making them want to be popular, raising them to be happy with mediocrity, with everything being the same.

1399
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,840
I am now learning to apply creative and corrective procedures,

1400
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,500
and to bring back to normalcy the world of the conspiracy.

1401
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:44,780
I am now learning to apply creative and corrective procedures,

1402
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,980
and to bring back to normalcy the world of the conspiracy.

1403
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,780
And to bring back to normalcy the world of the conspiracy.

1404
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,460
I can easily do anything that I want to do.

1405
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,760
I can.

1406
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,440
I can.

1407
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,360
I'm a winner.

1408
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,000
I can.

1409
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,000


1410
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,520
Are you abnormal?

1411
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,400
Then you are probably better than most people.

1412
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:09,680


1413
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,400
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

1414
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:12,920
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

1415
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,220
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

1416
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:32,120
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

1417
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,120
Yes, you tool shall молод.

1418
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,120


1419
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,120


1420
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,120

1428
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:57,520
Thank you.

1429
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,080
Thank you.

1430
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,900
Thank you.

00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,720
Thank you.

1432
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,620
Thank you.

1433
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Thank you.

00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,700
Thank you.

00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,240
Thank you.

00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,000
Thank you.

1437
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,400
Thank you.

1438
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,860
Your powers a weak old man.

1439
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,040
You should not have come back.

1440
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,400
You can't win.

1441
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,980
You can't win.

1442
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,760
I'm gonna kick your body, hit him on the side.

1443
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,380
Oh, I want to see him on the side.

1444
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,080
Oh, I say, oh, my side.

1445
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,300
Oh, I want to kick your body.

1446
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,260
You cannot win.

1447
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,960
If you strike me down, I'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

1448
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,800
Show you I will.

1449
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,080
Show you I will.

1450
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,720
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, show you I will.

1451
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,020
R2? R2?

1452
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,400
Your mind is a bitch and you know it.

1453
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,960
I want those plans.

1454
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,740
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1455
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,380
You've got a bad feeling about this.

1456
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,120
Surprise.

1457
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,460
I am your father.

1458
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:46,960
No!

1459
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,640
It's not true.

1460
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,440
Oh, yeah, it is, baby.

1461
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,500
What makes you qualified to be a reporter?

1462
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,700
I'm willing to violate anyone's privacy for my personal gain and then claim with a straight face that the public has a right to know.

1463
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,580
Only a fool tries to fool Mr. T.

1464
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,780
Strength is irrelevant. Resistance is futile. We wish to improve ourselves.

1465
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,480
We will add your biological intelligence.

1466
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,540
We will add your technological distinctiveness to our own.

1467
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,160
Your culture will adapt to service ours.

1468
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,240
He don't know me very well, do he?

1469
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,280
Now listen here, you mullet.

1470
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,460
Why don't you just light your tampon and blow your box apart?

1471
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,100
Because it's the only bang you're ever gonna get, sweetheart.

1472
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:38,380
I was piloting the Black Ops missions in the jungles of North Vietnam where you were sucking on your mama's tit at Woodstock.

1473
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,560
Don't lecture me about war.

1474
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,040
Laugh for while you can, monkey boy.

1475
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,380
Headline edition July 8, 1947.

1476
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,260
The Army Air Forces has announced that a flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.

1477
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:56,920
Army officers say the missile, found sometime last week, has been inspected at Roswell, New Mexico and sent to...

1478
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,400
Bob?

1479
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,060
...for further inspection.

1480
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:08,400
I smell conspiracy in every nook, cube, and plasticoid cranny.

1481
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,380
I smell conspiracy.

1482
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,240
I smell conspiracy.

1483
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,400
Lay your hands on the radio! Lay your hands on the radio and home!

1484
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,660
At last I have control of your radio tubes!

1485
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,100
And I do too.

1486
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,440
Good. This is Ren Huat.

1487
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,260
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

1488
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,660
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

1489
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,640
Keep listening, you idiot!

1490
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1491
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,800
Else I shall kill you!

1492
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,460
Take four red capsules.

1493
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,420
In ten minutes, take two more.

1494
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,260
They think they'll see an assault coming.

1495
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,420
You recognize that car?

1496
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,780
Even their computer is safe from outside attack.

1497
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,220
So they think.

1498
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,440
They've added a commercial virus protection program to keep their files from being frozen or destroyed by an outsider.

1499
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,700
They don't know that the real attack began weeks earlier at a government computer center.

1500
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,160
Federal agents have already entered that farmhouse through the virus protection program itself.

1501
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:23,180
The software update that loads the virus protection program into the farmhouse computer includes a so-called Trojan horse.

1502
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,980
A set of hidden instructions that lodge in the computer.

1503
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:36,940
This piece of software installs itself into their system and sends a copy of everything on their computer to the federal agents at night.

1504
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:44,300
Along with the Trojan horse is a logical bomb.

1505
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:49,180
It's another set of hidden priorities waiting to go off at the right moment.

1506
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,540
That moment signals the start of the federal assault.

1507
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,400
By flashing a new warrant on the farmhouse computer.

1508
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,440
Telling the occupants to surrender.

1509
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:07,680
And to throw the institution down and climb up the high пост yeah yeah.

1510
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:07,680


1511
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:07,680


1512
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:07,680


1513
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,540
It freezes on the screen.

1514
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,580
The computer refuses to function further,

1515
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,040
ignores all further keyboard and mouse commands.

1516
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,460
The night passes without further event.

1517
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,720
By morning, nothing much has changed,

1518
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,000
but that, too, is deceptive.

1519
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,820
400 yards away,

1520
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,940
two snipers are lying out in the open,

1521
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,100
disguised by metamorphic camouflage.

1522
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,300
The chemicals in their uniforms change color

1523
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,320
to match the light of the scene behind them.

1524
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,160
Up close, there's only a slight shimmering effect.

1525
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,460
From a distance, they're invisible.

1526
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,040
As the two snipers move closer for the final assault,

1527
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,660
their camouflage changes.

1528
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,240
When they move from shade to sunlight,

1529
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,560
the pattern lightens.

1530
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,700
As they pass a shadow, it darkens again.

1531
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,280
The modeled effect lets them neatly blend in

1532
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,100
with their surroundings.

1533
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,200
Even at 20 yards, the lookout sees almost nothing.

1534
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,980
If he sees anything, he'll probably see nothing.

1535
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,100
But if he sees something, he'll probably think

1536
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,580
it's just rising heat waves.

1537
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,280
I bet they can hear the noise coming from that engine

1538
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,120
on that vehicle, even though they can't see it.

1539
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,880
Underneath those waves is a light armored vehicle,

1540
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,080
also hidden by active camouflage.

1541
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,100
It's wrapped on all sides with millions of fiber optic cables

1542
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,500
that send a picture to one side of the vehicle

1543
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,080
of what's on the other side.

1544
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,980
Meanwhile, a helicopter circles overhead.

1545
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,680
That's nothing new.

1546
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,260
Helicopters have been here for weeks, patrolling the compound perimeter.

1547
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,660
The helicopter drops a canister behind the house.

1548
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,460
Moments later, it drops a second canister in the yard.

1549
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,180
A few hours later, after dark, a preset timer in one canister

1550
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,200
sets off a brief crackling sound.

1551
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,040
And behind that, a

1552
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:35,360
suddenly, every electrical device in the compound goes out.

1553
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,840
Lights, appliances, computers, they all flicker and die,

1554
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,620
fried by a burst of electromagnetic pulse.

1555
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,040
The occupants know something is happening.

1556
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,460
Stay calm.

1557
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:55,180
But what? There's another crackle, a burst of EMP from the second canister.

1558
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,020
Every light in the compound goes out for good as the backup generator dies.

1559
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:09,100
Inside the light-armored vehicle, the assault team gets ready for the final operation.

1560
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,280
In their own camouflage, they quickly cover the last few yards to the compound.

1561
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,120
Now that it's night, the two snipers who have been outside all day join them, working their way to the main entrance.

1562
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,800
Instead of trying to break down the metal door, they spray it with a chemical that turns it as brittle as a cracker.

1563
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,060
One push brings it down.

1564
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:44,380
They toss in a flashbang, a distraction device that works like a giant firecracker.

1565
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,440
A second grenade fills the interior with a sedative agent.

1566
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:06,480
Before the occupants can regain their bearings, every corner of the room is filled with sedative-laden smoke.

1567
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,880
The assault teams are protected by their jumpsuits and gas masks.

1568
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:17,760
The chemical quickly subdues everyone, adults and children, or puts them to sleep entirely.

1569
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,900
One man and one woman have been in another room, unaffected by the sedative.

1570
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,040
An agent catches the woman with a snare net.

1571
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,100
A stream of pepper-laced aqueous foam appears out of nowhere to cover the fleeing man.

1572
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,580
He falls to the ground from the pain.

1573
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,120
Inside, team members begin flex-cuffing their frightened, groggy targets.

1574
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,440
Suddenly, one more man bursts from a closet.

1575
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,480
Carrying a gun.

1576
00:56:53,540 --> 00:57:01,560
That shot was a liquid-filled 12-gauge round that bursts on impact, dissipating the energy and spraying the target with pepper spray.

1577
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:04,740
Help!

1578
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:06,620
Help!

1579
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,640
Help!

1580
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:10,920
Help!

1581
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:12,740
Help!

1582
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,280
Sir, it's just a tip.

1583
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,820
If we leave this place early, there will be no end to myself.

1584
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:24,820


1585
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:24,820


1586
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,100
We don't come to

1587
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,060
No, come on, don't leave.

1588
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:30,540
We give the top ру

1589
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,040
What's it like...

1590
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,520
What's it like there?

1591
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:34,920


1592
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,480
drinking 46 packs?

1593
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:35,480


1594
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:35,480


1595
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,880
What's it like to be dead in a żyłowieus second?

1596
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:44,000
not worth anything to yourself, and not worth anything to the rest of us?

1597
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,260
What's it like...

1598
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:47,580
What's it like...

1599
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,200
How was it?

1600
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:48,440
transformed and recovered?

1601
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:48,440


1602
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:48,440


1603
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,340
You see things in life and you'd be surprised what you see.

1604
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,360
Life, your whole life is changes.

1605
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,780
You go through changes in your life.

1606
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,960
One second, you got it made.

1607
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,100
Next second, you're down in the dumps.

1608
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,920
And it goes back and forth throughout your whole life.

1609
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,760
One second, you got the most beautiful girl in the world.

1610
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,240
Next second, you don't even have a girlfriend no more.

1611
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,800
And it goes back and forth and back and forth, you know?

1612
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,820
And this is life, man.

1613
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,680
It's changes.

1614
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,960
This is what you got to go through throughout your whole lifetime.

1615
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,140
Never, never, never land.

1616
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,560
Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man

1617
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:40,240
who even now fight to survive somewhere beyond the heavens.

1618
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:45,180
We realize that you have the ability,

1619
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,080
and it's not below you people,

1620
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:48,420
to decide.

1621
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,040
Do something like erase all evidences.

1622
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,820
Why do you have the press so far back?

1623
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,660
You can give me any kind of crap you want.

1624
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,440
I know.

1625
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,240
You know.

1626
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,380
The reason we're not talking to the press

1627
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,640
is you people have got to cover your butts from what you did.

1628
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,560
And that's what's going on here.

1629
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,400
We interrupt this program with a special bulletin.

1630
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:16,220
America is now under martial law.

1631
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:17,960
All.

1632
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,860
All constitutional rights have been suspended.

1633
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,480
Stay in your homes.

1634
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:31,420
Do not attempt to contact loved ones, insurance agents, or attorneys.

1635
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,260
Shut up.

1636
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:38,240
Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.

1637
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,460
Stay in your homes.

1638
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,020
Curfew is at 7 p.m. sharp after work.

1639
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,420
Anyone caught outside the gates of their homes,

1640
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,200
or in their subdivision sectors after curfew,

1641
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,800
will be shot.

1642
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,880
Remain calm.

1643
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,840
Do not panic.

1644
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:04,860
Your neighborhood watch officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.

1645
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:13,320
Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples will be shot.

1646
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,640
Stay in your homes.

1647
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,680
Remain calm.

1648
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,480
The number one enemy of progress is questions.

1649
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,800
National security is more important than individual will.

1650
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,980
All sports broadcasts will proceed as normal.

1651
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:39,700
No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission.

1652
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:44,660
Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor.

1653
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,860
Shut up.

1654
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,240
Be happy.

1655
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:51,300
Obey all orders without question.

1656
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,700
The comfort you've demanded is now mandatory.

1657
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,540
Be happy.

1658
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,060
At last, everything is done for you.

1659
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:07,040
