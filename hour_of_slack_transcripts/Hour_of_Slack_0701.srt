1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
Okay kids, the car is packed. Now go and get your father and we'll look at some more new houses.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,660
Funny light tonight.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,400
Look at my shadow.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,200
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:33,940
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius power of SWAT.

6
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,380
There is absolutely no other possibility.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,700
Now, let me introduce your tutors.

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,120
Reverend Arvin Stein.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,140
She's also been to Nicaragua.

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,640
By the way, she may also speak Spanish.

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,180
Oh, that's right, dear friends.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,240
We're back again with everything all changed around and...

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,500
Still my shadow, but...

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,180
It's still my shadow.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,760
I know.

16
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,240
That's the whole problem, you see.

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,320
But we're going to have a special subject for the show tonight.

18
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,460
For some of you people who haven't been up on your subgenius terminology lately,

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,880
we're going to investigate the subject of doctors.

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,180
Doctors.

21
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,180
That's a rank in the Church of the Subgenius.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,780
Yes, there's doctors out there, all right.

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,820
Doctors.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,780
Yeah, I could...

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,900
I don't...

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,420
Well, it can...

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,960
No one can define...

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,180
No one can define...

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,520
The doctor syndrome.

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,280
It can only be illustrated by example.

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,120
And be glad you can't see this show right now,

32
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,960
except on Channel X.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,780
We're having enough trouble as it is.

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,680
It has been a fun Easter, friends.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,280
You know, last year, the Easter pterodactyl brought the little eggs for my kids out in Glen Rose.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,360
And this year, unfortunately, it wasn't quite so easy.

37
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,760
It was the Easter vomit.

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:23,860
Ultrasaurus.

39
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,260
Huge eggs.

40
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,960
Huge eggs.

41
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,380
But...

42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,360
I mean, you can hear them in the background, just how bad it was.

43
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:32,900
So...

44
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:41,040
Dallas viewers, may call the number on your screen, 823-7490, for information.

45
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,080
For disinformation, just keep listening.

46
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,440
And thank you.

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,500
It's just been a heck of a war so far here.

48
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,160
We're trying to march on.

49
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,060
We're trying to march all the slack squads back to their barracks now.

50
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,880
And they're a little bit hard to deactivate.

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,100
They get belligerent late at night.

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,820
But they seem to be able to make it back to the barracks here.

53
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Okay, start it now.

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,840
This is what we call the monster beach party.

55
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,880
Hey, well, so welcome to the subgenius beach party.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,720
Yes, last week it was in Houston on KPFA.

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,040
You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is.

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,480
And don't you wish you did.

59
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,540
Oh, dear, that ding.

60
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,800
Well, Dr. Hall, is there any way you can fight through the sound effects

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,420
and tell us about their relationship between the demopods and the...

62
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,140
Well, the demopods...

63
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,300
The demopods and the myriapods got together at the early...

64
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,820
No, demopods and us-apods.

65
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,600
Oh, the demopods.

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,200
It says right here on the script we're supposed to...

67
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,960
I didn't understand that.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,040
I thought you meant this script right here,

69
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,720
the one with the red lines on the cover.

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,520
Listen, never read anything with red dots.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,160
I never believe anything with red dots.

72
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,880
It says read addresses to...

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,020
...people you don't like on the show.

74
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,820
God, I can't hear them from all sides.

75
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,860
Too many buttons to push, too many tape recorders to watch.

76
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,320
Mobius, that's your server.

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,340
I don't give a damn.

78
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,640
Dead center.

79
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,020
Yes, liberty right.

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,020
I can't stand things like this.

81
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,100
Don't make any sense.

82
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,340
The mallet's got out of my brain.

83
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,200
I am a subgenius, and by that virtue,

84
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,240
I am in touch with forces greater than man.

85
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,720
I dare you to kill me.

86
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
I am not a duper conspiracy.

87
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,300
I know more than they do.

88
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
I am a subgenius.

89
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,740
That's all I need to be.

90
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,940
I'm one of the good guys.

91
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,760
I shall prevail.

92
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,400
Let out the crazy man inside you.

93
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,440
He knows what's what.

94
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,960
Smile when you call me a fanatic.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Me, primate.

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,760
Me, open man.

97
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,120
I say to the pigs, give me your money.

98
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,960
You won't need it.

99
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,600
The future offers you nothing but destruction.

100
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,080
Bob.

101
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,880
What do they believe in?

102
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,920
Everything.

103
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,400
Who do they believe in?

104
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,760
A mysterious character named Bob.

105
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Named Bob.

106
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,200
Bob.

107
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,360
A character named Bob.

108
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,060
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

109
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,960
And to you, young man.

110
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,280
And to you.

111
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,940
If you will send a dollar.

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,340
Who will they believe in?

113
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,400
A mysterious character named Bob.

114
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,580
Bob is the gun and you are the bullet.

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,980
The showdown is fast approaching.

116
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,560
The church is still unknown, but its infectious doctrines spread across continents.

117
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,800
Church headquarters, the first Megafist Temple Lodge, is housed in this Dallas skyscraper,

118
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,120
from which Dob's secret mandates are issued to his enemies.

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,280
The

120
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,320
agents in the dreaded Brotherhood of Bob.

121
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,620
But this mighty edifice represents but the tip of a wandering rogue iceberg.

122
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:39,160
The words, hymns, and sound effects of Dob's are disseminated on a weekly basis to thousands of devout radio listeners in most major cities.

123
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,980
Even as far away as China and darkest Africa.

124
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,300
This show is so popular today that we're on his level.

125
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,600
We're studying it from all angles and you can even watch this show on Channel X.

126
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,040
As Hal plays the microphone and flies backwards around the other side of the planet.

127
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,980
The subgeniuses in China have to listen on shortwave radios.

128
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,260
Very hard to...

129
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,900
You'll notice we've switched to spewage music for the background for this segment of the show.

130
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,240
As the psychic surgery is performed, Bob's sweaty brow is wiped by a small nuclear explosion.

131
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:11,860
Oof.

132
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,120
Call the police.

133
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:12,960
Call the police.

134
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,460
It's all better now.

135
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,220
Call the police.

136
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,780
Call the police.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Call the police.

138
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,320
Call the police.

139
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,800
Call the police.

140
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:21,820
Call the police.

141
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,240


142
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,240


143
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,240


144
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,240


145
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,980
Oh no.

146
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,640
You're improving Jack.

147
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,660
You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty in you.

148
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,820
He gave you a vision of moral order in the universe, and there isn't any.

149
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,940
Those stars twinkle in a void there boy, and the two-legged creature schemes the whole world.

150
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,680
and dreams beneath them, all in vain.

151
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,580
All in vain, Jack.

152
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,040
Did you hear anything?

153
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,120
Listen to me.

154
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,180
Two-legged creature won't believe anything.

155
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,780
And the more preposterous, the better.

156
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,660
Whales speak French at the bottom of the sea.

157
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,400
The horses of Arabia have silver wings.

158
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,700
Pygmies mate with elephants in darkest Africa.

159
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,520
I have sold all those propositions.

160
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,560
And they were all fools and none of it matters.

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,280
For whatever reason you refuse to feel this space we're in,

162
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,140
to know its insanity, really know it,

163
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,440
whatever your particular anesthetic is

164
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,180
that you hold on to so desperately,

165
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,900
the thing, I mean, that makes you think you know who you are,

166
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
whatever that thing is,

167
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,140
you allow to keep you sane, your ace in the hole,

168
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,800
the psyche that keeps you from trying to guess

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,700
at what your pimp has in store for you.

170
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,280
Whatever keeps you from screaming out at this very moment

171
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,060
in absolute and sheer horror,

172
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,700
whatever that is, whatever that is,

173
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,880
it's a lie.

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,700
It's a lie.

175
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,140
Give reality your brain, you fantasized son of Walt Disney.

176
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,700
It's a lie.

177
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,460
No.

178
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,540
An old off the street pimp's con game.

179
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,820
The magic for turning human blood into US steel.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,980
The thing that seduces you into being satisfied

181
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,020
at pointing to the last tiny patch of flesh

182
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,860
you have on your bones as proof of your humanity

183
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,180
and keeps you satisfied thinking yourself human

184
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,520
because you live a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a life.

185
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,200
I know you because you live here in his space as I do.

186
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,120
You are his image and play his game on each other.

187
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,600
No.

188
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,260
Thinking it's your own.

189
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,700
I know you.

190
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,260
No.

191
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,060
You can't live in an insane asylum,

192
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,920
play an insane game with a madman,

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
and be objective, brother.

194
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,080
No.

195
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,080
Hope?

196
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,600
At least prostitutes get paid.

197
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,720
No.

198
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,600
Yes, while you pin your hopes, your sanity,

199
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,080
and most of all your individuality

200
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,040
on that rickety old con game, a web of words.

201
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,020
No.

202
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,260
No.

203
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,960
While the master pimp helps you paint

204
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,060
your individual death wish in your head,

205
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,200
feel who you are.

206
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,660
No.

207
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,220
No.

208
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,380
Feel for a split second the obscenity

209
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,300
of who you've got to be.

210
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,080
Really.

211
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,140
In actions, I mean.

212
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,860
Defined by, ordered up for, and delivered to your jobs

213
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,820
on Monday morning.

214
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,820
The greatest eight hours you'll spend in your entire life, ho.

215
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,660
Is a color television really worth that?

216
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,240
In this filth, this insidious insanity,

217
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,120
this nightmare of deception and hypocrisy,

218
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,200
in this United States of America,

219
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,620
careful not to awaken the sleeping,

220
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,480
we, you and I, wander around through a sea

221
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,520
of our own rotten bodies.

222
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,820
In this pimp whore's game, you pretending it's everything else.

223
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,680
In this sewer in which no one can escape playing,

224
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,640
it's normal for brothers to play.

225
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,760
It's normal for sisters to pimp sisters and wives

226
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
because their fathers pimped them.

227
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,680
Or for television stations to pimp their audiences

228
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,740
for perverted sponsors who whore for their own commercials.

229
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,620
And until the authorities catch on,

230
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,300
even common normals can purchase

231
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,940
the word of Bob itself in condensed form.

232
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,060
The legendary book of the subgenius,

233
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,880
available in bookstores everywhere.

234
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,440
But the only certain way,

235
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,140
to receive the Dobbs teachings in uncut form,

236
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,460
is to tithe directly to the church.

237
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,420
Do you really think you freed yourself

238
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,540
of America's special insidiousness

239
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,500
of being inside you?

240
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,020
No, brother.

241
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,500
America's a condition.

242
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,680
One thing is for sure,

243
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,860
a sheep is not a creature of the air.

244
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,460
But at the same time, we will be intent on

245
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,040
searching out the truth of all evidentiary components

246
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,460
which ostensibly have posed a threat

247
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
to our constitutional processes,

248
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,060
in particular, our concept of freedom

249
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,500
and our electoral process.

250
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,740
Good, because I was making, uh...

251
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,240
271 an hour.

252
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,740
Well, as a member of the stock exchange,

253
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,680
I would suck their brains out with a straw.

254
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,000
The easiest way is to write a postal card

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,480
and ask them to mail you all their leaflets.

256
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,980
They'll put you on, and forever you'll have everything.

257
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,880
Even after it's over with, you'll still get it.

258
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,020
They're very happy to do so.

259
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,440
You will be ordained as a card-carrying minister

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,520
and receive the huge official magazine

261
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,440
of churchly news and doctrine,

262
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,900
The Stark Fist of Removal.

263
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,660
I'd just like to say a few words about

264
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,080
The Stark Fist of Removal.

265
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,920
This is the official newsletter of the church,

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,760
and it's got all kinds of great stuff in it.

267
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,620
It's got the proof of Bob, it's got a picture of Bob,

268
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,820
with Ronald Reagan in there.

269
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,920
It's got all important instructions to the subgenius.

270
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,700
Illiterates can purchase their choice

271
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,200
of dozens of inspirational cassette tapes.

272
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,380
And there's even a line of casual subgenius wear

273
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,580
to fit every size or budget.

274
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,900
Oh, it's sprit their nostrils open with a bowtook!

275
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,640
That's not a very good answer.

276
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,120
You're heightening my concern rather than lessening it.

277
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,100
It's embarrassing.

278
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,480
It's moist.

279
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,440
It's moist.

280
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,260
It drips.

281
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,720
It squirts.

282
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,420
It's liquid warmth emitting from your body.

283
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,260
It's, uh...

284
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,580
It dribbles.

285
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,000
It spits.

286
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,180
It's nasty.

287
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,520
But yet it's beautiful in its own wet, slimy,

288
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,600
squirting, and embarrassing way.

289
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,560
He did.

290
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,700
And he did it the subgenius way, too.

291
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,100
He got...

292
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,700
It wasn't...

293
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,960
He had already gotten a short-duration marriage.

294
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,780
That's right.

295
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,320
From Pastor Naked, the official one.

296
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,860
He already had the paperwork.

297
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,300
He did have the paperwork.

298
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,540
He would have sanctified couplings, friends,

299
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,500
for the last few years.

300
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,400
But their short-duration marriage ran out.

301
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,920
And rather than send Buck any more money,

302
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,100
they went to Las Vegas and had one of those parlor chapel,

303
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,340
as Norm just told me they're called,

304
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,560
a parlor chapel wedding.

305
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,340
Marriage parlor.

306
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,000
And when he left the chapel,

307
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,420
this acolyte came running in.

308
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,660
It was one of those ten-minute ceremonies.

309
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,920
This guy actually had the gall to come running out going,

310
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,540
Sir, there's supposed to be a $25 tip,

311
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,100
quote, tip, unquote,

312
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,340
to which Pope Sterno threw down a dollar and said,

313
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,580
Sir, kill me.

314
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,280
That's right.

315
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,140
But we should say congratulations to Pope Sterno

316
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,620
and his faithful ubermatrix,

317
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,320
that is to say, Miss Dottie.

318
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,760
That's right.

319
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,500
And they're creating more little yetis, friends.

320
00:13:59,540 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes, sir.

321
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,520
They are further contaminating the gene pool.

322
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,540
Sterno's father,

323
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,560
the way he became a subgenius was his father was one of the guys

324
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,400
who had to stand on the Nevada desert

325
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,500
and face nuclear tests from about half a mile away.

326
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,180
Wearing only goggles and a lead-shielded jockstrap.

327
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,280
Duck and cover, baby.

328
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,000
You betcha.

329
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,460
But they weren't allowed to in those days,

330
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,920
and the result is thousands of subgenius children

331
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,140
of those selfless servicemen who gave their genetic structure for...

332
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,420
Genes, gave their genes for...

333
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,540
For nuclear dominance.

334
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,280
There you go.

335
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,340
And every bit will be appreciated.

336
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,460
Let me put it this way.

337
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,320
If I were you, I'd give me all your money.

338
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,980
All right, here's the money now being shoveled into the giant money elevator

339
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,100
and we're pressing the money into a small pellet,

340
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,260
which will keep us warm until 6 a.m.

341
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,520
If we want to eradicate...

342
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,580
We've been around the world three times.

343
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,640
If we want to eradicate the very concept of money,

344
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,940
it's going to take money and tons of it.

345
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,720
But money is to burn.

346
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,060
Here come tons of money now.

347
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,520
So we're asking...

348
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,680
And we can start with yours.

349
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,360
Okay.

350
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,380
Mr. Listener.

351
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,480
All the listeners now are putting their money in a big pile.

352
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,180
But it's not enough.

353
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,300
If we can take all the money and burn it,

354
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,620
then we can start a free anarchist society.

355
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,800
But we've got to have all the money first.

356
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,120
We're the only people who can take the responsibility for this project.

357
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,140
Yes, air and liquid both emit from this new type of tool,

358
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,840
which we have now begun to provide to the ministers

359
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,360
and those who would spread the seed of Bob.

360
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,260
The seed, my friend, of Bob.

361
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,140
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand.

362
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,900
There is a pain between my ears.

363
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,520
And so the confused initiate was led to Dockstock,

364
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,140
Dobstown itself, Dobstown, Malaysia,

365
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,840
where he was shocked to discover the most primitive possible living condition.

366
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,920
Earth was inhabited by a species from another dimension.

367
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,360
With certain chance from the book, sacrifices,

368
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,480
this race, the old ones, can be brought back.

369
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,240
And mankind?

370
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,400
Destroyed.

371
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,080
In the vast continuity of school park

372
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,980
There seemed to be evil within

373
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,840
There were people there

374
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
With sensible hues

375
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,920
And there were children there

376
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,520
With no wounds of distinction

377
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,280
There were women there

378
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,640
Who were thought of as virtuous

379
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,180
For they contained the blood

380
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,060
Of the ruling class

381
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,360
Of Suopat

382
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,120
I said men cried

383
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,320
Babies died

384
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,100
Children fell

385
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,680
Men sighed

386
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,500
Babies cried

387
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,880
Men died

388
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Children fell

389
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,180
Women suffered

390
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,340
People wanted repentance

391
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,460
And victims they wanted to escape

392
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,980
Ha ha ha ha ha

393
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,880
Yeah they just wanted to escape

394
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,340
Ha ha ha ha ha

395
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,260
He should know about it

396
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,620
He should know about it

397
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,280
He should know about Suopat

398
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:46,220
And the men about to perish

399
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,380
Ah baloney ..

400
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,040
He should know about it

401
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,000
How many baloney birds

402
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,240
He should know about this

403
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,280
Ballic była

404
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,500
Friends, that's the People's Temple

405
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,440
of Pope Michael Flores

406
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,600
and Pope S. Uber Dominatrix, Pam Smith,

407
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,980
editors of It's Only a Movie,

408
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,180
wonderful little fanzine,

409
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,940
check your encyclopedia,

410
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,640
you know which one I'm talking about for it.

411
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,060
If you read that magazine,

412
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,840
this is your two editors,

413
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,220
Funk and Away fans,

414
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,780
it's People's Temple.

415
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,200
I'd say there's about four months

416
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,760
before what?

417
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,280
Before there's a delightful smell

418
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,900
in the universe of charcoaled mankind.

419
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,220
You really mean four months?

420
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,720
According to the temperature rises

421
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,060
in the last few weeks, yes.

422
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,700
So that's the message, is it?

423
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,200
About another 300 deadlines.

424
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,820
Is that what we say in tomorrow's paper?

425
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,660
Tomorrow we report the news, the facts.

426
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,660
We leave prophecy to the street corner cranks.

427
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,800
Some purchase thousands of Bob's Handy pamphlets

428
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,500
with which to read the paper.

429
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:25,500


430
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:25,500


431
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,260
To recruit the worthy

432
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,360
and to perplex the normals.

433
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,260
To fill their minds with questions.

434
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,560
Questions that only Bob can answer

435
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,040
through his chosen apostles,

436
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,880
his fishers of wallets.

437
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And what is money?

438
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,340
Merely another tool of the conspiracy,

439
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,620
except when it gains power

440
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,200
by passing from your pocket to Bob's.

441
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,780
I've been eating Bob,

442
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,520
and if you have a problem with your cash flow,

443
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,960
it's because your cash is not flowing

444
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,500
towards Bob.

445
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,940
This is the first industrial church.

446
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
We're not a,

447
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,600
tax write-off scam.

448
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,040
We're,

449
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,020
we are an incorporated profit-making foundation,

450
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,020
if there is such a thing.

451
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,160
We're profits, and we want profits.

452
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,260
Children, you've got to come back

453
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,820
to the old American way, yes?

454
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,700
You've got to come back to quality goods

455
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,920
for your dollar, a righteous purchase.

456
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,680
Now let me ask you something, children.

457
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,520
How many of you have been tithing unto Bob

458
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,840
that which is truly Bob's?

459
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,680
Tell me that, children.

460
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,800
How many of you have been giving 10% of your worth of goods to Bob?

461
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,700
I don't care who you are or where you come from.

462
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,720
If you haven't sent your $20 into Bob,

463
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,120
you're going to burn.

464
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Mother Teresa,

465
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,960
I don't care how many people she's helped,

466
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,580
if she hadn't sent her $20 into jail,

467
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,200
Bob Dodgers is going to burn in hell.

468
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,120
And Bob offers a guarantee that can't be beaten.

469
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,060
Eternal salvation.

470
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,120
Or triple your money back.

471
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,840
Bob will protect you.

472
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,500
Bob is protecting you.

473
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,800
The genetic future.

474
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,740
Let him. Let him into your life.

475
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,340
Let Bob protect you. He wants to protect you.

476
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,700
He must protect you.

477
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,060
He has to protect you.

478
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,720
Jehovah One says Bob will protect you.

479
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,360
If you send a dollar to...

480
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,860
My baby! My baby!

481
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,460
My baby! My baby!

482
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,440
My baby! My baby!

483
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,440
My baby!

484
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,360
My baby! My baby!

485
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,480
My baby! My baby!

486
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,180
My baby! My baby!

487
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,800
My baby! My baby!

488
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,980
My baby. My baby!

489
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,280
My baby!

490
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,680
My baby! My baby!

491
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,080
My baby! My baby!

492
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,220
My baby! My baby!

493
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,260
My baby!

494
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,820
It's not the same thing anymore.

495
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,020
Famous Doug.

496
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,080
That's another place, friends.

497
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,440
Yes, it's not the same thing anymore.

498
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,860
You can get those prairie squid drinks.

499
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,640
You can actually get prairie squid drinks.

500
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,600
Yeah, they put them in a blender.

501
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,900
They put them in a blender with protein powder

502
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,980
and just turn them into a really thick...

503
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,620
It's kind of like a daiquiri in texture.

504
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,920
But it's not the real prairie squid, though.

505
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,160
It's the flash frozen stuff.

506
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,820
I mean, nobody does it with a live prairie squid.

507
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,920
Praise Bob.

508
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,760
Praise Bob.

509
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,480
Well, dear friends,

510
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,700
it's time for a moment of serenity and melody.

511
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,860
Yes, if you'll turn to page five in your program,

512
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,220
I'm going to lead you in the hymn,

513
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,420
which we call,

514
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,120
Bob is my story.

515
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,840
This is a hymn which is usually performed

516
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,960
in moments of extreme stress.

517
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,360
And such, I judge this to be.

518
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,840
It's very easy.

519
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,220
And you can support me on the second verse

520
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,920
and the chorus if you choose.

521
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,440
So we'll sing Bob is my story.

522
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,160
Page five.

523
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,240
I saw a man with a pipe and a grin

524
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,400
All in the new morning light

525
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,400
Smiling at me like a madman

526
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,120
Till he made me uptight

527
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,500
I told him don't bother me anymore

528
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,780
But he kept on just the same

529
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,940
Till I was totally brainwashed

530
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,700
Bob is his name

531
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,880
This is the chorus.

532
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,860
He is my story

533
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,200
Bob is my song

534
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,960
Bob is my song

535
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,900
Bob, my amphetamine

536
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,240
All the day long

537
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,980
I won't tear my poster of dogs down

538
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,900
I'll feel no sadness or shame

539
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Till I rejoin him in dogs down

540
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,340
Bob is his name

541
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,640
He has no lack of his stagnant flag

542
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,600
For those of his following foe

543
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,960
Bob is his name

544
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,040
He is the friend of whoever will send

545
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,380
Greenbacks or foes

546
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,200
He's growing stronger and stronger

547
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,340
But he keeps redder than flame

548
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,700
I'll be a pig boy no longer

549
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,940
Bob is his name

550
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,860
Bob is my song

551
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,240
Bob is your story, friend.

552
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,560
And Bob is your fame.

553
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,580
Bob is the glands that keep you feeling the way you do.

554
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,100
Keep your squid juices pumping.

555
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,400
Yes, they say.

556
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,200
Bob!

557
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,420
Stop now!

558
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,240
How many more times do we have to listen?

559
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,720
How many more times do we have to hear the worst song ever?

560
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,540
This band is terrible to not listen to.

561
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:20,540


562
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:20,540


563
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:20,540


564
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,080
They just want to fall asleep.

565
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,240
Yeah, the audience is going in every different direction possible.

566
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,620
They're sick of Bob.

567
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,520
They're sick of the Cafe Depresso.

568
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,760
Yeah, they're sick of everything here.

569
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,100
They only know three chords, but you're only gonna see them play one.

570
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,460
I'm so tired of these guys.

571
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,520


572
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,520


573
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,520


574
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,520


575
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,580
This band's bad.

576
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,180
It's no surprise.

577
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,400
I wish they'd just pack it up and go away.

578
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:09,220
Well, how many times do we have to play this same song over and over and over again?

579
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:19,380
Well, how many times do we have to play these same four notes over and over again?

580
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,280
When I came down to this nightclub, I thought things would be a little bit different.

581
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:37,540
But it's just the same old band, in the same stupid shirts, in the same stupid bleeped heads.

582
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,300
You'd think they could do something new after all these years.

583
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,580
But they just play that same song.

584
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,260
They just play that song all night long.

585
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,520
Just play that song all night long.

586
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:59,180
Well, how many more times do we have to play this same song over and over again?

587
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,340
Beats party, beats party.

588
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,040
They're sick of Bob.

589
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,160
Beats party, beats party.

590
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,860
Well, it's one chord up, one chord down.

591
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,040
Wotan Music's getting me down.

592
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,900
I played in this band for ten hours or so.

593
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,500
I ain't seen my check.

594
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,780
Where's my check?

595
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,180
Oh, where's my check?

596
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:32,820
Well, how many times do we have to ask for this same check over and over again?

597
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,460
Beats party, beats party.

598
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:47,840
Well, how many times do we have to play the worst song in the whole world over and over and over and over and over again?

599
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,680
Beats party, beats party.

600
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:59,640
Well, how many times do we have to ask your mom,?'

601
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,320
.. And the honor's in mine.

602
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,240
I know I got a lot of music for our music over and over.

603
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,820
All right.

604
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,920
pisci.

605
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,780
Bulldada shall live, because Bulldada, having never been alive, cannot be killed.

606
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,680
So in this paradox, we find a pure and simple answer.

607
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,800
An answer to the question of what to do tonight.

608
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,520
Friday night?

609
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,180
Ah, yes. It's Friday.

610
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,200
Yeah.

611
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,680
Yes, you can start sinning now, brother.

612
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,160
You can sin from now till Sunday morning.

613
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,180
You've got a good 48 hours of solid sinning in front of you.

614
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,760
And by God's end, after it's all over with, you can sit there with a hangover in church and have it all washed away.

615
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,200
Washed away in the blood.

616
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,780
The blood of the lambs.

617
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,400
And the blood of the wolves, for that matter.

618
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,960
For is not the lamb of Jesus now being eaten by a black wolf?

619
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,660
An evil wolf?

620
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,640
A wolf of conspiracy.

621
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,140
Conspiracy.

622
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,340
Conspiracy, my friend.

623
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,980
A wolf that would take the good jokes of Jesus, the sublime teachings of Buddha,

624
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:19,960
the small business parables of Dobbs, and twist them, distort them for their own aims.

625
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,320
Yes, that's the way it is now.

626
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,540
It's true.

627
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,420
It's true.

628
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,500
It's true.

629
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:04,940
And lo, many elephants and rhinoceros came to destroy their huts and villages and to step on their albums.

630
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,100
And lo, the Lord was angry that they did not give their money.

631
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,260
And great wrath and panic and broken guitar strings don't follow.

632
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,180
Look at it when you take a break from listening.

633
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,380
But for now...

634
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,820
What is a rant?

635
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,580
A rant's a revival.

636
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,960
And a rant is part of a revival.

637
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,560
A rival as an atom is part of a molecule.

638
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,080
Yes.

639
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:33,800
It's when the person gets on stage and lets Bob speak through it and just cuts loose.

640
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,560
It's the living tongue acting on the...

641
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,040
Exactly.

642
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,480
It's the undirected energy of Bob spewing forth through the human carcass.

643
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,820
We need a few of the initiates, please, to squat in the dirt and let us have their chairs.

644
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,160
Will someone help move the bodies of those stunned by the music back to the back by the beer?

645
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,320
The pile is out front.

646
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,640
No, back. Excuse me.

647
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,960
And for everyone...

648
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,120
We're throwing them in all directions.

649
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,100
Their body is worth approximately $12 and it's falling fast.

650
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,240
Everyone that dies tonight is thrown on a cremation pile.

651
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,640
Every subgenius that is carrying his car gets a cut of that $12.

652
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,940
We need the glands for those experiments.

653
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,520
And we're talking about the foot glands.

654
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,800
The most important one in your body next to you-know-what.

655
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,460
That's right.

656
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,840
And yet nothing could still the ranting tongues of the high priests of the subgenius.

657
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,620
No lack of material, no complete embarrassment could stop their ever-flapping,

658
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,860
petulantly vibrating, ranting tongues from continuously speaking the word of Dobbs.

659
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,480
Even though no one was listening, even though their drugs had not kicked in...

660
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,240
Voices in the darkness.

661
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,740
Even though their brains had...

662
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,380
Finally...

663
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,420
Completely left them...

664
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,900
Even though their tapes had run out and had to be flipped in order to continue the lessons in...

665
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,440
Just how doctors for Bob...

666
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,660
Orphic...

667
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,020
Not your physician for Robert.

668
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,100
None of that fancy stuff.

669
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,480
Just your straight doctors for Bob.

670
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,300
How they use anti-music to surgically change what was previously in your brain.

671
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,460
Oh, there went some of it.

672
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,360
Thank you.

673
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:20,500


674
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,120
We tried to donate to the sperm bank, but they wouldn't let us.

675
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,780
Praise Bob!

676
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,620
Praise Bob.

677
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,520
There's people here, there's people here who, you know, can't donate to the sperm bank because they're underweight.

678
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,360
Okay?

679
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,480
That's all right.

680
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,540
Let us just have just a few cells from underneath your skin so we can begin the cloning experiments.

681
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,740
Let us just have a chocolate.

682
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,560
I would like to clone that young lady in the front row because I know in about 14 years she'd be so cute.

683
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,660
We'd bring them our pride at Dobbs Town.

684
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Yeah, I just, you know, think you'd have a companion.

685
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,140
If you're going to be exposed to radiation, let's go all the way.

686
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,900
You know, if you're going to do it, then just sit in front of a color TV with your legs wide spread watching Mr. T cartoons,

687
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,280
and you can have a boy just like Jader.

688
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,960
Yeah, that's right.

689
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
It's him raising his eyes.

690
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,320
It's him raising his eyes.

691
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,200
Make the tides fall off your car.

692
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,740
I'm sorry, Bob.

693
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,960
Jader's parents live next to the largest industrial waste dump.

694
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,080
It's a Jader device.

695
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,320
In the entire county.

696
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,400
Adam hooked up to a Jader device.

697
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,320
Jader, the perfect prince of the church, speaks.

698
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,140
Some genius cheap humors.

699
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,320
Genius cheap humors.

700
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,000
I wasn't going to drink today, but, well, since I already had this damn case,

701
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,940
I guess I might as well do something with it.

702
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:36,500
And, well, I could take it back, but, well, they usually don't like you to do that.

703
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,860
And, well, I wouldn't want the grocery store to get mad at me.

704
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,020
I've, you know, I've been trying to win their bingo game.

705
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,100
And, you know, if I take a bunch of cans back, well, they don't like that kind of thing.

706
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,600
And, you know, I could, well, I could probably just pour.

707
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,380
I could probably pour all the beer out of it, but, well, it'd probably kill my grass.

708
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,420
And, yeah, I don't want to do that.

709
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:04,840
And I could trade in for the aluminum, but, yeah, it wouldn't be really worth the price of the gas

710
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,700
of driving down to the aluminum recycling plant.

711
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,060
It'd probably be worth, you know, yeah, that's what it is.

712
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,880
I could take them in for the aluminum, you know, because if I drank them,

713
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,940
well, it'd probably be worth more if they were just the aluminum.

714
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,160
I mean, there's no recycling.

715
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,640
The recycling plant's going to buy aluminum with beer in it, so I probably would have to drink it.

716
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,160
And, well, it, you know, helps wash down my food.

717
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,420
And it's probably, you know, if I, you know, didn't drink any today,

718
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,900
well, five more days from now, it'd be Sunday, and I might want some and wouldn't be able to drink any.

719
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,920
So at least I could say, well, hell, I got blowed off my ass last Monday.

720
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:50,900
And, you know, well, these pop tops, well, some little kid could step on them or, you know,

721
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,200
even though they are still full of beers, and, well, yeah, they are in my refrigerator,

722
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,180
but, you know, by some twist of the imagination,

723
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,860
this little boy's foot could conceivably, I'm not saying that it's impossible,

724
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:10,720
but it could probably come into my refrigerator, and he could, you know, cut his foot open.

725
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,280
And, well, if he sued me or something like that,

726
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,680
the hospital bill would be far greater than this beer.

727
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,280
Is it probably even worth it if he did step on it?

728
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:29,700
Well, you know, so if I would drink it and properly take care of the beer can tops,

729
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,780
then that'd be one less thing on my mind that I wouldn't have to worry about.

730
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,960
And if I did get drunk, well, I probably wouldn't have to worry about it anyway,

731
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:46,140
even though the fact that the beer can tops might be in, say, a trash can along with a beer can.

732
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,880
Oh, yeah, but, yeah, I was going to send them, take them to the recycling plant so I could get the money for them,

733
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,040
and that was another reason.

734
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:59,580
And, well, you know, they went to all the trouble to paint the red, white, and blue Budweiser label on here.

735
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,060
And, well, I'd hate to, you know, I like to support the arts.

736
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,360
I'm a patron of the arts.

737
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,780
I'd like to, you know, support them.

738
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,180
Did you hear what he was saying?

739
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,080
Did you hear what he was saying?

740
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,760
I don't like that last sound.

741
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,000
The Lord is mine.

742
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,880
My shepherd.

743
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,380
No, that won't do.

744
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,040
All right, close your eyes, please.

745
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,580
And repeat this prayer after me, right out loud.

746
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,780
Ing, ing, ing, ing, ing.

747
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,160
Like this.

748
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,340
Ink, ink, ink, ink.

749
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,180
Ang, ang, ang, ang, ang.

750
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,300
Eve, meat, concrete, eel.

751
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,920
What makes us do this?

752
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,120
I don't know.

753
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,140
Holy shit.

754
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,420
You're killing me.

755
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,940
You're killing me.

756
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,240
I hear it's red and blue.

757
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,980
Give me a box, baby.

758
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm just like you.

759
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,080
I don't know what's going on.

760
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,080
It never stops.

761
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,720
Well, soon in this song.

762
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,400
It never stops.

763
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,020
Two days later, I'm still going strong.

764
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,880
It never stops.

765
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,540
I don't know what's going on.

766
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,540
It never stops.

767
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,660
Beats party, beats party.

768
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,460
It never, never stops.

769
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,660
Never stops.

770
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,740
It never stops.

771
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,440
Beats party, beats party.

772
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,740
It never stops.

773
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:41,700
And then because we are Christians or Americans or something, I don't know just why, we began to get conscience pains.

774
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,540
And we began to hear people say, well, don't just do something.

775
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,320
Stand there.

776
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:46,760
No.

777
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,860
We're ready for our TV.

778
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,800
He's got a rod that's about to budge.

779
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,020
No.

780
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,920
Went to the doctor.

781
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,080
Let her go, Bob.

782
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,840
And I predict that our local American doctors will go on strike and be replaced by African witch doctors.

783
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,940
Doctors, doctors, doctors for Bob.

784
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,680
Doctors, doctors, doctors for Bob.

785
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,220
Doctors, doctors, doctors for Bob.

786
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,620
Doctors, doctors, doctors for Bob.

787
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,860
Doctors for Bob.

788
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,040
Endocrinologists for Bob.

789
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,860
Farmers for Bob.

790
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,880
Gynecologists for Bob.

791
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,060
Car Christmas for Bob.

792
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,420
Illustrators for Bob.

793
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,020
Jailers for Bob.

794
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,640
Kidnappers for Bob.

795
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,180
Lawyers for Bob.

796
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,600
Mothers for Bob.

797
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,020
Neurologists for Bob.

798
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,680
We kept the pussies alive.

799
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,180
They were in good condition.

800
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,660
We fed them once a week.

801
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,880
I didn't see why they had anything to complain about.

802
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,260
We had the neighbors look in on them while we were gone.

803
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,960
We didn't whip them hard.

804
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,560
We didn't kill them very hard.

805
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,080
I didn't see why they had any reason to sue them.

806
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,960
I mean, we didn't cut her legs off hard.

807
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,100
I mean, she didn't really have any...

808
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,880
We only cut off two of her legs.

809
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,380
I mean, she didn't really have any reason to sue.

810
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,680
I mean, when we ran over her face, it was with old tires.

811
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,300
I really didn't think she had any reason to sue with it.

812
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,020
I mean, it was a Volkswagen.

813
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,720
I mean, if we had...

814
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:18,860
I mean, if we had...

815
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,080
If we had run over her with a heavy car, I can understand why she had sued for that.

816
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,640
Just for throwing acid pits.

817
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,380
Yeah, Duell only took two livers, is what I heard.

818
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,780
And he only took two.

819
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,320
He only took three kidneys.

820
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,920
I mean, I don't see how the Subgenius Foundation is responsible.

821
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:43,980
I mean, these people want to hypnotize us into cutting their brains out with chainsaws.

822
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,460
Beach party! Beach party!

823
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,780
It never stops!

824
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,660
Beach party! Beach party!

825
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,780
I'm tired of this nightclub.

826
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,260
It never stops!

827
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,760
This band is so bad!

828
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,600
It never stops!

829
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:00,220
Why do I have to pay five dollars every night to stay alive?

830
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,560
Beach party! Beach party!

831
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:08,900
Well, how many times do we have to play this worse song over and over and over?

832
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,780
Beach party! Beach party!

833
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,420
Over again!

834
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,560
Subgenius Beach Party!

835
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,280
Over again!

836
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,520
Subgenius Beach Party!

837
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,500
Yes, it's Subgenius Boot Camp.

838
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,740
Drinking coffee and staying awake.

839
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,740
Stand up there.

840
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,400
Here, stand out in the rain and keep your wake.

841
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,580
Here, have some old Bob Cologne.

842
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,000
Do you call yourself a subgenius coming to drill with a beard?

843
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,980
That's two demerits.

844
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,560
All right, Mr. Hughes.

845
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,460
Okay, boy, three more demerits and I'll get that new baseball glove.

846
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,300
Look at the knees of your uniform pants.

847
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,940
That's disgusting.

848
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,220
I'm docking you five more demerits, Mr. Hughes.

849
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,440
Oh, gosh, gosh, get a new car!

850
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,040
What are you smiling about?

851
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,720
Orderly, that's six more demerits.

852
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,060
Yeah.

853
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:40,860
Yeah.

854
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,080
Yeah.

855
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:41,660
Yeah.

856
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,060
Yeah.

857
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,060


858
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,640
Yeah.

859
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,020
Yeah.

860
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,340
Yeah.

861
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,880
Yeah.

862
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:02,880


863
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,140
Get your own.

864
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:08,500


865
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
The one you each play.

866
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,840
What am I gonna get?

867
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,120
Nobody knows because nobody's不行.

868
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,980
Daddy oggi!

869
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,160
cares who can pay?

870
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


871
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


872
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


873
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


874
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


875
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


876
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,200
No, I know that.

877
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,200


878
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,200


879
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,200


880
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,620
What on earth does she want?

881
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:13,620


882
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:13,620


883
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,320
The good deal is in the wallet of the beholder.

884
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Know ye this.

885
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,780
Knowledge of earth taken and of the moon, not of the sun.

886
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,100
Extremists are as this discord in mind as great as order and patriarchy.

887
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,740
Through my discipline, nine armies can triumph.

888
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,660
The harlot will bribe thee with the rams of time.

889
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,740
The harlot is unclean and shall be made to perdition.

890
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,940
The divine king will be killed in the closet by his own crowns.

891
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,260
Darkness will fall.

892
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,580
The false signs will reign you.

893
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,700
If you act stupid, don't treat yourself equal.

894
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,160
With their bestowals and their minds and their tools shall be all stirred up together.

895
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,340
The image will be made flashing.

896
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,400
I have basically nothing to say over the end.

897
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,720
That's what I want to talk to you about tonight.

898
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,000
The prophets shall be listening from their mouths.

899
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,720
Do you even know what you're really thinking?

900
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,400
You may not know what you're really thinking.

901
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,660
And they shall command the source of all knowledge, which is likened to a book of the score.

902
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,640
And they shall write everywhere like a vine.

903
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,780
And they shall receive the sacraments from the angels of life, which preserve the rights in heaven.

904
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,660
And the cherished flowers shall arrange in the right way in the place.

905
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,120
While they are not friends, they shall always know how it is.

906
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,180
And they shall always write.

907
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,460
And they shall spread their message.

908
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,760
Everything comes apart.

909
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,040
Some will not understand.

910
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,420
They are drunk.

911
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,620
They are not men.

912
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,400
If you want to be known as an original creation, make sure you imitate them.

913
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,780
They are not people.

914
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,660
The Guru Hymn.

915
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,420
This is a hymn dedicated to the grinning, giggling monkey guru.

916
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,740
Now, this is bliss consciousness.

917
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,860
Now, we have the roots of the tree.

918
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,880
This is the trunk of the tree.

919
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,620
These are the branches.

920
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,360
The branches of the tree with the pretty leaves.

921
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,040
Now, in order to get bliss consciousness, we must water the roots of the tree.

922
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:28,660
When the roots are watered, the bliss rises up the trunk of the tree into the branches of the tree into the leaves.

923
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,340
When this happens, we have bliss consciousness.

924
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,880
Now, bliss consciousness is something that your mother will approve of.

925
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,340
Unlike sex and other said things,

926
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,560
this fits right on in with her.

927
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,240
She loves bliss consciousness.

928
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:47,840
Pig.

929
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,320
Pig.

930
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,940
There is a happy land far, far away

931
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,460
Where little piggies grow three times a day

932
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,020
Oh, you should see them run when they see the butcher come

933
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,800
Two cut slices off their bum three times a day

934
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,260
This is...

935
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,580
This is...

936
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,000
Dedicated to these goon PERCEN whale descends

937
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,160
F cliffs

938
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,680
tramp forrons

939
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,580
p talk

940
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,120
you

941
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,280
then

942
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,860
was there

943
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,100
and then

944
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,180
you, from The incorrigible Beyond.

945
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,600
Occultly, they'll hunt you

946
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:48,600


947
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,620
Your mind is no longer your own!

948
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,400
Ha, ha, HA, HA, HA!

949
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,100
I have no mind, I have no mind, my mind is not my mind.

950
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,760
Cast off the imperialist brains of normalcy.

951
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,740
Because you want to, I do what I do because you're all cold with me.

952
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,480
You do what you do because you want to, too.

953
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,220
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

954
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,240
You do what you do because you want to, too.

955
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,040
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

956
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,940
Now that you've seen what you've seen, will you be with us in the saucers on X-Day?

957
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:38,020
Or instead will you be left crawling through the glowing rubble, a doubter to the end?

958
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:45,080
In the sweet name of Bob, you must be saved, even if it kills you.

959
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,220
And of course, Bob.

960
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,440
You know, that was after that they picked me up and they said, you're crazy, you're crazy, Jimmy.

961
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,420
You gotta go in and relax and just settle down.

962
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,200
And they said, there's something wrong with the chemicals in your brain, that's what they said.

963
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,820
I say, it ain't the chemicals, you understand?

964
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,040
It ain't the chemicals, it's the minerals.

965
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,820
It's true, little pills work.

966
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,220
Your boy is a genius.

967
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:13,640
Pencil.

968
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,660
Even though we're leaving the air at this time, you may still phone in any prayer request you may have by calling 331-

969
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,220
Oh, digital countdown.

970
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,760
Or on the wall, Reverend Stang.

971
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,020
Yes, we're coming down, we got three minutes left.

972
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,920
Three minutes of slack time, friends.

973
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:32,660
And I could play some Burblin background noise, or I could play the official sign-off tunes and so forth, but...

974
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,600
We could just talk for another three minutes, but...

975
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,660
We easily, easily, easily, that is...

976
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,200
Easily, yeah, that's...

977
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,600
We could talk for another three hours, friends, because...

978
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,120
Or three days, if that's what it takes to get you to write to that sacred post office box.

979
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:47,220
You've been hearing the learned old scholars of the Church of the Subgenius Society tonight.

980
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,080
That's right.

981
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,200
And learned we are in the dark knowledge...

982
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,160
And forbidden sciences of time control, slack extraction...

983
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,280
And the arcane secrets of the prairie squid.

984
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:04,060
Friends, are you gonna put up with what the gland owners are laying down on you?

985
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,720
I want you to either stand up or shut up, baby.

986
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,280
That's right.

987
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,120
Praise Bob.

988
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,780
You gotta hip out to it, or die trying not to.

989
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,680
Or just kill me.

990
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,500
And think to yourself, there's no place like home.

991
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,380
There's no place like home.

992
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:38,940
All right.

993
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,380
We're pretty sure he's a psychopath now.

994
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,640
How do we spot him?

995
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,720
Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy.

996
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,040
Otherwise, they come in all sizes and shapes.

997
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,940
From 11-year-old girls to 80-year-old men.

998
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,620
Yeah, they all look perfectly normal.

999
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,520
I keep telling y'all, this is a sick and perverted nation.

1000
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,920
All tired.

1001
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,960
And nobody wants to listen to me.

1002
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,600
Nobody wants to hear about Bob.

1003
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,420
Nobody...

1004
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,080
I try to tell everybody what's going on, and they won't listen to me.

1005
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,940
Well, to tell you the truth, I can't stand it anymore.

1006
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,220
I don't think so.

1007
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:22,220


1008
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:22,220


1009
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,360
Hi, everybody.

1010
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,620
I'm Andy Oakley, and you're right on target for another session of The Gun Show.

1011
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:34,700
It's the election year game that lets legislators from all over America say good things about

1012
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,400
guns as they try to get votes, and score a bullseye with our sharpshooting panel.

1013
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,520
And who's tonight's first target?

1014
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,800
Our first target tonight, Andy, is a state senator from Rockhead, New Hampshire.

1015
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,580
Let's have a salve of applause for Harry Bolt.

1016
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,820
My fellow voters.

1017
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,020
Thank you very much.

1018
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,540
Nobody in this country admires firearms more than I do.

1019
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,500
Every American ought to have four or five.

1020
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,420
I've got a 12-gauge in the living room,

1021
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,600
a .238 in the den,

1022
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,060
.30-30 in my car,

1023
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,300
and as you can see, I'm carrying a 4.2-inch mortar.

1024
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,420
Now, put your hands up and don't try any funny business.

1025
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:06,780
Whoopee!

1026
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,580
Hey, we got a great reaction from our panel on that one.

1027
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,960
And who's our next contestant?

1028
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,040
Andy, our next target, from Milmoss, New Mexico,

1029
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,000
a congressman who's also a minister of the First Church of Self-Defense.

1030
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,720
Let's welcome Morris Mackley.

1031
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,520
Fire away, Reverend Mackley.

1032
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,200
Thank you.

1033
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,440
I'd like to show you all a beautiful full-color picture of our Lord

1034
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,400
wearing a .357 Magnum and a hand-tooled holster.

1035
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,140
And remember, guns are a gift from God.

1036
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,700
Bullseye, Reverend Mackley.

1037
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,540
You're going to be tough to beat this election year.

1038
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,880
And let's get to our final contestant on the firing line.

1039
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,420
From San Francisco, California,

1040
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,560
let's hear it for Congressman Willard Wentz.

1041
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,440
Welcome, Willard.

1042
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,740
And what good things can you say about guns?

1043
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,920
Well, I don't own a gun.

1044
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,460
And I don't particularly like people

1045
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,180
who do own them.

1046
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:51,400
Whoa.

1047
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,120
Willard, that's our warning buzzer.

1048
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,480
You've got just ten seconds more to say something good about guns.

1049
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,300
And remember, our panelists are all crack shots.

1050
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,920
Well, I guess guns are all right in their place.

1051
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,020
I'm not sure that's enough, Willard.

1052
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,720
You've got just five seconds more.

1053
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,740
I think we ought to register firearms.

1054
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,280
Whoa!

1055
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,760
Hey, everybody's done.

1056
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,120
That's some great shooting, panel.

1057
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,360
And that's all we have time for on the Gun Show.

1058
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,320
The Gun Show's been brought to you

1059
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:20,440
by the U.S. Department of Defense.

1060
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,720
By Bang, Bothered Americans Needing Guns.

1061
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,020
I'm your host, Andy Oakley.

1062
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,060
We'll be back right before the Illinois primary.

1063
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,540
And in the meantime, remember,

1064
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,520
a gun is like a good friend.

1065
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,560
Treat it right, and it won't kill you.

1066
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,720
We're in?

1067
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,500
...Chapman Prayer Partner

1068
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,100
and your personal friend.

1069
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,060
In the next 13 or 14 minutes,

1070
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,300
something good, good, good

1071
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,600
is coming your way.

1072
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,820
So don't leave this radio station.

1073
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,440
Let's have a good time.

1074
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,300
Let's have a good time together.

1075
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,060
He's all I need.

1076
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,280
He's all I need.

1077
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,520
Ah, yeah.

1078
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,400
Thank God I'm a man.

1079
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:18,620
Remember, that's Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1080
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,120
75.

1081
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,280
5, 2, 1, fire.

1082
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:23,980
Yeah.

1083
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,040
Step around in a circle.

1084
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,360
Step around in a circle.

1085
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,520
And you all fall down.

1086
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:36,940
Hey!

1087
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,240
I don't want this anger

1088
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,020
burning me.

1089
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,500
It's something for which it's so hard

1090
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,420
to be free.

1091
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:58,020
And all the dreams that we grow in sorrow

1092
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:05,500
We're making a difference, a change in the day

1093
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:15,680
I'm gonna be dead, I'm gonna be dead

1094
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:22,680
I'm gonna be dead, that's my day

1095
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,800
So stay tuned.

1096
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32,440
Don't forget to write Bobby for that free information.

1097
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,420
Box 1403 of 6 Dallas, Texas.

1098
00:53:54,520 --> 00:54:03,580
Box 1403 of 6 Dallas, Texas.

1099
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,760
I'm gonna play I am a doctor!

1100
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,880
A doctor's a boss?

1101
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,820
We bring him back to life and then we kill him again!

1102
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,720
I went and seen myself a doctor.

1103
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,080
And he gave me a great big bottle.

1104
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,200
Don't take him there, kid.

1105
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,640
Throw the poison pills away, pile!

1106
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,880
It's probably time for a little stimulation there, cadet.

1107
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,960
So why not get up and move a little?

1108
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,400
Comedy is comedy, but some rhythm tossed in can do anything but help.

1109
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,440
Let it go, boss.

1110
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:35,740
Oh!

1111
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,280
They say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, baby.

1112
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,460
Call me the big pill.

1113
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,280
We're here today, Doctor, for the World Game Jam at the Club Metro in Chicago.

1114
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,020
And I'd like to know, Saint Sulak of the Hog Butchers of the West, are you a doctor for Bob?

1115
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,160
I am!

1116
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,320
This is beginning a new life for me as the Saint of the Hog Butchers of the West.

1117
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,960
As a new man, I'm free!

1118
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:01,960
I'm free!

1119
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,840
And this proves it!

1120
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,220
Yes, but are you a doctor for Bob?

1121
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:04,680
This proves it!

1122
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,900
Boston, I'm a doctor if I prove that I'm free!

1123
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,400
Only a doctor for Bob can be free.

1124
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,160
Congratulations, for Bob!

1125
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,040
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

1126
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:25,680
No, I don't work charge brainwashing, I have a little, but it's a generic.

1127
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,520
You do what you do because you want to do it.

1128
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,240
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

1129
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,480
You do what you do because Bob told me to.

1130
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,960
But you, can you walk?

1131
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:37,660
Two!

1132
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:44,760
From the soles of my feet to the tip of my feet, I am a doctor for Bob.

1133
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:52,000
And let me say that prior to this moment, I had the least ability to understand a doctor for Bob,

1134
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,280
or any subgenius in the church.

1135
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,360
But tonight, with the artist elimination experiment being such a success,

1136
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,940
I truly feel that I am, for the first time, a true doctor for Bob.

1137
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,960
But Bobby is bigger than I.

1138
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,420
Oh, I think he's caught it. Doctor, give him something for his cough.

1139
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,620
All right, all right. Here's a quarter.

1140
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,180
Oh, that's not much.

1141
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,180
Not much of a cough.

1142
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,520
Well, thanks, Douglas. I'll take over.

1143
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,220
It's all right. You'll be yourself again in a minute.

1144
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,200
I'm so sorry, everybody.

1145
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,380
Now, you just drink this.

1146
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,460
Oh, you!

1147
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,840
I don't feel well.

1148
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,580
What's the matter with you?

1149
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,840
Oh, I don't know. I was the doctor.

1150
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,640
And he told me what to do, but I didn't do it.

1151
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:42,480
He said to take one pill three times a day, but you can't do that.

1152
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,740
I think I'd rather die than do that.

1153
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,000
Don't die, don't die.

1154
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,020
And it's a gas.

1155
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,660
I figure, you know, some of those roaches they put out in grass,

1156
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,380
and a glass of acid will put you on the moon in an hour.

1157
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,560
But reality, that's where it's happening.

1158
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:05,760
What?

1159
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,100
What's the use of pretending?

1160
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,340
I can't stand this anymore.

1161
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,640
Don't die, don't die.

1162
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,640
Doctor, please.

1163
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:14,900
Please, doctor.

1164
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,900
Chandler said you went over to Georgia Street to see that doctor.

1165
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,160
Yeah, that's right, Ed.

1166
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,320
Short visit.

1167
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,200
Poor guy.

1168
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,320
Pretty bad, huh?

1169
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,600
Well, the guy's really a mess.

1170
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,060
The beatnik walked up to the epileptic and said,

1171
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,860
Oh, I don't hear the music, but go, baby, go!

1172
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,800
Here's my million dollars.

1173
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,020
Bob's Beach Party.

1174
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,960
Subgenius Beach Party.

1175
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,640
One dollar.

1176
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,480
He said one dollar!

1177
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,540
All right.

1178
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,200
Bob's Beach Party.

1179
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,220
Subgenius Beach Party.

1180
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,540
Subgenius Beach Party.

1181
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,100
Subgenius Beach Party.

1182
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,600
Subgenius Beach Party.

1183
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,520
Great combination, isn't it, Joe?

1184
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,380
What's that?

1185
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,800
Arm full of narcotics and a loaded gun?

1186
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,520
Let her go, Bob.

1187
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,240
Boy, did we get high.

1188
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,220
Yes, sirree.

1189
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,340
We sure got relaxed.

1190
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,100
A physician must determine if tendon repairs are needed.

1191
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:15,520
There it is.

1192
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:16,500
Here it is.

1193
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:17,040


1194
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,080
Here's the last for me.

1195
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,180
The bleeding head are no longer.

1196
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,500
It's growing even now as you speak.

1197
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,300
Here's the last for me.

1198
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,460
But if the chief ever caught me taking these pills, he'd snap my head off.

1199
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,040
Here, try one of mine.

1200
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:30,640
Oh, yeah?

1201
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,160
Yeah, the chief himself's been on these for a week, and he's a changed...

1202
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:39,880
Our favorite area for clairvoyance has always been in the field of science and medicine.

1203
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,280
What's your trouble, young man?

1204
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,520
The Venusian goop rod, doctor.

1205
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,560
Now, see here, young man, my time is valuable.

1206
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,380
Doctor, this is a medical emergency.

1207
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,700
I hope you like that nonsense.

1208
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:02,220
I try to make the audience a part of the entertainment, and they go along with it all just great.

1209
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,800
That chatter with the doctor is no phony bit.

1210
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,500
Really, it's just the way it happens.

1211
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,100
You'll have to make it in one night when you're down Florida way.

1212
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,260
All right, nurse, bring the next patient in.

1213
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,800
Get up on this table.

1214
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,940
Pull off that gown.

1215
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,780
Raise up that right leg, let that left one down.

1216
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,760
Pull off them stockings, that silk underwear.

1217
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:34,340
The doctor's got to cut you, mama, Lord knows where.

1218
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,480
Internal, inner, non-existent, void particles.

1219
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:44,580
You can send negro-influenced voice waves, tap-shoe disc patterns.

1220
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:55,300
You can send us cow vomit, tooth broken, 11-gated, elongated, creation-oriented,

1221
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:59,760
spear gum, restaurant scars.

1222
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,580
You can send us...

1223
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,840
Don't look at me that way, Douglas.

1224
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,480
You're mad.

1225
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,240
Don't be frightened, Douglas.

1226
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,340
You have to see what service you require.

1227
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,200
Give me down the road!

1228
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,000
Give me down the road!
