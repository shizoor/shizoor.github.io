1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,140
The Subgenius Power of Splash!

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,980
It's hard to believe they were attacked by an owl.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,640
Praise Bob!

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:24,880
Friends, we didn't do a live show this last Sunday night because I was finishing up a little movie of my own.

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,980
A movie that I started filming in 1964.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,420
And I just finished it. It's on my YouTube channel, Rev Stang.

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,140
Anyway, we're doing a rerun this week. At least it's not an hour of slack rerun.

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:53,180
It is in fact a rerun of a show I did last Saturday week with a podcast called Project Archivist.

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,700
I had been on...

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,480
their show about three years ago and it was really fun.

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,120
So I did it again and it was fun.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,640
And I'm just gonna run that show.

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,140
Again, the show is called Project Archivist.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,620
If you type that into Google, that'll be... their show will be the first thing up.

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,420
Yeah.

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,860
We have the triumphant second coming of Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.

17
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,860
It's been, I think, three years.

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,620
It's been three years since we last had you on here.

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,020
And that was one of our most downloaded, most loved shows.

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,440
It's easily up within our top five shows that we've ever done.

21
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,260
And we've continuously throughout the years had people say,

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,720
when is Ivan Stang coming back on?

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,400
A little while ago, I'd say about a year and a half ago,

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,180
I was hanging out with a mutual friend of ours, Greg Bishop,

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,080
and we got into a big conversation about you.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,720
And he's like, yeah, you need to get Reverend Ivan Stang back on the show again.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,160
So ever since then, we've been trying to pull it off and figure out a way to get you on.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,380
And finally, I just bit the bullet and said, hey, let's do this again.

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
And you obliged. And now here you are.

30
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,080
So welcome back to Project Archivist, Mr. Stang.

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,340
Well, thank you so much. Praise Bob. Praise Rogin. Praise Lobo.

32
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,240
Thank you.

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,660
By the way, it's not Mr. Stang. It's Reverend Stang.

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,760
Yes, Mr. Reverend Ivan Stang.

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,700
Ultimately, you're right.

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,900
I used Mr. Smith, which I've been demoted to on Facebook.

37
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,980
Basically, they busted me.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,300
I've been using a fake name this whole time, but it sounds so much more real.

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
Mr. Smith sounds very generic.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,940
So it's been a while since we've had you on,

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,060
and a lot of things as of late have been going on with the Church of the Subgenius.

42
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,920
Let's get started with –

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,820
before we jump into all this stuff, let's start from way back in the beginning.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,740
The Church of the Subgenius started up in 1980. Is that correct?

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,400
January 2nd, 1980 was when we picked up the very first subgenius pamphlet from the printer.

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:16,880
And my wife was really mad because we had spent $60 on this thing, getting $100 or –

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,700
back then it was probably $500.

48
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:28,800
She basically said, if you don't send this to publishers and make money off it somehow,

49
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,360
you're in big trouble.

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,560
Because our intention originally was just to leave it around and save or confuse souls.

51
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,460
We were just going to leave them in laundromats.

52
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,420
Because my buddy Philo and I had been collecting what you might call kook pamphlets, fringe publications,

53
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,080
of all kinds – religious, political, whatever.

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,780
I later learned that the reason he was kind of –

55
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:06,300
he was recruiting me this whole time to work for this reclusive cult leader, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

56
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:14,500
And the next thing you know, I got sucked into this crazy burgeoning new world cult.

57
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,400
I like the idea of it being dedicated to slack, although sometimes it's just a little bit of a drag.

58
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,400


59
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,400


60
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,020
But somehow they talked me into doing almost all the dirty work for years.

61
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,260
I was going to say, you've been doing this for quite a while, so how does one achieve slack

62
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,960
when one is the one out promoting how to get slack nonstop?

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,120
Well, Bob Dobbs is the one who gets all the slack, apparently.

64
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:45,380
Actually, all's well that ends well, because in the last few years – actually quite a few years – I got my payback.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,980
I'm enjoying quite a bit of slack.

66
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:54,080
Kind of half-retired and having a real good time.

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:04,460
And my part in the silo is, too – the two of us have ended up ensconced on lovely ranches

68
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:13,080
in Texas and Kentucky, respectively, doing just what we most wanted to do,

69
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,140
which was not much of anything.

70
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,880
It's been great.

71
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
What's what retirement's supposed to be about?

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,820
Actually, we both have gotten busy.

73
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,820
Philo actually retired from what we call a conspiracy job.

74
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,620
And so he was really ready to jump back into Church of the Subgenius full-time.

75
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
And that's good, because I've been doing Church of the Subgenius full-time,

76
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,640
and I needed a different form of slack.

77
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:47,560
So I think he's going to be more involved, and I might be a little bit less involved.

78
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,400
But we're all still here.

79
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,320
How did you go about creating a religion from scratch?

80
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,740
Well, of course, this religion was started by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

81
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:11,820
We just happened to find a lot of his meaningful little memos with these wonderful quotes on them

82
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,000
that sounded wise, or at least they sounded good.

83
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,480
Like,

84
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,660
Too much is always better than not enough.

85
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,940
The subgenius must have slack.

86
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,400
Act like a dumbass and they'll treat you as an equal.

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,320
That kind of thing.

88
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,260
Some of them are not entirely words to live by, but like I say, they really sound good.

89
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
That's the first thing you need for a religion.

90
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,860
The second thing you need is an enemy.

91
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,800
And of course, in our case, that's all the normal people.

92
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,880
We call them human as opposed to subgeniuses.

93
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:59,720
But that sort of thing really appeals to people who are desperate to find something that makes them feel better than everybody else.

94
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,260
And maybe race isn't doing it for them.

95
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,300
They can't be smart because they're subgeniuses.

96
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,660
And even if they happen to be good looking, they probably believe they're not good looking.

97
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,280
We run into that a lot, too.

98
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,500
So it's a contrarious bunch of people you ever saw.

99
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:28,300
So trying to sell these weirdos a club for people who are non-joiners, it has been kind of an uphill battle.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,720
And we did have to brand our materials.

101
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:44,780
When we finally got a book published, it had to be branded humor so that we didn't end up being thrown in prison for treason or schizophrenia or any number of, you know, psychosis.

102
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,520
We don't have anything to do with Satan, but you know how some people are.

103
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,760
If it's not their particular personal savior, then it must be the devil.

104
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,560
No, yeah.

105
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,900
Because there's short duration personal savior.

106
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,200
We don't expect people to worship Bob forever.

107
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,440
In fact, that would probably be a pretty bad idea.

108
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,620
And it's like he works in your life for a while just long enough to free you from that.

109
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,760
That seriously bad cult that you were in.

110
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,520
Which might have been your employer.

111
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,120
But more than anything else, it's been really fun.

112
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,960
We meet the most interesting people this way.

113
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,920
When would you say that the Church of the Subgenius was at its maximum?

114
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,400
Was that during the days of you running the MTV ad?

115
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,200
Which, by the way, we still run on our show.

116
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,660
Well, I've converted it to MP3, and from time to time I'll drop it in.

117
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:54,100
It's kind of like we have come and gone in terms of fame and coolness.

118
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:02,320
Around 1984, we were the coolest thing in San Francisco for one month, which is about how long you're allowed to be.

119
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:12,640
But then again, in the 90s, we were cool in the Northeast, around Cleveland and Jacksonville.

120
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:12,640


121
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,400
And then in general, you know, Northeastern cities, we were doing a lot of live shows and clubs and stuff then.

122
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:30,720
And then we got infamous again when a terrible thing happened around 2005 where I had a young business partner.

123
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,800
He and his wife had a child custody problem.

124
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,480
She had a child before they were married.

125
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,600
And her ex-husband tried to have this child taken away from her.

126
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Because of Church of the Subgenius.

127
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,200
And this family judge in New York said, oh, okay.

128
00:09:50,420 --> 00:10:00,740
And took the kid away from a really hardworking college-educated family and stuck him back with this near-to-well, mentally ill biological dad.

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,660
And that made a lot of news on the Internet.

130
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,200
And that tragedy caused us to get a lot more attention.

131
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,580
And actually, we made more money that year than just about any other time.

132
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,620
Of course, Bob takes it all.

133
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,900
We don't see much of it.

134
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,740
You're serious about this.

135
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,840
Didn't the church know what was up with all of this?

136
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,900
Or did they really, they bought into it, is what you're saying.

137
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:41,080
Well, there was this family judge who initially said, oh, I don't want to hear about Church of the Subgenius.

138
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,740
That's a joke.

139
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,300
But then.

140
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,340
They managed to convince him, partly because of some of the raunchy stuff.

141
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,500
Remember, this was like several years ago.

142
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,480
And we had a lot of raunchy stuff on the Internet.

143
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,240
People since then, one by one, they call me up and go, hey, my grandma's on the Internet now.

144
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,760
Can you take down those topless pictures of me at the Subgenius camp out?

145
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,600
We had plenty of those.

146
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,820
We had an annual.

147
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,620
We still do.

148
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,440
We have this annual.

149
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:20,140
We have this annual kind of camp out where we all wait for the flying saucers to come on July 5th, 1998 every year.

150
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:34,120
And we've been doing it for years at a couple of different campsites and event centers that specialize in pagan and no hippie type festivals.

151
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,620
So that basically you can make noise all night long.

152
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,960
And people can run around with no clothes on if they want to.

153
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,800
You don't have to worry about me doing that voluntarily.

154
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,580
Voluntarily.

155
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:55,540
The first year that the world failed, they had the whole crowd stripped me down and threw me into a smelly pond.

156
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,380
I felt like I'd lynched, as if it was my fault.

157
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,440
You know, I'm not Bob.

158
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,220
Would that be the first baptism?

159
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,600
We've been doing that for a long time.

160
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,600


161
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,640
And they were a lot of fun.

162
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,800
Although we've had to switch from a swimming pool to a pond lately.

163
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,320
And I've been surprised how many people are afraid to get into a pond just because it's full of spiders and muck.

164
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,220
It's strange.

165
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,720
These kids these days are kind of scary cats.

166
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,480
They're soft.

167
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,740
Yeah, that's right.

168
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,940
That is the coming of the millennial Subgenius.

169
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,500
Yeah.

170
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,280
They're not.

171
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:46,340
I would never, ever call people names on the basis of their age because it takes all kinds.

172
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,500
There's really cool 10-year-old subgeniuses.

173
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,500
And then there's, you know, 50-year-old jerks that call themselves subgeniuses.

174
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,480
But really, all that made them a subgenius was their $35 membership fee.

175
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,100
That's really all it takes.

176
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,160
Mm-hmm.

177
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:15,320
You know, you won't necessarily be accepted as an equal, I guess, unless you act like a dumbass.

178
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,840
But your money will be accepted on equal?

179
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,320
If only it could have been Church of the Genius.

180
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,580
We'd have smart people.

181
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,400
We'd be rich.

182
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,360
But instead, we have subgeniuses.

183
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,180
Oh, well, they're a lot more fun.

184
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,360
So I got to ask you.

185
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,140
When you first started doing this and you guys were on your rise, I had read somewhere that you were a subgenius.

186
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,140


187
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,200
And I was wondering if you had any idea that William S. Burroughs actually wrote a short story for you guys.

188
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,780
Is that true?

189
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,740
No, he didn't exactly.

190
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,420
We were doing an anthology with Simon and Schuster of short stories about Bob.

191
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,340
And we had stories from some luminaries, science fiction writers.

192
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,140
Robert Anton Wilson wrote one just for us.

193
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,580
It was a Lovecraft takeoff.

194
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,320
Oh, who?

195
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,120
And John Shirley and Lewis Shiner, a few of them.

196
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,120


197
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,700
And a few other known sci-fi writers.

198
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:16,340
And we decided we'd hit up William Burroughs because we had heard we didn't know him or anything, but we had heard that he was subgenius friendly.

199
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,180
People had gone to shows where he was and he'd recognize the Bob button.

200
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,580
We managed to get through the firewall of his assistant who didn't think he'd be interested, but he was.

201
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,940
He said, oh, yeah, I've got just the thing.

202
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,520
He had already written something.

203
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,880
He thought would be perfect.

204
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,020
It was mainly about Jim Jones and the People's Temple, that mass suicide.

205
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,440
And in the 70s and but it fit perfectly.

206
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,900
No, it doesn't.

207
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:50,920
Go ahead.

208
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,980
In his in this case, it did.

209
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,220
Plus, you know, he was like the biggest name we had on the cover of the book.

210
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,780
Not that it helped much.

211
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,480
He did request twice as much as we were paying everybody else.

212
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,420
I think he got six.

213
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,100
I think he got six hundred bucks.

214
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,040
Whereas most of us got three hundred for our short story.

215
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:21,760
This is really funny stuff in that it's out of print, but we have it all on subgenius dot com buried in our classics section.

216
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:31,040
So you can read the William Burroughs thing and a bunch of other really funny stories on there and both pulse pounding, exciting stories.

217
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,640
All of this stuff.

218
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,480
Even the pirate out of print.

219
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,680
Are you planning on bringing any of this back into print at some point or another?

220
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,400
Or is it just stuff that that was it?

221
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,740
It's done.

222
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,460
It's archived.

223
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,080
And that's the last anybody's going to see of it unless they go digging for it.

224
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:52,920
Or, you know, we're we're we have been we have just started embarking on us into self publishing again.

225
00:15:53,780 --> 00:16:02,620
Thanks to print on demand companies so that you don't end up having to finance, you know, the printing of a thousand books that sit in your closet for five years.

226
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:02,620


227
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:15,440
We're going to reprint our old stark fist magazine, which was usually ended up being like a hundred and ten page journal that came out every two or three years.

228
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,700
And so we're going to I can reprint those pretty easily.

229
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,940
I've already scanned those.

230
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,320
I think I have rights to three fisted tails and I can release that.

231
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,740
And the other the two main subgenius books that aren't in print.

232
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,600
And I think I have rights to three fisted tails and I can release that. And the other the two main subgenius books that aren't in print.

233
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,860
Revelation X and newer one from 2006 called the Bob wollte

234
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,220
Okay.

235
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,640
When out of business and I'm going to

236
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,680
try to resurrect those books and we're also doing original stuff.

237
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,820
My radio partner, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, wrote a great sci-fi novel called Neighbor World.

238
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,080
It's almost like Clockwork Orange because it's written in this sort of future jargon.

239
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,380
It's great.

240
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,140
That one's our first one.

241
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,860
That was an easy one to do.

242
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,560
It was all text.

243
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,120
You can get Neighbor World on Amazon.com.

244
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,960
The book of the subgenius is still in print.

245
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,540
That's our original main book.

246
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,600
And strangely enough, that thing's been in print since 1983.

247
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,480
When you get your membership to the Church of the Subgenius, does that come with it?

248
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:31,100
Or is this like a Scientology thing where you got to experience the full strength of Bob?

249
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,680
You always need to contribute more.

250
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,900
Well, yeah.

251
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
It's a one-time.

252
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,820
You can become a lifetime subgenius for $35.

253
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,320
But no, we're not going to throw the book in.

254
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,580
You get a bunch of stuff.

255
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,880
I mean, you get the decoder ring, the bumper stickers,

256
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,520
the two magnets.

257
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,080
You get the main pamphlets, which are like little books.

258
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,920
And tons of graphics you can stick all over the place.

259
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,120
But, yeah, the book of the subgenius and Neighbor World and other stuff.

260
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,760
And the Hour of Slack radio show.

261
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,500
Now, that's free.

262
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,140
People can listen to that.

263
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,980
And there's 1,600 episodes online.

264
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,160
Now, you guys have been doing this for a while.

265
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,120
1985.

266
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,920
1985.

267
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,700
That wasn't even the first subgenius radio show.

268
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,320
Puzzling Evidence started doing a weekly show at KPFA in San Francisco in 1982.

269
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,360
And they're still on.

270
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,640
Do they still have a podcast feed?

271
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,420
Huh?

272
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,460
Do they still have a podcast feed going?

273
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,080
Because I was listening to them for a while.

274
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,520
Then it seemed like their feed or something fell off.

275
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,380
I wasn't able to find Puzzling Evidence anymore.

276
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,420
Or do they just combine with your feed?

277
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,200
Right.

278
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
There was somebody.

279
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,580
They weren't archiving it.

280
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,960
Somebody else was.

281
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,840
And he quit.

282
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,680
But now they're archiving it again.

283
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,240
If you just Google around for Puzzling Evidence, it should show up.

284
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,600
Or you can look at the page, the Hour of Slack page on subgenius.com.

285
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,360
Points to the other subgenius radio shows.

286
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:15,360
Of which, right now, there are three others besides Hour of Slack that are currently being done every week.

287
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,740
And I'm going to make a point.

288
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:23,640
Reverend Susie the Floozy does a show out of WREK in Atlanta.

289
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:37,520
And then there's a podcast called Time for the Show that's now being done every week or so by a bunch of younger folks who are much faster and less brain damaged.

290
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,860
Or maybe they're more brain damaged and they just sound faster.

291
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,520
I don't know.

292
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,880
So are there younger generations?

293
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,340
Yes.

294
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,600
Of subgeniuses coming in to fill the ranks now as the older ones get older?

295
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,680
Are you experiencing any growth in the church?

296
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,360
Oh, yeah.

297
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:54,860
Absolutely.

298
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,260
That's always been going on.

299
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,820
And plus, people get tired of it and drop away.

300
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,120
So there's been a certain amount of attrition all the time.

301
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,340
And yet there's new seekers coming in.

302
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,980
And the younger ones gripe a lot about, hey, it's all old people.

303
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,860
But there are young ones griping about that fact.

304
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,820
And they are somewhat outnumbered.

305
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:29,040
But yeah, there's always new ones come along.

306
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,320
Now, whether they're good for anything, that's a subjective viewpoint, I suppose.

307
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,600
I really enjoy the new radio show.

308
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,820
That's a change of pace for me.

309
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,880
And, you know, of course, anything.

310
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,660
Boy, you've been doing this job for 35 or 40 years.

311
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,820
Oh, God.

312
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,200
If anybody wants to do anything new, please do it.

313
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,220
Flip it out.

314
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,500
If you make a million bucks, send us 10%.

315
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,400
I make that 15.

316
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,180
15%.

317
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,580
Make a million bucks off this Bob ripoff thing.

318
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,840
Just send us 15%.

319
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,500
We'll be fine.

320
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,340
Wow.

321
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,120
And then we'll see you after we got some money out of you.

322
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,900
Then we'll sue you for trademark infringement.

323
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,260
Sounds about right.

324
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,040
All of it.

325
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,880
We haven't actually talked about that yet.

326
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,600
Because nobody's made a million bucks off of it.

327
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,580
It's true.

328
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,200
I got to ask you about the Devo thing.

329
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,320
Because Devo very much acquaints themselves with the Church of the Subgenius and Bob Dobbs.

330
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,740
How did you guys get involved with Devo?

331
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,620
How did that fall into place?

332
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,740
It was real easy.

333
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,980
I sent them a fan letter and a Subgenius pamphlet.

334
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,080
Because their second album, they had a little poster.

335
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,020
Actually, they got the artwork from us for the poster.

336
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,600
Or they redesigned one of our posters and made it theirs.

337
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,220
And they had a little...

338
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,940
No, that must have happened afterwards.

339
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,860
Anyway, at some point,

340
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,320
they had a poster.

341
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,040
They had a fan club, Club Devo, which is still going.

342
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,280
And I sent them a postcard and a pamphlet.

343
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,600
And I was amazed I got a response from Mark Mothersbaugh.

344
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,020
And he wanted to know more.

345
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,600
And I had done a 16mm underground movie

346
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,540
the one year I was in college.

347
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,220
And I sent that to them.

348
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,660
And they hired me on the spot.

349
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:41,840
And I was hired by the music company.

350
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,160
And they hired me on the spot to animate a G.I. Joe and Barbie

351
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,600
for one of their music videos, Love Without Anger.

352
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,100
And we just kind of did stuff for each other back and forth.

353
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
I did some animation for them real cheap.

354
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,980
And Mark contributed music to our MTV thing.

355
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,940
That music is by Mark Mothersbaugh.

356
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,800
And since then, I've kind of...

357
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,400
Mark has gotten so famous, I've kind of lost touch with him.

358
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,420
But I see Jerry Casale quite frequently.

359
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,640
And in fact, we were at his house.

360
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,000
Hanging out not very long ago.

361
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,700
He married a subgenius, too.

362
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,560
That proves it.

363
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,740
See, now there's going to be interbreedings

364
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,800
between divos and subgeniuses.

365
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,180
It's probably not a bad thing, though.

366
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,900
No, no, no.

367
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,620
Are you guys familiar with the band Negative Land?

368
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,820
Oh, yeah, very much so.

369
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,640
They opened at a...

370
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,020
They had our big show in 1984.

371
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,120
And that was like the second time they had ever played out.

372
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,000
Wow.

373
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,820
Wow, no kidding.

374
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,560
So at that point, we were more famous than them.

375
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,920
Around 1984, it's funny how many people I met

376
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,500
that I was slightly more...

377
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,420
I was a lot more famous than them,

378
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,760
although that's not saying much.

379
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,360
And then a few years later, they became household words.

380
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,880
Matt Groenig, for instance, of The Simpsons.

381
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,240
Yeah.

382
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,480
I met him when...

383
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,700
Just got in life in hell syndicated.

384
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,260
I got to see him again a couple of months ago, too.

385
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,060
And I hadn't seen him in all that time,

386
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,320
but he remembered that we had burgers at Astro Boy in L.A.

387
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,600
And sat around bitching about how we were never going to make it.

388
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,560
He's working on some real new show now.

389
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,680
I can't wait to see.

390
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,440
Future.

391
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:41,640
Future.

392
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,700
Futurama.

393
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,960
Futurama is like my favorite show that was on all the years that it was on.

394
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,360
Futurama was great.

395
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,480
It was on, then it went away, and then I think it came back.

396
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,940
I think it came back three times?

397
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,260
Yeah.

398
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,260
Was it two or three times?

399
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
I know it got canceled at least once.

400
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,540
Fox hated Matt Groenig because he had put them on the map

401
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,460
with something that made fun of right-wingers.

402
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,560
How dare he put them on the map making fun of idiots like them?

403
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:11,640
Yeah.

404
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:18,940
But so they really, they very much sabotaged Futurama as best they could.

405
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,500
They own The Simpsons.

406
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,860
They couldn't do anything about that.

407
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,820
But Matt had a much more connection to Futurama.

408
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,400
And they really, it was personal.

409
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:41,340
And I was so disgusted with the whole thing that when Fox started messing

410
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:47,140
with the scheduling of Futurama, I learned how to watch TV only on the internet.

411
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,860
And I haven't watched a regular cable show since.

412
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,120
I never see commercials.

413
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,360
So, ha ha.

414
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,500
Yeah, I became a cord cutter last year.

415
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,600
You learn how to download shows right after they air in England,

416
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,820
and the commercials are automatically cut out of them.

417
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:18,620
So, I guess it doesn't help the ratings of the show a whole lot, but I didn't have to.

418
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,780
Are you a Doctor Who fan?

419
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,860
You know, I never have actually watched a Doctor Who show.

420
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,680
Not once.

421
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,300
What?

422
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,660
Seriously?

423
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,920
I've also never seen an X-Files episode.

424
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,920
What?

425
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,500
Yeah, the reason for this is because I became a dad in 1979.

426
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,420
I'm the father of kids and this church.

427
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,360
And I had a day job.

428
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:49,080
So, I basically missed a lot of television, which I'm catching up on now.

429
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,560
I mean, half the people I know were real big Doctor Who fans.

430
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm sure I'd love it.

431
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,160
But, I mean, yeah.

432
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,540
That's why I can't believe you can't watch Doctor Who.

433
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,560
It just blows my mind.

434
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Well, you asked how you start a cult.

435
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,080
You have to sacrifice other cults.

436
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,720
You do.

437
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,840
You have to sacrifice your fandom.

438
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,260
You have to, like...

439
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,680
Yeah, it's...

440
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,180
You know, I missed out on all the other geek stuff in order to promote my own geek thing.

441
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,460
You need to do what Christianity does and just, like, encapsulate and absorb.

442
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,320
So, you need to, you know, you need to go and find those people and be like,

443
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,800
yes, we too are of the who.

444
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,720
And just absorb them into what you do and incorporate it into...

445
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,580
You know, all these subgroups of geek culture out there could very easily...

446
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,000
They need a shepherd, you know?

447
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,740
And you guys could fill that role nicely.

448
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,200
Well, yeah.

449
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,620
Well, we did do that for a long time.

450
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,320
The second book that we had published was called High Weirdness by Mail.

451
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:56,480
And it was a compendium of all the cool, weird stuff that we had discovered.

452
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:04,780
Some of it was kook material that was fun to read because it was insane and disgusting.

453
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,980
And other stuff was just really weird art.

454
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,000
And so, you know, we...

455
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,720
We tried to spread around our discoveries as much as possible.

456
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,660
The internet kind of made that redundant.

457
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,300
Yeah, I can see what you mean.

458
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:19,660
You know what I mean?

459
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:19,780
Yeah.

460
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,800
You know, all you had to do was type the word weird into Google and there it is.

461
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,700
It's done for you.

462
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,720
Yeah, I do it on a daily basis.

463
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:29,940
Literally.

464
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:30,840
Literally.

465
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,280
Our show functions on weird.

466
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,840
I need to ask you, and we discussed this very briefly before we hit record,

467
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,180
the whole Leesburg...

468
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,740
The 1956 drugstore ad that has a picture very much resembling Bob Dobbs.

469
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,040
What was that all about?

470
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,820
Oh, there's no question.

471
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,260
Well, see, here's...

472
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,040
That discovery spooked us.

473
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,000
Your listeners first have to imagine the original picture of Bob that put us on the map.

474
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,960
Is this...

475
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,020
Really, it's a halftone picture that looks like it was probably...

476
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,180
It started out as a drawing, like a black and white wash drawing.

477
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,140
I always imagined it was, kind of like a black and white painting.

478
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,440
And, of course, Bob had appeared in drawings and idealized pictures of him.

479
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,240
It had been showing up in magazines for decades, but they were all different angles of him, you know.

480
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,260
And it could be some other guy.

481
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,120
They all looked...

482
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,420
Every dad looked like that.

483
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,060
Half of them were named Bob.

484
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,380
They all had the pipe and they all had that...

485
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,920
Weird grin.

486
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,360
And some of them were Bob when he was modeling.

487
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,740
Well, still, the one true Dobbs hit.

488
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,480
It's like...

489
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,820
We had found it as a piece of clip art in a Yellow Page clip art book.

490
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,540
It was public domain.

491
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,340
Free stuff to use.

492
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,060
And we thought, well, that's Bob.

493
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,900
And we trademarked it.

494
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,700
And stared at it for 20 or 25 years.

495
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,120
Thinking that...

496
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,240
That was all there was.

497
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:21,040
Then somebody discovered these old ads in a newspaper in Virginia that had a photograph of Bob.

498
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,320
And it's definitely the one that the drawing is made from.

499
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:31,280
Because the Brylcreem gleam and the hair matches up perfectly.

500
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,460
The pipe does...

501
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,380
I mean, we've overlaid them on each other.

502
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,600
And yet, the photograph looks different.

503
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,060
He looks a lot jowlier.

504
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:43,100
He looks like an older guy than the main picture of Bob.

505
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,540
And it's a real face.

506
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,880
And so you can imagine.

507
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,660
That's like...

508
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,100
It just gave us the creeps.

509
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,520
We pretended we hadn't seen it for about four years.

510
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,580
Seriously.

511
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,400
It was like we just didn't know how to deal with it.

512
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,980
And then...

513
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,760
Is this like a possible situation where you have...

514
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,420
Like Bob Dobbs just reaching out through time and space to all of us?

515
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,040
Is Bob...

516
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,040


517
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,840
Has Bob always been there?

518
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,120
Is this like ancient aliens?

519
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:11,740
Right.

520
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,240
Yeah.

521
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,540
That's exactly what's been...

522
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:14,980
I mean...

523
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,500
If you look in Book of the Subgenius, there actually have always been Bobs.

524
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,860
You can find Bob images going back to the ancient Egyptians.

525
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,820
And, you know, cave paintings.

526
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,100
There...

527
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,200
There's pipes everywhere.

528
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,200
You know, all you have to do is put a pipe on something and it suddenly becomes a subgenius image.

529
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,480
That's awesome.

530
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,100
And...

531
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,160
And...

532
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,020
And...

533
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,360
Bob had been planting...

534
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,960
Freaking awesome.

535
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,960
Bob and the previous incarnations of Bob had been planting these hints forever.

536
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:59,260
And as the media overload built up in the 20th century, people started growing up seeing that grinning face and identifying it with something.

537
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:08,260
And, of course, after we started spreading it around, starting in the 80s, you know, people started spray painting stencils of it.

538
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:08,700
Yeah.

539
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,000
Yeah.

540
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000


541
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000


542
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000


543
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000


544
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000


545
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000


546
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000


547
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000


548
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000


549
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,280
And...

550
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,100
And...

551
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,100


552
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,100


553
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,100


554
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,100


555
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,100


556
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,380
And little...

557
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,700
I run into people...

558
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:29,460
Middle-aged people all the time that saw it when they were, like, in elementary school because somebody had stuck that face under their desk or inside the pencil sharpener or 30 feet up the side of the school building.

559
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,620
I've heard of all of those examples.

560
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,680
And these kids just sit and stare at that face and wonder about it.

561
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,900
And then the day comes when they see...

562
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,040
a little ad that says, send a dollar if you want to know about Bob.

563
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,080
Of course, nobody ever sends a dollar.

564
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,400
That's the part they figure is a joke.

565
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,760
When we started selling stuff for $10,

566
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,000
and they sell a little tiny metal pin at Bob's face for $10.

567
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,240
Well, we can sell a lot more of those than the ones that sell for only $1.

568
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,280
Go figure.

569
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,080
I really should double off.

570
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,000
I should add a zero to every product.

571
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,760
My son keeps telling me.

572
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,160
Dad, you've got to add a zero to everything.

573
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,020
So what you're kind of saying is it's possible that Bob could have been there

574
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,980
from the beginning manipulating our DNA,

575
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
and again, the way ancient aliens were,

576
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:32,160
to possibly engineer a genetic breed of Bobites or Bobbies, if you will.

577
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:38,060
Actually, it started so far back in antiquity.

578
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,400
It would blow your mind.

579
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,480
But this is all in Book of the Subgenius.

580
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,840
About 80 million years ago, the men from Planet X landed on the Earth,

581
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,260
accidentally wiped out the dinosaurs,

582
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,220
and created this servant race called the Yeti that were perfect bipedal beings.

583
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:02,540
They survived as what we call Bigfoot or the abominable snowman.

584
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,320
But of course, they're way more advanced than people.

585
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,680
The Yetis created the humans.

586
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,680
Later on, as a kind of lab rats.

587
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,100
And then were sloppy.

588
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,540
And they let them get loose.

589
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,040
And they even had sex with them.

590
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:22,820
And so now, in the modern time, you see the Yeti gene has been diluted terribly.

591
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,000
And the humans are just making a terrible mess of the whole planet.

592
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,120
In fact, they already destroyed the Earth once and switched places with Mars.

593
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,380
So they could start up.

594
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,180
What we're on now, actually, is a pristine planet

595
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,060
that used to be called the Yeti.

596
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,480
It was called Mars.

597
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,740
And Mars used to look kind of like what we call the Earth.

598
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,820
But look what we did to it.

599
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,520
Now it's barren, airless.

600
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,600
Nothing grows there.

601
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:55,780
Is it possible that offshoots of a certain species occurred over hundreds of thousands of years?

602
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,400
The ancient alien theory answers that exact question.

603
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,060
And the answer is Bob.

604
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,120
Bob.

605
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,860
Bob!

606
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,520
What about Nibiru?

607
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,200
Huh?

608
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,040
What about Nibiru?

609
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,060
Planet Nibiru.

610
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,940
Oh, that's superstitious nonsense.

611
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:12,840
Oh, okay.

612
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,000
That's a different kind of nonsense.

613
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,520
The real planet actually is light.

614
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,440
There you have it, folks.

615
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,300
That's crackpot stuff.

616
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,760
Are you kidding?

617
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,740
Those people are nuts.

618
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,200
Who could believe that kind of nonsense?

619
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,740
Yes.

620
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,700
This is a scientific cult.

621
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,780
Indeed.

622
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,040
Well, you having said that and pointing out that the Earth is a planet,

623
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,040


624
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,040


625
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,040


626
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,040


627
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,040


628
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,040


629
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,460
which all of your science sounds very sound.

630
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,040
I really, you know, I can't disagree with it.

631
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,540
What is your opinion on the coming singularity?

632
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,420
Well, the problem is that it's actually a race between the singularity and the ideogularity.

633
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:05,600
Can the machines become smart before the humans become so much dumber that they blow everything?

634
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,880
That's the race.

635
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:13,720
I have friends who honestly believe that there's this, that the artificial intelligence will

636
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,640
become so great that it'll solve all our problems.

637
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:25,660
Well, Genesis is Skylab, to quote the fifth Terminator movie.

638
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,660
And I don't trust the cloud or Skylab or any of that stuff.

639
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,500
I also don't trust people to get any smarter.

640
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,640
I remember when the Internet was something you had to be pretty smart to even know what

641
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,160
it was.

642
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,800
And now look at it.

643
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,600
It's just making people dumber and dumber and dumber.

644
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:51,800
Because no matter what stupid thing you want to believe, you can now find easily find 10,000

645
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,960
other people that have proof for the stupid thing you want to believe.

646
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Let's not even go the political direction, because that's where it has become.

647
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,480
Yeah.

648
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:10,280
It's infinitely obvious that the Internet is destroying people's brains.

649
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,540
I mean, it is rotting people's minds.

650
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,800
I knew it was going to become like TV.

651
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,460
And it did.

652
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,620
And it'll be worse.

653
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,300
I tell you.

654
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,500
Mark my words.

655
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,140
Nobody believes the old prophet of doom until it all comes down.

656
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,920
I won't be here, though.

657
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,260
I'll be with Bob on the saucers when that happens.

658
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,080
Does the Church of the Subgenius have a stance on the concept of flat Earth?

659
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,780
Yes.

660
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,760
That's pretty dumb.

661
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,380
It's much more complicated than that.

662
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,140
Not only is the Earth spherical, but it's hollow.

663
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,320
And there are a number of...

664
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,340
It's like one of those Russian nesting dolls.

665
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,240
It's planet inside planet inside planet.

666
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,780
We're only taking their word for it that this is the top floor.

667
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,360
You know, we see a sky, but I've never been to the moon.

668
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,340
I could all be fake, I suppose.

669
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,000
I've had friends who insisted that we never went to the moon.

670
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,060
And then a month later, they were telling me that the U.S. government had slave camps there.

671
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,140
They'd go from, we never landed there at all, to they're covering up slave camps.

672
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,560
Or that there's a city on the backside of it, and NASA's altered the photos.

673
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,060
And...

674
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,280
Oh, yeah.

675
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,480
What's the other one? The Black Knight satellite?

676
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,600
You don't even need the moon.

677
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,540
You just go down the...

678
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,880
The Nazis had an entrance to the hollow Earth at the North Pole.

679
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,580
And they were trying to make deals with the underground demon people that lived down there.

680
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,180
It backfired.

681
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,380
Sounds like it.

682
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,280
Yeah.

683
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,940
Yeah, no, we're more into the hollow Earth than the flat Earth.

684
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,140
I mean, it's real easy to prove it's flat, but it's harder to prove that it's not hollow.

685
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,980
Well, in subsections, it is.

686
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,020
Very true. Very true indeed.

687
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,960
Sure it is.

688
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,760
I mean, Carlsbad Cavern just keeps going.

689
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,860
I think...

690
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,180
There's caves that they don't know how far they go.

691
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,160
Wasn't there an Oracle Lobo that said something about how they've discovered the Earth?

692
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,140
That there's more water inside the Earth than on the surface at this point?

693
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:32,900
Yes.

694
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,720
Yeah, that's common knowledge.

695
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,140
Maybe.

696
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,460
And when that stuff comes squirting out, then suddenly we've got Waterworld, right?

697
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,680
Stephen Baxter wrote two really good novels about that happening.

698
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,280
I don't think it's proved that there's more water underneath the surface.

699
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,140
Exactly.

700
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,200
Not in terms of one big ocean.

701
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,900
There might very well be more water down there.

702
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,240
But it's not like in an ocean that's going to come squirting out.

703
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,180
No.

704
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:02,820
I don't think.

705
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,360
No, it's trapped in aquifers.

706
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:04,680
There is.

707
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,080
We're going to need it for the super volcano at Yellowstone.

708
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,680
Yeah, that caldera is really going to screw us over, isn't it?

709
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,680
Right.

710
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,080
We're going to need the super volcano to...

711
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,540
Well, no, we don't need the super volcano.

712
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,800
We're going to need the water from the hollow Earth to put out the volcano.

713
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:26,780
Yes.

714
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,800
They're just going to have a really big hose to get it over there.

715
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,860
See, we're scientific about our stuff.

716
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,440
We are.

717
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,940
It's awesome.

718
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,600
Okay.

719
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,420
God, so many questions to ask you.

720
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,440
So many places to go.

721
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,920
For anybody who's new to the Church of the Subgenius, who hasn't heard this yet, can

722
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,780
you give us the brief dime store tour of how we're going to be saved by Bob Dobbs?

723
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,120
The whole...

724
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,420
Which, by the way, I need to ask you before we do this.

725
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:05,140
Now that you've moved from your dwellings in Ohio down to Texas, what is the future of

726
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,900
X Day in Ohio?

727
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,160
Are they still going to be holding it there?

728
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,440
Oh, yeah.

729
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:07,800
Yeah.

730
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,680
It's too hot in July in Texas.

731
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,820
It's hot enough in Ohio.

732
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,100
Yeah.

733
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,740
Actually, it's funny.

734
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,100
My wife co-directs another festival called...

735
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:31,080
It's called Starwood that's for more spiritual type weirdos.

736
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,300
And it's also a music, like a world music festival.

737
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,540
And it's the week after X Day at the same place.

738
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:46,400
And we'll both keep going back to Ohio to do that forever, until the world ends, I should

739
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,780
say, which should be this summer.

740
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,000
But...

741
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,400
This summer.

742
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,180
This summer.

743
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,080
We have been let down 20 times.

744
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,080


745
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,080


746
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,240
20 times so far.

747
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,940
What is the reason for that?

748
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:05,640
Because every July 5th you celebrate X Day, which is when the aliens are supposed to come

749
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,540
and rescue the members of the church subgenius where Bob Dobbs...

750
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,820
Correct me if I'm wrong, of course.

751
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,920
I don't mean to get the religion wrong.

752
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,520
Where Bob Dobbs...

753
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,100
No, no.

754
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,400
You got it wrong.

755
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:24,080
Has brokered a deal with Jehovah One to give everybody their own private planet that's

756
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,960
the way that they want it to be.

757
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,800
But that's supposed to be on July 5th, correct?

758
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,440
July 5th, 1998.

759
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,420
Okay.

760
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,160
So, is our calendar wrong?

761
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,400
We're a little far beyond that.

762
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,740
We don't know what year this really is.

763
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,900
We don't even know for sure what planet this is.

764
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,480
Again, we're just taking their word for all of this.

765
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:55,700
Bob said that the world would end July 5th, 1998 at 7 in the morning, for everyone but

766
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:55,940
the aliens.

767
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,440
All they have to do is paying subgeniuses.

768
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,180
Everybody else undergo terrible tribulations, partly at the hands of the now equipped subgeniuses

769
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,980
with their death planets and stuff.

770
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,040
But obviously, I mean, Bob sold it.

771
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,740
We smoked it.

772
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,580
That settles it.

773
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,000
1998 hasn't come yet.

774
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,420
This could be 1818 for all we know.

775
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,800
And we've got a long time to...

776
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,140
If somebody noticed that it looked like the numbers had been turned upside down from the

777
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:36,820
original note and that Bob had originally scrolled down July 5th, 8661.

778
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,020
If you flip those numbers over, it says 1998.

779
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,280
That's just silly.

780
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,500
Nobody's going to wait 6,000 years for Bob, I don't think.

781
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,440
I hope not.

782
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,660
Some people wait 2,000 for their saviors.

783
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,300
But hey, go ahead.

784
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,260
Yeah, actually, you're right.

785
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,480
I mean, there's quite a few other cults that still...

786
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,500
Nobody's waited for the end of the world as many times as us.

787
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:11,000
The Jehovah's Witnesses have given all their worldly goods away about 10 times, but we've

788
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,160
done it 20 times.

789
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,800
Amen to that.

790
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:20,600
Well, as far as cults go and religious organizations such as yours, you guys probably have the

791
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,560
best bang for buck on a relative short time scale.

792
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,460
Because every religion out there, it's like 2,000 years, 1,000 years.

793
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,040
It's repeating all of the...

794
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,760
When's it going to repeat?

795
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,480
Well, it goes through cycles and we're in this cycle now.

796
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,920
Whereas you guys are like, no, this is a relatively short timeframe.

797
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,360
There's really not that much waiting involved.

798
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,640
It's a sign up and...

799
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:51,220
The world ends on July 5th, assuming this year might be 1998.

800
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,540
Well, I'll be out there.

801
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,540
That's the only time I have to get up at seven in the morning is X day, July 5th.

802
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,140
I've got a pretty good job.

803
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,580
Well, some people don't want to play the long game for salvation.

804
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,560
Some people...

805
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,660
This is the modern age.

806
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,720
Again, this is why this is one of the perfect religions for millennials because it's very

807
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,140
much...

808
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,840
It's an instant gratification, no wait kind of thing.

809
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:20,260
Whereas with most religions, as I stated, you have to wait quite some time to get your

810
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,240
comeuppance.

811
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,460
And you guys do have...

812
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,240
We have a money back guarantee.

813
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,720
We encourage...

814
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,560
I mean, slack comes first for every subgenius.

815
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,000
And that means if you like to eat, go ahead and eat all you want.

816
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,480
You might need to, of course, vomit later or something.

817
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:47,660
But it's like the way to escape temptation is to completely give into it.

818
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,840
And then it loses its power over you.

819
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,940
That sounds good, doesn't it?

820
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,020
Yeah, it's a Bob-ism.

821
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,620
Sounds a Bob, right?

822
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:04,720
So people should go ahead and max out their credit card sending money to us so that they'll

823
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,260
really be guaranteed a really good seat on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

824
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,160
They are sex goddesses.

825
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,300
They may appear as gods to some people, but that's what they want.

826
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,920
Well, if some people are into that kind of stuff, they're not going to be able to get

827
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,000
into the sex goddess thing.

828
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,000


829
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,000


830
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,000


831
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,000


832
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,520
And that's the kind of thing that's to each their own.

833
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,280
Well, it's funny that they're called the men from Planet X because they're actually

834
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,260
all female.

835
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,780
They don't need males around.

836
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,820
They haven't needed males for millions of years, from what I've heard.

837
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,620
Must be handsome females then.

838
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,520
They're so much smarter than humans.

839
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,240
That doesn't take much.

840
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:44,580
And parthenogenesis.

841
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,240
The men from Planet X have parthenogenesis, so technically they're really women from

842
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:51,900
Planet X.

843
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:51,900


844
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:51,900


845
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:51,900


846
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:57,200
let's talk about the kickstarter campaign uh the documentary that's being made about you guys

847
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,400
that has made over two hundred thousand dollars and i think it met its goals pretty quickly

848
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,720
that's just figures somebody else can make 200 grand off a church's subgenius

849
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:17,120
you sound bitter no no actually i'm so happy that they're doing this um we made a feature-length

850
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:24,620
documentary about the church in the 80s late 80s called arise and it's really good you can see it

851
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:33,580
for free on the internet or buy a dvd from us but um i i've always wanted to put together a

852
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:42,380
sort of a capsule history and video i've been shooting video and and recording stuff all this

853
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,800
time i have a massive massive amount of oh

854
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,240
mostly badly filmed vhs tapes we also have some professionally done stuff too

855
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,240
and um these folks in austin were smart enough to go you know there's a story here

856
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:08,540
and we're film producers and since we also run south by southwest there's a good chance our film

857
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:16,800
will get seen and finished and um god they it's like they spent a ton of money

858
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,100
on it

859
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,100
shooting over the last year with professional crew.

860
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:26,100
They flew out to San Francisco to film the radio puzzling evidence show,

861
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,380
people out there, and they shot it X day.

862
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:36,300
They were at my Cleveland house, which I need to sell, by the way,

863
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,860
and my Texas house where I'm going to stay mostly.

864
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,120
And I'm not telling them how to make their movie about Church of the Subgenius

865
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,700
because I don't know where to start.

866
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,300
And they're having trouble hammering it down and focusing it.

867
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,500
There's so much after 35 years or 40 years of this stuff.

868
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,860
So they're focusing on the early days.

869
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,420
And I've already lost a couple of friends because they weren't being focused

870
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:09,840
on.

871
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,700
Because they weren't part of the old guard.

872
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,360
But, you know, like I say, I can't tell them how to make their movie.

873
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,400
I'm just trying to help them make it as best they can.

874
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:27,780
And in fact, I've spent the last three weeks going through all of our

875
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:33,680
photographs, just still photos from the from the 80s before there was,

876
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,540
you know, we didn't have video cameras the first few years.

877
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,340
And so.

878
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,660
So I've been collecting all these stills and I've actually kind of relived my

879
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,560
entire life and photographs over the last three weeks.

880
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,780
And I feel like I'm about to go nuts.

881
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:55,240
But nuts with happiness because it's been so it's nuts with happiness.

882
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:55,980
It really is.

883
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,560
It's a really interesting story.

884
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:05,500
If they can encapsulate this stuff right, it should be really, really good.

885
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,760
I'm going to be going down.

886
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,860
I'm going to be going down there to to do some last minute interviews.

887
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,540
They want to interview Dr.

888
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,180
Drummond and me to kind of tie together stuff.

889
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,980
And maybe I'll get some clue as to what their focus will be.

890
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,100
You know, I might not even like this thing, but I have edited and written

891
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,040
four feature length documentaries myself.

892
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,000
And I know how hard it is to make even a bad movie.

893
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,000
So, you know, I just and they're hiring really good people.

894
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,640
I mean, this isn't like an amateur thing.

895
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:47,760
Two hundred grand.

896
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,980
That's a lot of money for a documentary.

897
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
And documentaries don't make money.

898
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:59,040
There's no way that they're going to actually, you know, make big bucks off of a documentary

899
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,700
that just almost never.

900
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,740
Is there a chance of this thing popping up on Netflix or anything like that?

901
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,420
Because Netflix is pretty documentary friendly.

902
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,600
Oh, absolutely.

903
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,100
Absolutely.

904
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,240
That's.

905
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,740
That's what's so good about it is that I'm sure, you know, I'm pretty sure they're going to finish it.

906
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,880
And I'm and if they do, these folks are so connected.

907
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,500
Oh, they know they know how to get things out there.

908
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,060
This is the this is the people who started South by Southwest.

909
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,960
The giant music film and computer festival in Austin.

910
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,740
It's unthinkably huge.

911
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:46,600
It's like those like the San Diego Comics Con or Dragon Con, only it's different kind of.

912
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:47,900
Stuff.

913
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,120
It blew my mind.

914
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,720
The tickets for it cost like sixteen hundred bucks.

915
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,920
And we got to go for free last year because they were our buddies and they wanted to film us there.

916
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,020
Holy crap.

917
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:09,080
Yeah, we were at we were at a party full of rich country Western stars and movie directors.

918
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:16,440
And who was the camera crew following around me and Philo and Paul Mavridis?

919
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,440
It's like people are sidling up to us.

920
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,440
You're like, why?

921
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,060
Who are you guys?

922
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,120
And why is that crew following you?

923
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,640
And we go, ignore him.

924
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,520
We don't know who they are.

925
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,500
They're just going to go away.

926
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,800
And then they go, come on.

927
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,580
Now, seriously, why?

928
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,640
And the film crew actually got to show me and Philo whipping out pamphlets.

929
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:39,740
And they said, well, you know, I'm not going to do that.

930
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:39,740


931
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:39,740


932
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:39,740


933
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:39,740


934
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:39,740


935
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:39,740


936
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:39,740


937
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,180
And I said, well, you know, I'm not going to do that.

938
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:40,180


939
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:40,180


940
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:45,580
And turning on these complete newcomers who just were curious about why we were being filmed.

941
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,320
And by the end of it, they were in the movie.

942
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,320
I hope.

943
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,200
I was told that that little scene was really funny.

944
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,700
Do you think this will bring more people to the Church of the Subgenius?

945
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,260
And if it does, are you ready for that?

946
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,780
Are you ready for a big resurgence?

947
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,720
Oh, I'd love it.

948
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,260
I'd love it.

949
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:09,180
I'd be man, I'd be hand assembling membership packs day in and day out.

950
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,480
I was going to say.

951
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,660
I do all that stuff myself.

952
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:22,240
And the actual mail order thing, that aspect of it, it's pretty much just just me.

953
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:27,340
I mean, I'm not the only person who writes and illustrates this stuff by a long shot.

954
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:34,200
It's but I'm the I'm the one who actually fills the orders and gets the stuff printed and all that.

955
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,300
I've gotten so fast at it.

956
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,340
I'm starting to feel like the ant farm.

957
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,000
Guy or the sea monkeys.

958
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,820
God, no.

959
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,700
We're in both cases.

960
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:51,180
Those were these goofy little businesses that were advertised in comic books and stuff.

961
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:56,860
But sooner or later, everybody had an ant farm and sea monkeys.

962
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,880
Every kid.

963
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,480
Lobos got one now.

964
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,260
I still have.

965
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,720
And it's it's a guy working at his house.

966
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,740
Selling this thing.

967
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,980
And they're they've done really, really well.

968
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:21,640
Obviously, I'm not nearly as good a business person as the ladies who are doing this movie.

969
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,400
And it is mostly ladies, which is kind of interesting.

970
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,660
The church is tended to be a bit of a sausage fest.

971
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,320
And that it has.

972
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:39,540
I mean, we're a little we've got much more diversity than Glar or or even Devo.

973
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:39,720
Yeah.

974
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,060
Probably.

975
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,320
But it's not all geeky guys.

976
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,340
And these these ladies really want to they want to draw more gals into it.

977
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:51,680
Yeah.

978
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,740
Enough of the women running around.

979
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,800
Well, whatever.

980
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,960
They were whatever they were.

981
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,720
They were kind of wanting to turn it in, turn, put the focus on Connie, Bob's wife.

982
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,720
But I think I think they realized that.

983
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,340
Although Connie's important, really, the focus has always been Bob.

984
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,720
But his face, you know, that face, that's really all you need.

985
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,680
You were asking, how do you start a cult?

986
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,440
Find the right face.

987
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:30,540
Find the perfect head and people will tattoo that damn thing all over themselves.

988
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,660
They'll become more billboards for your your cult.

989
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,760
It's just nuts.

990
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,120
I wouldn't do that.

991
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,640
I don't even wear Bob shirts when I'm driving around.

992
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:43,320
I know what it's like to be the Bob guy.

993
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,240
And in Dallas, I was the Bob guy.

994
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,780
I managed to avoid that in Cleveland.

995
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:51,900
Now I live in a small town in rural Texas.

996
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,800
There are worse things to be known as.

997
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,260
Well, I'm hoping to just be known as Mr.

998
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,480
Smith's son that came back to town.

999
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,820
And he has some kind of thing, publishes funny books or something.

1000
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:09,260
Well, if people would like to become involved in the church of the subgenius and if they'd

1001
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:15,160
like to become members, tell anybody where they can go, how much it costs and do mention

1002
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,360
your money back guarantee.

1003
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,660
I feel that's very important for anybody looking for some form of salvation in this day and

1004
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:21,920
age.

1005
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,360
Which, by the way, Bob doesn't discriminate, by the way.

1006
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,880
From what I understand, you can be multiple religions because you can never have too many

1007
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,380
saviors.

1008
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:28,960
Correct?

1009
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:29,680
Right.

1010
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,460
Sure.

1011
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:30,740
Sure.

1012
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,240
Bob is not a jealous God.

1013
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,100
He's not really God either.

1014
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,380
He's just the luckiest tool of God.

1015
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,240
He's a tool of something.

1016
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,640
I don't want to drag God into this.

1017
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:41,900
Is he a tool of something?

1018
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:42,740
Yeah.

1019
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,820
He's God's biggest tool, we might say.

1020
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,260
God's got a great big one, too.

1021
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,160
And he's a man.

1022
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,560
That's why I've heard that all my life.

1023
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,420
God's a man.

1024
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,180
Now, frankly, I think that's a little anthropomorphic.

1025
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,360
Yeah.

1026
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,100
I would agree.

1027
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,280
But anyway, we're getting into some heavy territory there.

1028
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,360
What's more important is the fact that you can be a man.

1029
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:07,360


1030
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:07,360


1031
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:12,540
You can find out more about Church of the Subgenius from subgenius.com.

1032
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:17,260
And all that takes is to be able to spell subgenius right.

1033
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,720
It doesn't have an O in it.

1034
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,660
But .com.

1035
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,080
And there's all kinds of free stuff.

1036
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,860
You can hear the radio show for free, watch the videos for free, but you can't get our books for free.

1037
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:42,520
And you can't become a minister and really unlock the real secrets.

1038
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,760
There's a lot going on on Facebook.

1039
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,820
If you Google subgenius, oh, you'll be looking into subgenius forums galore.

1040
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:58,760
And most of them will be pretty stupid because most of those are just guinea bobs, people who never even read Book of the Subgenius.

1041
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,420
They just thought Bob was cool because they were told that or something.

1042
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,000
I don't know.

1043
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,840
But really, the way to do it is to go to the subgenius.com.

1044
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,180
Get that membership kit.

1045
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,040
Because then you're an ordained minister, for one thing.

1046
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,240
You can then perform marriages or funerals or whatever.

1047
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,580
And best of all, it's only $35.

1048
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:24,840
But what you get is eternal salvation or triple your money back.

1049
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:33,120
If you don't get salvation for a full eternity, we'll happily refund not just your $35.

1050
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,360
We'll give you $110.

1051
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,680
Wow.

1052
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,820
That's very good.

1053
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,080
That's not right.

1054
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,400
No, that's not right.

1055
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,240
It's $115.

1056
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,120
Wait a minute.

1057
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:41,420
Oh, okay.

1058
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:41,940
Yeah, whatever.

1059
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,420
And we'll also sell you the book.

1060
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,240
No, it is $105.

1061
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,080
What the heck is going on?

1062
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,860
My brain hurts.

1063
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:57,680
Yeah, we have a big – well, if you go to hell as a result of joining the church, we have a book called Hell on $5 a Day.

1064
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,780
It's only $5.

1065
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,060
You only have $5.

1066
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,180
What would you learn out of the book of hell for $5 a day?

1067
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,820
What kind of stuff does that teach you?

1068
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,440
I hope I never have to know.

1069
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,920
That's the Christian hell we're talking about.

1070
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,680
There's a subgenius.

1071
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,460
Well, what is – okay, wait a minute.

1072
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,600
That's a good point.

1073
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,700
What is – we already know what the subgenius heaven is.

1074
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,660
So what is the subgenius hell?

1075
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,860
Actually, you don't know what the subgenius heaven is.

1076
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:35,080
What you're thinking of as the subgenius heaven is just the subgenius hell, which is so pleasurable.

1077
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,760
You have to go through that.

1078
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:42,300
You have to go through that to be prepared for the indescribable, unimaginable pleasures of subgenius heaven.

1079
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,000
We just have to take Bob's word for that.

1080
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,040
I think we're hanging an awful lot of trust on Bob.

1081
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,140
Yeah.

1082
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,900
I'm sorry.

1083
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:57,980
I'm sorry.

1084
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:04,060
Bob is not the answer, but neither is anything else.

1085
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,880
And really, you're on your own.

1086
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,000


1087
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:13,120
The main thing that Bob is teaching people is you've got to become a self-learner.

1088
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,340
You've got to learn how to teach yourself.

1089
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,040
He can't – you're not buying slack from Bob.

1090
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,700
You're buying the knowledge that you already have slack.

1091
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:27,340
You just have to figure out which of it is your kind of slack.

1092
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:34,040
The conspiracy is always trying to tell people, oh, if you drink this drink, you're going to get a lot of money.

1093
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:34,040


1094
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,140
If you drink this drink or buy these clothes or whatever, get this raise, then you'll have slack.

1095
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,000
If you watch this show, then you'll have slack.

1096
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:41,920
Well, no.

1097
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,360
Everybody has their own idea of slack.

1098
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,800
Some people are bird watchers.

1099
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,180
Some people play Monster Hunter.

1100
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,400
Some people are stamp collectors.

1101
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,220
Then they have to have some – oh, don't even get me started.

1102
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,380
The new one came out.

1103
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,980
Monster Hunter World.

1104
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:01,780
Monster Hunter World.

1105
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:04,480
Yeah, I've got 80 hours in already.

1106
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,220
It only came out on January 26th.

1107
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:07,900
Try harder.

1108
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:16,560
Well, the sad thing is I've read reviews by people who basically aced the whole game in 60 hours.

1109
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,340
Wow.

1110
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:22,520
But I'm old, and I stop and smell the dinosaur dung a lot.

1111
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,540
Oh, good.

1112
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:24,860
I also pause it.

1113
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,500
I have to leave it on pause.

1114
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,540
Apparently, time passes in the game even when it's on pause.

1115
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,900
It's all online.

1116
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:32,180
Oh, that's not cool.

1117
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,760
Well, it's okay with me.

1118
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,240
It looks so great.

1119
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,740
They've really improved it.

1120
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,540
It's really wonderful.

1121
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,400
I bought a PS4 just for that game.

1122
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,440
Wow.

1123
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:45,820
That's dedication right there.

1124
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,920
Capcom's got me wrapped around their little claw.

1125
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,220
I play other games, but not much.

1126
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:57,500
It's like I can't drive around Grand Theft Auto Land forever.

1127
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,120
Those monsters aren't going to kill themselves.

1128
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,500
It's very true.

1129
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,620
That is very true.

1130
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,140
Luckily, now I have grandkids that'll play it with me.

1131
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:07,500
That's awesome.

1132
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,820
I've never been able to find another adult subgenius to play Monster Hunter with, but

1133
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,700
Phyla's daughter and my grandkids play it with me.

1134
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:15,360
Huh.

1135
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,480
That's unfortunate.

1136
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,080
They're terrible at it.

1137
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:18,920
Well, that's bonding, though.

1138
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:20,220
That's a good thing.

1139
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,700
It's bonding with your grandkids.

1140
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,720
Yeah, I'm the cool grandpa that plays video games.

1141
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,100
Get off my lawn unless you're going to play.

1142
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,340
Well, Stan, we're going to let you go.

1143
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,780
I appreciate you being on here.

1144
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,160
It's been a lot of fun talking to you.

1145
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:41,120
Again, if you want to tell people where they can find you and get involved with the Church

1146
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:45,180
of the Subgenius if they want, I know they can find your podcast just by going to pretty

1147
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:49,500
much any podcast aggregator and doing a search for the Subgenius Hour of Slack.

1148
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,720
I am a faithful listener.

1149
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,460
I've been for many, many years now.

1150
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:56,840
But anything else you want to put out there, go right ahead.

1151
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,080
Well, for me, I'm a fan of the podcast.

1152
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,080


1153
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,080


1154
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,740
I lost the Internet.

1155
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:02,800
I don't Chin Trelink.

1156
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,080
It's okay.

1157
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:09,260
You see about five times my age, I've suburban life.

1158
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,720
My wife, my husband, one of the things just has been taken away from one of the former

1159
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:10,720


1160
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,940
Well, it's a bit interesting, the fact that we're good at communication on both times,

1161
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:11,940


1162
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,040
No matter what face I look at one of the times, if it's the first time you ever the universe

1163
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:16,340
sees me 받 it, you get the idea.

1164
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:16,340


1165
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:16,340


1166
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,880
Another typical image of us is one guy who has some second language linking himself with

1167
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,400
the university.

1168
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:19,460


1169
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:19,800
Hi.

1170
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:30,080
So the day you realize that this is not actually what we were talking about, I'll

1171
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,160
G-L-E-N-R-O-S-E

1172
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,240
Texas

1173
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,420
76043

1174
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:38,680
76043

1175
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,000
and I tried to get box

1176
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,400
808 because

1177
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,480
808 looks like

1178
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,160
B-O-B but no dice.

1179
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,860
That's unfortunate.

1180
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:50,960
Maybe next time.

1181
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,800
We're now relocated

1182
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,940
in a really colorful

1183
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,260
little Texas town

1184
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,760
that is known, has had a

1185
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,020
long history of new age

1186
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:02,900
cultish

1187
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,680
miracle cures.

1188
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,340
They used to have foul smelling

1189
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,620
sulfurous water squirting out of the ground

1190
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,380
and they sold that to the

1191
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,720
rubes as magic

1192
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,560
tonic water. How far are you from Aurora?

1193
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,580
Are you by Aurora at all? Are you close to Aurora?

1194
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,560
Have you

1195
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,380
been to the alien grave site by chance?

1196
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:22,400
Pretty far.

1197
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,520
It's not much.

1198
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,380
No. No, I don't need to.

1199
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,320
I have fossil

1200
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,880
alien skeletons here.

1201
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,420
We're going to open

1202
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,980
in this town,

1203
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,540
Glen Rose, there already is

1204
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,000
a creationist museum

1205
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,540
called Creation

1206
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,420
Evidence Museum. It's

1207
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,740
funnier than Church of

1208
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,760
the Subgenius and it doesn't mean

1209
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,980
but I've decided

1210
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,860
that we're, now that

1211
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,820
I basically moved on

1212
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,760
to what used to be

1213
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,320
my parents' goat ranch,

1214
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:58,960
I've got

1215
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,580
access to the same fossils and stuff

1216
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,420
as everybody else around this area.

1217
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,540
This is a famous fossil and

1218
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,980
dinosaur track area.

1219
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,560
And we really do have dinosaur

1220
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,800
tracks in our creek

1221
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,000
down the hill that I own.

1222
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,060
In fact, you can see us

1223
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,240
casting them on YouTube.

1224
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,100
But the important thing is,

1225
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,160
I'm going to have a,

1226
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,060
we're going to go into competition

1227
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,500
with the Creationist Museum because I'm creating

1228
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,180
the destruction evidence.

1229
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:29,600
And I'm going to have a

1230
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:29,600


1231
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:29,600


1232
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,560
I can't wait.

1233
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:34,640
Prehistory.

1234
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,040
I have, and I've got

1235
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,400
photographs to prove this.

1236
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,840
We've already got a display that has

1237
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,580
cave subgenius man

1238
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,420
and a cave subgenius woman.

1239
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,960
We call them Adam and Eve.

1240
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,420
Although I think it might actually be

1241
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,240
Adam and Steve.

1242
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,380
Oh dear.

1243
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,740
We have a fossil devil.

1244
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,820
We have a devil from the

1245
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,660
lower Cretaceous period.

1246
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,160
The skeleton of a devil that, you know,

1247
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,940
that's a very long story.

1248
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,740
And we have a fossil alien from the time of dinosaurs.

1249
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,440
Just a gray, a primitive gray.

1250
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,860
And he's got crystals for eyeballs.

1251
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,180
That's how we know he's an alien.

1252
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,900
And, and we have a fossil robot.

1253
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,880
A fossil robot?

1254
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,220
A fossil robot from the lower Cretaceous,

1255
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,440
probably built by the aliens.

1256
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,660
Noah's Ark sank here.

1257
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,560
I've got the ruin of it to prove it.

1258
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,140
And besides that,

1259
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:29,140


1260
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:29,140


1261
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,640
besides the regular dinosaur tracks,

1262
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:33,600
we have ghost dinosaur tracks.

1263
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:34,680
Oh.

1264
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,220
So this is just the beginning, you know?

1265
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,880
So we're going to have signs all along the highway

1266
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,420
coming to the ranch to say things like,

1267
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,820
Bigfoot mated with dinosaurs,

1268
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,720
Bible proof, $5.

1269
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,700
Next left.

1270
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,340
You'll sell out.

1271
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,820
Oh yeah, yeah.

1272
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,580
We're going to, yeah.

1273
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,600
Man eating chicken, only five bucks.

1274
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:57,500
Yeah.

1275
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,900
Seashell City, Rock City.

1276
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,020
Rock City is the big one.

1277
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,140
Rock City is like, that's,

1278
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:06,420
that's that you see advertisements for that thing on freeways

1279
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,520
two states away before you ever get to Rock City in Kentucky.

1280
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,800
And yes.

1281
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,020
You ever been there?

1282
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,320
Rock City and Chattanooga?

1283
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,860
That's, that's a great.

1284
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:18,860
Oh yeah.

1285
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,720
I've been to, I've been to a lot of roadside.

1286
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:26,440
My favorite, one of my favorite ones is The Thing on Interstate 10.

1287
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,560
Right at the border of Arizona and New Mexico.

1288
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:33,300
Do you dare see The Thing?

1289
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:38,280
Well, if you are ever seeing those signs on that highway,

1290
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,180
go ahead and dare.

1291
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:44,220
It's only a dollar and there's about a hundred things.

1292
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,720
Actually more like a thousand things.

1293
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,700
It's a great little museum of completely goofy stuff.

1294
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,640
The Thing itself, I'll go ahead and spoil it.

1295
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,440
It's a mummy.

1296
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:55,420
Ooh.

1297
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,480
An Indian woman, which, oh, I love the Indian woman.

1298
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,080
And a baby.

1299
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,520
And they may be completely crazy.

1300
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:00,560
Very possibly.

1301
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:00,640
They may be.

1302
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,360
The main thing.

1303
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,360
Yeah.

1304
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,140
But yeah, roadside attractions.

1305
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,980
That's one of the, in fact, one of the things that inspired

1306
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:14,580
the Church of the Subgenius was driving around this little town

1307
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:17,460
when I was much younger, I'd see these handmade signs

1308
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,860
that said, giant man tracks, 50 cents.

1309
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:26,220
And the story was that the Adamic people of the Bible,

1310
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,920
6,000 years ago, of course they lived with the dinosaurs.

1311
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,840
And so you'd find these human looking tracks

1312
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,660
near the dinosaur tracks.

1313
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,720
There really are lots of dinosaur tracks

1314
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:41,200
on the Paluxy River, a lot of them.

1315
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,980
And there are things that look kind of like human tracks.

1316
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:51,780
And I've been a science geek since I was a little boy.

1317
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,840
So I knew what was going on, but I always thought,

1318
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,380
wow, I could do that.

1319
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,480
Wow. I could do that.

1320
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,860
And I'd set up a sign and say, yeah,

1321
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,160
that hole in the ground, that's a mystery hole.

1322
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:00,700
Where'd it come from?

1323
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,740
We don't know. It's a mystery.

1324
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,680
Five bucks.

1325
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,140
You know, here's a decal.

1326
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,460
Here's a decal that says,

1327
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:10,140
I saw the mystery hole in Glen Rose, Texas.

1328
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,940
I actually have a friend who started doing that in Portland.

1329
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,100
There's a mystery hole in Portland.

1330
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,060
It's just a deep hole in the guy's backyard,

1331
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,800
but it's really dressed up.

1332
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:27,080
And he sells you a little bottle of nothing that's labeled,

1333
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:27,460
you know, a little bottle of nothing.

1334
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:28,780
I got hold of it.

1335
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:35,640
So it was here in this piece when some of my friends

1336
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:35,640


1337
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,440
because regardless of what you can say,

1338
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,260
you really need to know where your eyes started going.

1339
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,220
So that's, now this person we're dealing with,

1340
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,600
he has a very special gift.

1341
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,660
Which is called Hi-Lite,

1342
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,220
which is the system that gum psychology,

1343
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:43,220


1344
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:47,560
And in thisан Buffalo park,

1345
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,780
there's somebody that really likes to do research,

1346
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,560
but there's somebody that kind of city.

1347
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:57,440
Who's found good victimsvatnfmf The Tewkesbury construction dealer.

1348
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:06,020
here, magnetic healers who would pass magnets over your arthritic parts and make it feel

1349
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:06,360
better.

1350
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:13,400
And then when women had hysteria, they would apply their special vibrating magnets to their

1351
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:19,100
bodies to make them feel good in ways their husbands didn't know how to do.

1352
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,420
Some of those healers...

1353
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:25,060
And hence the term Steely Dan was born.

1354
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,280
Yeah, exactly.

1355
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:31,820
Some of these rubbing doctors and healers were killed by angry husbands.

1356
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,040
But it's a very colorful place.

1357
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:39,620
It's a really good place for Church of the Subgenius to have its final headquarters.

1358
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,300
Are you going to open up a Church of the Subgenius museum at some point?

1359
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:48,200
Well, we have had one all this time, but it's kind of private.

1360
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,320
There is a Bible museum.

1361
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,820
Right now, it's actually still in Cleveland because we had glass.

1362
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,420
There are cases there, and we don't have those in this house.

1363
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,800
And we've got to figure out how to house the Bob museum.

1364
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:09,380
It's got stuff like his original pipes, one of his teeth from childhood, gum that he chewed.

1365
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,040
You don't have any of the props from your stage productions or any of the props left

1366
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,740
over from the commercial that you did on MTV or any of that other stuff?

1367
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,280
Oh, sure we do.

1368
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,760
Sure we do.

1369
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,160
And some of those were rewards on that Kickstarter thing.

1370
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,820
But yeah, I do have...

1371
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,540
We still have the masks and things that were made for that.

1372
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:32,580
That's the stuff you need to put on display.

1373
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,900
You'd have to see this house to believe it.

1374
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,620
You'd literally have to see it.

1375
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,160
It's not just mine.

1376
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,360
A lot of subgenius houses are like this.

1377
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:49,580
If you have an understanding family, you get to keep all your weird toys.

1378
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,240
And yeah, man, this place is...

1379
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:55,780
It's full of heads.

1380
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:58,280
Subgenius heads.

1381
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,780
I'm going to tell you something that you may find hard to believe.

1382
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,140
I'm sitting at my desk, okay, in this house in Texas.

1383
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,920
It used to be my little brother's bedroom.

1384
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:13,660
This foul cabinet, desk, big computer screen, a couple of computers.

1385
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:18,820
But on the wall that I'm looking at, right behind my screen, is a bear skin.

1386
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:23,440
A bear skin rug stuck up on the wall with the head.

1387
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:24,840
There's a giant...

1388
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:30,160
A bear head that looks like it's about to bite a picture of Bob or my computer screen.

1389
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,400
It was a bear shot by my brother.

1390
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:43,000
And the rest of this Texas house has other animal heads of creatures that mostly my dad shot.

1391
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,140
Deer and sheep.

1392
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:47,560
There's even a goat that used to be a household pet.

1393
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:49,640
Household goat.

1394
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,980
That's not that uncommon down south.

1395
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:51,860
And...

1396
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,000
And, of course, the mask.

1397
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:58,940
The Bob masks and things are all up on the mantelpiece.

1398
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,560
The casts of our dinosaur tracks are here.

1399
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:08,160
And the coolest fossil collection, if you're into marine fossils.

1400
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:08,600
Here we go.

1401
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:12,260
It's not the most boring kind of fossil there is unless you're into it.

1402
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:18,860
But, you know, when life throws marine fossils at you, become a marine fossil expert.

1403
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,700
And, yeah.

1404
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:25,860
Yeah, yeah.

1405
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,520
It's a pretty unusual house.

1406
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,760
And the filmmakers covered...

1407
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,880
They filmed the Cleveland house before we moved here.

1408
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,740
We've combined the two now.

1409
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,600
So it's kind of Twilight Zone.

1410
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,340
It's kind of Adam's family.

1411
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,340
A little bit monster.

1412
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,420
You need to build a pole barn and put all that stuff on display in a pole barn there.

1413
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,660
And actually have a real museum of Bob, in my opinion.

1414
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,560
You know, in my humble opinion.

1415
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:03,380
Well, we had a barn, but high winds tore the roof off of it.

1416
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,140
This really is a goat ranch.

1417
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,100
It's a huge goat ranch.

1418
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:11,220
With a mile of creek running through it.

1419
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,660
And the creek really does have dinosaur tracks.

1420
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:16,080
And it's loaded with marine fossils.

1421
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,940
It's kind of a nutty place to live.

1422
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,620
But it's great if you were always in it.

1423
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:24,260
I was a dinosaur nut when I was a kid.

1424
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,040
Yeah.

1425
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:28,100
When my parents moved here, I couldn't believe they were so cool.

1426
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,460
That happened after I left home.

1427
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,760
So I never lived here.

1428
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,760
My dad died a couple of years ago.

1429
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,980
And that's how we basically ended up here.

1430
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:45,620
I would not have imagined that my wife and I could stand rural Texas.

1431
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,280
You read about Texas politics.

1432
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:53,840
But once your feet are on the ground, it's a nice little sleepy town.

1433
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,000
Friendly as hell.

1434
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:59,240
Well, I'm sure they all voted for somebody I'd never vote for.

1435
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,160
But they don't care to brag about it.

1436
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:04,760
That's good.

1437
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,720
They shouldn't.

1438
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,640
Well, Reverend Stang, we're going to let you go.

1439
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:13,020
Thank you for coming on here and talking with us again.

1440
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,780
As always, it's been a lot of fun having you back on here.

1441
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,500
I really am kind of geeking out because I do listen to your show all the time.

1442
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:23,660
And it's always a pleasure.

1443
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,940
Just to, you know,

1444
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:27,920
when somebody brings you up, I'll be like, oh, yeah, we've had him on our show.

1445
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,060
And they'll be like, you've talked to Reverend Stang?

1446
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,540
I'm like, yeah, he's a nice guy.

1447
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,820
You know, he's really open.

1448
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,280
He's out there.

1449
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:33,900
He's really cool.

1450
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:34,700
He's fun to talk to.

1451
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,520
You know?

1452
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:41,000
Yeah, as long as we're not real famous, people assume that I'm really, like,

1453
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,920
reclusive and impossible to get hold of.

1454
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,320
My phone number's on our website.

1455
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,680
There's no secretary.

1456
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:49,780
Yeah.

1457
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,500
It rings in my pocket.

1458
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:54,720
But I do.

1459
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,640
Yeah, you're pretty much, you're accessible.

1460
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,000
Well, I don't pick it up.

1461
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,040
And I don't return all the calls.

1462
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,780
It makes noise, but I ignore it.

1463
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,680
There's this thing called voicemail.

1464
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,520
Someday I'll check it.

1465
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,700
Yeah, if somebody leaves a nice enough message, I'll certainly return the call.

1466
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,260
Well, thanks for coming on here.

1467
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,340
It's been a real pleasure talking to you again.

1468
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:20,360
Well, thank you very much for letting me get on and brag again.

1469
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,600
No problem at all, man.

1470
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,100
I feel like I should be asking you guys how you're doing.

1471
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,260
And what was your last show and stuff like that?

1472
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,380
Oh, we're good.

1473
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:32,360
You know, we've been around for, what was it, eight years now?

1474
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,580
Is that what we said last week?

1475
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:34,820
Seven years.

1476
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:35,180
Yeah.

1477
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,380
Lately, we've been going through some crazy internet hiccups and stuff like that.

1478
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:43,540
Actually, this show is the first quote-unquote normal show we've had in weeks that so far

1479
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,520
has gone off without any kind of a glitch.

1480
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:50,120
I mean, I know there's a delay between us talking to you because we're going from Skype

1481
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,040
to phone and back, so there's a slight delay there.

1482
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,860
But aside from that, you know,

1483
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,420
praise Bob that this turned out good.

1484
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:01,100
Yeah, I'm not hearing much of a delay, but can you guys tell that I've got hearing aids now?

1485
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:01,860
What?

1486
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:09,600
I'm sure that the last time we did this, I was struggling to understand speech.

1487
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:14,440
Since then, I got real expensive hearing aids.

1488
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:17,400
God, life is so much better now.

1489
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,000
You can hear again.

1490
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,100
That's good news.

1491
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:20,620
Yeah.

1492
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,640
Everything sounds kind of weird.

1493
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,600
And music has a kind of an electronic-y edge to it.

1494
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,680
It's a little tinny.

1495
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:34,560
Crackling leaves are way too loud, but I can understand human speech.

1496
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,880
I'm sorry to hear that.

1497
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,280
That's good.

1498
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,240
Sorry to hear that.

1499
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:44,100
Well, listen, you guys have only been in headphones for seven years doing your show.

1500
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,880
Wait until you've been doing it for 35 years.

1501
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,660
You won't be able to understand anything.

1502
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,660
I'm getting there myself.

1503
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:51,400
Yeah.

1504
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,120
And then...

1505
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:56,020
The hearing aids that work aren't cheap.

1506
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:57,920
No, they're not.

1507
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,440
My old man has hearing aids.

1508
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,920
A lot of people in my family have hearing aids.

1509
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:03,680
Yeah.

1510
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:05,320
Well, I'm just glad that they exist.

1511
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:06,880
Yeah, absolutely.

1512
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,760
Thanks for having me on.

1513
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,760
Oh, no problem, Stan.

1514
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:11,780
No problem at all, man.

1515
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:17,420
I hope the documentary goes over well for you, and I hope there's a renewed interest in the Church of the Subgenius.

1516
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,140
And always, it's a pleasure talking to you.

1517
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,980
Thank you so much for coming out here and being with us.

1518
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,460
Praise Bob.

1519
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,800
Praise Bob.

1520
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:25,780
Praise Bob.

1521
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,260
And praise Lobo.

1522
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,260
Thank you.

1523
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:29,480
Thank you.

1524
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:29,480
