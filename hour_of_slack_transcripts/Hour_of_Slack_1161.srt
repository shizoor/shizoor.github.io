1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,840
Who is it?

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,760
This is Bob. He can straighten your wheel and fix that flat in no time.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,380
Sure I will. Sure.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,500
And then we'll take you along to the place where the show is going to be.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,560
Excellent. It's all going to bliss.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,640
The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,760
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects is intended only as humor

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,420
and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK Atlanta, its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,880
I can't tell her to stop hoping, but when she's disappointed again, you can help pick up the pieces.

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,700
I think I'm going to be sick.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,060
Everybody was busy getting things ready for the show.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,680
Mr. Stang, you won't believe your ears.

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,020
What's that?

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,620
You'll puke with wonder when you hear and see.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,200
Be specific. There are strange forms in the Matrix that come and go.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,240
Strange forces that cannot be predicted.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,660
There are signs and portents and faces in the sky.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,740
You're smoking a pipe.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,360
Uh-oh.

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,280
Then get ready for a super goody on Saturday, July 5th at 7 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,080
Our Earth will be...

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,780
Hurry, the tents come down July 5th.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,920
Portents.

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,140
You see? You see?

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,340
It means something sinister is coming.

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,620
The overlords are coming.

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,560
Yes, something sinister is coming. Soon.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,540
Oh, no!

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,320
Thanks to the lobotomy and, uh, let's see, the baby sacrifice.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,520
Oh, how awful.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,240
And, uh, the Castro Street group sex orgies and all that.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:48,720
Filthy.

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,580
I've done it going both ways. Completely accidentally.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,560
Ah, heck.

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,200
And filthy.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,800
Oh, for God's sake.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,560
The light just went off in my head.

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,920
It is crazy. It'll leave the landers on the air in jail.

39
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,900
It's a fine choice.

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,280
Yeah.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,760
And furthermore, I want him in charge of the program.

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,180
Uh...

43
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,320
Him?

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:04,940
Yeah, that's right.

45
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,500
You involved.

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,980
Can you believe it? This is a pretty good deal.

47
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,320
What?

48
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,060
Oh, those two idiots. Imagine!

49
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,900
Efficiency rate is still optimum.

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,980
Only when you two pick up the slack.

51
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,340
I'm sure that Bob will figure out a way to do that.

52
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,500
Fuzzy parameters. Limited logic. Shifting allegiances in the data banks.

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,420
Oh, no.

54
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,720
Uh, let's see. I'm going to, uh...

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,780
Oh, I'm going to be doing subgeniusly things, if you really wanted to know.

56
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,380
Well, I'm looking forward to it. Looking forward to it, Mr. Stagg.

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,620
Automated responses boxes. Stand by with a smelling sauce.

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,520
Earth receives a space visitor through a radio receiver. Next.

59
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,120
Jing.

60
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,340
Come.

61
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,540
Jing.

62
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:44,860
Come.

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
The new jing.

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,340
Come.

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,260
The new jing.

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,340
Come.

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,420
The new jing.

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
J slide.

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,720
Come.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,160
J slide.

71
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,160


72
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,160


73
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,160


74
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,160


75
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,160


76
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,160


77
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,180


78
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,220


79
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,220


80
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,220


81
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,220


82
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,220


83
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,220


84
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,220


85
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,220


86
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:09,680
That's great.

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:09,680


88
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:09,680


89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:09,680


90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:09,680


91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,620
So you thought about that with the jing.

92
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,660
Yes.

93
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,620
So, you thought about that with the jing.

94
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,280
You're right.

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,140
I don't know what to do.

96
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,700
The only time I'm happy is when I'm sitting on the floor

97
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,480
And if my sister goes somewhere I can't make it down the door

98
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,320
I don't know what to do

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,140
I don't know what to do

100
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,020
I don't know what to do

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,980
don't know what to do

102
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,900
I don't know what to do

103
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,780
I don't know what to do

104
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,620
I don't know what to do

105
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,500
I don't know what to do

106
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,920
How you seeing Bob?

107
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,860
Gotta be here soon

108
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,180
Yeah?

109
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,460
Well, maybe

110
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,560
Yeah, maybe

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,180
We're checking on it right now

112
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,220
Depraved genius

113
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,860
Party boy

114
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,640
This sinister psycho's capacity for mayhem

115
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,860
Is only matched by his insatiable appetite for a good time

116
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,480
Don't be fooled by his sensitive side

117
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
Oh, how do you know he's done all those things?

118
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:09,780
Hmm

119
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,380
Yeah, that's a genius throwing another universe party

120
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,780
And look at this

121
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,500
Yes, Bob

122
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Who else am I talking about?

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
All I know is I'm supposed to deliver him something

124
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,740
And I'll be on my way

125
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,280
I would be careful if I were you

126
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,200
Three strippers from Vegas were abducted a couple months ago

127
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,580
They were last seen getting in a motorhome

128
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,900
With some guy in a black duster and a cowboy hat

129
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,280
Bob, Bob, Bob

130
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,540
No one's seen him since

131
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,740
Around the 5th

132
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,580
That's when he has to report back

133
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,480
Or he's AWOL

134
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,680
We've never met

135
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,580
Oh, yeah, right

136
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,640
Which makes him that much more impressive

137
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,260
Really?

138
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,140
Yeah, yeah

139
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,360
I don't want to talk about Bob

140
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,420
As if on cue

141
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,440
You look surprised

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
Oh, Jesus

143
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,060
You're my first celebrity I ever gave a rosary job to

144
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh, please

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
I'll do anything you ask

146
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,700
Just, oh, please let me come

147
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,020
Please

148
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,660
Hey, Bob, say let's do that

149
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,600
Sure, I will

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,160
Sure

151
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,900
Yes, you bet

152
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,420
We're already

153
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,040
Guys on their knees are his assistants

154
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,620
As they say in the Old Testament

155
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,240
Gary the

156
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,020
Bobination

157
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,440
You can leave me there tonight

158
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,420
Come on, Bobby

159
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,320
Come on, Bobby

160
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,520
What do you know better than that?

161
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,640
Bobby

162
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,660
There's nothing to be frightened of now

163
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,120
On my planet

164
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,640
All of you will be free men

165
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,740
Not locked away like animals

166
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,980
Be free

167
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,680
Find your own happiness

168
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,400
Oh, come on, Bob

169
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,640
You don't really believe in people like that, do you?

170
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,900
If you're asking me if I believe in miracles

171
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,100
Then do it

172
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,260
On July the 5th

173
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,440
The 5th of July

174
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,380
Anno Domini

175
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,220
You think I'm gonna help you befoul his legacy?

176
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,040
Yeah, now the boss says it's a very bad thing for the country

177
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,220
The boss has got an idea

178
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,280
With all this Nazi and Jack money

179
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,680
That, yeah

180
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,940
Well, I haven't got it quite straight

181
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,460
But anyway, the boss says it's a bad thing for the country

182
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,420
What did you find out?

183
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,340
I don't need the terrorists

184
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,040
Boy, you're hotter than a firecracker on the 5th of July

185
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,100
The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth

186
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,340
You are to command the forces that mop up

187
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,860
No one must survive

188
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,340
You

189
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,600
You are to seek out and kill every human being

190
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,560
Sure, I will

191
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,520
Bob is anal

192
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,240
Meanwhile

193
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,400
Down in the lake bed they find, uh

194
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,920
More homes, like

195
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,540
Trucks and cars

196
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,580
But no people

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,600
Anywhere

198
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,400
Just

199
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,040
Vanished

200
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,940
They don't find them, huh?

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,180
They made the jump

202
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,700
The jump?

203
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,460
What's the jump?

204
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,060
Well, the lake bed is a jump station

205
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,760
For the UFOs

206
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,720
It's where they come to abduct travelers

207
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,800
And leave others behind

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,300
Right

209
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,560
It's kind of like an interplanetary

210
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,280
Truck stop

211
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,640
Yes

212
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,740
Right

213
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,260
Gateway

214
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,320
Crossover

215
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,300
And what, people just vanish out there?

216
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,000
In the middle of nowhere?

217
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,460
You really believe this?

218
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,360
You believe in this?

219
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,520
You don't believe me?

220
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,680
I can't believe it

221
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,960
Who cares what you believe?

222
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,020
No one would be stupid enough to believe that

223
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,940
Not if he's got his right mind

224
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,260
Please, Jesus, please, Jesus, save Bob, save Bob, save...

225
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,640
Save our Bob

226
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,680
To the unsuspecting person who would not normally get involved with him knowing who he is

227
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,300
Satan

228
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,860
No!

229
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,140
No!

230
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,440
No!

231
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,680
Yes!

232
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,660
No...

233
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,600
Bob's not

234
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,380
Sorry, kid

235
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,020
Come on!

236
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,440
I got you!

237
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,640
I want to call for all of those that believed in his power to rise up and come to him

238
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:24,980
Click

239
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,760
There it is

240
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,560
You hear from Bob?

241
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,680
Oh my God!

242
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,280
You got Bob?

243
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,160
Bob, Bob, Bob

244
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,280
And out they come

245
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:31,920
Bob

246
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,240
Tomorrow night I promise you, presto, the strangest story you've ever known

247
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Now, do you suppose this garrulous intruder may be a swindler perhaps

248
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,120
An assassin, a charlatan plotting some curious disaster for your love

249
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,360
Such characters exist

250
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,700
But they are secretive rather than mysterious

251
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,160
I, sir, am a major mystery

252
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,020
Did that salesman cut one?

253
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,460
Yeah, and for some reason he turned on the radio to cover up the smell

254
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,160
I don't know how to take this

255
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,020
I don't see why he moves me

256
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,200
He scares me so, I love him so, I love him so

257
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,100
I will be your guide to the gateways of every world in the universe

258
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,600
We will see impossible beings and unimaginable beauty

259
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,480
And everyone's gonna be what the guy says

260
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,420
What guy?

261
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,360
Bob

262
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,100
On the radio

263
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,860
This madman has only one thing on his mind

264
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,220
Evil

265
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,980
How long did he give it?

266
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:30,900
Tonight

267
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,680
Oh, that's just what I've been waiting for

268
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,660
Is everything packed?

269
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,200
We've been packed for a week

270
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,700
You sure it's safe?

271
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,880
Now, look, clean up this place and clean it up right

272
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,520
And don't leave any calling cards

273
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,140
Or at least

274
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,720
We're here to change the brain cells inside your head

275
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,140
Bob can help you get rid of the brain cells you don't need, my friend

276
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
With overwork and television

277
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,120
The conspiracy has added more brain cells than you need

278
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,240
We're here tonight to kill some of those brain cells

279
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,600
Your brain cells can't be afraid to say

280
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,320
Kill me, Bob

281
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,240
If only I could wedge my name in that little spot

282
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,200
But there's no room above the title for me yet

283
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, there's ESQ after this

284
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,960
One of these days, though

285
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,860
I've got a lot of other directors I have to kill

286
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,040
All of these are

287
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,400
Well, I don't know which is worse

288
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,780
They're eating it up?

289
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,580
Yes, from the way they're squirming around

290
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,060
It must be eating them up

291
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,220
You're the ace of cucks

292
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,780
Now bend over and smell the Furo's brain

293
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,900
Uberspeng

294
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,180
Uberspeng

295
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,500
Let me smell

296
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,220
Smell

297
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,660
Smell the Furo's brain

298
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,620
Max smell

299
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,780
Max smell

300
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,020
Max, please, sit down

301
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,300
Max smell

302
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,280
It's only a demonstration

303
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,940
And this is only a gun

304
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,620
It's not a real gun

305
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,180
It's a...

306
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,480
It's a gun from Dobbs

307
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,100
Oh, I don't know, man

308
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,440
Come on, it's not gay

309
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
There's guns in the room

310
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
Smell the Furo's brain

311
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,060
Ah!

312
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,020
That was weird

313
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,680
Hello, Mr. Stang

314
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,860
My assistants, you all know him

315
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,560
Mr. Stang

316
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,000
He's got some real duties he wants to show

317
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,840
Um...

318
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,520
Will you teach us how to smoke?

319
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,200
Yeah!

320
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,980
For some reason, something about the nature of our religion

321
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,340
Seems to appeal to these potheads and cannabis smokers

322
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,780
Looking forward to it, Mr. Stang

323
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,920
I just don't understand that

324
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,160
Yeah, very funny

325
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,620
We have a serious problem on our hands

326
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,200
This Malaysian thing is getting out of hand

327
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,640
I need to take care of Sioux night people to answer to

328
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,400
I can be arranged

329
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,240
A gentleman and Ivan was seen leaving shortly

330
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,940
Thereafter with this gentleman

331
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,740
My goodness, Ivan, I'm stunned

332
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,120
The same gentleman joined him again this evening

333
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,580
Bob, you're a poison

334
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,640
As they're walking

335
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,880
Basically fondling one another

336
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,560
As they walk on the street

337
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
It made me sick to watch

338
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,620
We observe Ivan and this gentleman again

339
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,420
In an embrace and a kiss

340
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,240
Oh, my God!

341
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,240
At that point

342
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,060
Here we are, Bob's Country Bunker

343
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,440
Bob's Country Bunker

344
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,500
They travel to a country western bar

345
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,220
What kind of music is this?

346
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,280
What kind of music will he have there?

347
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,900
Oh, we got both sounds

348
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,240
We got country and western

349
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,220
Smells awful both ways

350
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,860
This thing is going out two-stepping with Lisa

351
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,480
Lisa?

352
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,500
He lied to me

353
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,340
Unless his name's Lisa

354
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,180
Doesn't look like a Lisa, though

355
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,420
I didn't catch your name

356
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,400
We won't do that, Bob

357
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,280
We do know that Ivan is with this gentleman again this evening

358
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,080
They've been there for a little while

359
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,960
What do you want to do?

360
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,380
Bob, you're dead

361
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,100
You're dead

362
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,020
I mean it

363
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,480
Dead

364
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,240
Okay, let's go

365
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,120
Now hold on, Mr. Manager

366
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,760
Manager

367
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,480
Got a problem?

368
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,900
I simply refuse to have that man on my air

369
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,620
But we're in a spot

370
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,780
Why don't you have it shut off the air?

371
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,240
I want the program canceled immediately

372
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,820
Bob told me personally he will walk off the show

373
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,780
If he is not allowed to express himself freely

374
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,600
Why then what?

375
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,300
Right before you go to my office

376
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,880
We're going to talk about this private fire

377
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,340
That maniac

378
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,020
What's the matter, Bob? What is it?

379
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,660
Well, they went down to the manager's office

380
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,780
They want to shut us off the air

381
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,800
Well, if they can't do that, that's sabotage

382
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,180
Nobody can make a fool out of me except me

383
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,600
Why don't you think of the children?

384
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,580
Well, I have been thinking of

385
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,680
The worst of all was the disgrace

386
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,720
Doggone it, Bob

387
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm afraid I've lost another job

388
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,480
Ow, you smashed my hair

389
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,360
I'm sorry, Bob

390
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,600
He laughed gaily

391
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,300
A squid eating dough in a polyethylene bag is fast and boonibus

392
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:01,880
Got me?

393
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,240
He rubbed his rump, laughing with childhood pleasures

394
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,780
His grin now said,

395
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,580
I'm going to succeed at cross

396
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,860
But I don't know where I'm going to go for that one

397
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,520
That's illegal even in Mexico

398
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,960
Does it worry you, Bob?

399
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,120
The guy dismissed the question with a wave of his hand

400
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,180
Someone told me, maybe Malaysia

401
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,380
Be ready in five minutes

402
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,380
You bring the towels, I get the penicillin

403
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,980
Come here, Bob

404
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,520
Let me show you how a real woman does it

405
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,880
Ooh, ooh

406
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,420
Bob covered every criminal debutante in town

407
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,280
And now

408
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,900
Or whatever

409
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,800
Why don't you come with me?

410
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,160
Oh, Bob

411
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,220
When it's all over, you and I will be the only ones left

412
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,320
You!

413
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,140
You're one of us!

414
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,920
He's flaming hot and flaming gay

415
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,640
He's vibe squared

416
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,860
No, I was scared to death

417
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,580
He's got these eyes that like hypnotize you

418
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,720
Those eyes, they're frightening

419
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,760
And then his thing

420
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,480
I don't want to get into it, but it's huge

421
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,280
It's like a rocket ship

422
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,060
There was a noise too, a kind of plop noise

423
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,860
And the thing bulged

424
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,240
Fantastic

425
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,020
Do you believe in the devil?

426
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,880
Huh?

427
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,020
The world is full of all kinds of beings, my friend

428
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,520
But we make up imaginary ones with pointy horns and pitchforks

429
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,860
In our dreams, we're not the only ones who are like that, Bob

430
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,900
We fly like gods

431
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,180
We long to shoot through space

432
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,120
And why is that, huh?

433
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,720
Because humans used to fly long ago

434
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,420
So you sell drugs here, huh?

435
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,100
Imagination enhancers

436
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,800
If you imagine something, it can come into being

437
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,480
Imagine a devil, and he may show up

438
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,040
That was the charm, my friend

439
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,400
Friends, the world is ending

440
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,220
The birds are vanishing

441
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,980
The polar bears are melting

442
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,200
The skunks have all been eaten

443
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,900
Genetically engineered chemtrails fall from the sky

444
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,780
And all of our food is made of antibiotics

445
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,020
And American brain viruses are in every airport

446
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,860
The hole in the earth keeps getting worse

447
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,380
But that's nothing new to us

448
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,040
Whoa, what a hole!

449
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,340
Someday we're gonna learn and drop right in

450
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,520
Till then, we'll slack around on the surface again

451
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,780
You can't let it slide

452
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,100
You can't let it slide

453
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,020
Until it slips away

454
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,220
You can't let it slide

455
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,360
You can't let it slide

456
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,460
Until it slips away

457
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,680
Away.

458
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,700
Away.

459
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,800
What happened next?

460
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,240
July 5.

461
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,800
It gets sad again.

462
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,960
You remember Bob?

463
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,660
Bob!

464
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,320
Bob!

465
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:36,580


466
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,000
Done!

467
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,740
Garnet!

468
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,160
We have to get Bob!

469
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,040
Who's Bob?

470
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,280
One, two, three!

471
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,600
This is an outrage!

472
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Who is that one?

473
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,240
Send your answer to Old Pink.

474
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,260
Oh, my.

475
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,900
Welcome to...

476
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,960
The Others.

477
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,660
Yeah!

478
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Tonight's the night.

479
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,660
Tonight's the night they come.

480
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,640
It's a freak show.

481
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,220
Where?

482
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,800
About halfway up Devil's Highway.

483
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,040
Turn when you see the Indian.

484
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,340
His name is Bob.

485
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,620
Bob the Indian?

486
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,380
Yeah.

487
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,780
He'll be waiting.

488
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,600
He'll ride in the back, guide you the rest of the way.

489
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,060
Come again?

490
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,820
How do we know that?

491
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,980
I wouldn't go too deep in the desert if I were you.

492
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,300
You might never come back.

493
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,080
In fact, maybe you better stay here with us till it's over.

494
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,160
Sorry, I gotta do this.

495
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,920
But it's been real fun meeting you.

496
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,060
Well, if you change your mind,

497
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,940
then we'll be in there.

498
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,400
But not first.

499
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,020
Reveille at 0700 tomorrow?

500
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,120
0700?

501
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,440
How about okay?

502
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,880
You scamp, I love you.

503
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,480
Mwah!

504
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,100
You'll miss this, sweetheart.

505
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,500
Oh, my God, no.

506
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,320
It's today, the 5th.

507
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,600
I need to get out of here.

508
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,560
Bob!

509
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,620
Bob!

510
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,580
Bob!

511
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,400
Get up!

512
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,640
Come on!

513
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,960
Come on, it's 6 o'clock!

514
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,300
Right, Johnny, right, Johnny!

515
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,520
Short moments.

516
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,140
50 minutes, in fact, to kill.

517
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,840
Kill Bob!

518
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,160
Bob, Bob.

519
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,760
Bob.

520
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,500
We see him.

521
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:17,840
All right.

522
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,760
You remember Bob?

523
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,520
Bob the Indian?

524
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,360
No.

525
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,520
No, I'm Lawrence of f***ing Arabia.

526
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,660
Nice guess, Kimo Sabe.

527
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
You want to get in, Bob?

528
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,280
No, no.

529
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,600
All right, I'm done.

530
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,680
You, go that way.

531
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,300
I had the strangest feeling

532
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,780
that I was leaving the familiar world

533
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,900
of my neighborhood behind.

534
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,120
That, somehow,

535
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,700
I was going to die.

536
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:58,700


537
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,780
I was now in an unknown and alien place.

538
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,860
A place where anything could happen.

539
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,140
There it is.

540
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,340
Pull over by the cone, now.

541
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,700
Oh, good.

542
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,880
Now you unload these suitcases

543
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,620
and you arrange them in a big circle.

544
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,460
Exactly 12 paces from each other.

545
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,800
I think that might be your job, Bob.

546
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,860
Oh, Jesus!

547
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,040
He was groaning madly.

548
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,160
I think he was trying to talk me into doing something.

549
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,600
I think he was trying to talk me into doing something.

550
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,200
No way!

551
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,560
Just do it.

552
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,420
Do it.

553
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,460
He just grinned harder.

554
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,900
Do it and get it done now.

555
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,480
If it don't get done, then I'll move on it.

556
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,280
Do it.

557
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,580
Get it done.

558
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,540
I don't want to be no part of no conspiracy.

559
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,180
I knew he was in with a bad crowd, but it was worse than I imagined.

560
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:52,820
Aliens.

561
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,100
Huh?

562
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,540
Alien menace.

563
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,260
The alien next door.

564
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,020
And why was Bob always talking about you?

565
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,020


566
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,020


567
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,020


568
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,020


569
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,020


570
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,020


571
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,020


572
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,020


573
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,020


574
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,840
I don't know.

575
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,420
He didn't say.

576
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,120
Now, there's something like seven minutes to the world's end.

577
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,460
Is there anything important we needed to remember or do?

578
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,520
Five minutes to go.

579
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,760
Well, where are they?

580
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,340
They'll be here.

581
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,980
Those people always keep their word out.

582
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,400
You won't forget your promise, Bob.

583
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,100
Sure.

584
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,660
Sure, I will.

585
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,040
Next day, get up.

586
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,660
7 AM.

587
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,100
Drink two cups of caffeine.

588
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,400
Jump.

589
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,060
Drink more caffeine.

590
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,680
Ah.

591
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,280
Sup, geniuses?

592
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,000
This is X-Men.

593
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


594
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


595
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


596
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


597
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


598
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


599
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


600
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


601
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


602
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


603
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


604
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


605
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


606
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


607
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000


608
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,140
Yeah.

609
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,780
It's really cool.

610
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,020
Never want to smoke.

611
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,800
Never go out.

612
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,640
Don't go home.

613
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:22,700
Once more, there are other people outside.

614
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,700


615
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,700


616
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,700


617
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,740
Go to sleep.

618
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


619
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


620
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,760
THREE Saw logs.

621
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,020
200 of them returned.

622
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,800
consumption is going down.

623
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,020
IN THE MARINE.

624
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,540
appropriated have been used as Rand writes for the color back My very old

625
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:26,720
thinks you were able to survive.

626
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:26,720


627
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:26,720


628
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,820
Medic, breathe. Medic, breathe. Medic.

629
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,780
One, two, three.

630
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,680
Medic breathe. Medic breathe. Medic breathe.

631
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,840
Medic, breathe. Medic, breathe. Medic.

632
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,880
Three minutes, Chagall. I'm not a bit worried.

633
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,720
You are not, but I am.

634
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,040
There is no phone ringing, Derek!

635
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,100
Yes?

636
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,420
I can feel the vibes in the air. Bob is coming, and when he comes,

637
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,900
I run right through the jail door with a huge grin on my face.

638
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:07,140
Bob, are you worried at all about your lunar adventure?

639
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,220
I'm sure glad to have you boys here

640
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,300
I'm Bob and this here is my place

641
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,440
I read your flyer

642
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,460
Finally, a religion that makes sense to me

643
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,520
Hey everyone, I found him, over here

644
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,600
Bob was a science fiction writer of some note

645
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,580
Publishing many stories a year under various pseudonyms

646
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,380
Including Frank X. Barlow and Kilgore Trout

647
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,560
If I might be so blunt, do you really need a flash in name?

648
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,860
I mean, it's hardly a religious title, don't you agree?

649
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,160
My parents both were born in the day of the false gods who lie

650
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,540
The latter end

651
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,880
And I was born subgenius

652
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,940
Dobbs, I'm an admirer of your work

653
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,400
Personal as well as professional

654
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,100
I help people move on

655
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,600
Help them to escape their mundane ordinary lives

656
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,620
If you want to keep living this life of quiet desperation

657
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,620
What am I going to do about it?

658
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,580
That's up to you

659
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,260
I don't know, man

660
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,200
I, sir, am a major of history

661
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,160
You're a convincing talker about very unconvincing things

662
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,920
Whatever men do not understand they find unconvincing

663
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,720
But please don't suppose I'm dangerous because I'm unfamiliar

664
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,420
I ask that you believe in me

665
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,460
As what?

666
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,560
As a friend of yours

667
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,660
Your talent

668
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,680
Of all human beings

669
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,900
That's quite a spiel, Doc

670
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,100
Subgeniuses

671
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,740
You have two minutes

672
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,280
Three

673
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,040
Two minutes

674
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:43,240
Attention, subgeniuses

675
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,240
You have two minutes

676
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,740
Two minutes

677
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,960
Two minutes

678
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,100
Two minutes

679
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,340
Two minutes

680
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:52,540
Two minutes

681
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:52,540


682
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:52,540


683
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:52,920
Three minutes

684
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,960
Bob explained

685
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,680
It is a gateway station

686
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,020
They are situated throughout the universe

687
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,760
It is how people travel from one distant world to another

688
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,400
How come I've never heard about it?

689
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,380
He sighed

690
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,540
Politics

691
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,460
Some say let Earth in

692
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,240
Others say not yet

693
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,820
In the meantime, your gateway is a very important one

694
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,960
How do the gates work?

695
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,840
Look here

696
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,240
He started drawing on a napkin

697
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,280
If you draw two dots on paper, they do not touch

698
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,540
But if you fold the paper in half, they do not touch

699
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,020
If you fold the paper in half, you can touch the dots

700
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,680
Then the dots touch

701
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,400
Gateways are the folds in the paper

702
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,160
Through them, you can visit worlds of wild excitement and strange beauty

703
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,020
You can meet highly peculiar creatures such as you

704
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,100
That's all I'm taking from you

705
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,260
Get back here, you devil

706
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,660
Patience, my friend

707
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,020
Patience?

708
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,420
Bob, you are testing my patience

709
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,620
And all of a sudden, something comes into vision

710
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,000
No!

711
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,760
No!

712
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,320
It's a fist

713
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,980
Bob is my only hope

714
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,520
Back off and give him some room to breathe, Bob!

715
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:52,980
I'm not going to let you go

716
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,880
What are you all doing?

717
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,140
Well, I'm getting the book

718
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,600
Are all you people crazy?

719
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,400
What's happening here?

720
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,600
It's time

721
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,520
Time for what?

722
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,620
I have to go

723
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,220
You have only one minute

724
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,620
Come to the pavilion now!

725
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,420
Seems in a powerful way, that one

726
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,520
And the customer seems anxious to buy

727
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,700
I haven't much time

728
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,440
We haven't discussed the price

729
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,160
Thirty dollars

730
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,440
Thirty dollars

731
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,320
Show it to me

732
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,000
Take it

733
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,040
It's Bob's

734
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,580
Thirty dollars

735
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,540
Enter!

736
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,460
It's the chance of a lifetime

737
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,140
But you only get one chance

738
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Put these on

739
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,720
You're on your way

740
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,760
On my way where?

741
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,680
Paradise, my friend

742
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,220
There's no such place

743
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,580
Oh yes, John, there is

744
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,500
There's no such place

745
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:52,500


746
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,300
Make a choice

747
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,680
There's a whole other world out there

748
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,240
One chance

749
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,780
Make it count

750
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,600
Master, thank you

751
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,040
Now what?

752
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,180
Now we must beg the Hulk

753
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,600
See if they bite

754
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,380
And pull him in

755
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,760
You know no one can hurt you

756
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,080
You know no one can even get near you

757
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,400
You're an X-ray eye now

758
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,920
And you can breathe fire

759
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,120
You can wipe out entire cities

760
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,400
With one blast of your fiery breath

761
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,920
You're a monster now

762
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,700
And only a monster can realize

763
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,080
The fulfillment I'm capable of feeling

764
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,120
It's so wonderful

765
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,340
To feel this far gone

766
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,080
Ah!

767
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,620
You know what?

768
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,860
Stand there!

769
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,460
And wait

770
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Wait for what?

771
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,540
What's happening here, Bob?

772
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,540
The same old, same old

773
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
Am I gonna die?

774
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,400
We all died

775
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,320
It's just a matter of when

776
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,460
This moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of B

777
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,840
Old B

778
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:21,840


779
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:21,840


780
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,780
B-O-B

781
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,780
B-O-B

782
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,500
B-O-B

783
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,720
Over and over again

784
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Very slowly

785
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,820
With a long pause between the first B and the second

786
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,060
A heavy, murmurous sound

787
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,840
Somehow curiously savage

788
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,560
In the background of which one seemed to hear a stamp of naked feet

789
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,460
And the throbbing of tom-toms

790
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,940
For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up

791
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,760
But this subhuman chanting of B-O-B

792
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,520
B-O-B

793
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,920
Always filled him with horror

794
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,460
Gulp

795
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,700
Aliens!

796
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,080
Hundreds of them!

797
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,180
Like every space creature and comic book monster you've ever seen come to life

798
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,040
Only these were real

799
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:13,140
Beings with any number of arms, legs, heads, tails, tentacles and antennas

800
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,260
Slithering, gliding, creeping, waddling and scurrying this way and that

801
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,660
And not one of them gave us a second glance

802
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,360
B-O-B-B-B-O-B

803
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,160
B-O-B-B-B-O-B

804
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,900
B-O-B-B-B-O-B

805
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,460
A voice on the loudspeaker began making announcements in a language I'd never heard

806
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,000
It sounded like pure gobbledygook

807
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,660
I noticed that some of the creatures hurrying by were carrying suitcases

808
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,700
Suitcases?

809
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,260
Announcements on a loudspeaker?

810
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,140
All of the sudden I realized what this reminded me of

811
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,960
It's like some kind of airport, Mike

812
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,220
It's 7am, what are they cock-a-doodly doing?

813
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,040
Mike, don't look now

814
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,280
But there's a boa constrictor climbing over your shoulder

815
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,420
It turned out it wasn't a snake after all

816
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,220
It was an arm, one of three

817
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,940
Attached to a creature that looked like...

818
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,060
Well, you tell me

819
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,680
Noodles and Bob's throw-up

820
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,620
Three giant yellow eyes about the size of basketballs

821
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,260
Perched on the ends of three thin nets

822
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,000
Three arms were attached to its body at the waist

823
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,220
Each arm ended in a three-fingered hand

824
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,140
And yes, in case you were wondering, it also had three fangs

825
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,820
Bright red fangs

826
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,040
Located in the palms of its hands

827
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,900
And a third that was on the end of its trunk

828
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,540
She can't go flyin'

829
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,380
She can't go flyin'

830
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,140
She can't go flyin'

831
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,900
She can't go flyin'

832
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,720
She can't go flyin'

833
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,500
She can't go flyin'

834
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,140
Flyin' flyin' flyin' flyin' flyin' flyin'

835
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,820
Her

836
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,980
Thank you.

837
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,820
Thank you.

838
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,200
Thank you.

839
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,260
Thank you.

840
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,300
Thank you.

841
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,580
Thank you.

842
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,120
Thank you.

843
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Thank you.

844
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,360
Thank you.

845
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,020
Thank you.

846
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,900
Thank you.

847
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,440
Thank you.

848
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:28,440


849
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,240
Thank you.

850
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,640
Thank you.

851
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:30,940
Please.

852
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,080
Please join us.

853
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,020
You highlighted the ships.

854
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,380
Yeah.

855
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,920
You are our new parents.

856
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,520
Wait, is this book written for me?

857
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,940
Let's see what it says.

858
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,720
Thank you.

859
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,080
I'm the first.

860
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,820
You're my parent.

861
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,600
I think that's terrible.

862
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,860
It's a bad joke.

863
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,520
But this night's not over yet.

864
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,260
Woo! Woo! Woo!

865
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,100
You are sure I must come, you smack bastard!

866
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,640
The aliens are here! We're all going to die!

867
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,840
The aliens are here!

868
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,840
The aliens are here!

869
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,580
What?

870
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,560
The aliens!

871
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,460
The aliens!

872
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,280
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

873
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,200
Ouch! Ain't that ironic?

874
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,400
Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.

875
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,340
I suppose we all fought that one way or another.

876
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:34,940
See you.

877
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,840
They understood what they were doing.

878
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,980
They were unleashing a power unlike any humankind had ever had.

879
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,840
We now have...

880
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,200
...the ability not just to kill others, but to kill all other human beings.

881
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:51,860
Yeah!

882
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,540
Great job! Great job!

883
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:54,920
Magic

884
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,820
Is loose

885
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,080
Magic

886
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,080
Is loose

887
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,360
In the world tonight

888
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,960
Tonight

889
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,640
Tonight

890
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,100
Tonight

891
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,760
Tonight

892
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,160
Tonight

893
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,780
Tonight

894
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,020
Tonight

895
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,100
Tonight

896
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,380
Tonight

897
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:29,960
Tonight

898
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:29,960


899
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,600
Tonight

900
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:31,600


901
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:31,600


902
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:31,600


903
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,540
Rachel

904
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:45,540


905
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:45,880
I'm going to get somebody that will stop her.

906
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:45,880


907
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:45,880


908
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,920
Well, when you eliminate the impossible,

909
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,340
the only thing left, no matter how incredible,

910
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,160
is Bob.

911
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,320
Bob was some kind of illusion.

912
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,460
Magic Bob.

913
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,380
Like magic.

914
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,240
Real magic.

915
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,920
Like a shower around the sphere.

916
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,640
My feelings are better.

917
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,260
It's a strange kind of scene.

918
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,960
There's a little distortion

919
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,420
on my personal screen.

920
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,000
Honey!

921
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,060
Can you feel it?

922
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,160
Honey!

923
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,780
Can you feel it?

924
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,400
Magic

925
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,180
Is loose

926
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,400
Magic

927
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,420
Is loose

928
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,540
In the world tonight

929
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,720
Oh, this is dumb.

930
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,900
Magic

931
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,740
You're so beautiful.

932
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,700
In the world tonight!

933
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,680
How do you think it...

934
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,220
Magic

935
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,180
That's just like a sad excuse for your strange perversion.

936
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,420
Magic

937
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,740
You're screwed in the head.

938
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,040
Magic

939
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,160
Come on, Bobby. What do you know better than that?

940
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,880
Don't call me Bobby.

941
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,720
Magic

942
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,120
Bobby!

943
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,000
Magic

944
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,540
Alright, so...

945
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,080
Yeah, man.

946
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,640
I don't think I feel so good about this all of a sudden.

947
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:06,880
Magic

948
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,820
You dumbasses!

949
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:09,900


950
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,160
You're so stupid!

951
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,780
How could you?

952
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,120
Without their heads, they're powerless.

953
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,160
Please, no!

954
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,140
Said the head.

955
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,460
We mean you no harm.

956
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,820
No, I don't!

957
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,440
Oh, gee!

958
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,540
A lot of smart boys, aren't you?

959
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,400
This ain't right, Bob.

960
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,440
Nothing's right anymore.

961
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,880
The head, he thought, appeared to agree with him.

962
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,100
Run away, said the head silently.

963
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,620
Go back to the others.

964
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,300
You mean...

965
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,500
Go back, said the head.

966
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,580
Sure.

967
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
He saw reality too clearly.

968
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,820
A faulty denial mechanism.

969
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:39,900
Sure.

970
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,900


971
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,900


972
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,900


973
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,900


974
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,900


975
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,900


976
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,900


977
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,900


978
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,900


979
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,120
He failed to block out the terrible truths of existence.

980
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:50,620
In the end, his inability to push away the awful facts of being in the world rendered

981
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,700
his life meaningless.

982
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,160
Or as one great Hollywood producer said, too much reality is not what the people want.

983
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,780
I have named it Ozymandias Melancholia.

984
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,680
Oh, Bob generally knows what he's doing.

985
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,660
He does everything for the...

986
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,480
Well, Bob, what are we gonna do?

987
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,200
I don't know.

988
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,700
There's hope.

989
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,940
You see, he's got some fight left in him.

990
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,500
Guess Bob liked the real world approach.

991
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,500
Yeah, you know what he found?

992
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,780
Something about the place didn't seem real.

993
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,460
Didn't have a good, odd feeling about it.

994
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,220
So he quit.

995
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,200
Thought it was crap.

996
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,680
It was a joke, really?

997
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,360
No.

998
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,900
You were just wrong, that's all.

999
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,280
I'd rather not tell you.

1000
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,260
A little headache.

1001
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,460
Something you ate, perhaps.

1002
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,640
Joke, Dodgy.

1003
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,640
I'm not joking.

1004
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:37,640


1005
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:37,640


1006
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:37,640


1007
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:37,640


1008
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:37,640


1009
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:37,640


1010
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:37,640


1011
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:37,640


1012
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:37,640


1013
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,940
Are you gonna let me in on it?

1014
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,360
In on it?

1015
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,040
Sure I will.

1016
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:42,980
Sure.

1017
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,380
Bob, about, um, our money for tonight.

1018
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,320
That's right, uh...

1019
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,700
We want smoke.

1020
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,680
Uh...

1021
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,780
I said smoke.

1022
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,600
We've got to have smoke.

1023
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,020
Cause the smoke's a signal.

1024
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,640
And we can't be rescued if we don't have smoke.

1025
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,580
Yeah!

1026
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,060
There was silence except for the multitudinous murmur of the bees.

1027
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,620
Over here, Bob.

1028
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1029
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1030
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1031
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1032
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1033
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1034
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1035
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1036
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1037
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1038
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1039
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1040
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,620


1041
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:07,840
Bob.

1042
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,240
Over here.

1043
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,380
But this night's not over yet.

1044
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,720
There's been a little hitch in the giddy-up.

1045
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,500
Oh, you got your shoe case.

1046
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,420
I'll explain when we get back to the motel.

1047
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:21,660
Hey.

1048
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,160
Got a little surprise waiting for you there.

1049
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,640
No, Bob, you really surprised me.

1050
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,740
You got that right.

1051
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:28,740
Oh!

1052
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:30,920
Oh!

1053
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:31,860
Oh!

1054
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:34,840
Oh!

1055
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,300
Oh!

1056
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,640
Oh!

1057
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:36,720
Oh!

1058
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:36,820
Oh!

1059
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,320
Oh!

1060
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1061
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1062
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1063
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1064
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1065
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1066
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1067
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1068
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1069
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1070
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,600


1071
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,340
And I like Bob.

1072
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,800
I don't know, does everyone like him?

1073
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,460
I know Molly Ringwald ran out of there.

1074
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,360
She was scared of him.

1075
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,560
She was a little scared of, of Bob.

1076
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,200
Hah hah hah.

1077
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,380
Where're you goin'?

1078
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,180
How could I get goin'?

1079
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,660
Y'ka take me with ya?

1080
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,440
Don't even ask.

1081
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,740
Y-you know how we get.

1082
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,120
Huh?

1083
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,600
You think I'm kidding?

1084
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,960
Oh, don't leave me out here.

1085
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:07,600
That's all right.

1086
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:07,600


1087
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:16,680

1089
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,160
bob turned and draped his arms around our shoulders again smiled and say twizzled he said

1090
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:37,420
just as the camera flashed ah my eyes and before you could say dracula bob spread his wings

1091
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:42,840
uncurled its ears and turned into a bat and the air was full of flapping bat wings

1092
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,900
time for canal though watch out

1093
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,320

1098
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,380
i'm doomed

1099
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,680
there's no hope for me

1100
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,340
i battle my existential quantities all day long

1101
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,740
i entertain no dreams of ever freeing myself from them

1102
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,820
it's just the way i am sickly and worthless a scribble stab at the face of a perfection

1103
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,960
that never even really existed and don't tell me i just haven't seen it

1104
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,140
i see things as they are

1105
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,200
and i don't like it one bit

1106
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,080
and well yes sure

1107
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,400
i laugh and smile sometimes

1108
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,920
but eventually i come back to the realization

1109
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,860
that it's all futile

1110
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,440
for the least i know it

1111
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,440
hahahaha

1112
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,240

1114
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,960

1116
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,640
trying to save the world with your magical herbs

1117
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,400
victim theory and pc f**king troll

1118
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,400
just take a good look at yourselves you're so scared and idealistic

1119
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,300
whining at the first hint of difficulty itching to strike out

1120
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,560
and when you don't understand you're oblivious

1121
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,380
oh i'm sorry man i've signed a small circle of neurotics

1122
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:30,440
bouncing your boobs in aerobics classes breathing in positive ions well haha

1123
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,540
i guess you gotta spend your money on something

1124
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,820
so go ahead and spend it

1125
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,420
or it's not worth something

1126
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:37,880
hahahaha

1127
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,100
we're all doomed

1128
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,720
hahahaha

1129
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,180
sprawling and painting all over this natural world that sustains us

1130
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,420
for the self interest and comfort seeking that nature installs in us

1131
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,640
bombing and flituring our made up enemies

1132
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,880
in the hopes of avenging our pitiful tormented conscience

1133
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,980
sacrificing our souls and abandoning all that's left us worth living for

1134
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,140
for cheap globalized ephemera

1135
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,420
who says we're so rational huh

1136
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,140
we can't even decide if technology is our great savior

1137
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,160
or just our new escape note

1138
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,140
oh but it's just a more powerful pen

1139
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,880
to write the same old story

1140
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,200
in an ugly story it is

1141
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,020
struggling with each other

1142
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,140
struggling with ourselves

1143
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,600
and there's more of us all the time

1144
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,760
more fingers on your throats

1145
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,480
we've always had wars

1146
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,380
we've always had injustice

1147
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,300
we've always had stupidity

1148
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,700
why should we stop now

1149
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,460
we love it this way

1150
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,280
we wouldn't have it any other way

1151
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,160
but it won't last forever you know

1152
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,920
because unless we somehow change

1153
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,640
which is highly extremely unlikely

1154
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,920
we're all doomed

1155
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,200
all doomed

1156
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,420
all doomed

1157
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,600
all doomed

1158
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,480
all doomed

1159
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,280
after a few moments

1160
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,440
the green glow blinked out

1161
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,520
and the sound faded away

1162
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,960
until just the echoes

1163
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,300
lingered in the dark distorted shadows

1164
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,140
hey what the hell

1165
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,080
what the hell is this

1166
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,900
oh how our entire race will die

1167
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,920
this party stinks

1168
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,580
oh god you blew it up

1169
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,500
i hate that bastard

1170
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,120
jesus

1171
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,060
oh that son of a bitch

1172
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,700
i'm gonna kill you

1173
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,400
you stupid rotten son of a bitch

1174
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,120
you really did it

1175
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,040
i can't believe this

1176
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,480
but he pulled him off better than i was going to

1177
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,680
damn him

1178
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,300
wait a minute

1179
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,320
and i

1180
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,580
wait a minute

1181
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,280
um

1182
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:50,960
are you crazy

1183
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,840
are you

1184
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,240
i don't remember

1185
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,940
oh that's just

1186
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,180
you're not

1187
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,440
you're not

1188
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:56,740
you're not

1189
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,200
this is the only раз

1190
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,140
you're here

1191
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,880
look at this

1192
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,380
you know i love you

1193
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:16,680
so do you

1194
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:16,980
this is where we knees

1195
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,580
this is you

1196
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:17,860
we know

1197
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:17,880
how to

1198
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,200
how to

1199
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:18,340
how this

1200
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,360
what i got

1201
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:24,640
shut

1202
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,260
shut

1203
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:26,580
shut

1204
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:26,600
shut

1205
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:26,620
shut

1206
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:26,640
shut

1207
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:26,660
shut

1208
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:26,680
shut

1209
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:26,700
shut

1210
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:26,720
shut

1211
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,660
resurrected.

1212
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,440
Full of crap.

1213
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,880
After our, um,

1214
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,620
brainwashings there.

1215
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,800
And that's why I...

1216
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,100
That's why I'm the way

1217
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,160
you see me now.

1218
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,640
And we decay

1219
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,820
with every minute here

1220
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,280
and with your

1221
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,280
efficient ministrations

1222
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,060
turned to jelly.

1223
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,280
I want my freedom.

1224
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,940
But I was talking

1225
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,780
to empty air.

1226
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,400
He was tiptoeing

1227
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,380
toward the stairway.

1228
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,440
There's our thing.

1229
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,780
You have to be ready

1230
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,760
to be killed by Bob.

1231
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,020
I just want to say

1232
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:54,520
one thing.

1233
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,580
That I never listened

1234
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,740
to such a pack of lies

1235
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,280
in all my born days.

1236
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,140
We were lying,

1237
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,720
Mr. Stein.

1238
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,140
You think you have slack.

1239
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,620
Cut the crap.

1240
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,580
Most of you don't even

1241
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,540
know what slack is.

1242
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,220
No, I don't.

1243
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:04,900
I don't even know.

1244
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,220
This is the thing,

1245
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:06,520
suck it.

1246
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,460
I want you out tonight,

1247
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:08,820
bud.

1248
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,160
You'll live with Lisa.

1249
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,600
Princess.

1250
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,940
I can afford to go out

1251
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,940
and party at the disco,

1252
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,900
et cetera, et cetera.

1253
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,020
Now I can afford

1254
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,060
to go out and get some slack.

1255
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,400
I'm going to have

1256
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,660
my fingers in my ears

1257
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,840
and be going la la la

1258
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,560
the whole time.

1259
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,560
Impossible!

1260
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,960
I blinked and looked again.

1261
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,080
No, I wasn't crazy.

1262
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,660
Wimp was gone.

1263
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,980
The burnt out wimp

1264
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,180
wasn't even there.

1265
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,900
Where is that little weasel?

1266
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,480
Where is that old face?

1267
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:35,900
Where?

1268
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,020
He's gone.

1269
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,220
Clocked out at seven

1270
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,320
this morning and went home.

1271
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,620
He said you should

1272
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,900
keep wasting your life, though.

1273
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,260
You have to go out

1274
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:45,740
and go out

1275
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,500
on your own, man.

1276
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,180
Where are you going?

1277
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:55,780
Dallas.

1278
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,180
We're all going to live

1279
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:57,940
in the parking lot.

1280
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,540
See ya.

1281
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,140
I started a joke

1282
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,780
Which started the whole world crying

1283
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,740
But I didn't see

1284
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,140
That the joke was on me

1285
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:30,840
Oh

1286
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,320
Oh no

1287
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,940
I started to cry

1288
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,780
Started the whole world laughing

1289
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,140
If I don't see

1290
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,680
You

1291
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,700
That the joke

1292
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,260
Was on me

1293
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,420
That the joke was on me

1294
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,760
That the joke was on me

1295
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,300
Bob.

1296
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:11,800
Who's there?

1297
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:12,580
Who's there?

1298
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,120
Bob.

1299
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:13,740
You know.

1300
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,580
Go get my damn beer.

1301
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,400
You're freaking moron.

1302
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:15,800
Bob.

1303
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,560
You figure it out?

1304
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:16,960
No.

1305
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:17,480
Bob.

1306
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,260
I ain't scared of that circus freak.

1307
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,840
He's done exploiting me.

1308
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,320
So he plots a masquerade with his pack of sissies and kicks me out for good.

1309
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:24,680
I'm not scared of that circus freak.

1310
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,260
That's what happened.

1311
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,520
When did you discover that?

1312
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,380
How much money you got?

1313
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,620
What's that supposed to mean?

1314
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,300
Motherfucker.

1315
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:29,620
You know what I mean?

1316
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,140
Don't give me that condescending bulls**t Bob.

1317
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,680
I don't like it.

1318
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,860
I put the damn budget in the damn sink and he knows it.

1319
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:35,980
Yeah.

1320
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,560
It's the drugs.

1321
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,220
That's me.

1322
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,600
Listen to me you dumb s**t.

1323
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,040
Okay?

1324
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,500
I ain't even a have-been.

1325
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,700
I'm a fake creation.

1326
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,720
You got it?

1327
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,260
You stupid.

1328
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,720
I hung up on him.

1329
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,720
So how come now Bob gets to tool around in a power everything kind of ride?

1330
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,900
He's stepping large and laughing easy.

1331
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,420
But the calendar's still on.

1332
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:54,680
I'm not scared of that.

1333
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:54,680


1334
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:54,680


1335
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:04,540
The silence is deafening but the feeling is strong.

1336
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,500
All you're gonna do is cover Bob's name in s**t.

1337
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,740
Bob Newman!

1338
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,300
What can you tell me about him?

1339
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,120
Bob.

1340
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,020
Never seen him before.

1341
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,300
Medical records.

1342
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,400
Masturbatory techniques.

1343
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,040
Oh my god.

1344
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:22,740
References.

1345
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,240
What?

1346
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,440
Sperm samples.

1347
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:24,680
Sperm samples.

1348
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:24,680


1349
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:24,800
Sperm samples.

1350
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,460
Whatever you want to call it.

1351
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:26,580
Whoa!

1352
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,260
No.

1353
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,880
And then there is this incident involving Vaseline.

1354
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,900
Liberally applied to...

1355
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,060
Listen.

1356
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,920
What do you want from me?

1357
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,360
Nothing.

1358
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,660
Look I'm sorry.

1359
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,940
I can't help you.

1360
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,880
Maybe they don't want to be found.

1361
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,340
Maybe they got on a spaceship and flew away.

1362
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,180
There is one other possibility.

1363
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,480
They may have all been the victims of say a single diabolical serial killer.

1364
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,520
Maybe somebody who entices his victims to a remote location.

1365
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,740
in the middle of nowhere where he has his way with them.

1366
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:04,120
And then buries their bodies somewhere out there.

1367
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,400
Wish I could help you.

1368
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,460
Cowboy, the blue suitcase, the alleged murders,

1369
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,200
the alleged incident in the desert.

1370
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:11,840
But they were there.

1371
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,640
There were 15 people getting on a damn RV.

1372
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,080
John, do you really expect me to believe you were abducted by aliens

1373
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,660
wearing track suits?

1374
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:18,520
You guessed it.

1375
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,040
It says here in your statement,

1376
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,400
you believe they've stolen your sperm.

1377
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,460
Man, that's rough.

1378
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,480
I don't know.

1379
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,560
It's the only thing that made sense.

1380
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,220
It's a conspiracy.

1381
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,460
But if you want to be introduced to our chief conspirator

1382
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,400
in our little conspiracy.

1383
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,100
Where is it?

1384
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,800
What's the matter with you people?

1385
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,540
I was joking.

1386
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,360
Don't you know a joke when you hear one?

1387
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,080
So we know whoever laughed was Stang?

1388
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,420
That's not all we know.

1389
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,420
Mr. Stang.

1390
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,840
Drank a lot of bottles of Jenkum,

1391
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,200
which smells awful, but is...

1392
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,140
It's all dripping out of your ears.

1393
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,900
Come on, go go on the head.

1394
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,120
A lot of bottles of Jenkum.

1395
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,640
And that's why I...

1396
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,620
That's why I'm the way you see me now.

1397
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,280
Ridiculous, Mr. Stang.

1398
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,500
You think I'm kidding.

1399
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,180
I'm actually not kidding.

1400
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,540
Do you know what Jenkum is?

1401
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,800
You leave it in a jar for a long, long time,

1402
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,580
then you whiff it,

1403
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,760
then you see your ancestors.

1404
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,440
Today's Stang jury has already heard testimony

1405
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,080
about your event, Scotty.

1406
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:19,700
A lobotomy.

1407
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,420
Then Jenkum.

1408
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,120
That explains a lot.

1409
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,440
That may have been the way...

1410
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,240
It happened, Mr. Stang.

1411
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,180
Those things did happen, but...

1412
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,440
Suppose it wasn't.

1413
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,080
I don't know.

1414
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,140
That means something sinister is coming.

1415
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,840
Yes, something sinister is coming.

1416
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:33,620
Soon.

1417
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,560
But you're lying, Mr. Stang.

1418
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,220
I know.

1419
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,600
Well, but you know you got ripped off.

1420
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,240
If you could remember it,

1421
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,440
you'd know it wasn't any good.

1422
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,520
Perhaps, Mr. Stang.

1423
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,520
Oh, well, you know what?

1424
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,880
Bob never made any sense,

1425
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,800
but that was the charm of it.

1426
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,660
Well, Mr. Stang,

1427
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,400
it was an almost foolproof plan.

1428
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,680
But I wouldn't do that.

1429
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,220
You know why?

1430
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,180
Because it would be wrong.

1431
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,720
Mr. Stang.

1432
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,380
Don't do that.

1433
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,700
Prove you're Mr. Stang.

1434
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,420
Word.

1435
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,220
I made a million bucks

1436
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:04,840
selling 5,000 pounds of hash to school kids.

1437
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:05,520
Yes.

1438
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,840
Now there's our Mr. Stang.

1439
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,520
And they paid us, uh,

1440
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,100
300 euros each

1441
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,840
for a Jenkum lobotomy.

1442
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,500
Can you believe it?

1443
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,140
It was a pretty good deal.

1444
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,340
300 euros is like 500 bucks.

1445
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,800
The only problem was that

1446
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,600
Ivan had skimmed 25 million bucks

1447
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,140
from Spike Lee's operational account

1448
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,300
to cover his stolen nuclear,

1449
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,280
uh, materials.

1450
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:25,920
Today, what?

1451
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,680
How you find out about fish?

1452
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,340
Getting real tired of you ducking me, man!

1453
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,620
Halfway down the throat.

1454
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,660
That's the best place to find out about a fish.

1455
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,680
I want more money, man!

1456
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,920
How does a fish feel to the mouth?

1457
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,400
How does a fish taste?

1458
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,860
How does a fish work?

1459
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:40,540
Touch.

1460
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,180
Sense.

1461
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,100
Perceive.

1462
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,260
Where's my money?

1463
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,280
How does it relate?

1464
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,540
How do you use it?

1465
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,960
How do you find out?

1466
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:47,820
You touch it.

1467
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,880
You try to taste it.

1468
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,580
You smell it.

1469
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,540
You're relating to it.

1470
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:52,700
She's fine.

1471
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,900
Well, darling, you made a great try.

1472
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,940
I don't remember beating me, punching me.

1473
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,320
He wasn't really beating you.

1474
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,740
He was just trying to execute you.

1475
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,160
He didn't know how to do it right, so he had to, you know, use his fists.

1476
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,100
If he had any brain, he would have just shot you, but...

1477
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,000
A little bit at a time.

1478
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,900
Who would ask for that?

1479
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,320
You know you're my hero.

1480
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,500
You're my hero.

1481
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:54,000
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest

1482
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:03,400
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest

1483
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:09,120
And the world will be better for this

1484
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:15,140
That one man scorned and covered with scars

1485
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:21,220
Still strove with his last ounce of courage

1486
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:29,280
To reach the unreachable star

1487
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,340
I'm not innocent.

1488
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,080
You are.

1489
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,320
I killed Bob.

1490
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,660
Seekers, do you have what it takes to kill Bob when the time comes?

1491
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,040
Well, the time's coming in one short week.

1492
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,420
And if you'd like more information I want to do to save your yeti ass

1493
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,340
When it all starts coming down

1494
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,180
Turn to subgenius.com

1495
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,880
There isn't time to mail anything

1496
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,760
Oh, Bob, let it be this year

1497
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,360
Let it be this year

1498
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:15,040
Y'all smackers better figure out what y'all gonna do.

1499
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:25,200
Oh Bob, I'm gonna kill you.

1500
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:35,840
Oh Bob, I'm gonna kill you.
