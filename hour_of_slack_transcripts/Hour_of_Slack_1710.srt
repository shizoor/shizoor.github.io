1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,100
You're not going to sedate me anymore.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,820
Who are you?

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,360
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,160
I seem to be in a timeless space void.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,300
Neither light nor dark.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,020
I have awareness but not mind but no memory.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,980
That should hold her till you get her home.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,060
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,800
to see how they did hang.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
When I got there, her cupboard was bare.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,100
I couldn't ignite a thing.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,860
There was no shard, no bone, no twig.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,800
I brought my comic book collection.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,780
Was about this big, yeah.

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,820
From Alaska.

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:00:59,920
From Alaska.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,420
Without slack is like slack without frop.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,020
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,660
I found my dog food collection about five o'clock.

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,760
But all that food was stale.

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,200
I thought I'd call that rip-off schmuck.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,020
But I forgot he was in jail.

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,760
Ended up killing a porcupine.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,320
Just to see if I could smoke his rhyme.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:28,820
Oh!

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,980
Oh, frop are you ready?

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,200
Frop without slack.

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,580
Oh, frop without slack.

33
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,100
Is like slack.

34
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,340
You're Cocky kid.

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:45,860
Fướp without, I'm sorry

36
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:45,860


37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,780
Physics and I am gonna feel the need.

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,800
Oh, brobs!

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,640
without slack is like slack without propppa

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,080
Where the hell else am i going to cop?

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,860
where the hell else am i going to cop?

42
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,500
But Where the hell else am I going to cop?

43
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:05,860
Yeah!

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,640
But Where the hell else am i going to cop?

45
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,500
but don't cop from that guy right there

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,860
It's like, where the hell else am I going to cop?

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah!

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,380
But Where the hell else am I going to cop?

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,900
No way

50
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,580
No, no, no.

51
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,840
No, don't bother.

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,480
When we were born

53
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,140
into this life

54
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,820
we were destined

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,600
to make it right.

56
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,560
It's predetermined

57
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,180
and this is our fate.

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,960
We're singing this song

59
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,520
so you can relate.

60
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,640
We are going

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,260
to save the universe.

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,460
We are going

63
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,020
to save the universe.

64
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,260
We are going

65
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,840
to save the universe.

66
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,240
This time.

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,580
We are full grown.

68
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,200
We are grown up men.

69
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,420
We are all masters.

70
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,380
We pay to reason it.

71
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,860
It is our mission.

72
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,620
It is our task.

73
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,880
It's obvious.

74
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Just use your lives.

75
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,000
We are going

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,600
to save the universe.

77
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,840
We are going

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,320
to save the universe.

79
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,620
We are going

80
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,500
to save the universe.

81
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,420
We are going

82
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,420


83
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,720
This time.

84
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,780
Friends,

85
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,920
this is Reverend Stang

86
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,320
and I'm here all by myself

87
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,220
with the two dogs

88
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,880
at Stang Ranch

89
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,460
in front of Tarzan's radio station

90
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,560
which is this

91
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
bunch of mostly really

92
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,320
old equipment.

93
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,020
Analog type stuff.

94
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,720
Running through a little tiny digital recorder.

95
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,620
Smaller than a cigarette pack.

96
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,340
And the most modern thing hooked up to the system

97
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,120
is an iPhone.

98
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,020
On which I'm about to call Philodrummond and Bleepo Abernathy

99
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,180
and try to get them both on the show at the same time.

100
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,960
And I'm going to start up my CD player here.

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,940
Which has Captain Beefheart instrumentals

102
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,660
ready to play in the background.

103
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
And somewhere in here is a recording of an

104
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,980
obscene and terrible thing happening.

105
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,600
It's just the sound effects of it.

106
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,240
It's just a dog cleaning herself with her tongue.

107
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,780
That's all.

108
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,940
You can hear Captain Beefheart here.

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,300
This is old Beefheart.

110
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,740
So that's winged eel fingerling on the guitar.

111
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,080
I think.

112
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,940
Hold on.

113
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,820
Hold on just a second.

114
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,660
There we go.

115
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,260
I'm going to change over to a headphone jack thing.

116
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,100
Headphone.

117
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,880
What are you?

118
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,420
Is he talking about something dirty?

119
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,500
No.

120
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,920
He's talking dirty.

121
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,360
Can you hear me now?

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,860
You were talking dirty on the radio weren't you Philo?

123
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,460
Headphone jack.

124
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,400
Hello I'm Patrick Fave today.

125
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,880
Are we on the air?

126
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,460
Are we on the air right now?

127
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,000
Well yes and no.

128
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,380
Yes.

129
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,900
So we are somewhere.

130
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,280
Yeah.

131
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,040
We're on the air.

132
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,740
You know I like to include the setups in the show.

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,480
Oh yeah.

134
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,940
Since they seem to go on forever anyway.

135
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,500
Remember that last time we did Doctors for Wotan at XC?

136
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:19,500


137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,480
Yeah.

138
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,560
You weren't really ready and you were still futzing around after about half an hour trying

139
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,180
to get your crazy sound effects.

140
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,720
Sound right.

141
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,220
We'd already done six of our songs by then.

142
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:31,980
Yeah.

143
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,100
I just decided okay the setup is part of the show.

144
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,620
This is our best song.

145
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,640
Yeah.

146
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,420
You know and.

147
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,480
Well I think that's always worked for us in the past.

148
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,120
You know it's a good strategy for lack of a better one.

149
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,880
You know.

150
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,380
Right.

151
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,860
For lack of a better one.

152
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,340
Why not?

153
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,080
Why even look for a better one?

154
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,720
Just go to the easy one.

155
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,660
Yeah.

156
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,880
What is better anyway?

157
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,020
I mean is better really isn't easy sometimes better?

158
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:09,880
The path of least resistance I think is what you yourself dubbed that path.

159
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
A great man said that sometime.

160
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,640
Yeah.

161
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,280
Well I mean it's attributed to Bob but you're the one who told me.

162
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,860
Ah yes.

163
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,200
No I could I pushed.

164
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,060
Many of my.

165
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,660
I pushed.

166
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Many of my best things came directly from Bob to me.

167
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,220
Well everybody's best things come from Bob to them.

168
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,540
Hey you just had a lot more best things than most people.

169
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:46,320
When you see when you see me on Scrub Genius and I'm posting as I need my Johnson.

170
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,980
Yeah.

171
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,240
And you're like.

172
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,240


173
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,240


174
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,260
And you're like.

175
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,740
Did you see that?

176
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,080
Yeah.

177
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,340
Okay.

178
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,160
Yeah.

179
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,460
Because when I when I look at it just says me.

180
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,360
Right.

181
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,580
Yeah.

182
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,280
Same with me.

183
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,100
But other people see Reverend Ivan Stang.

184
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,380
Flipped me out a little bit you know.

185
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,940
Yeah.

186
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,280
Just a little bit.

187
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,660
Oh imagine how I feel on Facebook.

188
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,660
They won't let me be Reverend Ivan Stang on Facebook.

189
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,340
I have to use my human street name.

190
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,240
Which everybody has.

191
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,000
I mean it's the same name about half of Americans have.

192
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,240
It's ridiculous.

193
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,980
I'm going to call Bill K.

194
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,240
K.

195
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,940
I mean Reverend Bleepo Abernathy and see what happens.

196
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,360
Merge calls.

197
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,180
Merge calls.

198
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,980
That's what I need.

199
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,060
Hey can you hear me?

200
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh good.

201
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,540
Hopefully I can hear both of you.

202
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:32,980
Yes.

203
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,860
Yes.

204
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,960
You can hear us.

205
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,220
This is just crazy.

206
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,860
We can be hear us.

207
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,020
Just for one day.

208
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,200
And Bleepo this may surprise you but I think I'm hearing a bit of an echo.

209
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,220
I'm not sure.

210
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


211
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


212
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


213
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


214
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


215
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


216
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


217
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


218
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


219
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


220
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,220


221
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,320
Oh that might be that.

222
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm going along communicate.

223
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:15,220
Even considering I'm going tell it on abrazas of Aliexpress and hate it calm down you and

224
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,240
I move from a derived from adam Salmon and ב� Irene for a yes to this one and ask Julie

225
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,160
for help with the other one

226
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes, they said that.

227
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,440
And they were right.

228
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,840
Someone said that.

229
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,500
Yes, that was Lady Miss Keir.

230
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,440
Yeah.

231
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,200
Lady Miss Keir.

232
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,080
She was beautiful.

233
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,980
Oh, man.

234
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,700
And she still is.

235
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,080
She still is.

236
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,920
I hope so.

237
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,240
Yep.

238
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,040
Bleepo, you sound a little digital to me.

239
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,820
Do I?

240
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,420
Yeah.

241
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,840
What about now?

242
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,720
Huh?

243
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,280
Even now?

244
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,860
I mean, I can hear, I can understand Philo, and I can understand Bleepo.

245
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,720
Hey, does everybody's name end with an O?

246
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,940
Then there's Sterno.

247
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
And then there's...

248
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,020
And Onano.

249
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,100
And it's Ivano.

250
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,260
Stango.

251
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,760
Ivano.

252
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,420
Puzzly.

253
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
Puzzlo Evado.

254
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,380
Nenslo.

255
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,820
Yeah, Nenslo.

256
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,620
Nenslo, yeah.

257
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,020
Isn't Ivan actually short for Ivanho?

258
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,740
No, it's short for...

259
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,260
It means...

260
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,040
It means John, believe it or not.

261
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,460
Oh, I know that.

262
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,140
It's Russian.

263
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,500
I didn't know that myself.

264
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,420
I was giving you a joke, and you wouldn't even go with it.

265
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:22,800
Oh.

266
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,820
Well...

267
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,520
Ivanho.

268
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,420
Yeah.

269
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,300
Famous, you know, Sir Walter Scott or somebody.

270
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,600
No, it's Ivanho.

271
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,440
Get it?

272
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,140
Bleepo, you just sounded broken up again there.

273
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,600
Hmm.

274
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
I mean, not emotionally.

275
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,360
Technically.

276
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,040
I think that when we all three talk, we sort of duplex.

277
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,400
We don't talk to each other out.

278
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,960
See, I've got a microphone in front of me.

279
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,680
And the phone.

280
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,360
So, are you running your microphone into your phone?

281
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,860
I'm running my mouth.

282
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,900
I'm running my phone into my mix board.

283
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,300
The Tarzan's radio station little mix board that you're familiar with.

284
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,140
You don't have to do that.

285
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,840
Huh?

286
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,020
Do you have any alligator clips?

287
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,500
Yeah, I do.

288
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,040
Yeah, you need...

289
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,160
Not for the reason that...

290
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,740
Alligator clips.

291
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,320
You know, not...

292
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,120
But yeah, I do.

293
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,100
I do have fresh ones.

294
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,100
You should put those alligator clips on your nipples.

295
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,780
There you go.

296
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,060
Oh, okay.

297
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,360
But one on your left nipple and one on the phone.

298
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,340
Bleepo, you sounded just terrible then.

299
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,900
I mean, you broke up...

300
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:26,980
I'm sorry.

301
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,480
What about now?

302
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,760
You broke up into a million...

303
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,560
You're fine now.

304
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,360
What are you doing?

305
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,820
I don't know.

306
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm trying to keep it in the same place.

307
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,860
Well, and Philo sounds more muffled than before the merge.

308
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,920
Didn't the aliens say that?

309
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,300
At some point, Philo...

310
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,680
That seems like a familiar phrase.

311
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,380
What about now?

312
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,180
Now bleepo sounds good.

313
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,660
Sort of.

314
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,620
When we blabber all at the same time, does it still sound good?

315
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,220
No.

316
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,840
That would be the worst.

317
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,900
We can't talk at the...

318
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,200
Wait.

319
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,780
We just talked at the same time and it sounded awesome.

320
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

321
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,880
Oh, okay.

322
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,780
Well, let's try it.

323
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,680
I'm doing it right now.

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,880
I'm talking at the same time.

325
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,060
Okay.

326
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,140
Blabber, dabber, debber.

327
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,720
Yeah.

328
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,300
Pretend it's a puzzling evidence show.

329
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,520
And I'll put the background music on real loud.

330
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,400
And I shouldn't put on a monster movie, too.

331
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:18,960
Okay.

332
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,340
So I couldn't hear bleepo.

333
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,220
Yeah, I couldn't either.

334
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,980
That's because I was eating.

335
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,400
Oh, he wasn't actually saying anything.

336
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,340
Yep.

337
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,820
That explains everything.

338
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,540
So let's try it again.

339
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,300
Blippity, bloppity, blippity.

340
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,560
Well, now it's time for me to eat.

341
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,740
I need to eat something.

342
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,700
Shnogger, she neeger, she gooter, she gee.

343
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,380
That sounds like a puzzling evidence show almost.

344
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,120
Where's Hal?

345
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,420
Yep.

346
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
We all have our individual...

347
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,980
We all have our individual needs that we have to fulfill while we're on the show.

348
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm going to feed my head.

349
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,580
I just...

350
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,160
Yeah.

351
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,140
Okay.

352
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,060
Okay.

353
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,300
Like Allison, like the Jefferson Airplane did that time.

354
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,740
Yeah.

355
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,800
I remember that.

356
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,700
They admonished me.

357
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,680
They admonished me and directed me to feed my head.

358
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,540
To feed your head.

359
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,660
Yeah.

360
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,460
No, the Dormouse.

361
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,900
The Dormouse said it.

362
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,280
The Dormouse.

363
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,280


364
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
The Dormouse said that.

365
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,120
Right.

366
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,120
But Grace Slick told it to me.

367
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,460
Yeah.

368
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,580
That was back when she was hot.

369
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,480
I don't think the Dormouse actually ever says, feed your head, though.

370
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,780
I'm pretty sure the Dormouse does not really say that.

371
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,160
I think he said it to Grace Slick and she was just repeating it.

372
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,660
Right.

373
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:30,900
Yeah.

374
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,220
It was a private conversation between them.

375
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,400
Yeah.

376
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,060
A private conversation between the Dormouse and Grace Slick.

377
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,920
Because back then, rock stars could have private conversations with Victorian authors.

378
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,720
Well, and Dormouse.

379
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,400
Right.

380
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,680
Right.

381
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,440
And the authors would actually literally channel their characters.

382
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,680
So that's why you hear Dickens in those early Jackson Browne songs, you know?

383
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,640
Wow.

384
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,260
No, I guess I don't know.

385
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,060
But then they made that.

386
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,620
Yeah.

387
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,380
I do, but I was feeding my head, so I couldn't talk.

388
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,440
Boy, I sound so much better than you two guys.

389
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,180
It's unbelievable.

390
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,660
Mark Twain recorded some of the early bits with the Eagles.

391
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,700
They have Mark Twain on there because of that rule.

392
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,400
Okay.

393
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,960
That answers a lot of questions.

394
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
That explains a lot.

395
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,860
Can you hear me awesomely now?

396
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,820
Not awesomely, no.

397
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,600
No, but then, you know, I hate that term, awesome.

398
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,560
It's lost its awe.

399
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,940
It no longer calls you.

400
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,840
Can you hear me exactly now?

401
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,100
Now I can hear you exactly.

402
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,640
Okay.

403
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,720
It's funny.

404
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,200
It's funny.

405
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,460
It's almost like when you guys get far.

406
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:47,280
A little bit away from your phones or something, the digital signal starts to crack up.

407
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't like this merge thing much, but that's okay.

408
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,060
We can plow on.

409
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,440
If you guys can FaceTime, we can merge the FaceTimes, I think, and it'll sound even better.

410
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,580
Oh, my gosh.

411
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm up for any program.

412
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,380
You do FaceTime.

413
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,920
It's called FaceTime audio.

414
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,300
But it'll drop this connection, right?

415
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,820
Right.

416
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,160
It'll drop this connection.

417
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,780
In the mix, you'll have to cut that part out.

418
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:11,620
Yeah.

419
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,720
Oh, I don't know how to edit or anything.

420
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,640
I can't.

421
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,680
I don't know how to do that.

422
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,220
I just ended one thing.

423
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,720
I'm looking at Philo.

424
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,160
Speak, Philo.

425
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,320
Speak.

426
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,960
Philo, speak.

427
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,240
I guess I should change now.

428
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,900
See, all of a sudden, listeners, now this has become a TV show in that I can see Philo.

429
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,320
Well, look, I see BK waiting.

430
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,320
Hello.

431
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,180
Oh, hello.

432
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Oh, okay.

433
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,040
Now?

434
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,100
It's like a TV show.

435
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,480
It is.

436
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,440
Oh, and this actually may sound better now.

437
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,900
Oddly enough, it does.

438
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,040
We're using Wi-Fi.

439
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,160
We have a fatter signal.

440
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,040
Yeah.

441
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,440
Yeah, that's what she said.

442
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,260
The listeners don't know that.

443
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,640
Right.

444
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,000
They can't see this.

445
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,160
Thank goodness that Philo would scare them.

446
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,980
They would really, honestly, Philo seen from below with that giant beard and that face.

447
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,520
It's almost hideous.

448
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
Well, I guess you can turn the beef heart back up.

449
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,580
There it is.

450
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:12,960
Oh, oh, oh, wait.

451
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,500
I thought somehow it had interfered with my CD player, but it was just that I hadn't turned it on.

452
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,900
It may mute other things on your computer audio.

453
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,960
Well, this is all coming from another machine.

454
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:36,540
It's an old CD player running through an incredibly old Radio Shack mixer.

455
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,620
And I'm telling you, because you're doing that old school shit,

456
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:49,920
and you're using an old school language, your stuff, your excrement sounds better than the other people's excrement.

457
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,620
I know, because, yeah.

458
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,800
We can't say, can we say, like, cow hockey?

459
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,180
Yeah.

460
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,520
Yeah, you can say cow.

461
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,560
You know the rules.

462
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,060
All three of us are radio professionals.

463
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,320
Between the three of us, we've got like 150 years of experience.

464
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,780
That's right.

465
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:09,920
That's right.

466
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,520
That's right.

467
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,600
That's right.

468
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,600


469
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,600


470
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,600


471
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,600


472
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,600


473
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,600


474
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,600


475
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,600


476
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,220
Jesus rode his ass into Jerusalem.

477
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,000
Right.

478
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,740
You can say that.

479
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,340
Right.

480
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,040
Right.

481
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,180
Yeah.

482
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,260
But you can't say Mary Magdalene had a really nice ass.

483
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,020
Right.

484
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,500
We don't know that for sure.

485
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,060
We don't know that for sure.

486
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,340
It could be that that may be something we find out to be true at some point.

487
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,020
And another, here's another thing you can't say, even though there won't be any of the seven words in it.

488
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,360
The donkey had his way with Mary Magdalene.

489
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:40,680
Right.

490
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,620
In front of a big crowd.

491
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,280
No, you can't say that.

492
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,420
That's actually obscene by community standards.

493
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:49,780
Right.

494
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,880
But you can actually say that and get away with it because it doesn't have any of the seven deadly words in Christ.

495
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,500
No, that's what my point is.

496
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,720
My point is it doesn't have to have any of those seven deadly words.

497
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,940
It just has to be obscene and disgusting.

498
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,260
Well, I think that wouldn't qualify.

499
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,180
Right.

500
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,180
People don't want to see Mary do it in a compromising position.

501
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,220
Well, and we're talking about Mary Magdalene, who was kind of, you know.

502
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,160
She was a whore.

503
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,040
A whore.

504
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,720
Yeah.

505
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,400
A lady of the night.

506
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,940
Was she a saint?

507
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
Was she made a saint, too?

508
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,320
Oh, yeah.

509
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,060
Oh, yeah.

510
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,060
She bet.

511
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,500
All right.

512
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:31,460
Did she have a gospel that was among the censored, hidden gospels?

513
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,060
Yes, she did.

514
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,320
Yes, she did.

515
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,320
And, you know, Mary Magdalene, when Jesus was taken, when he actually lived through the crucifixion,

516
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,780
he and Mary made it over into southern France.

517
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,220
Right.

518
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,820
That's what some people say.

519
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,840
The pride of Christ stuff.

520
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,240
Yeah.

521
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,660
Yeah.

522
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,680
I know at least three people who claim that they're descendants of their Merovingians,

523
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,360
you know.

524
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,420
Of course, I believe all that, you know.

525
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,700
I believe every bit of that.

526
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,680
Nobody believes that I'm a descendant of the Romanovs.

527
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,320
They don't understand that my real name would be not Stang, but Rasputin Romanov.

528
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,080
And that I am the heir to the crown jewels of all the Russias.

529
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,580
I don't expect anybody to believe that.

530
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,900
I believe it.

531
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,760
I do believe it.

532
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,100
I believe it.

533
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,680
But, you know, you'll be surprised to know that I, too, am also almost over 4%.

534
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,740
I'm a 4%-er, man, like you.

535
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,920
4% of what?

536
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:30,940
Neanderthal?

537
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,580
Neanderthal.

538
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,300
Oh, wow.

539
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,000
That's the real royalty right there.

540
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,320
Oh, really?

541
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,080
Oh, cool.

542
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,500
Wow.

543
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,320
I got 4%.

544
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,160
4%.

545
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,000
I didn't know that.

546
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,040
Wow, that's great.

547
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,880
My dad found out.

548
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,120
My dad did that.

549
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,640
My brother.

550
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,480
That's how come you and I got, you know, we got along so well early on is because we both

551
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,260
had that Neanderthal thing going.

552
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
Well, Yetinsani.

553
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,000
Yetinsani.

554
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,420
Have you guys both seen the Zukowski documentary called Struggle?

555
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,940
Oh, yeah.

556
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,700
The story of Stanislav Zukowski.

557
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,320
What's it on?

558
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,640
Netflix.

559
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
And they're flogging it.

560
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,120
They're pushing it.

561
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,680
They're pushing it real hard.

562
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,120
It's the first documentary that comes up.

563
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,220
Yeah.

564
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,200
Actual people I know are in that.

565
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,540
It's, yeah, right.

566
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:16,980
Right.

567
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,220
Well, Bob's in it.

568
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,580
Yeah, that's right.

569
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,220
Bob's in it.

570
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,380
St. Byron Werner is in it, in a still.

571
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,840
Yep.

572
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,620
And my friend Charles Schneider, a brilliant fellow, is actually one of the talking heads.

573
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,900
And, well, Robert Williams, the painter, does a fabulous, yeah, he and his wife, Suzanne,

574
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,620
both, they do a great job.

575
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,760
They do a great job of talking about how brilliant and how crazy the great man was.

576
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:54,660
We're talking about Zukowski, a Polish artist and scientist who really was a genius artist

577
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,300
and the most crackpot scientist you could ever imagine.

578
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:08,800
He pieced together an entire new history of the world and history of linguistics, anthropology,

579
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:15,120
everything, from studying art in museums all over the world from different cultures.

580
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,980
And he just threw out all the history books and all the known science and just said, this

581
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,480
is what is clear from the art.

582
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:32,500
I'll have you guys know that I got a chance to attend a speaking engagement by Zukowski

583
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,220
at the Dallas Fantasy Fair.

584
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,320
Oh, wow.

585
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,520
And I got to tell him that we admired...

586
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,320
That we believed in Zermattism, but that we felt he had it backwards, that the Yeti

587
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,940
were the good guys and the humans were the bad guys.

588
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,220
And I got treated like a kook by Zukowski.

589
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,220
That's like one of the biggest badges of honor.

590
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,360
I wish I had a recording of it.

591
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,800
But yeah, he just kind of rolled his eyes, looked at the audience and said, well, you

592
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,780
know, many people sometimes get these funny ideas.

593
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,460
I mean, I got funny ideas about my work.

594
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,920
Do you remember in the movie Galaxy Quest?

595
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
He was really bummed out.

596
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,720
He was sitting in the...

597
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,360
Zukowski was in Galaxy Quest?

598
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,500
No, I'm talking about...

599
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,940
I'm just making a point.

600
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:33,920
The actor, Tim Allen, his character sitting there at this convention and he's just heard

601
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,800
what a washed up doofy is in the bathroom.

602
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,540
Right.

603
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,380
And so now he's sitting out there signing autographs.

604
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,000
He's really mad.

605
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,320
Some kid comes up and asks him some arcane question about some really something about

606
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,320
the power thruster for some mathematical thing going on in the ship and he blows up,

607
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:55,860
you know?

608
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:04,140
Mr. Shatner, why were the quartz dimethium crystals available only on one planet?

609
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,780
Yeah, Mr. Shatner.

610
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,960
That's you, that's you.

611
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,900
And he's playing Zukowski.

612
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,480
Yeah.

613
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,800
Well, yeah, that was, boy, those Dallas Fantasy Fairs were great.

614
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:28,500
They brought in Robert Crumb and Ray Harryhausen, but I heard tell and they were run by a young

615
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,980
acquaintance of mine.

616
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,880
He and I were the first, the youngest members of the Dallas Science Fiction Society at one

617
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,020
time.

618
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,760
And he became rich off the Fantasy Fairs and apparently that's what put him out of business.

619
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,300
He got too successful and partied a little too hard.

620
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,080
Yeah.

621
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,840
Everybody who puts on those big conventions tends to, there always seems to be some problem.

622
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,280
Well, you know, my wife and I put on conventions.

623
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,580
Yeah, except you guys, except you guys.

624
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,240
It's just another example.

625
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,040
It's, you see it every day, all the time.

626
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,200
The older I get, the more it just slaps me in the face every day.

627
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:15,820
It's that people, you see how little power it takes to corrupt a human.

628
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,760
No kidding.

629
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:17,940
No kidding.

630
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,780
Even in the church of the subgenius, it's like people will get-

631
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,160
The tiniest amount can cause them to just go totally nuts.

632
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,340
Well, they never got to be popular or famous before.

633
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,300
And they don't understand how little that really means.

634
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,240
Yup.

635
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,540
Yeah.

636
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,640
And-

637
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,960
And it's just that it doesn't even take much.

638
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,760
You see it, you can be like, you know, one clerk is above the other clerk.

639
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,360
And so he's lauding it over him because of his greatness.

640
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,000
You know, in his higher position.

641
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,800
I've seen such-

642
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,740
We've seen such tragic examples of that.

643
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,320
And-

644
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,320


645
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,320


646
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,320


647
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,360
And within the church of the subgenius, if you can imagine that.

648
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:07,620
Yeah.

649
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,300
I can imagine it.

650
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,080
I've seen it myself.

651
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,140
To put, to use the jargon-

652
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,160
So sad.

653
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,020
Bobbies that decide they're now in the hierarchy.

654
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,060
What they don't understand is there never was a hierarchy and there's not really any

655
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,420
such thing as bobbies.

656
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:29,640
There's a lot of stuff there's not any such thing as, and they, they, they get so worked

657
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,740
up about this stuff.

658
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,300
And then they start treating it like a-

659
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,300


660
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,300


661
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,300


662
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,300


663
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,920
And others like, you know, tools and who, and that everybody gets offended.

664
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,800
And-

665
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,420
Well, you know, it's sort of like there wasn't a such thing as bobbies, but then it's like

666
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:51,140
a self-fulfilling prophecy and people find their, the niche that fits them in their environment.

667
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,100
Well, it's like the word sheeple.

668
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:59,800
It's when somebody starts calling everybody else Bobby, that's the Bobby and the people

669
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,280
that, that, that call everybody else sheeple.

670
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,280


671
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,340
Well, they just sound all alike.

672
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,040
Who's the sheeple?

673
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,100
That's how I got my name.

674
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,000
Huh?

675
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,300
Well, I guess I don't know-

676
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,460
I combined Bobby with, with sheeple and I got bleepo.

677
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,060
See?

678
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,420
That's how, that's how I came up with the name.

679
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,100
I guess they have to come up with a new term for a sycophantic butt kissing toady.

680
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,680
You know, I'll tell you, I'll tell you guys a secret.

681
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,180
I wrote down the name Dr. Strange and then crossed out the doctor.

682
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,260
I'm sorry.

683
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,260


684
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,260


685
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm sorry.

686
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:32,560


687
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:32,560


688
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:32,560


689
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:32,560


690
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,100
I got the doctor and a couple of letters and then looked in the Dallas phone book for a

691
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,740
name that wasn't in there with Stang.

692
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,240
That's, that was it.

693
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,300
Philo, on the other hand, who hadn't come up with a name instantly, just like I did,

694
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,040
just did instantly because that was his name.

695
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,480
Just Philo.

696
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,880
Yeah.

697
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,140
You know what, Dr. Drummond, I want-

698
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,100
Philo Drummond.

699
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,420
I want you to know Dr. Drummond.

700
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,860
It really was just like in the air?

701
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,260
That's how you came up with it?

702
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,260


703
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,260


704
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,260


705
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,260


706
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,260


707
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,680
Well, no.

708
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:14,000
Philo can make up strange but name sounding names just effortlessly.

709
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,780
And I admired that so much.

710
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,600
Remember when we used to give each subgenius a special secret name?

711
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,700
Yeah.

712
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,840
It was too much trouble so we quit doing that.

713
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,900
But Philo whipped out a list of funny sounding names in a minute.

714
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,580
Of course, I was the one who had to write them down.

715
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,140
We put the-

716
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,120
We put together lists several times.

717
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,360
Many, many lists.

718
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,500
Okay, time to- it's time to come up with some more names.

719
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:47,660
Actually, Bleepo actually does come from, much as the church, a lot of, some ideas in

720
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,540
the church of the subgenius came out of a perverted version of the Fireside Theater's

721
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,960
Bozo's stuff.

722
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:55,980
Yeah.

723
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,680
Yep.

724
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,180
Yep.

725
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,960
Because my friend-

726
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,540
There's that O again.

727
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,240
Art and O.

728
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,260
Art and O.

729
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,000
And we were talking about evil clowns.

730
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,920
We were into evil clowns way before evil clowns were a thing.

731
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,020
Oh yeah, me too.

732
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,140
And I have lots of proof of it.

733
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,560
Yeah, exactly.

734
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,120
And so I was doing sort of an evil clown bit.

735
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,840
Oh, it's me, Bleepo the Clown.

736
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,480
Ha ha.

737
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,500
Why weren't you in World of the Future?

738
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,680
Or something, you know.

739
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,040
Yeah.

740
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,920
All because of Ed Gein or whatever.

741
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,680
Right.

742
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,720
So he was an evil clown, you know, that would like murder people or whatever.

743
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,620
And so that was Bleepo.

744
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,220
I had no idea we had something like that.

745
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,220


746
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,220


747
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,220


748
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,220


749
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,220


750
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,220


751
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,020
I didn't know what you were talking about.

752
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,120
I didn't know what you were talking about.

753
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,200
I thought you were talking about the clown.

754
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,600
Bleepo the Clown.

755
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,660
I thought you were talking about the clown.

756
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:34,660


757
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:34,660


758
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:34,660


759
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,820
And then when it came time to come up with my subgenius name, I had another character

760
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,660
who was Mr. Abernathy, the spokesperson for your local power company.

761
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,880
Mr. Abernathy.

762
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,980
And he talked like that.

763
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,840
And so I figured I'd combine Bleepo the Clown with Mr. Abernathy, and then that was Bleepo

764
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,380
Abernathy.

765
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,820
It was just my own thing.

766
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
No one knew about these characters except me.

767
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,480
Yeah.

768
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,360
It was all in my own head.

769
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,280
News to me.

770
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,520
Yep.

771
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:10,320
Is Bob going to kill us for being so plain, blunt?

772
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,800
He's going to kill you.

773
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,240
He won't kill me.

774
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:14,800
Right.

775
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,060
Because I haven't actually gone that far yet.

776
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,980
And I still have the certificate, so he said he's not going to kill me.

777
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,300
He said it, but yeah.

778
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,340
Yeah.

779
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,600
Other people could have bought that certificate several times over.

780
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah.

781
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,340
That's the thing.

782
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,340


783
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,340


784
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,340


785
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,340


786
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,280
They're always up for auction, and you never know about who is in the blind auction, and

787
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,820
they never even tell you when it's yours that's sold.

788
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,420
But that's sort of one of the-

789
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,100
Or how much or how little it's sold for.

790
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:42,960
Yep.

791
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,560
Yep.

792
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:50,240
But so I say that I don't think I have any enemies, but yeah.

793
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,300
They're probably lurking right now, listening to this.

794
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,340
Well, I know I have enemies.

795
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,180
But there's so many-

796
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,160
It kind of runs in the family.

797
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,340
Yeah.

798
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,600
There's so many federal agencies listening right now.

799
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,640
Why?

800
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,680
The FBI, the NSA, the TSA.

801
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,380
Oh, I think they quit on us a long time ago.

802
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,960
I think they got bored with us.

803
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,840
Like all these guys talk about is monster movies and comic books and stuff.

804
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,080
No, they hoover up all that stuff.

805
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,360
They have a big machine.

806
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,540
I was actually in San Francisco when they installed it.

807
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:24,960
Oh.

808
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,320
The telephone company was complicit with us.

809
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,140
But the government said, we need this.

810
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,740
And the telephone company was like, you want me to jump?

811
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,860
How high and how far?

812
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,460
Right.

813
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,040
Yeah.

814
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,580
Spy on all citizens with a giant computer?

815
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,120
Sure.

816
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,240
So they made this-

817
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,480
Yeah.

818
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:42,620
Yeah.

819
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:48,340
They made this network that can hoover data of all the phone calls, all the where they

820
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,200
go, and the metadata that goes along with that stuff.

821
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,040
And they harvest all that stuff for the NSA.

822
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,800
And then they have robots, algorithms that are constantly plowing through that stuff,

823
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,680
looking for things.

824
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Yeah.

825
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,480
But look how mistranslated that stuff usually ends up.

826
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:11,460
I mean, we've all played around with our smartphones to see what kind of gibberish it would translate

827
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,740
our gibberish into.

828
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,180
Yeah.

829
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,020
But they have the power of massive, huge, huge amounts of data.

830
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,780
Even smarter than an iPhone Plus, 6 Plus?

831
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,140
So they don't have to look at an individual to come up with trends that they can then

832
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,380
use to target individuals.

833
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,140
Right.

834
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,380
Yeah.

835
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:30,380


836
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,080
So, do you think the word frop triggers anything?

837
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,440
Probably didn't until just then.

838
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,040
I hope so.

839
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,040


840
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,820
But the word trigger does.

841
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,700
Oh, uh-oh.

842
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,420
No, trigger does.

843
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,220
Yeah.

844
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,560
As soon as you say trigger, oh man, there's like 10 more people listening right now.

845
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,960
Well, but the word before that was frop, so now-

846
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,980
You don't want to say Muslim.

847
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,780
Uh-oh.

848
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,680
Oh, damn.

849
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,060
Goddammit.

850
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,120
Sorry.

851
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,840
Muslimics.

852
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,660
That's what my son and I call those people.

853
00:31:59,660 --> 00:31:59,660


854
00:31:59,660 --> 00:31:59,660


855
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,420
Muslimics.

856
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:06,320
It's kind of a takeoff on someone we know who actually talks that way.

857
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,480
Oh, dear.

858
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,020
Yeah.

859
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,660
Wow, the Captain Beefheart music that you guys can't hear just ended, and I think I'll

860
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,240
leave it off.

861
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,640
You know what?

862
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,500
I'm eating big hunks of chocolate right now.

863
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,340
I'm pals on Facebook with the drummer from Captain Beefheart's Magic Band.

864
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,520
Which one?

865
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,440
Oh, come on.

866
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:27,980
What's his name?

867
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,400
It's-

868
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,920
John French.

869
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,220
John French?

870
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,520
No, the other one.

871
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,660
There's a guy named Art.

872
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,160
Oh, come on.

873
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,520
He's got a name like another name.

874
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
A guy named Art.

875
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,040
Obviously, he's not a good friend, but he's selling the drumheads.

876
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,860
He's selling the drumheads from Captain Beefheart, so if you want the big bass drumhead that

877
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,060
says Captain Beefheart, you can get that now.

878
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,920
Wow.

879
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,240
Yeah, he lives near me, in fact.

880
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,220
I was surprised to see he lives like in North Hollywood.

881
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:53,920
Right.

882
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,520
Well, I was going to say, a lot of people live near you, Bleepo.

883
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,560
Famous people, super famous people.

884
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,900
Well, Chuck McCann told me to live here.

885
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,980
It was actually because of the great voice talent and funny man, Chuck McCann.

886
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,100
He said, Billy, you should live over here.

887
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,780
Here's where you should live.

888
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,920
And he was right.

889
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,240
I live there now.

890
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:21,700
Chuck McCann's film, The Projectionist, was the first time I ever saw found footage

891
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,180
repurposed.

892
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,140
And, you know, he had a little world of the future.

893
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,100
The terrible world of the future and then the wonderful world of the future were two

894
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,000
collages that he built into that movie.

895
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:42,200
That was a huge influence on me as a low-budget editor.

896
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,880
Which movie?

897
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,940
The Projectionist by Chuck McCann.

898
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

899
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,680
I remember that.

900
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,940
It was pretty obscure at the time.

901
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:51,980
Yeah.

902
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,760
And, you know, this was back in the day when you couldn't just rent a video.

903
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,180
Yeah, and you couldn't just get your movie distributed.

904
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:01,780
Right.

905
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:09,200
Yeah, I saw it at some really weird art film porno theater in Dallas.

906
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,620
Right, right.

907
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,520
Because I think there's a breast in it at one point, I think.

908
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,640
Yeah, maybe.

909
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,520
Or there might be.

910
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,000
I can't remember.

911
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,740
Anyway, yeah, that and the movie Head also had a media barrage found footage chop up.

912
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:26,740


913
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,400
And really fractured flickers.

914
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,900
Remember that old show?

915
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,420
Yep.

916
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:33,740
Yep.

917
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,560
Silent movies with all those Jay Ward voices doing shi-e-ko.

918
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,180
I have a copy of a bunch of those.

919
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,860
I have a whole bunch of those.

920
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,340
There's a few people that did that.

921
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,240
Also, the Fireside Theater Jay Men.

922
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,600
Right, Jay Men Forever.

923
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,620
Yeah.

924
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:56,580
That's another one of those pastiches of old footage.

925
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:56,720
Yeah.

926
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:01,000
That they repurposed and did their own soundtrack to.

927
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,880
And it's hilarious.

928
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:03,800
Yeah.

929
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,260
Yeah.

930
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,400
The one that though I had to direct people to is you go on YouTube and you type in Green

931
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:11,880
Boy.

932
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,420
It's hard to find unless you do this.

933
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,780
You type in Green Boy, G-R-E-E-N-B-O-Y, official.

934
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,260
Huh.

935
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,660
And just watch that thing.

936
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,340
It's a takeoff on Dragnet that a friend of mine did.

937
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,640
Oh, oh, okay.

938
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,040
Okay.

939
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,240
I remember the Green Boy.

940
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,540
Yeah.

941
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:36,200
Mike Upchurch co-wrote a lot of the Mr. Show episodes and he was a writer for the Chris

942
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,780
Rock Show.

943
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,360
Wow.

944
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,280
And he's my buddy out here and he is putting together a new thing that I'm helping him

945
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,120
with a little bit with the sound.

946
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,120
And I'm also in a little bit.

947
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,340
But he takes old footage.

948
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,560
I'm not going to say what the new footage is that we're doing that's old footage, but he

949
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:01,480
takes old footage from like an existing TV show or a movie and then he adds contemporary

950
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,360
actors and situations to it and they had dialogue.

951
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,400
So you see this actor having dialogue with, you know, what's his name?

952
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,260
Joe Friday there.

953
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:11,540
Yeah.

954
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,600
Oh, yeah.

955
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,580
In the Dragnet thing.

956
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:19,160
I had a conversation with Joe Friday at Burning Man.

957
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,540
They had a...

958
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,860
There was this camp that had a life-size jacket.

959
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:31,940
Jack Webb photo with a speaker behind it and they were in a tent kind of secretly watching

960
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,420
you and they could hear you.

961
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,740
I walked up and said, hi, Sergeant Friday.

962
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,280
And they would play...

963
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,940
They must have had some device that would cue...

964
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,000
It was like a soundboard.

965
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,320
Yeah.

966
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:51,160
It was a soundboard that would cue up these tapes from Dragnet of Jack Webb lines, you

967
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,640
know, and he'd go, just the facts, ma'am.

968
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:53,840
Just the facts.

969
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,240
Just the facts.

970
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,560
I'd go, oh, the facts.

971
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:55,880
Okay.

972
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,160
Well, we've...

973
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,140
I'm from Church of the Subgenius.

974
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,380
We found our way to this crazy place here and I don't know what's...

975
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,560
You know, LSD is the bomb.

976
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
You know, that kind of...

977
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,080
It just triggered these things that they had some control over.

978
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,000
So it was like a conversation with an AI a little bit.

979
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,980
Well, yeah.

980
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:17,740
This...

981
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,440
What's the point, Mr. Nell?

982
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,640
What are you trying to tell us?

983
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,460
Yeah.

984
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:20,880
What?

985
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,120
There it was.

986
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,740
There you go.

987
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,240
You want to get to the point, Mr. Nell?

988
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,600
What is it?

989
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,420
What are you trying to tell us?

990
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,960
Philo's so good with that.

991
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,320
He could...

992
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,640
Philo could pull stuff up.

993
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,580
Of course, you've been...

994
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,720
Philo, you've been observing K-Rob for years.

995
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,420
K-Rob is the guy that does sound with Dr. Hal.

996
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,780
It was Wednesday, December 24th.

997
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,200
We were working the day watch out of Berkeley.

998
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,880
That guy's incredible at just whipping...

999
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:45,900
All right.

1000
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,200
My partner's Frank Smith.

1001
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,200
Yeah.

1002
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,340
What'd you do, Philo?

1003
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,520
Just type in Jack Webb?

1004
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:52,720
Jack Webb.

1005
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,920
Yeah.

1006
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,320
Just drag that sound board.

1007
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,120
Oh, my God.

1008
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,620
Wow, really?

1009
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,060
That's great.

1010
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:58,920
Yeah.

1011
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,880
I've had a number of them...

1012
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,440
There's several of them came up.

1013
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,580
Oh, my God.

1014
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,260
There's another one.

1015
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,340
Wow.

1016
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,640
I used to do that on the show.

1017
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,360
I'd be on the...

1018
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,240
Sitting there on the show...

1019
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,360
Well, yeah.

1020
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,960
I've heard you do it a million times.

1021
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,120
Yeah.

1022
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,560
They'd say something, I'd pull it up and then I'd play it into the mic from my phone.

1023
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,000
Right.

1024
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,320
Something like that.

1025
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,520
Too bad we're not on a show now.

1026
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,360
I wish I was on a show.

1027
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,700
Yeah.

1028
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:22,700


1029
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:22,700


1030
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:22,700


1031
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:22,700


1032
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:22,700


1033
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,700
I'm getting ready to post the last

1034
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,820
Puzzling Evidence show I was on

1035
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,940
Wow

1036
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,420
That was like two years ago

1037
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,180
On your video?

1038
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,960
On your Roku thing?

1039
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,220
I have a Mixcloud page where I post

1040
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,120
Oh the Mixcloud

1041
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,160
Just Puzzling Evidence shows

1042
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,820
Heck Philo has a TV channel

1043
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,900
I know the Roku

1044
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,400
Yeah

1045
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,080
That's wonderful

1046
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm so glad it's you and not me

1047
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,420
Well here

1048
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,440
This might intrigue you

1049
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:56,920
Because now

1050
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,080
Before we could only host

1051
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,340
10 videos at any given point in time

1052
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,380
So I had to kind of rotate things

1053
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,700
And

1054
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,880
You know

1055
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,520
The content wasn't always as fresh as it could be

1056
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
But now

1057
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,040
I've got

1058
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,940
5 slots

1059
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,620
But each slot can be an infinite number of things

1060
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,540
Good God

1061
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,180
Wow

1062
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,980
Good Lord

1063
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,800
So now I'm just in the process of putting everything that I ever did out there

1064
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,600
And I'm going to be looking for new content before long

1065
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,500
Anyone with a Roku device

1066
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,220
Which costs about 20 bucks

1067
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,200
Can watch

1068
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,460
Subgenius television

1069
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:39,960
Including

1070
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,360
Bulldada movie of the week

1071
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,580
W-E-A-K

1072
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,880
And the great

1073
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,300
St. Joe Riley's archival show

1074
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,500
Hypnotic Eye

1075
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:51,540
Yeah

1076
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:51,760
Hypnotic Eye

1077
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,780
Oh wow

1078
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,600
The new Dobbs film short fest series

1079
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,540
Is on there

1080
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,700
Those are great

1081
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,060
The new

1082
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,240
And then of course the Ministry of Slack

1083
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,400
We have that series out there

1084
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,140
We only have one season so far

1085
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,420
We're going to hope to make more

1086
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,120
Yeah but it's a real TV show

1087
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,660
With a backdrop and a laugh track

1088
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,600
God the laugh track is so great on that

1089
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,580
Yeah pretty funny

1090
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,700
Rev X is

1091
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,620
Do you have that on YouTube?

1092
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,600
Is that on YouTube too?

1093
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,480
It's on my Vimeo channel

1094
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,880
On Vimeo okay

1095
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:26,840
Cool

1096
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,860
Yeah that's better than YouTube

1097
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,000
Vimeo.com slash Philodrummon

1098
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,460
And then just search around

1099
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,400
You'll find Ministry of Slack out there

1100
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,540
But I would suggest you watch them in sequence

1101
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,960
Yeah listeners you don't even have to have a Roku

1102
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,420
You just get on your computer and go to Vimeo and type in Philodrummon

1103
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,360
Cool

1104
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:49,820
And everything that we host on Roku is actually served from that Vimeo page

1105
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,080
Oh

1106
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,940
Oh

1107
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,080
Oh

1108
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,980
That's our server Vimeo

1109
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,820
Hi

1110
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:04,680
Listeners I feel like I should explain a couple of things about our guests tonight

1111
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,260
Actually Lonesome Cowboy Dave was planning to call in

1112
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,800
But I think he felt bad or something tonight

1113
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:19,300
But Reverend Bleepo has been like a creative

1114
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:19,880
Author

1115
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,520
Audio engineer and producer at many radio stations

1116
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,920
He worked with Howard Stern for years and years at that station Stern was at

1117
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,440
I'm not allowed to say that

1118
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,160
I worked at the station that Howard worked at

1119
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,620
Right

1120
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,000
Made very clear to me that I should never ever say I worked with Howard Stern

1121
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,540
Oh

1122
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,020
I remember them mentioning you on the air once

1123
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,560
Or twice

1124
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,620
Several times

1125
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,320
I would work with him but I didn't work with him

1126
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,420
They complained about your patchouli

1127
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:49,680
Okay

1128
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,060
And your

1129
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:57,620
And they knew that you were some kind of a pagan-y woo-woo

1130
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:03,620
You know some you were going to these Starwood things

1131
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,400
By the way did you know Hal was a guest at Starwood last year?

1132
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,080
Dr. Hal

1133
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,600
And he's going to be next year

1134
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:17,240
And he's going to be at X-Day because somebody just donated 700 bucks

1135
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,600
To pay for Hal's plane ticket

1136
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,260
Wow

1137
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,060
To come and go to Starwood

1138
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,520
And his lodging

1139
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,220
That's wonderful

1140
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,400
Because I lost money on X-Day last year

1141
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,800
And I couldn't afford to do the Hal thing

1142
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,640
And the guy that used to help is already on the saucers

1143
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,560
Dr. Dark

1144
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,880
But I did a little fundraiser

1145
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,620
I just said we're really hurting for money to bring in Dr. Hal

1146
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,780
And raised 250 bucks

1147
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,760
And then this one subgenius couple

1148
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,380
I probably shouldn't say who

1149
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,040
But they're at X-Day

1150
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,020
At most X-Days

1151
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,380
And they wanted to see Dr. Hal

1152
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,940
Passed the pressure

1153
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,680
No no it wasn't passed the pressure

1154
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,440
It was a different couple

1155
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,360
Oh yeah I forgot we're on the air

1156
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,540
Yeah yeah I don't want to you know compromise anyone's security

1157
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,400
You don't want to say people's names

1158
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,360
Right

1159
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,640
Or I mean and what if the other subgeniuses find out

1160
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,380
What they sent Stang 700 bucks just for Hal

1161
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,280
What are they going to send me if I play sad?

1162
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,240
So anyway

1163
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,320
I'm sad

1164
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,080
Yes Bleepo here now lives in Hollywood

1165
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,300
And is an actor

1166
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,240
He always wanted to be a cartoon voice

1167
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,000
And he's ended up being all kinds of cartoon people

1168
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:46,220
Well yes I'm still actually trying to break through the cartoon ceiling

1169
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,440
But you worked with what's left of the Fireside Theater

1170
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,240
I know and you know what

1171
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,900
They're

1172
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,120
Yeah it's hard to get a gig

1173
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,120
You'd be surprised

1174
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,300
You'd be surprised at the people that aren't getting cast

1175
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,660
Not that I'm saying I won't get cast

1176
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,220
But

1177
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,660
But it's very very competitive

1178
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,120
It's ridiculously competitive

1179
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,940
And they don't want to hire anybody

1180
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,380
Over the age of 40

1181
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:13,980
Right

1182
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,740
Or the age of 30

1183
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,340
Right

1184
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:15,920
Yeah

1185
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,880
Well my son moved out there

1186
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,340
Even for the voices

1187
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,200
With a degree in film

1188
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,040
From M.A.C.

1189
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,240
And he couldn't get any job

1190
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,320
For a year

1191
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,920
He couldn't get a job delivering pizza

1192
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,660
For a year

1193
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,180
When he finally did get a job

1194
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,280
It was at a really good production place

1195
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,060
But his job was to repair their Macintoshes

1196
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,280
Right

1197
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,420
Thank goodness he knew how to do that

1198
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,300
Eventually he let on that he could edit

1199
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,560
And they let him be an editor

1200
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,800
And then he became a director

1201
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,000
Just before they closed

1202
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,740
And

1203
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,900
And

1204
00:44:51,060 --> 00:45:21,060


1205
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:51,060


1206
00:45:51,060 --> 00:46:21,060


1207
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:51,060


1208
00:46:51,060 --> 00:47:21,060


1209
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:51,060


1210
00:47:51,060 --> 00:48:21,060


1211
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:51,060


1212
00:48:51,060 --> 00:49:21,060


1213
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,260
SUGA

1214
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,120
Coming up next

1215
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,120


1216
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,120


1217
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,820
It's America

1218
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:30,820


1219
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:30,820


1220
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,100
But now

1221
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:32,580
I've got more

1222
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,680
Backs

1223
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,280
Cutting

1224
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,940
Continuity

1225
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,100
Of moment

1226
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:38,900
To the

1227
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,000
workers

1228
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,100
Who're

1229
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,080
Wah

1230
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,660
Are

1231
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:46,780
The

1232
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,340
MU

1233
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:47,340


1234
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,380
Back

1235
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:50,780
In

1236
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:50,860
Our

1237
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:50,940
Time

1238
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:50,940


1239
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:50,940


1240
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:50,940


1241
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:50,940


1242
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:50,940


1243
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:50,940


1244
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:50,940


1245
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:50,940


1246
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:50,940


1247
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:51,040
McMurray

1248
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,040


1249
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,040


1250
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,040


1251
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:50,400
On

1252
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:50,600
Alem지

1253
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:50,640
—Z

1254
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:50,920
Now

1255
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,380
that lived above me.

1256
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,640
And so the apartment would get flooded above me,

1257
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,740
and then my apartment would get flooded,

1258
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,000
including, of course, where the tapes were.

1259
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,180
I've got all the reel-to-reel tapes

1260
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,860
that you ever sent me, Bleepo,

1261
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,700
in my Dobbs shed,

1262
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,520
the climate-controlled special facility

1263
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,940
that I had built.

1264
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,160
Just for my tapes.

1265
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,140
For the rest of my life.

1266
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,880
Just for your tapes and my tapes.

1267
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,860
It has my old reel-to-reel tapes, too.

1268
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,620
And a wall of VHS,

1269
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,520
because that's what we filmed stuff on

1270
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,620
for a long time.

1271
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,020
Yep.

1272
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,700
I threw out all the...

1273
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,100
People don't know what that means.

1274
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:38,380
I think it means very high signal.

1275
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,880
Vehicular hickey salamander.

1276
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,540
It is something like that.

1277
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,860
It's a vertical...

1278
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:47,740
Do I hear...

1279
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,080
It's vertical helical scan.

1280
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,020
Yeah, vertical helical scan.

1281
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:51,780
That's right.

1282
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,120
Do I hear Zandy in the back there?

1283
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:54,920
No, I don't.

1284
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,280
No.

1285
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,520
Oh, I thought I heard Zandy.

1286
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,400
No, I was starving,

1287
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,800
so I came in here to eat.

1288
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,740
No, Zandy's in...

1289
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,000
And there's television in the other room.

1290
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,960
Oh, it sounds like Zandy.

1291
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,040
No, he's in Dallas.

1292
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,300
That's two hours away.

1293
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,800
Oh, okay.

1294
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,680
He's talking about Zandy as my son.

1295
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,520
He's now, like, 40.

1296
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,980
I don't know how my dad felt.

1297
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,720
I'd come in the house,

1298
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,020
hadn't seen my dad in a year,

1299
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,400
and he'd go,

1300
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,180
Ivan, I can't believe my own son's got

1301
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,960
a long gray beard and a beer gut.

1302
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,720
I don't have the beer gut anymore.

1303
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,640
That's good.

1304
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,340
Well, I had a heart attack,

1305
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,900
and I had to completely change my lifestyle.

1306
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,280
Big time.

1307
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,820
Bigly.

1308
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,960
Very bigly.

1309
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,600
One time, my dad looked at me,

1310
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,060
and he looked down at my gut

1311
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,080
and looked up at me,

1312
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,380
and he goes,

1313
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,840
well, you finally gave up, huh?

1314
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,100
Yeah.

1315
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,140
Oh, my God, that hurts.

1316
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,120
Oh, geez.

1317
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,660
Yeah.

1318
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:55,840
Wow.

1319
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,800
You finally gave up, huh, son?

1320
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,500
Listeners, I'm going to do a little bit more.

1321
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,220
Now that we've been recording for over an hour,

1322
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,500
I was going to say who these guys are.

1323
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,580
Dr. Philo Drummond, well, I mean,

1324
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,460
that's a household name,

1325
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,920
but I wouldn't know about Bob

1326
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,280
were it not for Dr. Drummond.

1327
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,860
I wouldn't have this.

1328
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,580
I wouldn't have known his job as sacred scribe.

1329
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,140
I wouldn't have known the word slack.

1330
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,640
Well, yeah, I would have known slack,

1331
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:35,680
but I wouldn't have known about the conspiracy by that name.

1332
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,060
Yeah.

1333
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,260
Yeah, me neither.

1334
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,080
There's a lot of, you know,

1335
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,960
file a new Bob before anybody.

1336
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,400
And here's another weird thing.

1337
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,380
So they say.

1338
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,120
Dr. Drummond is the one who finally got me on the internet

1339
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,900
around 19.

1340
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,600
Ninety four.

1341
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,280
So I'd been hearing all these nerds had been telling me,

1342
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,580
you got to get on the internet.

1343
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,700
It's bulletin boards, bulletin boards.

1344
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,320
I was going, what the hell are they talking about?

1345
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,520
And then you get mailed by computer.

1346
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,860
They were so bad.

1347
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,220
And they were terrible at explaining what it was.

1348
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,720
Believe it or not, the first email I ever got mailed to me

1349
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,300
was from Penn Gillette.

1350
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,260
Oddly enough.

1351
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:19,640
Wow.

1352
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,760
And he was trying to get.

1353
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:20,900
Really?

1354
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,480
To understand it.

1355
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,560
But it was not until Philo,

1356
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,640
who I think by that time lived in Missouri,

1357
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,560
came to my house and he said,

1358
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,660
do you have one of those AOL discs that comes every day in the mail?

1359
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,280
Because this was like 1980.

1360
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,360
No, 19, about 1993.

1361
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,800
91 or two.

1362
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,920
Yeah, 91 or two.

1363
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,400
He goes, and I said, well, yeah, of course.

1364
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,400
And he goes, and he shoves it in my machine.

1365
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:50,740
He doesn't have a whole stack of them.

1366
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,120
He doesn't have 700 of them.

1367
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,680
He doesn't have 700 of them.

1368
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,360
Right.

1369
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:02,260
For the first time, I found myself actually seeing the internet on my little classic Mac

1370
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,400
or whatever I had.

1371
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,280
And the World Wide Web hadn't even been invented.

1372
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,180
No, we had Prodigy and CompuServe.

1373
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,080
Right.

1374
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:20,720
Well, see, first I was on AOL, which at that time, believe it or not, kids, was $3 a month.

1375
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:20,720


1376
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,500
And the general goal of a device for this were people going multimedia attacks.

1377
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:29,500
And I didn't even realize it something real, out of nowhere from Google.

1378
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,180
I called Apple.

1379
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,460
I said, well, what is that thing called?

1380
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:32,160


1381
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:32,820
I said.

1382
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:32,960


1383
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,760
That against me.

1384
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:38,760


1385
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:38,760


1386
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,240
I thought Apple was like, well, if I pay you for this, I'm going to work with you or

1387
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,240


1388
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,520
And funnily enough, I ended up coming back to Google's digital not help me on my way

1389
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:42,520


1390
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:42,520


1391
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:42,520


1392
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:42,520


1393
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,260
What was cool about it though is, first of all, I was going on back fixed wanting

1394
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,320
to use the internet to work at Apple because I only had required г and ug and running

1395
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:50,460
a company.

1396
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:57,340
right and then usenet i i went out and i found some books about usenet and um

1397
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,540
there was a great guy there's a guy named adam told you about it yeah i remember printing out

1398
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:10,780
a whole bunch of stuff on the use right that was the thing it's called alt dot slack right before

1399
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:17,040
we even were there well see that kind of turned me off because it was reams of paper and it was

1400
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:25,160
unedited so it was like you got the previous post reprints over and over and over again and i didn't

1401
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:31,020
understand really what i was looking at there were only four people on the internet then and

1402
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:37,760
okay so yeah but they were all really smart right so different one was one was the fire sign theater

1403
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:45,080
one was bob robert anton wilson was on and robert anton wilson and the residents the residents were

1404
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,860
also there and also uh

1405
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:54,520
i forgot there was frank zappa didn't want to hear about it yeah oh david bowie david bowie was

1406
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,860
the other one yeah so just those well i'm the swedish guy that invented hypertext markup

1407
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:06,900
language or ht oh yeah yeah the swedish the swedish chef yes so yes but it may have evolved

1408
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:14,160
what was his name something anyway it was fine it was after a hundred nerds all those

1409
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,880
bowie and all those other people had tried to

1410
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,480
explain the internet to me it just didn't get through until dr drummond at my house plugged it

1411
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:30,860
in and turned it on and said here's what the deal is and uh yeah within a few months i had

1412
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:39,540
was using uh usenet for all kinds of things uh porn i mean the porno faucet was unbelievable

1413
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,800
even then i think pornography is kind of driven 20 minutes you can get a picture of a naked girl

1414
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,560
yeah to

1415
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:53,640
show up yeah they show up line by line by line right but they were the innovators for multimedia

1416
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:01,780
on the internet was pornography because that's where the money was um and in fact the subgenius

1417
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:09,080
website is on a server that is mostly used for high-end porno things so that's why we're banned

1418
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:16,140
in some hotels and classrooms but just because the the company that we're that we used

1419
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:23,920
it was jesus that set me up with that but anyway yeah it's like i i had to become self-taught

1420
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:31,600
with the internet just as i had to fake my way through when video replaced film

1421
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:39,320
and then of course the internet replaced video we all had to self-educate and move

1422
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:46,720
television what places smell a vision but philo uh was working as an arms dealer for the

1423
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:58,340
internet and he was a real early adapter and it just uh but he wasn't a nerd and so he was able to

1424
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:05,320
make sense of it for me and i thank you for that dr drummond well you're welcome but what you guys

1425
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,400
said was true is true is true is true is true is true

1426
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,320
from pr news in washington i'm tempered by cautionary reminders to

1427
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:34,260
keep it respectful but the sexual path is the only sex path the russian government says 4.72

1428
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:43,340
and 4.16 earlier this year the russian government says it is listening to pr news

1429
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,480
