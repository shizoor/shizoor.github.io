1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
We, the jury, find the defendant guilty.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,060
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,740
No! No! Guilty!

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,680
I'm not me! I'm...

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,820
The Self-Genius Power of Swag!

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,360
Click. Click.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,680
From PR News in Washington, I'm charged with a sex crime against Harvey Weinstein

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,080
and 13 members of a youth soccer team in July of 2006.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,400
President Trump denies all his sexual relationships were consensual.

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,360
Alive.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,080
Forecasters are expecting this month in New Mexico,

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,720
the National Interagency Fire Center says it's expected if a summer hits.

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,780
FBI agents rated PR News.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,740
The Dow 63-14-75-5-24-24-27.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,540
PR is in trouble.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,200
President Trump said you're listening to forcible sexual PR news.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,500
PR News.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,540
10-4, Beanie.

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,840
Head for fear.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,520
Microwaves won't find me here.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,740
I detect a conspiracy smell.

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,260
I want to know who's at the wheel.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,940
Who's at the wheel?

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,680
Who's at the reins?

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,980
Who's the little ring?

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,040
voice inside of my brain

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,720
Starts with a whisper

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,500
ends with a squeal

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,840
I wanna know who's

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,800
at the wheel

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,080
Fidel Johnson

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,900
Mafia spies, I don't really

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,900
think that Kennedy died

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,780
They took him to the moon

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,280
that would be so

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,160
but I'm pretty damn sure that they didn't

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,760
really go

38
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,200
Who's at the wheel? Who's at the range?

39
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,860
Who's that little voice

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,520
inside of my brain?

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,220
Starts with a whisper

42
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,980
ends with a squeal

43
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,360
I wanna know who's

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
at the wheel

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,280
Kenyan Muslims ruin

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,700
our lives, Al-Qaeda camps

47
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,360
drones in the sky

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,380
A man with a mustache

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,700
plotting a deal

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,320
I wanna know who's at the wheel

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,040
My paranoia

52
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,680
is an avalanche

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
When I find out I'm on a crap

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,120
in my pants

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,660
The hard, hard truth

56
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,320
The real, real deal

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,740
God, I fear nobody's at the wheel

58
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,440
Who's at the wheel?

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,040
Who's at the range?

60
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,460
Who's that little voice inside of my brain?

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
Starts with a whisper

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,940
ends with a squeal

63
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,360
I wanna know who's at the wheel

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
Who's at the wheel?

65
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,900
Who's at the wheel?

66
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,040
Who's at the wheel?

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,880
Who's at the wheel?

68
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,480
Who's at the wheel?

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:07,860
Who's at the wheel?

70
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,040
Who's at the wheel?

71
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,460
I wanna know who's at the wheel

72
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,920
Who's at the wheel?

73
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:25,420
The Rainmakers could not be more timely in this day of Russian propelled boogaloo propaganda, friends.

74
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,640
This...

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,920
might be kind of a sad hour of slack because it's not a rerun.

76
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,900
And these are sad times.

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,300
But we try to put the best face on the troubles and that face is of course the Bob face!

78
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,880
We put our Bob smile on.

79
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:53,920
The Dobbshead bandana mask helps if it's in a place crowded with diseased humans.

80
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,340
And we face the future knowing that we're not alone.

81
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,300
We knew all along that the world was ending and only the subgeniuses will be saved.

82
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,420
Oh yes, Bob's promise rings true.

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,120
He said, Bob said in 1953, these prophetic words.

84
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,160
It's gonna be a bummer, man.

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,320
Can anyone say he was wrong in any single detail of that?

86
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,360
It's gonna be a bummer, man.

87
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,000
Prophecy fulfilled.

88
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,780
There'll be lots of music in this episode because there's a long center core of words.

89
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,740
And the music was picked in a thoughtful way to fit the theme.

90
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,820
And about the only music I could think of to perfectly fit the theme was pretty much all by the Rainmakers

91
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,360
plus Jimi Hendrix and some youthful girls and maybe one boy

92
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,400
in a new doctor band called the Sub G Kids.

93
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:05,180
But before we get too real, let's go see a monster movie from the album of that same name by the Rainmakers.

94
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,100
It's as true today as it will be tomorrow.

95
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,100
From 2014, actually.

96
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,520
The Rainmakers.

97
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,400
Well it when time did it get really heavy

98
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,040
What kind of everything was it?

99
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,320
Saying every fireume is the sound of life

100
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:50,960
And that it was each human human being

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,500
When I say John D.

102
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,600
I said we're going to be the first matters we see

103
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,200
The fact that John D.

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,000
is on the same level we're like the aliens

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000


106
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,380


107
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,380


108
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,380


109
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,460
If your soul's for sale, it's all gonna be gone

110
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,960
Pale politicians hiding in religion

111
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,300
Drag us to the ditch, it's all gonna be gone

112
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,720
In our monster movie

113
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,960
These monsters are real

114
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,300
In our monster movie

115
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,500
In our house on the hill

116
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,020
Ain't no salvation in a money nation

117
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,300
Pre gonna eat you, it's all gonna be gone

118
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Dollar bills steeple, all you poor people

119
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,280
Gonna get out, it's all gonna be gone

120
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,420
In our monster movie

121
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,760
These monsters are real

122
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,940
In our monster movie

123
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,360
In our house on the hill

124
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,660
Everything about it is a puzzle

125
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,940
Something presents, we're all puzzled

126
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,780
Nobody believes they will survive

127
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,280
And we're all just a bunch of fools

128
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


129
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,380
But the problem is alive

130
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:33,320
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

131
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:47,420
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

132
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,860
Numb after Trump

133
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,200
In your melodrama

134
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,960
You're the limited

135
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,500
It's all gonna be gone

136
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,860
Jesus ain't a common

137
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,980
Neither is your mama

138
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,020
Close up for the kill

139
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,260
It's all gonna be gone

140
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,240
In a monster movie

141
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,880
These monsters are real

142
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,960
In a monster movie

143
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,320
In a house on the hill

144
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh

145
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh

146
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh

147
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,100
Oh, yes, dear friends, and welcome to Hour of Slut number 1783.

148
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,740
It's not a rerun tonight.

149
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,780
We've done reruns three weeks in a row while America was burning,

150
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,860
and I could probably just keep my mouth shut about all that

151
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,620
because you can't say anything without angering somebody.

152
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:21,760
So let me say that I'm not speaking for the Church of the Subgenius.

153
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,240
This is just yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

154
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,760
and the Subgenius Foundation head office, which is also just me.

155
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:42,500
But it's time to talk about the BLM demonstration in Glen Rose, Texas.

156
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,600
Yes.

157
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:51,660
Which happened just a couple of days ago on June 13th of the year of the conspiracy calls 2020.

158
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,000
Now, before we went to the event, I wrote down some of my ideas

159
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,300
and posted them here and there so as to get even better ideas.

160
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,740
And most of them were just ideas.

161
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,420
But I'm going to set it up by reading the preliminary bit,

162
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,360
and then I'll go through the actual report after it happened.

163
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
And this is what I said.

164
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:25,260
There's a BLM vigil in the town square of our tiny, super-Republican, super-cowboy town this evening.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,160
And boy, howdy, the angry, threatening right-wingers on Facebook

166
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,240
are way outnumbering the earnest teenage girls and old folks who are likely to be on the BLM side.

167
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,980
So I'm going to go and add to the crowd size.

168
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,600
Except for the BLM.

169
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:59,940
Most of the demonstrators in favor of BLM will most likely be not patriopsychotic anarcho-materialists like me,

170
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,440
but earnest Republican Christians.

171
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,280
That's about 90% of the population here.

172
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,460
The other 9% are Democrat Christians.

173
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,720
And then there's the four subgeniuses.

174
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,600
Two of whom are...

175
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,100
technically also Jewish.

176
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,460
Now, I've considered some handmade signs I might bring.

177
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,580
No human lives matter, was my sister's suggestion.

178
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,280
She likes animals, though.

179
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,020
Probably not a good idea, because both sides might shoot me.

180
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,880
And then, of course, there's always slack lives matter,

181
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,320
which would be an even worse idea.

182
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,340
I am going to go down there and check it out, though.

183
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:52,900
I could stand on one side with a gun, yelling and braying at the juvenile jokes,

184
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,920
and then go over to the other side to bend the knee and bow my head,

185
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,980
while holding the gun to my own head and crying,

186
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,100
Why? Why? Why?

187
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,680
That was Philo's idea.

188
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,900
I thought of wearing realistic makeup,

189
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,400
so I'd look like I'd just been...

190
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,640
beat all to hell,

191
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,780
and hold up a sign saying,

192
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,040
Black and Blue Lives Matter.

193
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,840
But again, that would probably get me beat up, for real, by both sides.

194
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,820
They might politely take turns.

195
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,800
After you, demon crap, you go ahead and hit him first.

196
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,060
Oh no, Sir Repuke, I insist you have first go at him.

197
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,180
Well, if you insist.

198
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,900
Have at you, smartass, since you like bruises so much.

199
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,080
Indeed.

200
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,360
How dare he besmirch our serious street fight with mirth and levity.

201
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,320
Yeah, I guess at last we found some common ground.

202
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,320
Beat up the smarty pants.

203
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,040
We could bring the dogs.

204
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,380
Everybody loves dogs, especially Claudia, the boxer pit bull,

205
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,500
who's almost completely black all over, and so lovable.

206
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,440
And she could wear Black Lives Matters.

207
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,940
No, no, no.

208
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,060
That could really be taking the wrong line.

209
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,820
The most common response from dumbasses around here,

210
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,380
to the whole BLM thing, is usually along the lines of,

211
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,600
So you don't think cop lives matter?

212
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,740
You don't think white lives matter?

213
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,320
Why do you bring your hate of your own kind to this nice, peaceful town?

214
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:43,060
The gullible dumbasses are also spreading the probably Russian-originated lie.

215
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,660
Or boogaloo.

216
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:54,760
The lie that violent thug professional looters will be bussed in from the big city in Dallas.

217
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,080
Quite a few people here fall for all that Russian fake anti-thighs hiring propaganda

218
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,120
that they send each other on Facebook.

219
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,680
And Fox math.

220
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,700
My immediate family, friends, is multiracial.

221
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,700
And I personally have had a gun pointed at me by a cop just because I had long hair

222
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,000
and a t-shirt on with a flying saucer on it, which made the cop say,

223
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,260
So you're in a cult?

224
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,480
I've also been chased by rednecks just for having long hair, although that was 50 years ago.

225
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,780
And nowadays, half the rednecks and bikers have long hair.

226
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,580
Incidentally, I don't use the word redneck as a pejorative.

227
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:47,480
It just simply means rural outdoor workers whose necks get red in the sun.

228
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,500
They call themselves rednecks proudly, and I'm half redneck myself.

229
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:59,620
They might also be great historians or writers or musicians or scientists on the side when they're not on their tractor.

230
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,600
And yeah, my neck is only about half red.

231
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,820
I actually did benefit quite a bit from slavery.

232
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:14,980
I was born a little more stained with the sins of my ancestors than most, I'm afraid.

233
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,200
My great-great uncle was Senator Cotton Ed Smith.

234
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,740
Wikipedia had this to say about Ellison Durant Cotton Ed Smith.

235
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,500
He was a Democratic Party politician from the U.S. state of South Carolina,

236
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,800
widely known for his virulently racist and segmented behavior.

237
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,580
He had his own kind of segregationist views and his advocacy of white supremacy.

238
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:48,740
He represented South Carolina in the United States Senate from 1909 until 1944.

239
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,880
At that point, the Republicans and Democrats kind of traded places.

240
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,480
Anyway, that connection might have helped my father get into Harvard Law School.

241
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,260
Also, my mom was the one who came to this little all-Democrat town in the 70s

242
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,080
and convinced them they were all actually Republicans.

243
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,660
But of course, I lived in East Cleveland for 20 years,

244
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:23,200
so at least half the neighbors and the people I worked with had lives that were black and mattered to me.

245
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,820
By the same token, the vast majority of my encounters with police officers have actually been positive.

246
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,840
But I've got to run now because I heard there was going to be a prayer vigil

247
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,620
for cops in the square in about 20 minutes,

248
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,260
and I'm going to go sniff that out on my way to the post office.

249
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,080
Well, friends, that turned out to be fake news.

250
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,000
There was no prayer vigil for cops or any other kind of prayer vigil,

251
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,680
just the usual fruit stands and little tiny farmer's market.

252
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,700
It was all just big talk.

253
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,920
However, there was a Trump-Pence sign on one stand, which was new.

254
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,180
I bought some fresh eggs from a different stand.

255
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,820
The Trump eggs hatch in the middle of the stand.

256
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,380
I was very into little Trumps.

257
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,820
Okay, that was in the morning of Saturday, June 13th.

258
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,300
Then we went to the Glen Rose Black Lives Matter vigil.

259
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,860
And what an anticlimax.

260
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,620
Everything was just as I predicted, uneventful.

261
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,540
Only, actually, it turned out a lot better than I expected.

262
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,720
With a couple of ridiculous exceptions, there was no counter-protest,

263
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,600
no patriot vigilantes with AK-47s.

264
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,220
I counted about 75 friendlies respectfully participating in the peaceful vigil

265
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,200
in the town square, listening to several speakers who were mostly Glen Rose citizens.

266
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,740
It was really touching at times and fairly boring at other times.

267
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,720
It was 7 o'clock in the evening, and the weather was really nice.

268
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,700
Now, strangely, the busloads of hired anti-tankers,

269
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,060
anti-fob, professional looters, and outside agitators

270
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,680
predicted by the skeptical naysayers on the Glen Rose Facebook pages,

271
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,420
they never showed up.

272
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,840
I'm guessing maybe they had a flat,

273
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,720
or maybe they got in the wrong directions and went towards Glen Rose, Arkansas.

274
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:27,100
Not a single flaming trash can was slung through a single storefront,

275
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,040
as was widely predicted.

276
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,680
Now, despite the public restlessness,

277
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,640
and the classrooms being locked,

278
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,500
another threat that scandalized many of the pro-fa people on the local Facebook,

279
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,660
viewed as a harbinger of disaster and a Democrat coup,

280
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,800
it was actually a very peaceful demonstration.

281
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,700
None of the roads were blocked, despite the dire predictions of some BLM critics,

282
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,940
and for some reason, parking was no different than any other Saturday evening in the town square.

283
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,240
But it was just uncanny how a bunch of young and old,

284
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,760
and 90% white, Glen Rose natives were able to gather for an hour

285
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,620
and acknowledge that there are still some pretty serious disparities

286
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,160
due to racial prejudice that need to be addressed.

287
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,360
I guess the anti-fa must have surrendered and run away

288
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,540
due to all the promises by Glen Rose pro-fa conservatives that there would be, quote,

289
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,400
second amendment presence, unquote,

290
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,960
for the safety of this God-fearing town of 2400 people.

291
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,820
To protect it from, you know, the teenagers and boomers

292
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:46,080
talking on a little PA about nature and sustainability and justice and all that stuff.

293
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,300
Now, people who wanted to speak were invited up to the courthouse steps

294
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,280
where there was a microphone on a stand and a PA speaker about the size of a shoebox.

295
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,320
I had to stand practically next to the steps,

296
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,840
just to hear well, but I'm pretty deaf.

297
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,500
And I placed my location recorder near the little speaker,

298
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,520
so I have an okay recording of everything.

299
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,140
Don't worry, I won't force it on the radio audience.

300
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,500
I only really know a few of the folks who were there,

301
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,840
but I introduced myself to some of the organizers.

302
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,340
Since everybody's wearing face masks,

303
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,800
unless they were speaking on the microphone at the time,

304
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,700
it was kind of awkward.

305
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,300
It was awkward.

306
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,920
And it required the occasional lower face reveal.

307
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,260
At one point, I said to somebody,

308
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,680
I recognize the upper half of your face from Facebook.

309
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,680
Now, my buddies on our secret non-Facebook internet club

310
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,540
asked me for a live report.

311
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,600
And I told them the short version.

312
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,120
It was touching and boring both.

313
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,940
A big loud chuck

314
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,800
with Trump banners drove past three or four times, honking.

315
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,380
That was the full extent of conflict.

316
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,580
It scared Princess Wee, though.

317
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,460
And of course, there were lots of good old boys standing around nearby,

318
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,000
just sort of observing.

319
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,620
But nobody was waving guns around or any of that.

320
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,520
Unlike a little town in Ohio,

321
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:26,820
where the locals, the conservative locals,

322
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,980
some of them were convinced that there were paid rioters coming in.

323
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,540
And they actually beat up a whole bunch of the peaceniks.

324
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,800
But at the Glen Rose thing,

325
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,420
there was a preacher and a lot of Jesus and love stuff,

326
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,640
which actually kind of made me tear up,

327
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,280
because there were some really authentic moments that happened.

328
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,660
As I told my buddies,

329
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,800
I've never seen so many attractive ladies of all ages.

330
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,560
In one place in Glen Rose.

331
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,680
Democrats appear to have healthier diets,

332
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,560
judging by the turnout at this.

333
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,400
There were three black people there that I know of.

334
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,620
That's a lot for Glen Rose.

335
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,880
One was a councilman from Arlington

336
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,720
who got on the mic and talked about his experience of racism.

337
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,640
One was a local guy who works at the grocery store

338
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,820
who hadn't heard anything about this demonstration

339
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,380
and just stumbled upon it.

340
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,100
And was flabbergasted to see all these Glen Rose, Texas,

341
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,780
small town rednecks acting like they actually gave a hoot about this stuff.

342
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,820
And he did a little spontaneous statement,

343
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,920
which was good.

344
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,100
One of the organizers and a few participants

345
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,000
were young Latinas or Latinos,

346
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,860
plain old Americans, but not Anglos.

347
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,460
But honestly, for all intents and purposes,

348
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,700
it was an almost all white, all local, 90% Christian,

349
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,420
probably half Republican, small crowd

350
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,020
that basically said,

351
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,700
here we are and this is what we think.

352
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,080
Black lives matter.

353
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,660
And also it would be great if all lives got to be

354
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,760
mattering equally somehow, someday,

355
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,480
or something like that.

356
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,200
Basically, it was supposed to be an anti-fear message.

357
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,440
So, anyway, although there were a few guys in front of me,

358
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,980
in front of some stores across the street,

359
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,880
being sarcastic and fist-bumping occasionally,

360
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,920
there were none of the threatened, open-carry,

361
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Second Amendment biker individuals

362
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
promised by Facebook loudmouth.

363
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,600
Just that one Trump truck that honked.

364
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,960
And somebody revved up their engine real loud a couple of times.

365
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,920
So, the promised Civil War once again failed to materialize.

366
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,060
Instead, corny as this sounds to say,

367
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,580
for one evening, kind of like at Christmas,

368
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,780
the town square was exuding a vibe of love.

369
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,620
And it was pretty cool.

370
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,440
And gave me some slack.

371
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,680
Plus, again, I've never seen so many healthy and attractive

372
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,020
looking ladies in the town of Glen Rose all in one place.

373
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,900
Now, a friend of mine,

374
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,020
who happens to be a Republican,

375
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,900
responded somewhat snarkily to that report

376
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,840
when I posted it on Facebook with pictures.

377
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,120
He said,

378
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,420
Yeah, because of your participation in that protest,

379
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,360
police brutality worldwide has utterly ceased.

380
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,340
Good job.

381
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,560
Well, it actually was Facebook brutality that spurred me personally.

382
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,040
Juvenile jackasses on the internet making threats to scare a 15-year-old

383
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,000
is actually the main reason I went.

384
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,980
This vigil was originally started by a 15-year-old girl.

385
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,220
And boy, did they bully her.

386
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,720
Oddly enough, the bullies didn't actually show up to speak of.

387
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,320
Oh, but today, the people who weren't there are all busy telling each other

388
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,500
that there were only a dozen people at the pathetic vigil.

389
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,260
And it's just the typical blatant lies.

390
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,520
The truth never fits their childish agendas

391
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,700
because the complex is actually not quite as simple as they are.

392
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,420
Another crusty old bastard, Dr. Piss-Off, said,

393
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,300
What? You said there was no cussing? WTF?

394
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,520
To which I said,

395
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:55,700
Not cussing is some liberal's way of letting the supposedly all-Christian apple pie opposition

396
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:03,300
let them be the coarse and vulgar vocabulary-challenged troglodytic louts for a change.

397
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,460
Some time ago, I noticed that four-letter vulgarities had become normal

398
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,940
on everything from news headlines to children's cartoons.

399
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,580
And many youths and boomers alike can't get through a sentence

400
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,120
without using

401
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
Bob?

402
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,420
the way uh was once used.

403
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,660
Of course, cussing is necessary.

404
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,380
But as a contrarian emergentile subgenius,

405
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,500
I've consciously switched over to using only archaic, quaint euphemisms

406
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,060
from my grandparents' era, like

407
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,740
God darn it.

408
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,460
Tarnation.

409
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,720
What in Sam Hill?

410
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,940
Dad blasted.

411
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,580
Con sarnit.

412
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,380
That's just a bunch of hooey.

413
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,700
Et cetera.

414
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,260
Et cetera.

415
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,300
But uh, my favorite response was

416
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,720
one subgenius, Reverend Thorpe, I said, I think, said,

417
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,540
The public restroom's being locked.

418
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,400
They'd infringed on your right to excremeditate.

419
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,920
I would make a big stink about that.

420
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,580
Yeah.

421
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,720
Yeah, man.

422
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,100
Then you're stepping on our religion.

423
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,380
And uh, oh, somebody, one of the critics on the Glen Rose Facebook page

424
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:29,580
sarcastically referred to having accidentally parked in the anti-fa parking lot

425
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,640
with what to him were dramatic consequences.

426
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:38,060
And I thought, the poor guy, he took, he mistook it for the pro-fa parking lot.

427
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,800
Pro-fa!

428
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,600
Where's that word been our whole lives?

429
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,120
And you're welcome to use it.

430
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,840
Anyway, congratulations to the Glen Rose nice folks on a successful event.

431
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,300
And I was glad to half meet a lot of them since half their faces weren't visible.

432
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,420
And uh, here's a little poem.

433
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,880
Uh, just to change the subject.

434
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:12,200
This is uh, from Pastor Prime of the Mutant Mountain Boys band that we see at the devotionals.

435
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,920
There once was a virus from Wuhan.

436
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,800
Infected me while on my futon.

437
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,880
I laid there for weeks while breathing in squeaks.

438
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,880
But healed up by getting my snooze on.

439
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,500
Uh, yes, it is actually terrible.

440
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,060
And now back to our regularly scheduled subgenius programming.

441
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,040
I actually have no idea what that is at this point.

442
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,400
And now this.

443
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,840
Bud Light presents

444
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,280
The Subgenius Power of Slack

445
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,900
Real American Heroes

446
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,740
Today we salute you, real American heroes.

447
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
Don't stay in too long

448
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,500
Or everyone will shout

449
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,980
Finish quickly and come back

450
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,040
Roar!

451
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,380
Roar!

452
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,040
Roar!

453
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,080
Danger!

454
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,760
Teacher...

455
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,920
f******ed

456
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,560
Danger

457
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,960
Teacher....

458
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,440
Danger

459
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,840
prejudiced

460
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,380
Danger

461
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,420
F***

462
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:28,660
Sometimes, you gotta say,

463
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,320
FULL CREDIT!

464
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm, quote, very, very nervous.

465
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,360
I'm so nervous that local health officials are recommending people evacuate.

466
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,360
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs plans to fire four missiles over Japan and into waters around Guam.

467
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:55,460
Japan says it's the first test of a VA's nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a missile.

468
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Congress has been trying for years to make it easier to fire.

469
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,780
Now, the county health department says it's seeing the highest air quality readings it's ever recorded.

470
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,220
For people who are vulnerable.

471
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,340
Vulnerable people include pregnant children.

472
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,120
Children and anyone over age five.

473
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,280
A Denver court has heard from the turkey.

474
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,320
She testified that she groped a former turkey, grabbing her and lifting her turkey skirt.

475
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,880
This turkey says it is unclear whether German turkeys are strained,

476
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:29,120
and Germany has warned its citizens about turkeys after a German turkey was arrested last month in Berlin.

477
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,960
The Dow is 2198, 25, 22, 21, 26.

478
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,160
The turkey says this is PR.

479
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:37,560
News.

480
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,300
Well, I was thinking about Abraham Lincoln and the enemies of the truth.

481
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,880
But I could not tell a Kennedy from a John Wilkes.

482
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,720
Out of my way.

483
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,320
Out of my way.

484
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:07,320


485
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:07,320


486
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,500
Out of my way, hey, out of my way, hot rockin' on recordin' day

487
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,880
And I feel like kickin' a fight with anybody who claims they're right

488
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,800
All the preacher men, the politicians, all the critics and the things they write

489
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:32,080
Out of my way, out of my way, hey, out of my way, hot rockin' on recordin' day

490
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,320
And this is a call to arms, this is a call to hands

491
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,400
This is a call to the voices and the minds of the people in every land

492
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:51,600
Out of my way, out of my way, hot rockin' on recordin' day

493
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,380
And we're takin' the history test of who's baddest and who is best

494
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,920
Lenin the brother, Lenin the sister, Lenin the communist

495
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:27,560
Out of my way, out of my way, out of my way, out of my way, hot rockin' on recordin' day

496
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,520
Waste me one day, want the money in the mattress

497
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,060
Waste me one day, want the money in the mattress

498
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,940
Waste me one day, put your pennies where they go

499
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,740
Waste me one day, nothin' left to believe in

500
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,400
Nothin' left to wait for

501
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,280
And gettin' in to tell the truth

502
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,720
Was like pullin' the wisdom tooth

503
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,020
And though he never would admit it, everybody knew he did it

504
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,760
When he burned down the board and moved

505
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,720
Out of my way, out of my way

506
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,400
And we are the immigrant flock

507
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,040
A ship wrecked on the sea

508
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,740
From the Glymph Rock

509
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,960
From the Monitor and the Merrimack

510
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,140
From the Thresher and the Pueblo and the Titanic

511
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,960
Recordin' day, the money in the mattress

512
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,220
Recordin' day, put your pennies where they go

513
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,100
Recordin' day, nothin' left to believe in

514
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,720
Nothin' left to wait for

515
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,680
Out of my way, get out of my way

516
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,040
Get out of my way, get out of my way, get out of my way

517
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,760
Out of my way, get out of my way, get out of my way

518
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,220
Get out of my way, get out of my way, out of my way

519
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,420
Out of my way

520
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,420


521
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,420


522
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,440
Out of my way

523
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:40,900
Out of my way

524
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,520
Out of my way

525
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:42,900
Out of my way

526
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,100
Out of my way

527
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,100


528
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,760
Out of my way

529
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,240
It's all a lie

530
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,540
We're being lied to

531
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:03,380
every day every day we think that we have all the answers we don't have all the answers

532
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:15,680
they won't give us the answers so how are we supposed to live our lives how are we supposed to live our lives

533
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:36,640
I love you Disney boys you are the answer to my problems all the misinformation all I need is real people in my life authentic people who have opinions who are not sheeple

534
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,420
sheeple

535
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,620
sheeple

536
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,220
sheeple

537
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,620
They're out there, Miss Pucci.

538
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,820
They are.

539
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,460
They are.

540
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:50,900
They are.

541
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,460
And they just keep adding lines and lines and lines.

542
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,680
And for what?

543
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,260
Are they pussy?

544
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,640
I mean, like, I'm like, to keep us under your thumb.

545
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,720
Oh, I know.

546
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,100
Right?

547
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:07,800
Right?

548
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,840
Because if they told the truth, they do.

549
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
There would be an uprising.

550
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,500
And kind of, there already is.

551
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,060
You know?

552
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,100
All the time was this or that.

553
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,260
Because we're kept in the dark.

554
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,180
How many times do we not hear something that's out there?

555
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:29,340
We only hear of these cases because someone was there to witness it.

556
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,060
How much is really being kept from us?

557
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,520
We're never going to know.

558
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,020
The Book of Secrets.

559
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,980
Yes, they have all the answers to all the questions with all the scientific data to back it up.

560
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,820
You know what?

561
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,160
I just figured out the answer.

562
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,940
We just got to find a way to fuck Bo Gates.

563
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,540
He'll tell us everything.

564
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,740
I didn't know.

565
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:05,760
That was It's All a Lie, an excerpt from Freedom of Speech by High Priestess Pucci and Reverend Katana 007,

566
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,680
who formed the band Sub G Kids with Reverend Negative.

567
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,780
That's Cyra.

568
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:18,020
The Reverend-laden Danger song earlier was also by the Sub G Kids,

569
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,800
who, if I understand correctly, were streaming that on video also while they performed it.

570
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:34,120
And in between, the PR news of Lemur and the song Reckoning Day by the Rainmakers from the 70s.

571
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:42,100
But now, well, I play this long Jimi Hendrix song every five years or so,

572
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
just in case nobody's...

573
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,340
heard it.

574
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,960
It's probably been ten years.

575
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,040
It's still considered one of the best guitar solo songs ever done.

576
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,040
The song Machine Gun by Jimi Hendrix.

577
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:02,560
And this is the famous Fillmore East New Year's performance that was on the main band of Gypsy's album.

578
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,440
Happy New Year, first of all.

579
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,380
We have about a million or two million more of them.

580
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,600
If we can get over the summer.

581
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,860
We have to dedicate this one to such a draggy scene that's going on.

583
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,600
All the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York.

584
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,280
Oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam.

585
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,520
Had to do a thing called Machine Gun.

586
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,840
Machine Gun by Jimi Hendrix.

587
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:34,840


588
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:34,840


589
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:34,840


590
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,540
It's a great song.

591
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,340
It's a great song.

592
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,540
It's a great song.

593
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,280
It's a great song.

594
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,800
I think it's going to..

595
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,700
Không...

596
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:11,900
I think it's going to..

597
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,560
It's a great song for someone who's arranging stuff a lot.

598
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:12,560


599
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:12,560


600
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:12,600
I think it's going to be..

601
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:12,600


602
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:12,600


603
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:12,620
Almost, just at the edge of wäre.

604
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:12,720
Right.

605
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,260
Just at the edge.

606
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,000
guitar solo

607
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,720
guitar solo

608
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,060
guitar solo

609

guitar solo

610
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,340
Well, I pick up my axe

611
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,000
and fight like a farmer, you know what I mean?

612
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,740
Hey!

613
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,100
And your bullets keep

614
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,260
knocking me down

615
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,900
guitar solo

616
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,500
guitar solo

617
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,760
guitar solo

618
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,260
Hey! I pick up my axe

619
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,280
and fight like a farmer, now

620
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,940
Yeah, but you still blast me down

621
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,120
guitar solo

622
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,700

626
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,840
The same way you shoot me down, baby

627
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,240
guitar solo

628
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,760
guitar solo

629
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,620
You've been going just the same

630
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,620
three times a day

631
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,460
guitar solo

632
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,420
And you're on such a plane

633
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,120
guitar solo

634
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,400
Hey!

635
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,060
For sure

636
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,620

black

664
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:30,720
Yeah

665
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,340
That's what we don't wanna hear anymore!

666
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,920
No bullets

667
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,840
dirty gear

668
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,640
no playful

669
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:59,260
Your time has come to rock the ages

670
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:04,340
Your time has come to burn the fields

671
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,380
Strain your mold and tear the pages

672
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,120
Tune your drum, your time has come

673
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,540
Standing on a mountain underneath a clear starry sky

674
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,160
Digging for an old gold record in the coal hillside

675
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:34,620
Your time has come to wrestle angels and capture one

676
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,360
Your time has come

677
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:47,980
Your time has come to claim the quarters

678
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,880
Raid the port, seize the flag

679
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:59,240
Storm the ramparts, cross the waters

680
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,920
Steal the guns, your time has come

681
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,920
Hoping and wishing and praying for a clean escape

682
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,360
Your time has come

683
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,800
From the worn out, torn out, burned out same old ways

684
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,940
Your time has come to kill the giant

685
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,820
The Bible hum, your time has come

686
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,260
Salamander's

687
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,740
Vanging at a rhythm on a jiffy-fifty-gallon drum

688
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:59,600
Yee-Yeh

689
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,800
Whoop!

690
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,120
Woo!

691
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,020
Dat videos are कลhao

692
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,600
Then now is the time to come

693
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,640
Your time has come!

694
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,340
To Kill The Which?

695
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,400
To rock the ages

696
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,320
Run, child, run

697
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,000
Your time has come

698
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,980
Your time has come

699
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,580
Your time has come

700
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:10,320
Your time has come

701
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:40,320
Your time has come

702
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,320
Your time has come

703
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,380
You're gonna leave that flag behind

704
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,900
So long, Johnny Rev

705
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,000
Johnny Rev, whoa, whoa

706
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,860
Johnny Rev, goodbye

707
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,760
Hey, Johnny Rev

708
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,680
Where did the wind blow

709
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,960
All your courage

710
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,940
All your nerve

711
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,320
Tied up

712
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,100
And your parents arise

713
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,880
