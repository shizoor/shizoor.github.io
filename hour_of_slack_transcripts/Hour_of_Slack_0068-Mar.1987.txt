They named the pathway over and over again.
I was driving the Chrysler and Bob was on TV.
The day that my boy got kicked by a mule.
I was with Cousin Junior for DNA back farm.
I was drunk, I was lonely, I was wild.
And I was drinking Budweiser and Bob was on TV.
Drinking Budweiser, watching Bob on TV.
Swallowing red wine, they mocked me all day.
We named the pathway over and over again.
I was drinking Budweiser.
Budweiser, and Bob was on TV.
I was drinking Budweiser, and Bob was on TV.
Okay, that was kind of leading into the next show.
That was Drinking Bud and Watching Bob by Buck Naked.
Reverend Buck Naked, that is.
Oh, yeah!
Thank you so much for playing Buck's Mighty 45 there.
You bet. It's got another side, too.
I might get that on next week.
That's a...
It was helped written by a friend of mine.
That's a sexy song.
Oh, man.
Fly Killers.
Let's go!
Oh!
This is a test of the emergency broadcast system.
The broadcasters of your area, in voluntary cooperation with the FCC and other authorities,
have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency.
If this had been an actual emergency, you would have been instructed where to tune in your area.
For Bob.
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted.
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated adoption.
And recorded on dial 126.

Copyright 1986 by the Subgenius Foundation and the participants.
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.
We subjected it to careful editing.
You are about to participate in a great adventure.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
Welcome dear friends.
When will you leave?
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
The time doesn't ever see its father in no way.
Yeah.
Now the dead cat.
Hold the knot.
Yeah.
Again, Matt.
And do you know what happened?
And do you know what happened?
And do you know what happened?
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.
Well, I'm afraid of God.
God put money in that empty purse. Don't ever let it be broke again.
You do what you do because you want to.
I do what I do because...
Because Bob...
Bob told me to!
You got a piece of that.
You can't do that to me.
Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.


Well, dear friends.
I had considered revealing to you all the plot of the subgenius movie treatment.
But, uh, I don't think I'm going to do that this week because that takes some preparation
and sound effects and music and so forth.
And I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.
Instead, we're going to study this essay by Dick Sutphin called The Battle for Your Mind, a pretty well-done study of persuasion and brainwashing techniques being used on the public today.
And the author, Dick Sutphin, is a professional hypnotist, and I believe if he's the same person I'm thinking of, I believe that he's also a musician who sells a lot of kind of laid-back tapes in the new age category.
But in a way, this essay shows you that just like with other movements,
the new age isn't all bad.
And he talks here about the birth of conversion.
Conversion, he says, is a nice word for brainwashing.
And any study of brainwashing has to begin with a study of Christian revivalism in 18th century America.
Apparently, Jonathan Edwards actually accidentally discovered the technique.
During a religious crusade in 1735 in Northampton, Massachusetts, by inducing guilt and acute apprehension and by increasing the tension, the, quote, sinners, unquote, attending his revival meetings would break down and completely submit.
Technically, what Edwards was doing was creating conditions that wipe the brain slate clean so that the mind accepts.
New programming.
The problem was that the new input was negative.
He would tell them, you're a sinner.
You're destined for hell.
As a result, one person committed suicide and another attempted suicide.
And many others found that although they thought they'd achieved salvation, they were obsessed with a diabolical temptation to take their own lives.
Now, friends, they have considerably modified that technique.
And they're not going to change it.
Since then.
Bob's
What did you say, Bob?
I said, good Lord.
What to lose?
A little time.
Hurt your ego a little bit, baby.
Probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now.
So that's no big deal.
So why not?
So why not?
Why not make a new beginning in your life and see what will happen?
I don't know. You don't know.
And you will never know.
You have signed the application.
You do have the kit.
None of those things are important.
But there is a point in your life when you've got to just stop talking about it.
And when you've got to stop worrying about what your friends and neighbors and relatives and uncles and aunts and sisters and brothers and everybody else is going to say about it.
Because nobody else is going to pay your bills for you.
Why not?
You don't know.
And you will never know.
And who knows?
Just maybe.
Just maybe.
You could have one of the biggest...
I don't know.
But even more important, you don't know.
You will never know.
You will never know.
Just maybe.
You're in for a new and exciting experience.
You have signed the application.
Well, have you got your pipe through the mail?
Have you got your pipe through the mail?
Friends, attention all musicians.
You're invited to write or phone for information about the Musicians National Hotline Association,
a non-profit organization that helps musicians find bands and helps bands find musicians and gigs.
Write to the Musicians National Hotline Association, Box 7733, Salt Lake.
Utah, 84107.
Or phone 801-268-2000.
I can't believe there's musicians trying to find bands.
There's so many bands out there.
It's ridiculous.
Once again, that number to write if you're looking to connect up with a band is Box 7733, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84107.
Or phone 801-268-2000.
Very close to the Good Sex for Mutants dating service sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius at no cost to us.
And only to dear cat lady up there in Utah.
And girls, you need to join the Good Sex for Mutants dating service.
We'll give you the number to write at the end of this broadcast.
Notice I didn't say boys because, well, there's too many boys in the Good Sex.
There are a lot of boy and men in the Good Sex.


And the girls, I think they don't need the Good Sex for Mutants dating service.
But you might get something out of it.
You don't know whether you need it or not.
Hoo!
The whole world is going crazy.
We're not against it.
And so let's move on to the message.
The techniques and stagings will vary from church to church.
Many use speaking in tongues.
To generate catharsis in some while the spectacle creates intense excitement in others.
And it's becoming more and more sophisticated as professionals come into the market for brainwashing.
A man in Los Angeles is designing, building, and reworking a lot of churches around the country.
He tells ministers what they need and how to use it.
And this man's track record indicates that the congregation and the monetary income
will double if the minister follows his instructions.
He admits that about 80% of his efforts are in the sound system and lighting.
And dear friends, these conversion techniques, I mean, frankly, what I'm about to tell you
is our secrets of how the Church of the Subgenius works, just like any other mind control cult.
We have studied these techniques non-professionally.
Not like your Falwells and your Criswells.
We're working strictly from an intuitive basis.
And also we admit what we're doing, which is what I'm doing right now.
Subgenius mind control gone out of control.
They handed me this jar and said my brain was in it.
And then when the police came, they poured it down the sink.
Bob?
Bob?
Bob?

The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind
every time you say, see, hear, or think.
Bob?
That's your key phrase.
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.
We are controlling transmission.
Among the conversion techniques mentioned,
the meeting or training takes place in an area
where participants are cut off from the outside world.
This may be any place, a private home, a rural or remote setting,
or even a hotel ballroom where the participants are allowed
only limited bathroom usage.
In human potential trainings,
the controllers will give a lengthy talk about the importance of
quote, keeping agreements in life, unquote.
The participants, they're told that if they don't keep agreements,
their life will never work.
The real reason for the agreements is to alter internal chemistry,
which generates anxiety and hopefully causes at least a slight malfunction
of the nervous system, which in turn,
increases the conversion potential.
Since the importance of keeping agreements is so high on their priority list,
the converts will then twist the arms of everyone they know,
attempting to talk them into attending a free introductory session
offered at future dates by the organization.
The new converts are zealots.
In fact, the inside term for merchandising,
the largest and most successful human potential,
is zealot by zealot.
Ah, yes, dear friends, so true, so true.
We will control the vertical.
Kill, kill, that.
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels
and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.
Then we dip them in the sacred water.
And what exactly does this do for them?
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned
and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,
the imprinting of the true subgenius.
Materialize.
The Reverend Janor Hypercleets from Little Rock, Arkansas,
tried to make it all a little clearer to me
with his own explanation of his conversion into the church of the subgenius.
They said this jar was my mind and then they poured it down a sink.
Run that by me again. I don't know. What do you mean?
They said your mind is in this jar and then they poured it down the sink.
Can you go into a little more detail?
Well, Bob is the original church that sanctifies the worship
and launching of bodily parts of golfers.
A schedule is maintained that causes physical and mental fatigue.
And this is mainly accomplished by long hours in which the participants
are given no opportunity for relaxation or reflection.
One of the most successful human potential seminars
forces the participants to stand on a stage in front of the entire audience
while being verbally attacked by the trainers.
A public opinion poll shows that the number...
one most fearful situation an individual could encounter
is to speak to an audience.
It ranked above window washing outside the 85th floor of an office building.
Friends, and now I can tell you from personal experience that that is true.
That was the big fear I had to overcome in order to be a half-decent subgenius preacher.
Um...
So you can imagine the fear.
The fear and tension this situation generates within the participants.
Many faint, but most cope with the stress by mentally going away.
They literally go into an alpha state,
which automatically makes them many times more suggestible than they normally are.
Another loop of the downward spiral into conversion is successful.
The fifth clue that conversion tactics or brainwashing is being used to control the brain
is the introduction of jargon.
And friends, as you well know, we subgeniuses are experts in jargon.
New terms that have meaning only to the insiders who participate.
Vicious language is also frequently used purposefully to make participants uncomfortable.
And here's where we differ, friends, from the New Age and the Christian cults and so many others.
And the money-making cults, friends.
The money-makers.
The final tip-off is that there is no humor in the communications,
at least until the participants are converted.
Then, merrymaking and humor are highly desirable
as symbols of the new joy the participants have supposedly found.
Cult gatherings or human potential trainings are an ideal environment to observe firsthand
what is technically called a new joy.
And this is what we call the Stockholm Syndrome.
This is a situation in which those who are intimidated, controlled, or made to suffer
begin to love, admire, and sometimes even sexually desire their controllers or captors.
But let me inject a word of warning here, says Dick Sutphin.
If you think you can attend such gatherings and not be affected,
you are probably wrong.
He describes a situation where a woman who was a trained psychologist
was sucked into a voodoo cult.
We got puppet boy!
Oh, feels so good!
Dear friends, you know,
as we said last week,
if we can't raise $40 million by 1988,
then our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, is going to die of AIDS.
And friends, you can call this station
and talk to the very will of Dobbs itself
at 823-7490 or 828-9500.
Come on, call in. We dare you.
Go ahead. Ask questions.
What's going on here?
And, you know, I can't guarantee what kind of an answer.
What you ought to do is put headphones on and listen closer to the show.
But that number to call, well, they're already calling the will of Dobbs.
That number to call is 823-7490 or 828-9500.
And friends, you don't want to let Bob die of AIDS.
Pledge that $40 million quick.
Listen to this beautiful Chinese music.
Oh, yes.
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation
to provide programs which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.
There is absolutely no other possibility.
Hee hee hee.
But don't you see you'd be doing exactly what you say you're fighting, killing, using force because you're certain you're right.
But it wouldn't be the same thing because we'd be advocating nothing, forcing nothing.
Now, there are many strong men in the world today fighting for tolerance, compassion, wisdom,
for your right to be different, to be wrong even.
They wouldn't be tough.
Only the dogma could be infallible.
Trying to play God.
You just can't do that.
Why not?
If God's too busy.
Who's to say that it's not his will, that we're not his agents?
I had to learn about Bob on the street.
Yeah, well, you couldn't start your car.
That's it.
You're here to prevent the putrefaction.
But this putrid world only tells that we're not doing our job.
This is Sister Chris from Dixie.
WFMU in New Jersey.
The half hour of slap show.
Absolutely correct.
On the ball.
All the time.
This is WFMU FM East Orange.
No, it's not.
It's KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.
And has just presented half hour of the subgenius cassette program.
Courtesy of the...
The subgenius foundation.
Yes, a real organization.
Disorganization.
The particular tape we heard was media barrage of an undetermined number.
Also known as subgenius intro.
The address, in case you'd like more information, is post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.
Great.
Here is the subgenius foundation.
Thank you, Sister Chris.
I am Sister Chris.
And I present the subgenius program each week here at Monday from midnight to approximately
1230.
And, dear friends, tonight I wish to speak to you about the word, yes, the word O Bob,
that manifests itself in many ways in blatant, outright, and rogue subgenii.
Yes, you know that.
The power of Bob's word seeps into and or blasts through conspiracy programming with truth and gut-blasting humor.
It virtually takes over your life, twisting and turning you so that you can leap with ease onto the luck plane and glide along so that you can enjoy the yakutisma.
Not to be confused with the yakutisma.
Yakutisma.
Along the full creature comforts of slack.
Now the only thing that matters is now.
The eternal present moment always subject to change.
And it naturally follows that the word of any subgenius is subject to change.
In other words, what a subgenius says becomes the gospel truth for that moment.
Anything said after that, even a contradiction, replaces the power of the previous truth.
You know what I mean.
No?
Well, in the words of Bob.
I always lie, and I'm always right.
Music is another way the powerful force of Bob's transferable tongue enters the game.
It's very much like the reversible blades on the Popiel Vegematic.
Bob's tongue dices, slices, julians, and even cuts through titanium steel vault doors.
When you combine the vocals inspired by Bob with musical talent and or ineptitude inspired by Bob, you've got anti-music.
A concept able to leap conspiracy categories with a single bar or drone.
You listeners out there, you WFM new listeners, being the erudite lowlife scum that you are, can spot most conspiracy music a mile away.
But don't be deceived.
Just because an artist or group, not a marching band, has a recording contract with a major label, or they may have attained a certain level of success or at least recognition,
that doesn't mean they're not a part of the music industry.
That does not mean that they are a conspiracy sanctioned group.
They are...
There are some subgeniuses in places of power, in record companies and publications.
How else do you think the book of the subgenius got published?
By the way, the book, which was formerly published by McGraw-Hill, has been picked up by another publishing house for the word to come.
Anyway, the message of Slack is more important than any image projected or perceived.
Hell, it's more relative than Einstein ever thought.
Oh, we love you, Sister Kris. We're in love. We're in love.
Hoo-ah!
So true.
sucky
in the

well



yeah
yeah

I'll say it again
In the land of the free
Use your freedom and joy
Your freedom and joy
In ancient Rome
There was a poem
About a dog
Who found two bones
He picked the one
He licked the other
And one in circles
He peed his own death
Freedom and joy
What you got
Freedom and joy
No more a sense of shame
But really a demand for recognition
As a form of life
And God's judgment
Is going to come and fall again
Upon a godless, Christ-rejecting,
Blasphemous society
Well, if this sounds
Paranoid, you're right
But I think I have good reason
To be paranoid
It's a strange world
Out there
This is what life is like
At a bottom line level
And I'm not going to make you
Cut through a lot of other stuff
To get through it
Here's what it is
There's no gimmick about that
It's straightforward
It's strong
And it's elemental
Heavy stuff
A world of
Witchcraft
Rudin
Devil worship
A wild, gnawing
Animal hunger
Will grow in you
If you call 823-7490
823-7490
And talk to the will of God
Throughout the years
Thank you
You're welcome
Further we get into
Um
The decognition process
Very important to brainwashing
Step one is alertness reduction
Which I think, personally
That most large companies use
The controllers cause
The nervous system to malfunction
Making it difficult to distinguish
Between fantasy and reality
This can be accomplished
In several ways
Poor diet is one
Watch out for those brownies
And Kool-Aid
And the other thing is
The sugar throws
The nervous system off
More subtle
Oh, and friends
Some of you will be quite
Familiar with this
More subtle is the
Spiritual diet
Used by many cults
They eat only vegetables and fruits
Without grounding of
Grains, nuts, seeds, dairy products, etc
An individual becomes mentally
Spate
Inadequate
Sleep is another primary way
To reduce alertness
Especially when combined
With long hours of work
Or intense physical activity
False slack in so many forms, friends
Programmed confusion
Where you're deluged
With new information
Lectures, discussion groups, and so forth
And at the same time
The controller bombards
The individual with questions
And step three is thought-based
Stopping
Techniques are used to cause the mind
To go flat
These are altered state of consciousness
Techniques that initially induce calmness
By giving the mind something simple to deal with
And focusing awareness
The continued use brings on a feeling of elation
And eventually hallucination
The result is a reduction of thought
And eventually, if used long enough
The cessation of all thought and withdrawal
From everyone and everything
Except that which the controllers direct
The takeover is then complete
Oh yes, friends
Isn't it so cosmic and wonderful
To achieve the cessation of desire
The cessation of thought
Where you can just let the godhead
Make your decisions for you
And if it just so happens that
Some powerful individual
Some charismatic person
Like for instance
Reverend Ivan Stagg
Is given the permission by your brain
To make your decisions for you
Then isn't that just fine?
And oh, we have so many techniques for this
And we subgeniuses once again have
Hey!
I can't seem to brainwash those dogs
Through subversive measures
Devo passes on the word of Bob
By the name of the godhead
And I, uh, we
If you take a look at our last album cover
His name's been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines
Of each of the band members
Right next to the word sex
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex
Bob put money in that empty purse
Don't ever let him be broke again
You do what you do cause you want to
I do what I do cause
Cause, cause Bob
Bob told me to!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Uh, they'll also tell us about the mysterious
J.R. Bob Dobbs
Who, as I understand it again
Is the high muckety muck
Of the church of the subgenius
Uh
Hello Bob
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived
Perhaps you've been deceived by
by evangelists masquerading as angels of light.
I got this weird thing, you see.
You know how people often get reincarnated into this material plane,
no matter how hard they try?
Yeah, yeah, man.
I must have committed suicide 300 times,
and I keep ending up in the same lifetime
in a slightly different observational universe.
And I have to talk to you guys because...
Yeah, man, that's really heavy.
Yeah, it's deeper than I can handle.
Whoa, just slow it down a bit.
I keep being born on October 21st, 1952,
and I end up going through the same lifetime.
Oh, well, okay, your problem is you've got a bad case of the 50s.
I've seen it.
That grassy knoll just went around the country shooting people.
There were 10 people there shooting that looked just like Terry Thornley.
Got it, dead center.
Terry Thornley!
Some people use fake names in this tree.
They hide behind a pseudonym.
They're afraid the conspiracy is going to come after them.
Just because the conspiracy gets their address,
well, fine.
Friends, I'm the one who's got access.
Me and only one other person on this whole planet,
someone else,
has access to the identity codes for all of you,
all the listeners of this show.
Cue night of slight shooting tape.
Um, one of these techniques would be marching.
Yes, we get the bobbies out there marching along in a great parade.
Another one is meditation.
Oh, it's so laid back.
Get them into a fixed alpha state.
And which isn't always bad.
But then we begin to rather than,
I mean, we could call it Nirvana,
but instead we begin to fill in the blanks left by the meditation.
Don't you see?
They said this jar was my mind and then they poured it down a sink.
You can't use your brain to think about it.
You can't use your brain.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!


Ah!
Ah!
And they are shooting each other because of a new prize.
Fuck the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.
Number of a man.
His number is six hundred three score and six.
Jehovah one.
Neil Gu budgets.
Cosmetic is a christian welfare mes Naomi ska cant such a mustache ug understand is six
zero twenty dollar request for a person So just think about this.
We probably know most in the rest of material we've thrown give me false Jump
God can use you individually and collectively to begin to address and deal with those problems.
You have signed the application.
Welcome aboard.
But one doesn't listen long before a little warning signal goes off inside that says, watch out.
Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error.
But the language, the pure language of heaven is missing.
Something says, look out, this guy is fishy, cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English, but soon they're rattling off in a completely unknown language.
When they haven't even been to kindergarten spiritually.
We eat more, drink more, play more and do less.
Start.
We earn a good living than any other people in history.
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music.
And I might add a lot of it's worse.
The cultists would have no following.
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically for more.
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know.
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debauchery, the cruel and tortious executions,
it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.
There are little eyes upon you and they're watching night and day.
With a vocal and activist minority ready, apparently to burn the bomber's field of fear for more.
And most incidentally are in their teens or their twenties.
And that's washing people.
I'll tell you that.
They dwell in caves, not high rise apartments.
They may not have found the key to affluence, but they found an endless supply of dope,
uninhibited sex, an endless supply of money.
Free access to a distillery, I suppose.
Ah, yes, the harvest.
You can count on that.
Or the field.
For more.
My friends, we could feed another man.
We could feed another nation with our garbage.
What more than a space hogger on Earth is the church of subgeniuses?
I don't know.
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?
Bang.
Are you blaming God for atom bombs, atomic warheads?
Don't.
I don't know.
I only know that it will signal the end of time.
Why?
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
The past blotted out, and the future assured.
Ah, yes, the harvest.
This is the way they did it in the New Testament.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
Dear friends.
And you can write for more information about Jeff and his wife, and you can write for more


information about the church of subgeniuses.
I'm going to be giving that P.O. box.
And that's what you really need to do is write for information because what we have in print
is at least equal to, if not completely surpassing of what we do on the radio.
That may not impress all of you, but what the heck, you know what I mean?
And that P.O. box to write to is bob.com.

Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.
75214.
Ah, yes, Bob started here in Dallas, and that just figures because Dallas is, you know,
I don't care what they, as much as I hate this city, as far as I'm concerned, it is
every bit the equal of every other big city I've been to, which includes Paris, London,
and Peking, dear friends.
And, you know, in other words, life is sorry just about everywhere you go unless you got
a bunch of damn bob in your life.
See?
That's the whole thing.
You got to get some of that bob in your life, and half of you already got a bob in your
pocket.
You don't even know it.
Oh, yes.
So why don't you call the Will of Dobbs here at 823-7490 or 828-9500.
I'll see you next time.

Maybe we'll just send that guy back.
That's a pretty good thing.

That's much better.


So here comes stuff, I gotta say.
Now, how are you guys doing?
How are your anchors doing?

I can catch you there with the electric hitchhiker.
We are back!
OK opposition just showing people.
Got it, man?
Yeah.
I think it's something that, uh...
Parified.
And the third thought-stopping technique is chanting.
Such as, for instance, friends speaking in tongues
could also be included in this category.
And so we find, Dick Sutton says,
that, uh...
Um...
The people most susceptible to mass movements
would probably be about a third of the population.
What Eric Hoffer calls true believers.
They are joiners and followers.
People who want to give away their power.
They look for answers, meaning, and enlightenment
outside themselves.
Hoffer calls these people
eternally incomplete
and eternally insecure.
Oh.
All praise Bob.
And if it's not for those Bobbies,
how I'd have to go out and get a real job.
And never underestimate the potential danger of these people.
They can easily be molded into fanatics
who will gladly work and die for their holy cause.
It's a substitute for their lost faith in themselves
and offers them a substitute for individual hope.
Hitler's brown shirts were true believers.
Yes.
The moral majority is made up of true believers.
All cults are composed of true believers.
You'll find them in politics, churches, businesses,
and social cause groups.
They are the fanatics in these organizations.
And, uh, of course, you have to throw in a common hatred,
of course, friends.
An enemy or a devil is essential to the success of mass movements.
Hitler's devil was the Jews.
Hitler's devil was the Jews.

And Christians have Satan himself, but that isn't enough.
They've thrown in the occult, the New Age thinkers,
and anyone who opposes their integration of church and politics.
Um, in revolutions, the devil is usually the ruling power or aristocracy.
The conspiracy, in other words, dear friends.
Some human potential movements are far too clever
to ask their graduates to join anything,
thus labeling themselves a cult.
But if you look closely, you'll find that their devil is
anyone and everyone who hasn't taken their training.
And, friends, this, this stuff is so true.
It really is.
Um, I've seen it in action myself.
Even, and this is the most important thing,
even before we tried.
And even nowadays, when we don't try
to use brainwashing techniques on our listeners
or our, uh, audience who comes to a subgenius revival,
well, it somehow...
It's not just the subgenius.
It's the subgenius of the people who are so eager
to have some authority figure tell them what to do.
And preferably an authority figure like Bob Dobbs,
who has, uh, a split off from the mainstream,
from the main authority.
This is the new authority, the inventing,
the, the explorer authority.
The cool and groovy counterculture authority, dear friends,
that has led the revolution into the cons...
into something far worse than the conspiracy
that you started out with.
Ah, yes, dear friends, it's so wonderful
to be a powerful brainwashing controller such as myself,
intuitively inclined to exercise these techniques
on, mm, those of you listening now
who can't seem to invent your own religions,
who insist that there must be a true,
a one true religion, one better than all the others.
Oh, dear friends, you know, at least,
at least you can say that we subgeniuses tell you
what the heck we're doing, and we'll tell you why.
Why?
Why? To get ourselves a little slack.
And those of you listening who understand exactly
what I'm saying would of course realize
that there's probably room for you in this organization,
whereas you yourselves could become,
mm, fairly well-paid, uh, brainwashing...

...as opposed to the followers.
As, as, um, uh, Butt Naked's cartoon,
uh, little cartoon in the second stark fist showed,
the hammer is able to hypnotize
the nail into doing its bidding.
Uh, there are so many nails out there, friends,
begging, begging for some jerk like you or me
to bang them over the head over and over again
until they're embedded deep within the,
the belief system that we desire.
And, friends, not only will they pay us to do this,
but they'll pay us at 20% interest.
The conspiracy...
...knows its power so well
that it puts its face in front of the pink
and says, go ahead, urinate on me,
and yet the pink boy, the mediocritan,
the average listener of this show, even,
is so, so completely brainwashed,
just in general, by television and, uh, rock and roll
and everything else they're into, church,
uh, other, other, uh, religious training they may have had,
and just society in general,
that not only will they not urinate
into the face of the conspiracy,
but they will instead put their faces down there
to have it urinated upon.
And they will do this, friends,
as Sterno Kekever said, at 20% interest.
And that is the kind of climate we're living in today.
Oh, yes, friends.
America was supposed to be the land of freedom.
And it is, or it would be, it would be,
if y'all would only take advantage of it.
But, like Devo said, freedom of choice is, uh,
is, uh, is what you get.
But, friends, it ain't what you want, a lot of you.
You're terrified of making your own decisions.
You don't know that.
You, you pride yourself on making the decision
to let that great man J.R. Bob Dobbs
make your decisions for you.
But I got news for you, you bobbies out there.
J.R. Bob Dobbs doesn't make decisions.
J.R. Bob Dobbs simply goes with the flow,
to use hippie terminology.
J.R. Bob Dobbs, it just so happens,
happens to want what's going to happen.
It doesn't want to happen anyway.
And if you want what Bob wants,
then, yes, you get what you want.
But even more important, Bob said,
they'll pay to know what they really think.
And, uh, once you've paid Bob Dobbs enough,
like, for instance, all worldly goods,
you may be ready to learn the final lesson,
which is this.

The Greatest People on Earth
and you walk in with the Judas tribe
and the wife of Judas might be one of the ladies
I'd laid to make a socialist.
I knew I couldn't trust anything but communism
and the principle in me, yes,
I knew that that's what I had to depend upon
not depend upon the arm of the flesh
and never put all your eggs in one basket
so honey, I put my eggs in many places.
You figure that out if you want to.
Some of you are too naive,
you don't know what Jim Jones is all about,
you can't even follow him.
You haven't even smelled where he's at yet,
much less followed him.
You don't even know who he is
and you might miss him
if you didn't have a real good look at him
you wouldn't even know who he looked like.
You really haven't gotten next to him
but I've got all kinds of things in store.
All the listeners of this show
can unite a slight shooting tape.
All right, now we're going to
check out the movies on TV here
and we'll have a report about
agriculture and instruments.
Oh no, are they showing subgenius video
the movie again?
Yeah, I believe so.
Oh, they're looking for a face-up artist
to take the pieces of Bob's brain
and try to put them back together again.
Oh, that's art nowadays.
You put a pipe,
you take any picture,
put a pipe on it, it's art.
Get 500 bucks or so for it, New York.
Oh, it's subgenius art.
Got a pipe.
A kid does better art than that.
Art, art, art, art, art, art, art, art.
Art, art, art, art, art, art, art.
Or that happened to me.
Yeah, art.
I think I'll recall.
A slow, slow.
Fast, fast.
Fast.
Slow, too.
Fast.
I can't remember.
Tape.
Yeah, but there's nothing to play back on.
Pedigree house.
It's nothing to play back on.
Nothing to play back on.
Nothing to play it back on.
Nothing to play it back on.
Ain't nothing to play it back on.
Nothing to play it back on.
Nothing.
Nothing.
To play it back on.
To play it back on.
What could I say?
Dallas, Texas.
This is K-O-N-90.9.
Dallas, Texas.
And this is D.K. Jones.
D.K. Jones available only through the hour of slack,
so keep your tape recorders running, friend.
When there's a place in my heart
that isn't too smart
There's room at the top
For those who don't stop
I'm sick for your land
Raise your hand
You're the lover with the devil
All he's gonna get is a 10-year
I don't burn, baby, don't burn
The disco and fun
Now it's what you learn
Big shot, getting too high
Dancing to the music
If you like it, I'm not
You gotta dream, join the team
Everything's the opposite of what it seems
True life, end of the night
Big black dog is worse than his body
Where's the place in my mind
That isn't too kind
This room in the sky
For those who don't know
Don't say you ain't late
Whatever they say
The only thing they wanna do
Is make you pay
Can't eat for the man on the street
Freezing on the payments
For the elite
You gotta jump off the ground
Before somebody steps on you

So friends, please do remember to write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.
Listen to that show spilling all over the floor once again.
And stay tuned because...
I hereby inform you that the person trusted to me under Section 476...
Stay tuned, please, for the Soul Oldies show with Ron Lindsay, who's here on time for once.
I can't believe it.
R.B. stroke C-Zone stroke 907 stroke X.
Fine here, dude.
How come I have to do my show out of my car?
Welcome to Remedios Radio.
Texas, you know, your car is bigger than two counties up here.
The population of your car is over 16,000.
Why do you even need any listeners?
Because we...
Because Texas exists to create people who...
Drive Californians crazy.
You see, that's the way it is.
It's like Tinkerbell.
It only exists if people will give it their credence.
I guess that must prove that Dr. Greedy's is a Californian.
Well, I'm afraid we all have to admit that.
However, we may hate to admit it.
But he hasn't been outdoors in over six years.
Well, that's healthy.
There's no more ozone.
And he doesn't drive.
No, that's because he prefers to be driven.
Now, Ron, you see, there's no graceful way to get out of a subgenius show.
You just kind of...
They don't ever come to a resounding climax or anything like that.
They just kind of muddle on and on and on.
Another world.
You just have to...
Just to hell with it.
Let's go.
Praise Bob.
Praise Ron.
Yeah.
