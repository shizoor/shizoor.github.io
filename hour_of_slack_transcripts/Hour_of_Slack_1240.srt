00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
From early Sunday morning national FBI-led radio news, I'm the first favorite character in northeast Minneapolis this season.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,180
State forecast chance of east in the north, in the south.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,300
This is FBI-led early Sunday morning national radio news.

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:33,480
Attention! Attention! This is your beloved leader, Mob, the Ex-Multi.

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:45,700
There will be a special giant toy rally today at Mob Memorial Stadium, honoring that impressive space explorer, Mob.

6
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,040
He is a first!

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,880
First! This is return from the planet Earth.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,920
You are all commanded, uh, uh, uh, invited to attend.

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,840
What is going on here? I demand an explanation.

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,520
She's alive! Alive!

11
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,760
Why the hell aren't I notified about these things?

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,960
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,020
Lord, we are fine.

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,600
Strip naked and get on the probulator.

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,640
You're switched on to the subgenius.

16
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,360
Power of...

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,580
SWATCH!

18
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,320
The groovy show that comes to you live from Master Race Frankenstein Radio Control.

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,060
The exciting adventures of the man with the action-packed expense account. America's Fabulous, Bob.

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,940
Number identification error.

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,800
I think I'm gonna start this thing.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,440
Yeah, we called a wrecker to pull the show out of the sand here.

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,280
And the wrecker itself is a record.

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,780
Bob got mired in the muck.

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,180
And they hardened it to concrete-like hardness.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,000
The show's gonna need a record.

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,540
Wouldn't you like to have Bob working for you?

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:07,260
On the other hand, look at him from Bob's point of view, and you see Bob's poor conduct on the job.

29
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,100
Bob would be popular wherever he worked.

30
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,360
Oh, I get it.

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,220
Keeping a Bob.

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,700
It's amazing, isn't it? Our voices right now are going to be immortalized in digital form forever.

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,800
And they're staying sane.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,320
Yeah.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,340
Like this? That's stupid.

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,380
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,940
I better listen to that again.

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,340
Everything's being recorded.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,920
And cut up and collaged and...

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,940
People are hearing me?

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:35,940
Slice dice.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
That's so silly.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,620
Twelve cappuccinos later, it's a...

44
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,460
Oh, silly, huh? We're just silly, is that it?

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,540
Yeah, I see.

46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,900
We're not funny and we're not silly.

47
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,640
We're not funny, we're just silly.

48
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,000
Silly.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,360
This isn't funny, this is just silly.

50
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,740
Ugh.

51
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,800
Hello, this is the Bernard.

52
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,700
I just want to say that I am a strange bizarre anomaly or mutant.

53
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,560
And that earthquake that just occurred, I caused that earthquake to happen by my will alone.

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,980
That's proof that I am a mutant and not one of these common genetic, bland, normal humans of the community.

55
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,920
And that we need to stop this conspiracy, whose time needs to come to an end.

56
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,600
And that we need to keep fighting them as mutants until the aliens decide to come and take us away from here.

57
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,520
Because the UFOs are in the sky.

58
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,360
And they know that I'm here.

59
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,000
That's all.

60
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,300
Goodbye.

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,080
I ain't no man of circumstance

62
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,720
I walk around in leather pants

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,320
I don't need no salad snack

64
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,900
I think I'm having a big back attack

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,960
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce

66
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,780
Special orders, don't upset us

67
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,500
All that we ask is you let us serve it

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,720
You're way paranoia's

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,260
There's too much paranoia's

70
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,220
When the goings get tough

71
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,240
The tough get rough

72
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,780
It's not quite enough to get you there, is it now?

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,220
Sing it, that's how the day will end

74
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,680
Don't ask me for American Express

75
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,320
You want my money, I'll write you checks

76
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,840
Cause I don't want no Apple Jacks

77
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,000
I think I'm having a big back attack

78
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,140
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce

79
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,980
Special orders, don't upset us

80
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,740
All we ask is that you let us serve it

81
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,960
You're way paranoia's

82
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,500
There's too much paranoia's

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,820
Got a furry little kitty following me around all day

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,480
A furry kitty from the Psychoskeletons covering the Devo Classic.

85
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,920
And much more Psychoskeletons can be found at soundclick.com slash thepsychoskeletons.

86
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,900
Before that, our frequent message,

87
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,700
Lever Bernard takes credit for the earthquakes.

88
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,200
And amidst the collages by Lemur,

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,720
there was some puzzling evidence

90
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,020
and a title sequence by Reverend Outa Spaceman.

91
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
By the way, I have a correction to make.

92
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,300
Last week, I credited a collage called

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,160
I Told You I Was Bob to Reverend Sweetness McGee,

94
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,180
but really, it was Reverend Tai Ping Monkey, high colonic.

95
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,180
Speaking of which, there's a subgenius devival

96
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,300
coming up in Shanghai, China on March 23rd,

97
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,880
and I am not even kidding.

98
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,700
It is, however, at a secret location,

99
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,400
so you'll have to watch the subgenius.com events page

100
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,980
or the Asia Subgenius Yahoo group

101
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,780
praise Reverend Shining Path of Least Resistance.

102
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,940
Also, I will be preaching and showing new bug porn videos

103
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,380
at Winterstar February 4th weekend.

104
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,940
This is Hour of Slack number 1240,

105
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,300
and tonight we're relying heavily upon cuts

106
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,060
from the January 8th Puzzling Evidence Show

107
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,780
on KPFA Berkeley.

108
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,660
With post-puzzling evidence,

109
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,440
Dr. Philo Drummond, Dr. Howland Owl,

110
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,820
Reverend Phineas Narco,

111
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,220
Justin Credible, and Empress Zoe.

112
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,000
So, for Slack, let's get to work.

113
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,560
Yes, down below, the Morlocks continue to operate their machinery,

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,520
gleaming stainless steel boilers and pumps,

115
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,380
and venting steam,

116
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,520
constantly maintained by their Morlock servitors.

117
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,940
There we go.

118
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,680
All right, now the adjustment's been made,

119
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,960
and we're now moving backwards, actually, over the Earth.

120
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,440
Yes, I suppose we should get back into earlier eras.

121
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,080
As we prepare to lower the show back down into the parking space.

122
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,280
Back down into the low comedy preserve of Howard Stern and others.

123
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
And now the connection's been made.

124
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,460
Again.

125
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,560
Okay, that's your cue.

126
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,020
Who's cue?

127
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,020
Not mine.

128
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,600
No, no, the gong caller.

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,500
The gong caller?

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,120
Yep, gonged away by the Daughters of the Moon.

131
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,500
Picks up on a groovy lost journey, man.

132
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,940
It does, no, really.

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,280
Well, what is this?

134
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,820
The turkeys are laughing at us.

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,440
Is there some little thing you didn't tell us about your plan, Lieutenant?

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,040
I don't know.

137
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,220
I don't know.

138
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


139
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


140
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


141
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


142
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


143
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


144
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


145
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


146
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


147
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


148
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,220


149
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,680
I don't know.

150
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,200
Is there a...

151
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,260
Do I have a line here?

152
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,640
Oh, it says

153
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,640
throw his ax at...

154
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,460
I think it's missing him.

155
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:20,760
Chief turkey.

156
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,460
Oh yeah, okay, right.

157
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,040
I thought we did that ax thing earlier.

158
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,580
There, that was a stunt that was photographed separately.

159
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,560
So now we go to...

160
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,040
Oh, all right, all right, I got it.

161
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,660
We go to the cantina scene, I think.

162
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,660
So maybe the...

163
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,560
Do you have...

164
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,320
Are you on the right page?

165
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,960
That's in your script.

166
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,340
There's a script.

167
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,300
It's in a blue page.

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,620
It was added to my...

169
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,500
I don't think he can hear me.

170
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:35,940
Hey, caller?

171
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,700
I'm banging on his door.

172
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,460
I'm in the booth here.

173
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,140
Yeah, no, I'm banging on the caller's door.

174
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,320
I'm here.

175
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,100
Do you have our script tonight?

176
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,320
This is me.

177
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:41,960
Yes.

178
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay, so you know what we're supposed to be doing, right?

179
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,200
Right, I'm about to get my line ready.

180
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,620
All right.

181
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,280
This is where Epiginus regrets to Macassar

182
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,760
the theft of the prince of Agaspark.

183
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,460
You shall die, eater of leeches.

184
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:58,900
Pig dog.

185
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,640
Spartan dog.

186
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,960
Trajan pig.

187
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
Mother of pearls.

188
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,260
Mother of pearls.

189
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:06,560
I die.

190
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,820
God, read Daniel.

191
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,120
Daniel, what I wouldn't do for a drink of...

192
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,920
Of weak beer or strong water.

193
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,660
He wished to talk to...

194
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay, my line's here, Hal.

195
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,920
I gotta talk to you.

196
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

197
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
Let the fool come forward.

198
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,220
There will be many vague things that will happen in...

199
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,520
Silence!

200
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,540
You do not know what is the way of Magaspool.

201
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,600
Magaspool?

202
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Yeah, Magaspool.

203
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,540
No, not again.

204
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,980
Magaspool has warned you.

205
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,340
Those who trespass in his domain must perish.

206
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,140
You have to do that again so we can add the echo.

207
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,800
And Magaspool said,

208
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,840
let them who defy me

209
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,700
be punished to the full extent of the divine law.

210
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,020
Okay, we'll add the video later there for the punishment part.

211
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,760
There we go, the monster's got it.

212
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,140
They shall be boiled in the black tars of the...

213
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,480
All right, Hal's doing his read over

214
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,680
and the dissolve into the monster.

215
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,540
There we go.

216
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,800
He prowls in the sea of agony...

217
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,680
The lumbering creation of an errant god.

218
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,440
You do not believe I'm a pilot, Drummond?

219
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,340
No, I do not believe you are a pilot, Drummond.

220
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,860
Watch me ride this wagon.

221
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,520
What?

222
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,820
Get away from that wagon.

223
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,160
We're doing a monster show.

224
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:25,840
Oh.

225
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,660
Holy guacamole, the whole thing's gone haywire.

226
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,860
You guys know the guy who sweeps the chimney?

227
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,680
Bob?

228
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,360
Yeah.

229
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,180
Bob, except he's not Bob, he's Bob.

230
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,020
Who's Bob?

231
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,460
Bob is Bob.

232
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,100
That doesn't look like Bob.

233
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
No, that's Greg Norman.

234
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,260
I'm talking about Bob.

235
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,700
Bob.

236
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,560
Terrific Bob.

237
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,200
Bob?

238
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,200
Yeah, Bob.

239
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,260
Bob is Bob.

240
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,140
Bob is Bob.

241
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,120
Terrific Bob.

242
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,080
I don't know.

243
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,280
That doesn't look like Bob.

244
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,620
Bob has been around here for some time.

245
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,660
Who's Bob?

246
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,840
Bob.

247
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,540
Bob?

248
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,460
What, is this supposed to be some sort of psychodrama?

249
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,580
Exactly.

250
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,560
Oh, Bob.

251
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,640
Yeah.

252
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Yeah, and that little collage was by Local Color.

253
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,180
Now, let's welcome back Philo.

254
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,960
It's so great to be back on the show again.

255
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,600
I bet.

256
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,480
I was thinking about that.

257
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,660
Hey, did you see this?

258
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:23,960
For a long time.

259
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,540
Three weeks.

260
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,480
Bin Laden was a bad dad.

261
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,380
Bin Laden was a bad dad.

262
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,560
His kids have come out with all sorts of terrible stories about the way Omar...

263
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,480
Treated him.

264
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,680
Abused him, yeah.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,600
Who did?

266
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:36,920
What?

267
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,260
Hi.

268
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,380
He made them live in unsanitary jails.

269
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,780
Omar.

270
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,200
Omar.

271
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,620
Omar.

272
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:41,920
Omar.

273
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,520
Omar is his son.

274
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,640
Omar bin Laden.

275
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,280
Bin Laden.

276
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,020
Oh, you know...

277
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,880
They are good friends.

278
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,680
He may be a...

279
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,320
Bush family.

280
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,520
He may have been a...

281
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,580
Yeah, he may have been the mastermind of the 9-11 terror plot, but at least he could have

282
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,180
been a decent father, but no.

283
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,820
He chose to be a bad father.

284
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,440
A mean dad, according to his son, who has written a tell-all book to rival Joan Crawford's

285
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,560
Christina Crawford.

286
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,800
I really thought he was going to be a good father too, after all that evidence of it

287
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,080
in his past life.

288
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,240
Oh yeah, I see where you were saying the guy was channeling the guy that you were channeling

289
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,600
the guy.

290
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:27,980
Uh...

291
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,960
Oh, my God.

292
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,440
Oh, my God.

293
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,720
Oh.

294
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,840
Oh, my God.

295
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,220
Oh, my God.

296
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,660
Oh, my God.

297
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,540
Oh, my God.

313
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,420
That was a piece called Sedated Cicada by Rural War Room

314
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,840
from their CDMX.

315
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,260
The Flaming Yawn, praised Byron Werner and Donovan Soot

316
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,860
of RuralWarRoom.com.

317
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,080
And now Dr. Howell will tell us

318
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,800
of the Frankenstein radio-controlled monster Computer God.

319
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,680
Oh, so are you reading about the Computer God?

320
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,720
I was. I can only follow in the steps of Francis' deck

321
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,160
or stand on his gigantic shoulders.

322
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,560
I think you can stand on his shoulders

323
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,740
and vault yourself forward with a...

324
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,780
Usually.

325
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,340
In a few years you are made string bean thin

326
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,380
or grotesquely deformed, crippled and ugly

327
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,460
or even made over one foot shorter

328
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,600
or one foot taller as the Computer God sees fit.

329
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,940
Virtually all of the important instant plastic surgery

330
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,680
is done to you inside the Computer God sealed robot operating cabinet.

331
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,740
Even unbelievable impossible plastic surgery operations,

332
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,240
all impossible even for dozens of vicious kosher-borsher doctors

333
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,760
working round the clock for weeks.

334
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,940
The Computer God sealed robot arm operating cabinet

335
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,560
can perform all of the above impossible plastic surgery operations

336
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,140
overnight, even dwarfing you over a foot

337
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,500
or increasing your height by two feet.

338
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,160
This is possible because Computer God robot operating cabinet

339
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,120
imitates your micro-miniature electrical current intelligence system in your body.

340
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,320
It even duplicates the micro-miniature electric currents

341
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,220
that soften your broken bones

342
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,840
to create mending and re-exhaustions.

343
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,280
It can even create a

344
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,280


345
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,180
and then create stress, either compressing the bones,

346
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,020
thereby shortening them, or stress to make the bones grow longer.

347
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:18,780
The worldwide unbelievable lowest deadly gangster kosher-borsher vicious medical profession.

348

00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,520
especially the face.

350
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,060
Wipe-on hormones and laser beam surgery causing instant ugly deep wrinkles, scars,

351
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,780
age spots, arthritis, freckles, bunions, and contusions.

352
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,520
It's a thing, a stinky, sneaky thing from the abyss.

353
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,700
You spent more time in the sewer than on the surface.

354
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,760
With grotesque, leering ugly face with blemishes, pimples, red blood cells,

355
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,600
brown, black, or even thick white face and body.

Total graying and balding, even hairy body and furry body,

mustached, bearded women even wipe on synthetic hormones,

mossing, cancerous growth, bloating, swelling, deformed, big pickle nose, bulldog hanging cheeks and jowls.

361
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,620
What's wrong with that?

362
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,100
From teenage gradual wipe-on, yellowing, browning, and blackening of teeth,

363
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,780
to new skin, grinding, and acids, leaving hollow brown stumps,

364
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:33,920
so vocal cords are made raspy, aging, creating a wrinkled, ugly, gargoylic clown.

Booze face worldwide population by age 70.

366
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,980
Deformed, crippled, weak, and brain-damaged, new senile, lingering for inevitability of gradualness, extermination.

367
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,420
The only hope for future.

368
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,380
Do you know one word of pray for me, Dr. Howland Owl?

369
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,100
Also in the news...

370
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm convicted today of crimes against humanity

371
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,260
and sentenced to death by slowly waiting for help.

372
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,280
But the event is taking place in an atmosphere of mistrust.

373
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,860
Pope Benedict XVI opened fire from several directions today, killing six people, including the district chief.

374
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,960
Benedict reminisced yesterday with a group of Germans about the Third Reich.

375
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,500
He said it made him happy and allowed him to resume his studies for the PR News.

376
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,660
This is PR News.

377
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,200
PR News is bad.

378
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,860
The Chinese government was rocked by deadly text messaging in July.

379
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,260
The government says residents are limited to hundreds of thousands of messages per day.

380
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,540
However, Beijing says text messaging and the internet were used last summer to organize PR News.

381
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,340
PR News

382
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,340


383
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,860
PR News

384
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,740
PR News

385
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,060
PR News

386
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,240
PR News

387
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,240


388
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,240


389
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,240


390
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,240


391
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,240


392
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,780
PR News

393
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,320
PR News

394
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,900
PR News

395
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,460
The ultimate

396
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,660
The ultimate

397
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,540
The ultimate

398
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,760
The ultimate

399
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,760
Literally crashing through

400
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,460
Literally crashing through

401
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:32,740
Literally crashing through

402
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,980
literally crashing through literally crashing through

403
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,960
world record human puzzle

404
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,860
A Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm did that on his CD called Blank.

405
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,480
Lemur did the news, and now more news.

406
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,380
And what about that big local story, Phil?

407
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,520
That big local story is from the MMO report by Adam Beissner.

408
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,720
Huxley is an old friend of mine.

409
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,340
From my first E3, it's always been there, touting its Unreal Engine 3 graphics.

410
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,080
It's been where?

411
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,820
Boy, did those look great in 2004.

412
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,540
Delicious.

413
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,320
An unusual action-oriented play.

414
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,920
It's 2009 now.

415
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,400
Several shooter-style MMOs have been released.

416
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,820
And there I am, playing the Huxley beta for the show floor again.

417
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,500
It's good to know that some things never change.

418
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,420
Huxley is still fun.

419
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,380
It plays much like Unreal Tournament 2004.

420
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,260
And the side...

421
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,480
...Sci-Fi setting is one I never tire of.

422
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,100
Even if nothing about it stands out.

423
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,160
However, it's no longer unique.

424
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:22,360
I have no idea how it's going to entice players away from the dozens of other sci-fi first-person shooter titles out there.

425
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,920
Maybe it'll stay in beta for a while longer, which is for the best.

426
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:36,740
I don't know what I'd do at E3 2010 if Huxley's not there.

427
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,200
It'd be quite the brave new world.

428
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,720
Don't leave your brain out in the rain.

429
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,880
Thank you so much.

430
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,360
Thank you.

431
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,100
Thank you.

432
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,520
Thank you.

433
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,780
Thank you for that warm, warm reception.

434
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,440
It was a warm, wonderful moment.

435
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
So warm and...

436
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:56,900
Wise.

437
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,320
It's kind of warm and wet.

438
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,600
Wonderful.

439
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,040
Warm.

440
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,540
Warm.

441
00:22:59,540 --> 00:22:59,720
Wet.

442
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,420
Wacky.

443
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,060
Why is it wet here on the seat?

444
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,300
Warmth.

445
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,360
Like someone...

446
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,000
Life-giving, life-affirming...

447
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,600
What's this warm wetness?

448
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,540
Warmth, friends.

449
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,000
That's what we need more of.

450
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,560
Life-affirming warmth.

451
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,480
Life-giving.

452
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,900
Friendly.

453
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,520
Calm.

454
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,380
Welcoming.

455
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,320
Warm.

456
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,260
Wet fur.

457
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,260
Wiggling.

458
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,340
Pulpy.

459
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,140
Palpating.

460
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,440
Palpating.

461
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,800
See, we've got the collar in the pain well again.

462
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,560
Yes, I know.

463
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,700
We lured him in there.

464
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,280
With honeyed words.

465
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,280
But now we can be...

466
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,600
We can...

467
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,400
Operation Vivisect.

468
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,800
I guess that'll teach you that there's danger at the club.

469
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,600
I spell my surname...

470
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,940
Sir Danger.

471
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,640
And vivisection isn't such a bad thing.

472
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,720
No, not if you're the one who's doing it.

473
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,140
Because you can learn how...

474
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,840
You can learn so much about human...

475
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,980
React to invasive stress.

476
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,500
Or non-human anatomy.

477
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,020
Two dollars and fifty cents.

478
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,540
Your witness, Mr. Mason.

479
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,260
Exactly.

480
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,460
Exactly.

481
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,840
Now, uh, get nervous.

482
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,200
You say you sat for it.

483
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,240
It just ought to hurt a little, being in the room.

484
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,340
Well, I...

485
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,400
Yes or no, please.

486
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,200
Well, no, sir.

487
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,420
I mean, yes, sir.

488
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,000
Now, did Beggington have she, that man?

489
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:16,820
Right?

490
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,760
There about a week or any,

491
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,680
said it's not the else,

492
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,580
but anybody in a day,

493
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,760
anything, if she was, she...

494
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,540
Mm-hmm.

495
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,640
That's all.

496
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,660
Vrrrr.

497
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,540
Two light bulbs flickering

498
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,940
Next to my ear

499
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,240
My ear?

500
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
buzzing and chattering

501
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,260
thought I could hear

502
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,820
them say

503
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,400
my little skook

504
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,420
my little chuck

505
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,420
my darling dearest

506
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,600
ee-truck

507
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,700
truck truck

508
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,800
some words were spoken

509
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,260
some part of a cow

510
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,960
bits of

511
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,920
intestine in your

512
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,640
stomach right now

513
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,400
can't pick up my mind

514
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,200
as I slowly start

515
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,040
to sink

516
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,260
look at my feet stuck in the mud

517
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,180
and I think

518
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,420
two light bulbs

519
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,220
flickering next

520
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,640
to my ear

521
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,540
buzzing and chattering

522
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,440
thought I could

523
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,280
hear them

524
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,160
say my little skook

525
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,240
my little chuck

526
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,400
my darling

527
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,220
dearest ee-truck

528
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,420
truck truck

529
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,540
one, two, three, four

530
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,780
one, two

531
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,800
I can't start walking

532
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,460
this is one of the lessons we like to give out

533
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,260
here on the show

534
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,480
it takes a lot of obedience to follow the show's

535
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,040
dogma

536
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
and understand

537
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,660
how the callers relate

538
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,740
to that, how we layer in

539
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,220
the logic of the caller

540
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,540
and the listener into the show's

541
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,640
many, many

542
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,260
protocols, it's very

543
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,080
layered series of protocols

544
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,180
to be able to

545
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,360
promulgate the show.

546
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,420
So you think we need to

547
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,220
evangelize and bring the show to

548
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,060
unfortunates who have never heard it before?

549
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,420
Absolutely. How else are we going to make sure

550
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,380
that it gets out?

551
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,220
And also we have two chorus members

552
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,240
already. Because I don't think

553
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,020
that the... Members of the chorus.

554
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,980
That the poor

555
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,120
and the minorities are properly

556
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,180
represented in the audience of the show.

557
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,540
Publicity is always a plus.

558
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,140
Well, they can always tune in.

559
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,940
The thing that you have to do is develop a street team.

560
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,220
You start making flyers.

561
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,400
Don't pay any attention to me.

562
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,940
It's probably just some street producing stuff.

563
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,700
We do flyers and shows.

564
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,300
After a while they know we do flyers.

565
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,400
What comes after

566
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,280
the flyer? I mean, haven't we risen above

567
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,520
the level of a flyer now?

568
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,240
Yeah, I think of emails, websites,

569
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,380
whatnot. Aren't we like in a four-color

570
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,100
process, monthly subscription

571
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,280
magazines? I'm still smoking

572
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,060
hash with the stones in Marrakesh.

573
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,280
Shouldn't we be in high times or something?

574
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,920
In rolling stone at this point.

575
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,140
High times are still in the future.

576
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,280
Get your picture on the cover.

577
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,000
I didn't even know what you were doing

578
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
was art. I thought it had to be

579
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,900
in a frame or like Jesus and Mary

580
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,180
and the saints in church.

581
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,820
Well, you know, the human soul chooses

582
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,940
to express itself in a profound

583
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,000
profusion of ways, not just plastic

584
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,720
arts. Sculpture, painting,

585
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,980
charcoal. Then there's

586
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,680
music and poetry

587
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,300
and dance. Lots of people.

588
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,960
Photography. Slam dancing?

589
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,080
Well, insofar as it reflects

590
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,900
the slam dancer's inner

591
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,000
conflict with society through the beat.

592
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,980
Yeah, yeah, sure.

593
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,940
Why not? You see, what

594
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,120
I'm dealing with is the aesthetics

595
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,280
of the transitory.

596
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,880
I'm creating

597
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,000
tomorrow's memories. And as

598
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,020
memories, my images are

599
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,740
as immortal as art,

600
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,040
which is concrete.

601
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,000
Wow. Oh, it shall

602
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,440
be done.

603
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,040
Wow. Cool.

604
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,100
Thanks, thanks.

605
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,740
It was nothing. Actually,

606
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,760
local color did it. Local

607
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,080
color. The song we heard,

608
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,140
Two Lightbulbs Flickering, is from

609
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,120
Fegmo Tactic, Reverend

610
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,320
Mark Hostler's solo-ish album

611
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,400
from NegativeLand.com.

612
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,060
Now, back to puzzling

613
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,660
evidence for the whiny phylo.

614
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,400
Confirm

615
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,280
birthday suit. Dancing

616
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,220
just incredible.

617
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,660
Pull down a window and choose

618
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,780
from the SLV the appropriate

619
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,080
choice. After the resounding

620
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,880
success of the Normandy invasion,

621
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,700
the Allied commanders are

622
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,620
buoyantly confident that the war in

623
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,460
Europe will be over in a matter of weeks.

624
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,840
And that Hitler and his battered

625
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,140
army have no other option

626
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,340
than surrender.

627
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,740
This journey's worth it.

628
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,660
But then came the Battle of the

629
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,080
Collars.

630
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,040
It's a simple act.

631
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,260
Battle of the Collars.

632
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,860
Despite the advice of his best

633
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,920
military minds, the Fuhrer

634
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,280
will hear no talk of defeat.

635
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,900
In mid-December 1944,

636
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,920
the Germans launch a desperate and ruthless

637
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,000
counter-offensive in the Ardans Forest.

638
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,320
Utterly surprising,

639
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,700
unprepared, complacent,

640
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,880
cud-chewing Americans who stand in their way.

641
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:47,920
Through the

642
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,960
frigid snows of the mountainous terrain,

643
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,960
German tanks rumble

644
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,000
and infantry struggles to realize

645
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,200
Hitler's goal of dividing the Allied

646
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,980
armies and capturing the Allied

647
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,160
forces.

648
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,940
Don't ever, ever let the Tooth Fairy

649
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,500
forget your child.

650
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:02,600
Fuck you!

651
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,840
Where's my pig?

652
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,100
Where's my pig?

653
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,700
Tooth Fairy?

654
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,300
The fucking Tooth Fairy.

655
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,640
The Tooth Fairy, the real Tooth Fairy,

656
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,800
the real Tooth Fairy,

657
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,800
can forget your child if you're not careful.

658
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,600
I'm the Tooth Fairy of Connecticut.

659
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,480
If you haven't laid out the appropriate, uh, Tooth Fairy

660
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Yeah, and they've got, like, long vampire teeth, then you realize they're the long type of fairy to be hovering around your child.

661
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,180
sometimes the tiny tooth of a child is not enough to attract the child.

662
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,180


663
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:33,580
Tooth Fairy, you need some additional Tooth Fairy hormone attracted.

664
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:41,720
This Tooth Fairy hormone attracted is available at Walmart for only $12.95

665
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,640
with your special Tooth Fairy attracted device holder.

666
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,100
It's a simple, uh, dentist trick.

667
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,560
It is. It's a way that you get the Tooth Fairy to step into your house.

668
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,720
Nothing special.

669
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,180
Even in the middle of the night.

670
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,180


671
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,240
Even if you didn't.

672
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,740
You could actually use this to trick the Tooth Fairy.

673
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,640
Tooth Fairies don't listen to this show, so it's okay.

674
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,020
It's kind of early to be talking about the Tooth Fairy.

675
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,460
You can go to Walmart and get your Tooth Fairy attracted.

676
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,760
It's available at, not just Walmart.

677
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:17,760
I don't think Walmart probably has a lower price, but you can get it at Home Depot or Best Buy or any of your other Tooth Fairy supply stores.

678
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,340
But generally, I think the Tooth Fairy attracted, uh,

679
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,860
Wherever you can find Yellow Jacket attracted.

680
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,100
Right. It's, it's right next to the Yellow Jacket.

681
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,500
It's attracted to Fly Rattling.

682
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,460
All that stuff.

683
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,580
That smelly, smelly pheromone-laced and rotted, fetid, stinky stuff laced up.

684
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,620
Anyway, don't let the Tooth Fairy pass your child by this Christmas.

685
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:48,500
Just because your child has a birthday around Christmas time and loses its tooth.

686
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,440
I just need to sprinkle food around my toes.

687
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,760
You can sprinkle food around your toes.

688
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,460
Around your toes? Who said?

689
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:02,180
It may not attract the Tooth Fairy like, like, you know, what some of this Tooth Fairy attracted, this pheromone that they extracted from dead Tooth Fairies.

690
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,200
I wonder what Michael Pepe's up to with that, uh, Tooth Fairy scam this year.

691
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:18,040
I don't know. I don't know. But all I know is that if, if anyone's child gets passed up by the Tooth Fairy, those repercussions last all year long.

692
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,900
Until the next tooth is lost, at least.

693
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,600
I wonder what the Tooth Fairy does with all of his teeth.

694
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,300
I don't know.

695
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,700
The Tooth Fairy makes this hideous, hideous jewelry and sells it.

696
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,820
It's a donut.

697
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,380
It's a donut.

698
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,540
Tooth Fairy's teeth.

699
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm trying to reignite sectarian violence.

700
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,940
December is designated National Drive Intoxicated during the holidays month.

701
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:52,740
The U.S. is calling for extra political prisoners bound for the U.S. ahead of a religious holiday.

702
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,440
Separately, the U.S. military has announced that the U.S. military will be sent to the U.S. for a religious holiday.

703
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,820
The U.S. military will announce the death of another PR News Washington.

704
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,140
Are you guys having breakfast?

705
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,380
Yeah, I'm hungry.

706
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,320
Very cool.

707
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,120
Frosted Flakes.

708
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,460
You guys know Philo?

709
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,000
No.

710
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,640
Philo?

711
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,700
Yeah, remember that guy?

712
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,840
Is he that guy that's eating Frosted Flakes and beer in the other room?

713
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,120
Sugar Frosted Flakes and beer?

714
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:11,880
Uh-huh.

715
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,720
Philo.

716
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,920
Philo.

717
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:19,940
Philo.

718
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,840
Philo.

719
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,080
Philo.

720
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:21,980
Philo.

721
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,300
Philo.

722
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,740
Philo.

723
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:22,740


724
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,220
Philo.

725
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,320
Philo.

726
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:23,500


727
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,320
Philo.

728
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,440
No Wow.

729
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,660
You'll hit her when you eat her!

730
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,300
You'd better be careful though not to hurt yourself.

731
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:46,680
Ariel?

732
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,160
Ariel, is this your bedtime?

733
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,220


734
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,220


735
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,220


736
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,220


737
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,220


738
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,700
Aloha!

739
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,600
What do you think about December 21st, 2012?

740
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,900
I'm hoping that I'll be there to see.

741
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,960
Wow, good answer.

742
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,760
Good answer.

743
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,700
Yeah.

744
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,300
I think it's going to be horrible, and I'm really looking forward to it.

745
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,040
Well, I'm not so sure that it's going to be so bad.

746
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,320
It will be great.

747
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,020
It'll be a tropical paradise.

748
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,440
Everybody in the world will be like that guy.

749
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,280
What's the one where the meteorite hits the earth and they have a great New York gets drowned section?

750
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,820
And everybody's screaming and writing this stuff, and there's one guy down by the fountain who's reading the papers.

751
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,640
The wave is coming.

752
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,880
Yeah.

753
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,940
Doesn't even notice.

754
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,740
No, he does.

755
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,300
He's just like, I'm going to enjoy this.

756
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,880
He gets blown away.

757
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,120
You can see him in a few frames getting swooshed out of the picture by the wall of water.

758
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,420
But everybody else is running and screaming.

759
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,280
He's like, I like the New York Times.

760
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,860
I finally get a chance to read this paper.

761
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,740
My wife never let me read the paper.

762
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,560
Well, well, well.

763
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,200
You know, it's great to talk about.

764
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:50,900
He's talking about Obama now.

765
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,800
Now he's in love with Obama.

766
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,500
I did manage to go and see Avatar.

767
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,480
Obama.

768
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,440
I would certainly sing its praises.

769
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,000
You've got to go down and see it.

770
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,600
What did you think?

771
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,740
Giant 3D.

772
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,660
Was it like a rave?

773
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,100
Was there any surprises in it?

774
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,000
Is it good enough to see twice?

775
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,380
Yes, it's good enough to see multiple times, I think.

776
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,760
In fact, it's like nothing else I've ever seen before.

777
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,960
Unfortunately, it's the future of movies.

778
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,160
It's the way movies are going to be in the future.

779
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,040
Because this new 3D process is so inclusive.

780
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,360
You are right there.

781
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,260
And you're on the plane.

782
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,260


783
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,500
You're on the planet.

784
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,280
Absolutely.

785
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,160
I'll let my parents know.

786
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,320
They spent six years making this movie.

787
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,120
It's a special 3D that was actually developed by James Cameron.

788
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:31,580
That's a lot of money.

789
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,640
They give you giant glasses that are large enough to cover your glasses if you wear glasses.

790
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,240
That's true.

791
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,620
That movie's worth more than some countries.

792
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,820
But giant glasses also are nice to get so your field of vision is not restricted by a cheap little...

793
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,400
It's true.

794
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,860
It's worth more than most of the countries in the world.

795
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,780
Think how much food that would be for, say, Africa.

796
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,600
The movie's interesting in many ways.

797
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:51,800
Yeah, it's about a lot of donuts.

798
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,600
It's about a lot of ways.

799
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,280
And it's also...

800
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,680
I think that Cambridge, rather than food, would rather have a really awful DVD, you know, SVA's copy of...

801
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,360
Like the shot in the theater?

802
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:03,600
Avatar.

803
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,740
What I'm trying to say about it is that you'd be interested in it because it's a deliberate retread of Custer and a deliberate retread of Vietnam.

804
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,800
I don't even know her.

805
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,860
They mix all this history together.

806
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:22,260
The natives riding their six-legged horses are really very amorous in their eyes.

807
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,740
They're all in their own way.

808
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,020
Yeah.

809
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,780
And you're...

810
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,220
That's so sexy.

811
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,900
And among them is quite interesting.

812
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,660
Yes, they are sexy for 15 feet tall blue individuals with...

813
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,740
It's a 50s record.

814
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,640
It's a 50s record.

815
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,260
With prehensile tails.

816
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,800
It's really good.

817
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:41,100
Except these tails are really a nerve trunk at the end of which are genitalia or nerve endings.

818
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:41,500


819
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:41,500


820
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,340
Nice.

821
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,500
I wish I could have that.

822
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:44,300
Genitalia.

823
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:44,960
Genitalia.

824
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,880
It's a mind blower.

825
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,680
It's not three hours or whatever.

826
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
It zips by.

827
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,880
Somebody called...

828
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,180
Oh.

829
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,320
Somebody called me earlier and said he saw it twice already.

830
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,420
Which I think is really unfair because you took a seat from somebody else who hasn't

831
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,320
seen Avatar yet.

832
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,840
Yeah, you know, that's all right.

833
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,620
It's not hurting you.

834
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,220
There's people waiting to learn if you got your seat.

835
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:08,560
I did actually take it in with K-Rob who's no fan of James Cameron.

836
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,020
Get out of line and let me in there.

837
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,420
Yeah, K-Rob and Hal walk up and they just push people out of the line and get in.

838
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,860
See, that's my seat.

839
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,300
Not at all.

840
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,660
But we did buy our tickets in advance because the press of humanity rushing in seemed to

841
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:26,500
crush into chaos the possibility of even the rudiments of...

842
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,120
You remember when they were like shooting the gas canisters?

843
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,460
Gas canisters?

844
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,500
I thought that was...

845
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:31,620
Oh.

846
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,780
Yes, they gassed the natives.

847
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
They did all sorts of bad things to the aliens.

848
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,440


849
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,160
But the gas canister like falls to the floor of the jungle and bounces toward the camera.

850
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,380
And both times I saw it, I had to move my head quickly.

851
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,880
It looks like it's coming at you.

852
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,640
But what's really amazing is it all seems to be surrounded by...

853
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


854
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


855
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


856
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


857
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


858
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


859
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


860
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


861
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


862
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,640


863
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,220
It's not surrounding you, not in front of you.

864
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,040
I don't know who it is.

865
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,600
That's the amazing and immersive effect.

866
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,420
That's what my cat does.

867
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,480
But some critics I think are right to be a little weary of...

868
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,200
Was there somebody there?

869
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,480
I don't know what's happening.

870
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,240
I'm so confused.

871
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,420
It might be that all movies are going to have to be like this from now on.

872
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:09,660
Honey, I think there's someone in the house.

873
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,940
And it might be threatening movies as they exist.

874
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,200
Everything has to be 3D and everything that isn't 2... that's only 2D will be old fashioned

875
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,680
instantly.

876
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,620
But I want to see the air blurs and the lights.

877
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:20,620


878
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:20,620


879
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:20,620


880
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:20,620


881
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:20,620


882
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:20,620


883
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:20,620


884
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,120
I want to see the story in 3D.

885
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,840
I remember the old days when this show was about fopping.

886
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,020
There's an angel's voice of being sued by...

887
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,160
What happened to those days?

888
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,360
That was a long time ago.

889
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,480
...by a secretive organization known as the Children's Bible Hour.

890
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,500
This show used to be about something people could believe in.

891
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,820
I can out-prop Jesus any day.

892
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,780
More deadly than the Communist Party, the Masons, or any secret society...

893
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,920
We didn't fool around with these pointy-tointicle rules the old days.

894
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,600
...the Children's Bible Hour deals ruthlessly with its opponents.

895
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,840
Back in my day...

896
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,600
And although Bertha Trover shooks the immortal aunt of the

897
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:50,600


898
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:50,600


899
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:50,600


900
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,040
world, Bertha of radio and recording fame is no longer among the living.

901
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,220
She still watches over the entire enterprise from her roost in heaven...

902
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,220
She could tie one on with the best of them in her day.

903
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,980
Well, that's what they say, but that was before she got the Lord.

904
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,080
Before she got religion.

905
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,320
Before she did those nude scenes in Playboy.

906
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,880
Shelley Winters could play Aunt Bertha.

907
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,620
Boy, that would be a nice one to have.

908
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,200
A nice picture of you to have for me.

909
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,180
Kathy Bates.

910
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,380
Yes, Kathy Bates.

911
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,300
She could certainly do it.

912
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,580
She could.

913
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
She has shown herself to be a trooper in more than one motion picture.

914
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,240
Well, maybe we should go back to the past and then go forward into the future here.

915
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,000
Into the past I fly at last to dwell again amidst the golden days.

916
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:38,120
But look at me again and find instead a savage world's primordial displays.

917
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,680
Indeed.

918
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,220
And I like that.

919
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,280
That's good.

920
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,560
So, in other news, a large blimp-like beanie was seen hovering in the sky.

921
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,100
Or maybe that was just me.

922
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,160
Kind of an utmost...

923
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,060
Oh, about the Kremor?

924
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,920
Did you see the one about the Kremor?

925
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,400
Would I?

926
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,000
Should I?

927
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,660
I did already.

928
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,280
I had all night for my journals.

929
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,740
Oh, I thought you were afraid that I would read from your journals if you left them

930
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:01,820
there.

931
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,880
No, I read them out to all of Northern and Southern California.

932
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,140
It was very liberating.

933
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,300
Well, fortunately, there should be a recording of this show.

934
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,320
No one is going to really care.

935
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,620
Well, you never know about that.

936
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,320
There are the fans, God bless them.

937
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,620
I mean, if I left them in the closet, you know.

938
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,160
Oh, that's very stylish.

939
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,100
That's very charming.

940
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:18,620
Thanks, Kim.

941
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,140
I like it.

942
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,520
Oh.

943
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:19,960
I could.

944
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,080
I could.

945
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,080


946
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,080


947
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,220
I could.

948
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,420
Now I like it even better.

949
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,300
With the flower.

950
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,900
I have to go to bed, honey.

951
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,280
Flower.

952
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,060
I'm tired now.

953
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,520
Go to bed.

954
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,320
Well.

955
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,380
I'm going to bed, too.

956
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,200
Good night, darling.

957
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,520
I'm unfortunate.

958
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,160
Good night, honey.

959
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,980
I love you guys.

960
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,800
Love you, too.

961
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,260
Say you've got the automobile.

962
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:35,960
I had a good time.

963
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,860
You're going to drive away.

964
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,080
SLB.

965
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,500
See you.

966
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:38,780
Love you.

967
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:38,920
Bye.

968
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,600
As the ducks quack in the dawn.

969
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:40,960
I love you, too.

970
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:40,960


971
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,720
Love you.

972
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,920
Over the swamp.

973
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,260
Love you, too.

974
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,140
Love you.

975
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,340
Bye.

976
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,300
Good night.

977
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,300
Love you.

978
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,300


979
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,300


980
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,300


981
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,460
Me, too.

982
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,940
I'll think about you, too.

983
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,440
Don't let the bed bug spike.

984
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,960
Don't eat the apple.

985
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,220
Oh, no, I won't.

986
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,520
Sorry.

987
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,200
If I do, I'll just wait for you so we could eat it together.

988
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,300
Good night.

989
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,880
Good night.

990
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,100
Good night.

991
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,640
I have to make some peanuts.

992
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,240
Good night.

993
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,600
Oh, dear.

994
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,280
You've done this.

995
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,680
Do it.

996
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,380
People are out there.

997
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,060
When you're surrounding yourself with people, you're not alone.

998
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,060


999
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,060


1000
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,060


1001
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,060


1002
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,060


1003
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,060


1004
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,060


1005
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,060


1006
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:45,460
A lot of strange characters out on the streets these days.

1007
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,900
Someone was telling me that they were going to go see, on Facebook, they said they were

1008
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,240
going to go see Avatar on mushrooms.

1009
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,200
That is almost not necessary, but I wondered what that would be like.

1010
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah.

1011
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,020
At the time.

1012
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,340
I do think that the Brow should hustle himself down there because the whole...

1013
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,400
Did you see it in IMAX?

1014
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,260
...re-do of America's Finest Moments is expertly mixed with...

1015
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:14,500
Yeah.

1016
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:21,980
...social criticism of various recent political developments and things that we're doing

1017
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,520
right now.

1018
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,720
It's funny, all of his movies have this kind of human versus technology theme to them.

1019
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,560
Well, there is a tension because he also is on the side of the military as, you know,

1020
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,340
stylistically, although he realizes that they are bad.

1021
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:44,480
And it's a paean to nature and to the beauty of unspoiled worlds, which is made really

1022
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,860
with the latest scientific gadgetry.

1023
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,700
The most unnatural thing that can be conceived.

1024
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,620
And you'll notice that some of the natives, they needed some of the technology like grenades

1025
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,120
and...

1026
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,280
Sure, they picked it up.

1027
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,480
Yeah.

1028
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,440
But that's what natives do, if it's crazy not to pick it up.

1029
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,900
If it's there, but we really messed up their planet anyway, it was wonderful to be on that

1030
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,300
planet.

1031
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,220
That's why I would want to go back.

1032
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,700
They were blue Smurfy cats.

1033
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:08,740
I missed that.

1034
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,300
That's why they're there.

1035
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:09,780
Why are they gone?

1036
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,880
They were blue Smurfy cats.

1037
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,740
They are definitely.

1038
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,480
You're going to be right.

1039
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,440
with a lot of things you can't in this world.

1040
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,380
They were larger.

1041
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,400
They're 15 feet tall,

1042
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,780
but then also you can fall longer distances

1043
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,880
and you can ride those flying dragons

1044
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,440
that would never get off the ground here.

1045
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,160
But does the rate of the rotation of the planet

1046
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,020
make any difference as to how the gravity is?

1047
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,340
I mean, like if it's a slower rotation,

1048
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,640
does it have less centrifugal force

1049
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,080
and therefore less gravity?

1050
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,760
That's what I wonder about.

1051
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,320
I had to mention the movie,

1052
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,100
but that doesn't mean that we have to talk about it all night.

1053
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,520
However, I will defend it against its detractors.

1054
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,740
It's clearly an amazing step forward.

1055
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,040
I was astonished.

1056
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,120
Yeah, it is astonishing.

1057
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:06,780
Yeah.

1058
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:10,480
That it's so vivid and so beautifully conceived.

1059
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,360
And, uh...

1060
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,660
More power to it.

1061
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,060
I'm just afraid that now a lot of inferior movies like it will appear.

1062
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,100
There are some properties that could certainly be done.

1063
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,120
We're certainly anticipating Edgar Rice Burroughs'

1064
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,700
A Princess of Mars with those six-legged...

1065
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,160
Oh, yeah.

1066
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,420
The height of the blue people

1067
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,580
is similar to the height of Burroughs' Green Martians,

1068
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,600
but there's no reason why any script

1069
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,440
can't be made.

1070
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,260
Yeah.

1071
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,520
Well, it's certainly...

1072
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,660
Not that it wasn't always possible through artistry.

1073
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,140
Individual handmade artistry could duplicate it,

1074
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,960
but it would be, you know,

1075
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,220
it would be prohibitive, certainly.

1076
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,880
Wasn't Ray Harryhausen very...

1077
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,660
He took a very dim view of the CGI and...

1078
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,840
Uh, on over-reliance on it,

1079
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,120
but he actually likes it.

1080
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,460
But his intention is to make stuff by hand.

1081
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,140
Yeah.

1082
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,320
You know, you get a satisfaction

1083
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,480
if you're photographing what's really there.

1084
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,360
But I think it can be just as complicated

1085
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,900
to do it on the computer, you know,

1086
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,120
even though it's not physical.

1087
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,980
It takes as much artistry, I think.

1088
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:29,800
Yes.

1089
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,160
Well, there is a lot to figure out about that,

1090
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,520
but you see, when one is actually struggling

1091
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,680
with the reality of a dimensional object,

1092
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,460
happy accidents make sense.

1093
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:44,460


1094
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:44,460


1095
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:44,840
They may occur.

1096
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,760
While if you plan everything from the beginning,

1097
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,820
everything is totally under control.

1098
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,460
There you go.

1099
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,780
Inspiration may be present and driving it on,

1100
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,280
but the incidental inspiration,

1101
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,140
which we see in most works of art,

1102
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,840
would not naturally occur.

1103
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,720
It would have to be duplicated in some way.

1104
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,120
This certainly doesn't mean you couldn't do it,

1105
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,400
but it does mean that there are a lot of

1106
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,320
prick falls and holes and mine shafts to worry about.

1107
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:13,680
But I think...

1108
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,420
I think there could...

1109
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:14,460
Well...

1110
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,960
There could be happy accidents and using...

1111
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,960
Like, Stang had that...

1112
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,800
You could get stung by a bee.

1113
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,500
Yeah.

1114
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,980
Yes, your outlook could change.

1115
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,220
And then, of course, that would warp the creation.

1116
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,220
But, on the other hand,

1117
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,860
one does not necessarily know everything

1118
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:38,060
or even bring everything that one does know to the work.

1119
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,680
You certainly need to look outside yourself

1120
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:43,720
and your...

1121
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,000
pixel by pixel universe

1122
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,140
in order to gain the basic inspiration

1123
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,940
to maneuver there.

1124
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,280
Well, as a subgenius,

1125
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,060
I'm certainly on the lookout for good mistakes.

1126
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,540
Learn well.

1127
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,820
Then we will see if your insanity can be cured.

1128
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,200
I think I'm gonna die.

1129
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,800
I think I'm gonna die.

1130
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,360
I think I'm gonna die.

1131
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,700
Do you want to hear a story?

1132
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,140
I think I heard this...

1133
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,440
this homeless guy's review of Avatar.

1134
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,500
It's about three minutes.

1135
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,060
Well, why don't you start spinning that particular platter?

1136
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:22,760
OK.

1137
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,980
I seem to be here on the bridge.

1138
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,400
Everything's slanted over

1139
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,040
and puzzling evidence has disappeared.

1140
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,900
I think he took an escape pod.

1141
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,800
And now it's time for Bum Reviews

1142
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,400
with Chester A. Bum.

1143
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,140
Tonight's review...

1144
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,000
Avatar.

1145
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,640
Oh my god, this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life!

1146
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,680
I see.

1147
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,420
Spoilers!

1148
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,120
There's this bald boy who can control the wind.

1149
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,120
Oops, wrong avatar.

1150
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,680
Oh my god, this is also the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life!

1151
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:03,120
There's this guy who lives in the future, and he has lost his legs!

1152
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,720
I lost my legs once!

1153
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,720
Oh wait, there they are.

1154
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,600
So they send him to a planet filled with blue Smurf people!

1155
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,320
Only they're not little Smurfs.

1156
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,840
These guys are friggin' huge!

1157
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,260
And look a lot like Garfield.

1158
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,620
So the business people are like,

1159
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,540
We have to move these Smurfy cats because they're standing on top of this rock that's worth like a bajillion dollars.

1160
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,820
And the military is like,

1161
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,980
Blow stuff up!

1162
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,120
Blow stuff up!

1163
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,020
Sounds like my hamster.

1164
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,540
So this guy with no legs is put inside a Smurfy cat's body,

1165
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,920
and he has to convince the other blue Smurfy cats to leave!

1166
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,340
I know what that's like!

1167
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,220
People are asking me to leave all the time!

1168
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,300
Hey, if a dog can urinate at a children's playground, why can't I?

1169
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:34,960
Savages.

1170
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,100
So he meets up with a female Smurfy cat,

1171
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,800
who's the daughter of a king and a female spiritual leader.

1172
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,940
Well, one of them are dead.

1173
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,800
And she's also betrothed to this other guy!

1174
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,180
Yeah!

1175
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:43,900
Yeah, he's dead too.

1176
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,340
Most people who are betrothed at the beginning of movies are often dead.

1177
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,960
That's how most Disney movies work!

1178
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,820
I mean, not Disney movies work.

1179
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,640
So the guy with no legs gets to learn the ways of these Smurfy cats,

1180
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,620
but the big bad military,

1181
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,760
along with the big bad corporation,

1182
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,680
want to tear their village down!

1183
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,940
But the scientists are like,

1184
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,280
No, no, you can't do this!

1185
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:03,560
Why?

1186
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,380
Because the trees have some kind of energy,

1187
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,960
and they can communicate with the energy,

1188
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,640
and this energy will change the world!

1189
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,100
Puh!

1190
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,940
Who do you think you are, some kind of scientist?

1191
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:11,320
Yes!

1192
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,920
You think we pay you millions of dollars,

1193
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,680
to tell the truth?

1194
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:13,940
Yes!

1195
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,840
And you think that because you have a brilliant mind,

1196
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,840
and years of loyal experience,

1197
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,080
that we're going to listen to you?

1198
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:19,880
Yeah!

1199
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:20,780
Well, we're not!

1200
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,140
Why?

1201
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,380
Because we're the big bad military,

1202
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,640
along with the big bad corporation!

1203
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1204
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,460
That makes no sense!

1205
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,860
Squash them!

1206
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,100
Click!

1207
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:29,900
No!

1208
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,940
The Smurfy cats!

1209
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,620
So the guy with no legs goes back in the Smurfy cat body,

1210
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,840
and they get all the other Smurfy cats together!

1211
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,940
So the big bad military come in to wipe them all out,

1212
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,940
with their machine guns,

1213
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:40,360
tanks,

1214
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,380
giant robots,

1215
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,800
and flying death machines!

1216
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,880
But it's okay,

1217
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,080
because the Smurfy cats have bows and arrows!

1218
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,580
Of course!

1219
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,020
And they also use all these other alien animals to destroy them!

1220
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,240
Because if there's anything we've learned in the past,

1221
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,720
it's that mankind is no good at destroying other species!

1222
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:58,780
We suck at it!

1223
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,220
I mean, did you see Return of the Jedi?

1224
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,680
We came and wiped out Ewoks!

1225
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,020
An entire empire destroyed by teddy bears!

1226
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,100
Support our troops against Smurfy cats and teddy bears!

1227
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,140
They are deadly!

1228
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,220
So the Smurfy cats send all the humans back to their planet,

1229
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,320
and the guy with no legs,

1230
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,700
officially,

1231
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,040
becomes a Smurfy cat himself!

1232
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,220
I always felt like a Smurfy cat trapped in a man's body!

1233
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,020
Don't we all?

1234
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,400
And the moral of the story is,

1235
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,980
anything that is human is evil!

1236
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,160
And anything that is not human is...

1237
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,400
not evil.

1238
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,000
Hooray!

1239
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,440
So I really liked Ferngully,

1240
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,720
Pokerhunt is,

1241
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,200
Atlantis the Lost Empire,

1242
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,660
Dances with Wolves,

1243
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,500
Avatar,

1244
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,700
the most original movie I've ever seen in my life!

1245
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,840
I mean, that James Cameron is a genius!

1246
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,940
He took an idea that often made horrible children's films,

1247
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,600
and turned it into a billion dollar,

1248
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:42,760
epic!

1249
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,020
I wanna see him remake some of my favorite children's classics!

1250
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,600
The Tom and Jerry movie must be retold!

1251
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,680
With green bear booms!

1252
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,240
This is Chester E. Booms saying,

1253
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,300
CHANGE!

1254
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,940
YOU GOT CHANGE!

1255
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,700
Oh, come on, have a guy out, will ya?

1256
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,840
Come on, change!

1257
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,620
Well, can you at least help me buy a blue Smurfy cat?

1258
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,720
Or are you afraid he might urinate in front of a children's playground, too?

1259
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,120
The best review ever!

1260
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,480
Uh,

1261
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:12,740
I'm a little bit scared.

1262
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,280
I'm not afraid of, uh, Avatar,

1263
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,100
uh, from a funny website called,

1264
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,180
thatguywiththeglasses.com,

1265
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,600
also known as Doug Walker.

1266
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,240
Now, the news.

1267
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,480
From PR News in Washington,

1268
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:31,000
I'm a fairly lackluster, heavy, slight, unacceptable, straight, largely lawless critic this morning.

1269
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,800
President Obama says,

1270
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,040
Uh, I am greatly worthy of support.

1271
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:35,440
Uh,

1272
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,960
At least four people are dead,

1273
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,780
and more than a dozen injured after yet another PR News from Washington.

1274
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:42,580
At least four people are dead, and more than a dozen injured after yet another PR News from Washington.

1275
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,080
Uh,

1276
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,580
they're dead.

1277
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1278
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1279
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1280
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1281
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1282
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1283
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1284
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1285
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1286
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1287
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,580


1288
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,560
workings

1289
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:38,020
The world was ever seen.

1290
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:00,200
The world was ever seen.

1291
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:42,120
The world was ever seen.

1292
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:56,580
The world was ever seen.

1293
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,760
The world was ever seen.

1294
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:58,760
The world was ever seen.

1295
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:32,260
The world was ever seen.

1296
00:55:47,580 --> 00:56:12,480
The world was ever seen.

1297
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:40,640
The world was ever seen.

1298
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,360
The world was ever seen.

1299
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:40,940
The world was ever seen.

1300
00:57:53,540 --> 00:58:12,580
The world was ever seen.

1301
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,460
you know, along with the rest of the United States,

1302
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,260
coming to them.

1303
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,860
You know, now that the 20th century is over.

1304
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,400
Put a smile in your smoking.

1305
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,340
A-s-a-p-i-n-i-s-a-r-i-a-s-l-a-r.

1306
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:30,580
Smoother.

1307
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,260
Hi, Bob.

1308
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,120
Cooler.

1309
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,040
Cooler.

1310
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,160
Check it out.

1311
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,520
Best for you.

1312
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,260
Oh, I see.

1313
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,340
Well, that's too bad.

1314
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,880
Good evening.

1315
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,160
As you have already guessed,

1316
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,960
tonight's show illustrated man's inhumanity to man,

1317
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,260
his indestructibility in the face of obstacles,

1318
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,620
the senselessness of war,

1319
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,420
the need for a dream,

1320
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,900
the value of spiritual action to combat the lust for profit,

1321
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,260
and finally, the corrosion of life,

1322
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,180
the depletion of energy,

1323
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,980
and the frustration of love,

1324
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,320
which result from following a...

1325
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,020
a philosophy of romantic opportunism in an idealistic society.

1326
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,840
Naturally, we don't believe any of that.

1327
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,160
Good night.
