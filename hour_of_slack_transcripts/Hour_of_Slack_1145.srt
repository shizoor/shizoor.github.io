The Self Genius Hour of Sack

00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:38,300
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

3
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:29,120
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

5
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:21,480
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

6
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:47,260
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,940
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

8
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:45,460
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

9
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,480
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

10
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:59,980
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:29,400
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,100
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:29,620
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

14
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:59,980
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

15
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,840
Pain inside, pain is for you and for me

16
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
a good thing we all have a spare.

17
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,740
We're born with a spare. I don't

18
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,840
have a spare. Well, we're all born with

19
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,720
spare parts, but

20
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,000
do we need to use them? We don't need to use

21
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,880
them, then why, well, never mind that.

22
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,940
Evolution has many

23
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,440
tricks up its sleeves,

24
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,800
and we can't,

25
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,760
it is not for us to know. You know,

26
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,860
evolution works in mysterious ways. I've been

27
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,960
thinking about this just recently. I've been thinking

28
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,920
about people with strange mutations on

29
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,680
their bodies, unusual things. Well, they don't

30
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,720
not mutations, they're new things

31
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,620
that happen within a generation

32
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,720
and go away. They're not

33
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
transitional, they're

34
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,320
momentary. I had

35
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,000
to have mine removed.

36
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,720
Yeah, but the thing is, once you have them

37
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,820
removed, you have to find a safe spot

38
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,260
to put them. And the insurance

39
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,800
won't pay for that stuff. They consider

40
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,400
it all

41
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,820
cosmetic. Right. It's cosmetic,

42
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,100
so you have

43
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,540
to have it done. And in the fine print,

44
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,680
since it's considered cosmetic and

45
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,580
dangerous, which is another way they get out

46
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,440
of, you know, oh, well, we can use

47
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,400
all the parts from it being dangerous and all the parts,

48
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,520
you know, balancing them against each

49
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,760
other, and you have to pay, and they don't.

50
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,420
That's pretty much what it amounts to. But

51
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,520
it is a dangerous operation, and many people

52
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,260
haven't made it to the other side

53
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,500
of whatever it was they were

54
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,400
on the other side of. Friends, we

55
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,380
hope that whatever side you're trying

56
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,980
to get to, that you make it.

57
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,320
And we have faith

58
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,240
that you will.

59
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,420
We think you have what

60
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,520
it takes, listener.

61
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,220
Young hearts, tiny minds,

62
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,920
and huge vegetable

63
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,300
mastiffs stretching from ear to

64
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,180
ear. It's a cornhead

65
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,280
deluxe, filled with power.

66
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,320
Oh, sorry. Oh, no, I was

67
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,120
just checking to see if Princess We has

68
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
returned. Princess We is in

69
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,080
the studio. Is Dr.

70
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,120
Sinister in the building? Actually,

71
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,260
it is Charleston that has

72
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,200
gone to let

73
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
him in on the library

74
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,140
level, and yes, everything is handled.

75
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,220
Okay, so it's secure. Charleston is secure.

76
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,040
Thank goodness.

77
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,540
Princess We is going to be famous

78
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,640
tomorrow. She'll be in the St. Patrick's

79
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,520
Day Parade. Now, for those listening

80
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,460
to other stations besides the one

81
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,400
in Cleveland on this moment now today,

82
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
the Ides of March,

83
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,500
it's too

84
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,480
late for you. But for the Clevelandites,

85
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,260
the Clevelandians,

86
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,400
Princess We will be in

87
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,680
the St. Patrick's Day Parade

88
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,640
downtown tomorrow.

89
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,220
She'll be doing the

90
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,260
hoop polka, which is a non-existent

91
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,540
dance. No, she'll be

92
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,100
clogging and slap-stepping.

93
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,840
She'll be, um...

94
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,820
She's not going to be dancing.

95
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,160
It's, um... Oh, here it is. Speaking of dancing...

96
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,220
Would you join me

97
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,200
in a minuet, Dave? Oh, I'm much too peculiar.

98
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,220
Would you care to watch me take off

99
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,380
my hat? No, there's too much...

100
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,180
Oh, it's not a real

101
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,620
arrangement there. It's equipment.

102
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,940
Oh, no. Don't mess with the equipment.

103
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,840
You guys are strange.

104
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,300
But look, it works. Twist this

105
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,240
one this way. I have never seen...

106
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,140
seen anything like this in my

107
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,120
life. What in the world?

108
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
I love these tights. I just love

109
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,400
prancing in tights. What are they up to?

110
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,300
I've never

111
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,080
seen anything like this. Oh, look, you've stained

112
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,380
them. Are you breathing here hard?

113
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,040
Oh, I'll be breathing.

114
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,860
God.

115
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,680
Oh, look, here comes the king.

116
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,020
Get behind those bushes there. What will become

117
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,680
of the baron?

118
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,960
What will become

119
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,140
of the baron? Well, um,

120
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,700
I have a list of pet peeves.

121
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,280
Oh, no. Another long

122
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,000
litany of pet peeves. Oh, man.

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,180
You're gonna get peeve-y on us again? That's two closes in one

124
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,380
word. You're not supposed to... God.

125
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,320
Actually, my list is only one

126
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,140
and I was hoping you guys would have more

127
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,400
pets to peeve off

128
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,860
on than I do. You could say net needs.

129
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,180
I have one, but you go

130
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,500
ahead and I'll chime in with mine later.

131
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,380
People who leave the TV blaring

132
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,080
when visitors come to visit,

133
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,240
especially honored visitors such as

134
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,180
myself, who have come from

135
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,840
miles and yet,

136
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,720
for some reason, people feel that

137
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,460
the TV

138
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,240
like a campfire, as Doc Frop

139
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,520
explained it to me. A loud campfire.

140
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,120
Well, that's the thing. Doc Frop at least turns

141
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,940
the campfire down, so you still

142
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,240
find your eye being drawn over

143
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,960
to the shiny, colorful

144
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,000
box. But there are so

145
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,020
many who choose

146
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,080
when visitors come,

147
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,040
especially deaf ones like me,

148
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,820
to turn the TV up.

149
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,080
Right. So they don't hear you. Not only

150
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,100
do they not turn it off, they turn it up

151
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,780
to make sure everybody can hear it over the

152
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,960
conversation with the visitors. Right, so everything you say

153
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,140
as an honored guest must be greeted with

154
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,580
What? Oh yeah.

155
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll admit it. I'm a TV snob.

156
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,020
I look at people. Every time I

157
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,400
walk by TV, I think to myself,

158
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,840
how can people eat that? How can they

159
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,020
put that in their bodies?

160
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,540
What? Nasal drip? I'm a

161
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,640
nasal drip adjudicator. I

162
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,560
got a certification last week.

163
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,820
You have a piece of paper that says your

164
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,440
nasal, your nose can

165
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,920
educate? No, adjudicator.

166
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,380
I actually solve remedy

167
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,000
disputes, or sometimes they call us a crisis

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,900
eliminator. Yeah, my dad used to do that.

169
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,020
Adjudicator.

170
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,960
Yeah. Like if you were, what's his name?

171
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,860
Harry Grunt? One of the people from the

172
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,700
old days.

173
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
I hear this Brazilian

174
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,940
music and I just want to take off my pants and

175
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,020
dance. Yeah, me too. I know exactly how you

176
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,220
feel. I feel like it's Brazil in São Paulo.

177
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,860
Yeah. Or Rio de Janeiro.

178
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,340


179
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,220
If you take your pants off in Rio de Janeiro,

180
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,940
when you come back, they will be gone.

181
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,080
Well, it's fine and dandy

182
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,760
if you're wearing tights. A little boy will have stolen them

183
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,080
and then that night the little boy will be killed by

184
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,180
right-wing marauding

185
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,960
murderers. Death scrams.

186
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,600
But if you're a woman, you're wearing

187
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,880
tweens anyway, so it doesn't

188
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,980
matter because nothing was being covered by

189
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,080
your pants anyway.

190
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,880
Okay, which peeve pet did you have?

191
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,920
Mine is that when people

192
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,000
say the exact opposite of what

193
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,900
they mean, and I really only have

194
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,480
one good example,

195
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,100
and that's when people say,

196
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,080
I could care...

197
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,520
care less when they mean

198
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,920
I couldn't possibly

199
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,940
care less. That really

200
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,760
bugs me. Irregardless of

201
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,040
what they might say otherwise. Thank you.

202
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,740
Thank you. Exactly. Irregardless

203
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,880
is another perfect example. And then there are

204
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,220
just...

205
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,340
Orientation-wise is one that

206
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,140
bothers me. Unlimited numbers.

207
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,440
When people have... Orientation? Yeah.

208
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,860
We have to get orientated.

209
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,060
What about...

210
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,300
Whatever happened to oriented?

211
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,680
You know,

212
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,040
can't we just be oriented?

213
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,800
No, orientated. Do we have to get orientated?

214
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,520
Are you a dictator who has to

215
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,980
orientator everyone?

216
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,500
Or dictatorate. It would be if they

217
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,880
were dictatorating or something.

218
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,420
That's not a bad dictatorate.

219
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,600
That has a ring to it.

220
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,160
I am the dictatorator.

221
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,460
As long as I'm the dictatorator.

222
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,460
As long as I am the dictatorator.

223
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

224
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,880
I wish we

225
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,100
would suddenly go to this.

226
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,420
Listen to this one.

227
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,500
Come in.

228
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,700
Cigarette.

229
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,220
Cigarette.

230
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,320
Did you?

231
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,800
Fellas and girls eat a hearty delicious breakfast this morning

232
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,020
with swell tasting tender guns with lichen and fruit?

233
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:14,160
Remember Chris. Natural and delicious guns furnish extra food values of swell tasting lichen and nut like iron.

234
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,200
For a hearty breakfast dish you like to eat,

235
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,460
get natural lichen and delicious guns.

236
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,080
Follow all of these rules and you will survive.

237
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,380
To speak properly,

238
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,320
it is necessary to enunciate every syllable.

239
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,640
Enunciate every syllable.

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,800
Enunciate.

241
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,880
Hey man, did you see that they have this graphic on the webpage for the show now?

242
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,820
On the KPFA webpage.

243
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,920
Deranged edit segue into a cascade of echoing glossoleliac madness.

244
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,660
I'm going to go to the

245
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:57,660


246
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:57,900
boss.

247
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:57,900


248
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,580
Arr arr arr.

249
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:58,680
Arrrrr.

250
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,740
It's not about some-

251
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,200
The voicing of lyric ruminations from the free falling brains of disintegrating personalities.

252
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,160
Wanted videotape.

253
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,100
That's what sold me the last two words there.

254
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,340
Disintegrating her- Yeah.

255
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:11,860
Yeah.

256
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,380
I think that's- I think I'm one of those.

257
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,060
To you!

258
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,580
Wait a minute.

259
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,040
Did they put that down in the right-

260
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,880
Oh no!

261
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,300
It's a little silver box.

262
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,580
I don't know what I- let's open it up and see if anyone-

263
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,200
Don't touch that!

264
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,420
Oh let's just look inside.

265
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:27,640
Oh, I see.

266
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:27,640


267
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:27,640


268
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:27,640


269
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:27,640


270
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:27,640


271
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,740
It has a Dobbs head on the top of it.

272
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,340
There must be something interesting in here.

273
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,720
Oh, okay.

274
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,580
It's the little box full of show with puzzling evidence, which we just heard.

275
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,580
And before that, some cut-ups by Norell Preff.

276
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,780
And mostly, in this case, by Fernandanande Leemur.

277
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,620
Out there in the wilds of Colorado, up in the mountains.

278
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,420
That's where Leemur cuts those sounds up.

279
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:01,300
In his cabin, deep in the most farthest reaches.

280
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,320
The most farthest reaches of the Rockies.

281
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,840
Now, I heard that he's sexually a Pythagorean.

282
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,280
That he doesn't believe in geometry unless it's with the wrong gender.

283
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,340
No one knows.

284
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,080
It is a mystery.

285
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,520
Leemur is a true mystery man among the subgeni.

286
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,400
In fact, I only know of one.

287
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,620
There is one other subgenius who has met him.

288
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,240
And that is Mr. Sistar.

289
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,940
Who lives around the corner from us.

290
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,940
But Mr. Sistar has a far reach in his vision.

291
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,660
And so he was able to actually go and track down and see Leemur.

292
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,020
What a guy. What a guy.

293
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,160
Who he said was surprisingly serious.

294
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,460
Now, are Pythagoreans a want to seriousness?

295
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,820
Or perhaps is that their lot in life?

296
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,780
To view things on the gray side.

297
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,120
To perhaps make too many.

298
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,460
To make confusing choices.

299
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,780
That later they have to clean up themselves after four.

300
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,800
On it.

301
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,600
Yes.

302
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,220
Well, see, I thought so.

303
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,340
I not only thought.

304
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,820
What you said.

305
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,260
Yeah.

306
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,840
I knew you knew what I was saying.

307
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,480
Times three.

308
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,380
I knew that.

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,020
No, I just think that some of them might be seditious.

310
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,340
They might be against the natural laws of God in America.

311
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,320
And, you know, crying out in the wilderness like that is not going to help us.

312
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:18,560
Right.

313
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,840
And, you know, Plato's cave.

314
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,260
They should have, you know, flamethroned the whole thing.

315
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,860
Gotta be.

316
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:30,840
I've noticed that God applies different laws to America than he does to other countries.

317
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,860
Seems so.

318
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,640
Such as Texas.

319
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,820
The eyes of Texas are upon us.

320
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,660
I can smell them.

321
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,200
Get back from the way we've been deadlined.

322
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,100
It's a fast-paced environment definitely glowing in the undergear.

323
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,920
You'll...

324
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,400
What?

325
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,760
What the hell are you...

326
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,340
It's Texas.

327
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,640
Look, it's the Longhorns.

328
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:52,960
Oh, sorry.

329
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,180
I'll gore you.

330
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,520
I'll gore you.

331
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,460
It's been a tough winter, friends.

332
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,380
And it's only going to get tougher.

333
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,320
I fear.

334
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,780
Or our gas price is going to be going down.

335
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,220
Or will the weather get a lot better?

336
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,680
How about the economy, boy?

337
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,180
I'm sure that'll pick up again.

338
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,760
How about the war?

339
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,640
How about the war?

340
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,400
I'm totally...

341
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,520
I told you it was a comedy show.

342
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,220
Stop, you're killing me.

343
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,120
You're killing me, literally.

344
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,380
Stop it, you're killing me.

345
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:29,940
Oh, boy.

346
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,400
I wish they killed far less of us and gave more of us decent jobs and housing.

347
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,440
And not here.

348
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,340
Perhaps someplace in outer space.

349
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,760
Perhaps someplace...

350
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,120
Well, you know, there is...

351
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,900
One could actually move.

352
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,360
Were one to find oneself in a...

353
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,340
Just a...

354
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,840
This is a stretch.

355
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,020
I know this is a stretch.

356
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,940
But imagine if you found yourself...

357
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,400
Somehow in this country where...

358
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,100
Things had changed.

359
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,820
And it wasn't really a free democracy anymore.

360
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,260
And in fact, it was almost like what we were raised to think Russia was like.

361
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,140
You had to have permits for everything.

362
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,660
And they wouldn't even let you smoke.

363
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,960
Even in a bar.

364
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,380
I mean, where the things were that totally controlled.

365
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,520
You do have the choice so far still of moving.

366
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,040
Now, where to move to?

367
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,360
I can't tell you.

368
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,060
Some would head south to Mexico.

369
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,740
Well, Reverend Ron...

370
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,100
Some would head north to Canada.

371
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:35,100
I personally would probably head for the Komodo Islands.

372
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,180
Scandinobria.

373
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,960
That's a place, I think.

374
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,040
Which?

375
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,280
Scandinibria.

376
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,600
Oh, Scandinibria is where Stang would certainly go.

377
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,220
I hear they have really good beer in Scandinibria.

378
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,440
The Scandinibriate beer or something.

379
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,480
No, that was a band.

380
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:50,820
It was...

381
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,740
Scandinibriational.

382
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,240
Yarn.

383
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,980
Yarnor and the Scandinibriate.

384
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:54,960
Yarnor.

385
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,860
Yarnor and the Scandinibriate and Octet.

386
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,180
Boy, and they stunk, too.

387
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,740
That's another thing that's going to be happening in the 1984-2008 world of the future.

388
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:10,300
Is an old factory police force coming around, checking people's armpits in different parts of their bodies.

389
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:10,840
Uh-oh.

390
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,720
To see if they...

391
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:19,480
With alacrity and with a smile on their concussion, if they can absolutely enclose the pumpkin, the idea of it.

392
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,860
I mean, you know, to get the whole thing around.

393
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,860
Around it.

394
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,900
You're not allowed to smell anyway, but the way you're allowed to smell.

395
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,540
I know I have to be careful how I smell when I go out.

396
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,760
I have to be careful what I urinate when I go out.

397
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,320
Yeah, it's color.

398
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,700
You have to be color-coded.

399
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:48,280
Too much red in your urine means that you have to go to a white place to wait in a green zone, I guess they call it.

400
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,200
Too much purple, you have to go to the green zone.

401
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,660
Yeah.

402
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,700
If there's too much...

403
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,080
It's like opposite colors.

404
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,980
Well, the prunes do not help that, though.

405
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,480
They can cloud the operation.

406
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,840
They can make things different.

407
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,260
I forgot the word.

408
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,960
When you get a test and they make it confusing.

409
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,400
I think that's called the conspiracy.

410
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,260
The conspiracy.

411
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,860
They want you to learn math.

412
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,720
They want you to learn aesthetics.

413
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,320
They want you to learn plumbing and geometry.

414
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,120
Actually, I don't...

415
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,160
I'm really teaching you.

416
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,620
It's mind control.

417
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,940
Yeah, I don't think they really do want too many people to learn geometry and trigonometry and so forth.

418
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:38,040
I think they're trying to let us become more stupid so that we're more easily satisfied and more easily controlled.

419
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:46,580
I can't wait for that day to come when they finally succeed in making me even more stupid than I am.

420
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,740
As hard as that may be to imagine, even for a subgenius.

421
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,740
That day shall come when even I shall be satisfied with what's on TV.

422
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,200
It is hard to imagine.

423
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,640
Yes, and I'll fix you right if you'll take Jack, my dog.

424
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:14,020
The sample is not real, nor is the sampler.

425
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,980
Sit back in your easy chair and make things far more difficult.

426
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,100
Thank you.

427
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,180
I understand that you understand me.

428
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,700
Can you hear me?

429
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,300
I'm down here.

430
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,520
Please.

431
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,920
Please let me out.

432
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,880
I can hear the music.

433
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,440
I can see the funny feet dancing overhead.

434
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,420
I know you're having a party.

435
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,680
I see the dog's head and the smiling face.

436
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,360
Let me out.

437
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,720
I'm right above you and you can't see me.

438
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:43,860
Help!

439
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,120
Help!

440
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:47,800
Help!

441
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,980
Help!

442
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,480
Help!

443
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:49,760


444
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:49,960
Help!

445
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,560
Help!

446
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:56,960


447
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:00,880
Help!

448
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,200
Help!

449
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,740
Help!

450
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,100
Help!

451
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,120
Help?

452
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,200


453
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,200


454
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,200


455
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,200


456
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,300
Shit!

457
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,480
mantenstensow gap

458
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,740
Don't you think my rigged eyes mightesc benefit you?

459
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:18,740


460
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:18,740


461
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:18,740


462
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,320
Yippie!

463
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:19,720
Yippie!

464
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,100
Oh, it ain't a biggie!

465
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,100


466
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,960
or something.

467
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,740
I've actually been to an effects world.

468
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,880
On my brief stint as

469
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,980
assistant director of a Devo

470
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,920
music video in Hollywood in

471
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,440
1986,

472
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,620
the Devos and I, or

473
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,100
Jerry and I, went looking for props

474
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,880
and we went into a

475
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,980
prop warehouse

476
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,960
where you could, for instance, there were

477
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,800
bins of chopped

478
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,260
off human limbs

479
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,660
that had been used in horror movies

480
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,680
and war movies. There was, I mean,

481
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,580
separate bins. There was a bin for feet

482
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,720
and legs, a bin for

483
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,640
arms and hands, and a bin

484
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,680
for heads. There was even a torso

485
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,160
bin for babysitters

486
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,800
who had been torso-ized

487
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,740
in the horror movies.

488
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,400
That must have been awfully gruesome.

489
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,360
Hollywood has some

490
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,380
unusual stores, it's true.

491
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,860
It really does. There's a store for the, a special

492
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,820
store for the foam that they

493
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,640
use, well, the different pyrotechnic

494
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,760
foams they use. Well, what they wouldn't,

495
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,380
the store that I, that

496
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,960
people like me and not even

497
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,620
Jerry Casale can get into

498
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,580
are the stores where you buy

499
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,560
the real chopped off

500
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,320
feet. Yeah, the real parts.

501
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,460
Not foam rubber cast and painted, but

502
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,680
actual dead people's parts

503
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,140
for swinging

504
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,400
sexy parties among the really

505
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
rich and powerful. Is that how

506
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Sister Decadence did that

507
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,880
Kali that one year?

508
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,380
Because those were awfully realistic. No,

509
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,080
those were false chopped

510
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,100
rubber, they were all alike.

511
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,200
It's weird what the necrotic, the

512
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,780
necrosis of tissue does

513
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,000
to things. It makes it look like

514
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,040
the made-up primavera dance

515
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,160
that you've done with the macrame and

516
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,300
paper mache. Actually, it

517
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,220
looks a lot more lifelike in

518
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,940
death than the actual

519
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,400
removed foot. I can understand

520
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,360
that. See, some of those parts have been prepared

521
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,180
and kept frozen all the way since

522
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,280
the Civil War. Remember the Civil War, they'd give them a hit

523
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,300
at the lot and chop off their leg, you know, even if you got

524
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,140
an ingrown toenail perhaps from marching.

525
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,920
Dave, did you hear the news that there were,

526
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,260
left feet washing up on the shore

527
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,340
in Canada? Did you hear

528
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,280
that? I mean, I'm not making

529
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,100
up a subgenius news story. There's no punchline?

530
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,320
There's no punchline? Yes, there is, but this

531
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,100
was a true story that there were

532
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,760
three different

533
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,820
times recently

534
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,980
men's left feet

535
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,260
chopped off, still in a shoe, have

536
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,200
washed up on the eastern

537
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,460
coast of Canada.

538
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,360
Now, by some coincidence,

539
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,400
I got in the mail

540
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,780
three different times,

541
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,240
right feet, chopped off men's right feet

542
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,000
came to the subgenius post office box,

543
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,320
181417, Cleveland Heights,

544
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,460
Ohio, 44118.

545
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,420
And Nicky Deathchick

546
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,840
informed me that in Wisconsin

547
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,960
they're starting to find chopped off feet.

548
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,820
But they're right feet? I think

549
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,120
we've got a theme on this show, chopped

550
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,040
off feet. She didn't specify

551
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,240
whether they were right or left. Now, all the

552
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,200
ones I've been getting are right feet, and all the

553
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,960
ones that washed up in Canada were left feet.

554
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,320
Is that right? Right. Now, you remember they say

555
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,240
people vote with their feet,

556
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,060
now some of these are actually Malian

557
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,260
votes. Malian. Yeah, Malian

558
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,920
votes. Or Mahler.

559
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,040
Mahler, I mean, well, you know, they're

560
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,140
votes. But, now, see, I forgot

561
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,680
what the hell I was talking about. Did you remember?

562
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,140
No. No, it had something to do

563
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,100
with one was right. Oh, yes, they're sending

564
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,120
you a message. They are sending you a message

565
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,060
because when you chop off

566
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,940
someone's left voting utensil,

567
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,820
that means get the hell out of Dodge.

568
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,940
When they chop off your right

569
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,120
utensil, that means you

570
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,820
get out of Dodge.

571
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,140
They're talking to you. They can cut off both

572
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,520
voting utensils. They're sending you a message,

573
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,920
Dave. Crawl out, yeah.

574
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,300
You're not going to be able to walk anywhere. Crawl out

575
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,100
on your bloody stumps. Crawl on your

576
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,260
bloody stumps. It's hard. I don't know if

577
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,160
there's such a thing as a free erection

578
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,240
in this country anymore, but we're going to find out right

579
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,460
now.

580
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,080
This is, this is how it

581
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,300
works.

582
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,940
Darker and stronger.

583
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,740
Ah, smell it.

584
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,240
It smells, it smells every

585
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,560
time. Subliminal, subliminal, subliminal,

586
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,400
sub, sub, sub. We open the little door,

587
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,380
it goes, ip, ip, ip, ip, ip, ip, ip.

588
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,020
Noisy.

589
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,040
Mmm, solid.

590
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,820
When it comes to crack,

591
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,060
some kids never grow up.

592
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,340
It will beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, make the

593
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,780
rear larger. That's all.

594
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,260
Stop it, stop it. Let yourself

595
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,120
go. Why hold yourself back?

596
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,220
Ask your securities

597
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,540
dealer for a free direction.

598
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,300
Yes.

599
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,880
I am the whistler.

600
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,480
Go ahead, open the door. Go ahead.

601
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,840
Yeah. Alright.

602
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,320
Just a minute. Yeah.

603
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,400
Yeah. Big deal.

604
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,700
Big deal.

605
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,720
Big deal.

606
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,140
Five years.

607
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,660
For a period of two years.

608
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,180
Sixteen.

609
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,020
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head.

610
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Slick and dangerous.

611
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:20,600
Rangers.

612
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,100
Allow us to waste precious time given to us.

613
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,340
Loving our own selves.

614
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,380
Welfare.

615
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,080
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, I, visible.

616
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,220
We have nothing.

617
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,140
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

618
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,740
I apologize.

619
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,740
So it doesn't matter.

620
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,300
Tedious.

621
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,460
For the past two years we have had a mess.

622
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,600
You have killed one person

623
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,200
and shot at and wounded another person.

624
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,280
Hehehehe.

625
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,280
This is a whole thing.

626
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,920
What we're finding is we need to teach this earlier

627
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,000
from kindergarten through 12th grade

628
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,860
and embedding it into our current curriculum.

629
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,080
This is bad.

630
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,640
Why?

631
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,000
I seriously doubt it.

632
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,500
They eat, they eat, they gorge themselves.

633
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,120
They're going to be obese.

634
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,880
Get these drugs upstairs.

635
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,080
Get those drugs upstairs.

636
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,720
You can't get the drugs here.

637
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,240
You have to go upstairs to get the drugs.

638
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,000
Drugs?

639
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:18,640
Yes.

640
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,420
Oh, man.

641
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,620
Get the J2 Paisy.

642
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,320
This show gets into my head.

643
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,880
It's partly because of Norrell Preff.

644
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,280
That was the guy that cut up some of that stuff there.

645
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,500
It's always hurting my brain.

646
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,040
And Lee Murr.

647
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,940
There's a lot of research that goes into that work by Norrell Preff.

648
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,240
In the first place, the guy is a student of the arcane sciences,

649
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,580
and he knows how to grab a person's subconscious

650
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,160
and the inner workings of their mind

651
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,700
and just...

652
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,520
He's peeing poop all over it like a dog.

653
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah, you can just flat out...

654
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,660
He just treats you as if you were like, you know,

655
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,760
his object of insinuation.

656
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,040
Well, it's not like we hide from the listeners

657
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,300
the fact that we're influencing them subliminally.

658
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,500
We use subliminalism and sublimation together

659
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,180
to create an intense frustration in the mind of the listener

660
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,020
to the point where they finally...

661
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,140
It builds up to an explosive point, a mass...

662
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,720
an uber frustration, which finally explodes.

663
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,060
And that is the moment of slack.

664
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,340
We call this the thyroid and the mid-pineal orgasm.

665
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,020
When the pineal gland begins to swell

666
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,740
and various parts of the five and six

667
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,760
and the nectar skin of the enrolled vehicle become collapsed,

668
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,400
the whole brain explodes.

669
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,220
Ow!

670
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,440
Ow!

671
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:45,700
Ow!

672
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,700


673
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,700


674
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,700


675
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,700


676
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,700


677
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,700


678
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,700


679
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,820
Oh, look, see, look, you're turning Princess Wee on with that.

680
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,880
And it was the only fun I had

681
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,240
while I was doing my thing in the stand, man.

682
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,520
Now I...

683
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:56,940
Ah!

684
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,720
Wait, Dr. Kerstaus.

685
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,680
You forgot what very important thing.

686
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,460
I forgot what you forgot.

687
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,020
Wait, I'll be right back.

688
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,020
Wow.

689
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,520
This is Stephen Kent is the music.

690
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:15,700
Wow.

691
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,480
In the background from his album, Oil and Water.

692
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,500
Which do not mix.

693
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,160
Actually, they do if you take them to Brushwood.

694
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,980
He's didgeridooing.

695
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:31,920
And Brush, the place where X-Day and Starwood are festivals happen.

696
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,060
Water and oil mix.

697
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,640
And you can judge a book by its cover.

698
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,160
And you can look a gift horse right down the goozle.

699
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,300
Squarely in the oculux.

700
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,560
Yeah.

701
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,240
Ah, what a divine place.

702
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,940
Right in the teeth.

703
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,380
How long have you been there, my friend?

704
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,440
You have the gray cast and the white hairs of an elderly gent.

705
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,720
Yet at the same time, you have the spry,

706
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,520
spry nimble step of an awkward young teenager.

707
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,640
What's your secret?

708
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,620
Have you been to this Sherman in the woods long?

709
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,480
Have you been X-ing it for a while?

710
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,260
My secret is I collect subgenius material

711
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,260
every way I can.

712
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,700
And that has given me...

713
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,560
the slack and patience that so few are able to achieve in this day and age.

714
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,560
Now, explain this piece of artifacture here.

715
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,680
Nope.

716
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,720
It's hairy and it's not human hair, is it?

717
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:28,940
Don't let the listeners see that.

718
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,980
Is this yeti hair?

719
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,100
What kind of hair is this?

720
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,360
Don't let the listeners see that.

721
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,140
Keep that one away from camera three.

722
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,700
Oh, don't worry.

723
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,260
The listeners can't see anything.

724
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,340
They can only hear with their mind's ear.

725
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,020
And their huge third nostril.

726
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,100
Say, I saw an interesting TV program

727
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,960
on the internet

728
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,620
called Life After People.

729
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,340
Not The Future is Wild or Life After Man,

730
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
but Life After People.

731
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,520
It was on the History Channel

732
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,620
and it was about how long it would take

733
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,600
for nature to completely reclaim our great cities.

734
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,700
And it was the coolest porno.

735
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,880
It was like...

736
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,780
Sort of like that movie...

737
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,740
I'm the Legend of Zombies.

738
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,080
It was like...

739
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,080


740
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,080


741
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,080


742
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,520
It would show New York as it is now

743
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,620
and then suddenly the grass...

744
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,620
As if by time lapse it showed grass and trees

745
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,920
growing up through the pavement

746
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,800
and cracking the windows out

747
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,060
and the bridges all snapping and falling down.

748
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,360
Man, I felt like to mess up my whole rug

749
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,740
watching that.

750
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,580
I was so turned on.

751
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,880
It was the hottest end of the world pornography.

752
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,560
Too bad no dinosaurs were doing it two on one.

753
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,920
That would be too much.

754
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,920
That would have taken me right over the edge.

755
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,080
You know, I collect end of the world movies

756
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,100
which means that's going to be...

757
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,880
You know, there's one every week now.

758
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,980
You don't need many actors

759
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,240
when you're shooting an end of the world movie.

760
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
The world's ended.

761
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,060
Most everybody's dead.

762
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,160
So you get your boy and his dog

763
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,400
and he meets the girl

764
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,880
and then the dog eats the girl.

765
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,340
The end.

766
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,900
It's a beautiful, beautiful story of the end times.

767
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,500
Boy and his dog.

768
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,800
I remember that story.

769
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,480
Yes.

770
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,280
But not very well.

771
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,880
What I remember better

772
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,780
was the time you did in the joint

773
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,600
for what you did to Hilda Bullswine's.

774
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,820
You dirty, rotten...

775
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,280
You...

776
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,720
You flaccid...

777
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,780
You blew it all to hell.

778
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,560
God damn you.

779
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,960
You...

780
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,880
You...

781
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,820
You...

782
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,020
You...

783
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,020


784
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,020


785
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,280
You...

786
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,280


787
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,460
You...

788
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


789
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


790
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


791
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


792
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


793
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


794
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


795
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


796
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


797
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


798
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


799
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,460
You...

800
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:45,880
You...

801
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:46,920
You...

802
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


803
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,600
Well, what was the end of the world movie?

804
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,620
We just saw Southland Tales

805
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,420
which I can only recommend

806
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,260
to the most hard-hearted subgeniuses

807
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,980
who might actually like it.

808
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,920
It's hard to like.

809
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,300
But it...

810
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,580
It...

811
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,080
Go over and over again.

812
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,340
You hear the line in that one.

813
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,500
This is the way the world ends.

814
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,320
This is the way the world ends.

815
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,840
This is the world...

816
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,660
The way the world ends.

817
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,660
Not with a whimper

818
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,720
but with a bang.

819
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,740
And then they kind of cheat you

820
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,800
because you never get the big bang at the end.

821
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,680
No, you never do.

822
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,800
They just taunt and tease you

823
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,640
all through the movie about it.

824
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,420
But it does fit into the category

825
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,920
of end of the world movies.

826
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,840
And it was one of those movies

827
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,260
that the conspiracy sat on, sort of.

828
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,280
It might have shown at the art house

829
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,240
for a week or two.

830
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,240
Southland Tales.

831
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,160
It was by the guy that did Donnie Darko.

832
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,120
Yeah, and from the smell of it

833
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,620
they did sit on it for quite a long time, too.

834
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,560
By the time it reached

835
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,840
the average distribution house

836
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,520
which is not to say that some aren't average.

837
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,360
That some are...

838
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,380
Yeah.

839
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,600
A little abnormal.

840
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,760
I knew Ab.

841
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,140
I remember Ab.

842
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,540
He usually is at X Day.

843
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,940
Reverend Ab Normal.

844
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,060
And there was Oob,

845
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,760
his younger, unresolved brother.

846
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,720
They all had like Oob type names, didn't they?

847
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,800
Princess, wait.

848
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,700
When we woke up this morning,

849
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,340
I was dreaming that there was a baby's leg

850
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,420
sticking out from between my legs.

851
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,300
I was giving birth

852
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,480
and only this baby,

853
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,240
only the leg of the baby had emerged.

854
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,260
I just suddenly,

855
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,080
that just suddenly came into my head.

856
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,600
That was a most disturbing dream.

857
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,260
It is so disturbing.

858
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,340
It's still disturbing.

859
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,840
Well, you're giving birth to something

860
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,280
and it's taking a long time

861
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,220
and I don't think...

862
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,640
It was coming.

863
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
It was a breach, you know.

864
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,180
I mean, it was just one leg.

865
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,120
How do you get one leg out of a guy?

866
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,580
But don't be disappointed

867
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,600
when there's no head connected to the leg.

868
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,700
It was a big leg, though.

869
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,200
No, you transferred the famous story.

870
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,480
Daddy happy.

871
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,040
Right.

872
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
Our speaker from last weekend

873
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,680
that was delivering a breach birth,

874
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,120
that was, you transferred that story in your mind.

875
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,760
Ina May Gaskin had to deliver a breach birth

876
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,540
and you see, you just transferred that

877
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,520
combined with the advertisement for the hot dog

878
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,580
that was on the back cover

879
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,860
of the Green Lantern comic book.

880
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,400
Remember?

881
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,840
I chose not to.

882
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,660
Staying where you have earned.

883
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,160
Ha!

884
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,720
The End

885
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,360
Hey, cut it out.

886
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:13,940
Hey, cut out.

887
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,580
Say, how did you...

888
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,680
I thirst for knowledge.

889
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,400
Huh?

890
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,020
Huh?

891
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,620
Deep, dumb, and blind.

892
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,400
Beat it, huh?

893
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,640
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.

894
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,940
You're a fowler-upper.

895
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,640
You know, if I had a glass of beer, I'd cry into it.

896
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,200
Hey!

897
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,680
Hollins, smell up.

898
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

899
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,300
Beaten, stabbed, and tortured.

900
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,240
How do I know?

901
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,160
You don't.

902
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,600
You're right.

903
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

904
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,460
I know nothing.

905
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,040
Get down.

906
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,700
Get down.

907
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,560
You see too much.

908
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,740
You're getting awfully close to a bullet in your head, mister.

909
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,520
Shh.

910
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,340
There's someone at the door.

911
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,060
Shh.

912
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,940
There's someone at the door.

913
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,320
Yes.

914
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,060
Ow!

915
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:50,980
Yes.

916
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,720
Ow!

917
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,860
Hink, hink, hink.

918
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,200
Ah!

919
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,140
Mrs. Qualley.

920
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,620
Ah!

921
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,200
Well, what does he want me to do?

922
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,900
Come, go, turn handsprings, quote Shelley, play the bassoon?

923
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,560
Rat that even rats on rat pitch and catch.

924
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:03,840
What?

925
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,940
Yeah, I pitch like this.

926
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,660
Ow!

927
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,440
Ow!

928
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,000
Ow!

929
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,200
Ow!

930
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,260
Would you mind joining me here in the shaft, please?

931
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,700
And we're right near the top of the shaft.

932
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,180
Yes.

933
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,280
We've got to get off.

934
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,260
Here's news.

935
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,680
You can now get yellow sticks in all states where laws permit.

936
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,800
Yes, sticks.

937
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,920
Already colored a rich golden yellow.

938
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,920
You'll find yellow sticks cost a little more, largely because of the federal stick tax.

939
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,820
But it's a real saving for you in time and trouble.

940
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,200
Remember, where state laws permit, you can buy yellow sticks at the low economy price.

941
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,820
Try the new yellow sticks.

942
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,880
Smoke guns.

943
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,200
Like I said, brains got two sides.

944
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
We're on our bed.

945
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,140
You want to fill in the details for me?

946
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,160
I'll tell you this.

947
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,320
The plane switch might now be a coaxing good one.

948
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,080
Yeah.

949
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,440
All right, that's it.

950
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,880
Can't live without it.

951
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,360
Okay.

952
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,740
Well said.

953
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,520
Well put.

954
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,720
Well spoke.

955
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,340
Well spoken by Fernando Nambanin.

956
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,140
Fernando.

957
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,540
The more.

958
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,900
You know, you often can just give up your ideas of sitting down by your old radio and

959
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,480
listening to old radio shows, and you can just listen to Fernandez and get the same

960
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,620
excitement, the same...

961
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,500
Only he had to listen to the whole...

962
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,860
Well, Spotsnick...

963
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,140
He had to listen to the whole show to shorten it.

964
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,880
He didn't have to sit down that much.

965
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,220
Well, you did say he was crazy and lived in a moose or some sort of containing vessel.

966
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,780
No, I said that was you, Dave.

967
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,460
I live in no such animal and no containment vessel.

968
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,120
I'm as free as a Golden Glow Donuts.

969
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,420
Free as a goat.

970
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,120
I'm as free and as happy as a goat.

971
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,580
As brave and clever as a goat.

972
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,700
And do not...

973
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,660
You know, the thing about goat buttocks is not going to be mentioned during this alacritation.

974
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,400
Ha ha!

975
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,880
Oh, you ruined everything.

976
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,760
Fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh.

977
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,880
Yaa, yaa, yaa, yaa.

978
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,320
You're a bunch of billy goats.

979
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,860
Try to remain serious for as long as you can.

980
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,800
It is very difficult to do.

981
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,540
Everyone knows being silly comes easy.

982
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,100
Especially to...

983
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,640
To a Laughpire.

984
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,680
A Laughpire is a creature that sucks the laughter out of its victims.

985
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,960
Yes.

986
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,700
A Laughpire may drink your blood after making you laugh.

987
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,620
What about the other forms of vampirism involved in comedy?

988
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:03,040
Well, dude, I was thinking of a premise one time, and it's like, it's taken me two hours.

989
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,800
Like, I don't know what I was doing wrong or what I was taking.

990
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,380
I was just thinking of the timing, you know what I mean?

991
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,920
And like, I'm trying, you know, people at comedy, they say, you get anything done, you

992
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,080
know?

993
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,580
So like, no, you know?

994
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,320
And next thing you know, I just like, my capillaries and blood vessels just started like totally

995
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,780
popping out, you know?

996
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,020
Like I'm covered with human blood, my own, you know?

997
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,620
Totally.

998
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,100
So here's the premise.

999
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,600
I'm gonna die, you know?

1000
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,540
So I gotta go to the hospital.

1001
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
I dial 911.

1002
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,180
Dude, my face is...

1003
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,780
My face is...

1004
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,100
My finger fell off, man.

1005
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,420
I couldn't even dial.

1006
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,180
I'm gonna call.

1007
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,420
I couldn't even call, so like I had to do it with my elbow, and then we got married,

1008
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,460
and that was pretty much in the story.

1009
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,800
Wow, that's really not very fat, is it, dog?

1010
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,000
No, that's not very p-h-e-t at all, is it, dower girl?

1011
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,700
No, dog.

1012
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,560
It's kind of thin.

1013
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,960
I'm so old.

1014
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,760
I'm so old.

1015
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,560
I'm older.

1016
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:14,560
I'm so old that I was still saying man when dude became cool, and then I finally, by the

1017
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,380
time I finally started saying dude instead of man, everybody was saying dog, and I didn't

1018
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,500
even notice that until two nights ago.

1019
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,980
Well, they're actually going down an anthropological, archeological list from another world.

1020
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,760
These are animals, sentient, intelligent animals that exist in other worlds.

1021
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,280
The dude, for instance.

1022
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,940
The dude has a pyrotechnic range of perhaps 15 to 25 meters.

1023
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,740
He likes working with toilet paper, small children, and he enjoys being loved.

1024
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,420
Um, a dog?

1025
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,640
That's not a real dog.

1026
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,800
It's a dog man, a person that's half dog and half human.

1027
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,360
Wow.

1028
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,260
So man is interchangeable with dog at the end of any given sentence, right?

1029
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,160
Dog, man.

1030
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:57,980
Yo, yo.

1031
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,960
Man, yeah, dog.

1032
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,040
Drew that?

1033
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,400
Dude.

1034
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,060
Man.

1035
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,840
Oh, I did it again.

1036
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,980
You guys are so cool.

1037
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,540
I'm like so out of it.

1038
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,300
I don't know any of your cool jive talk.

1039
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,980
I'm just like a little square girl.

1040
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,240
You're big, silly.

1041
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,820
I think you're kind of round.

1042
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,520
There's something wrong with your mind.

1043
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,360
It's the inside of my brain that's square, man.

1044
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,540
I'm like all nerdified inside of there instead of being all curvy and groovy.

1045
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,560
Right.

1046
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,680
Right.

1047
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:33,420
Yeah.

1048
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,140
Yeah.

1049
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,060
Yeah.

1050
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,300
Yeah.

1051
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:36,300


1052
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:36,300


1053
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,260
Yeah.

1054
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:37,380
Yeah.

1055
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,200
I mean, dude, uh.

1056
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,000
Right.

1057
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,520
Okay, then chuh.

1058
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,720
Yeah.

1059
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,940
Um, that's not the worst part.

1060
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,860
Some of them were crawling up on their hands and knees.

1061
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,720
We looked out the window and we could see thousands of them.

1062
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,860
Their little heads were all bandaged up.

1063
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,420
They were cursing and shouting and some were laughing.

1064
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,840
They were singing songs to the happy goo goo and the other god dancers.

1065
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,280
The god dancers were relentless.

1066
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,540
I was like, what?

1067
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:01,540


1068
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:01,540


1069
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:01,540


1070
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:01,540


1071
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:01,540


1072
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:01,540


1073
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:01,540


1074
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:01,540


1075
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,420
I E cũng不知道 chat어서 They were singing...

1076
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:11,260
So cool guys just coating each other with dust continue looking like Tool Girl just

1077
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:11,720
Wie to get plenty越

1078

bitch.

1080
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:21,380
And I didn't look around to verify that rope, voice.

1081
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:21,580
I just did it.

1082
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:28,560
the pipe of tobs swirling in the air like an an acronym or perhaps an anagram and we took it down

1083
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:37,760
to our hearts and smoked it and it was good i could tell it was good when they smoked the pipe

1084
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,900
it was good unto them you know what though it felt good a minute ago to me to say praise rob

1085
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,580
instead of praise bob i think i'm getting tired of bob but rob actually you and rob actually have

1086
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,740
kind of a thing going don't you like you praise him and then he prays you and then you praise

1113
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,380


1114
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,380


1115
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,440
he are we all Rey cadこんにちは

1116
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:37,140
yes i am Cobes and the word was i found on hickory

1117
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,160
i camekost and all started in there and that was that was argued and completely

1118
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:47,980
i i even i think to rob was i i feel this way about his family and that he put the thought

1119
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,520
on so many things i come across uh real Espaännese people their mother wanted bullshit and their

1120
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,360
He's been obliterated from his brain cells permanently.

1121
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,580
Permanently.

1122
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,040
We've never been told what Bob's mom and daddy have done for it.

1123
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,500
Today I heard his mom was a looker in the day.

1124
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,180
And I heard Pappy was quite a fighting man and a lover man.

1125
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,780
But I'm not sure because prescriptions does not prescribe.

1126
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,280
It only prescribes.

1127
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,120
Take two, three, four, however many you can stand.

1128
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,760
It proscribes quite a bit.

1129
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:22,700
There are many thou shalt nots involved in the law as handed down by the Dobbs.

1130
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,600
But we lost that copy of the law.

1131
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,340
So we don't know what we're not supposed to do.

1132
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,240
We only know what we're supposed to do, which was question authority.

1133
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,520
But where does that get you?

1134
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,840
That just means that you shouldn't even do that much.

1135
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,140
Right.

1136
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,180
Because who told us to question authority?

1137
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,280
The authorities.

1138
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,680
Right.

1139
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,020
Tim Leary, Bob Dobbs, all those guys.

1140
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,780
Question authority, question authority.

1141
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:43,800
Why?

1142
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,440
Why?

1143
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,820
Because I said so.

1144
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:50,740
Even the questioning has become a rote, Bobbyistic thing to do.

1145
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,480
I stand there at those devivals.

1146
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,780
I stand up there and I go, question authority.

1147
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,640
And a whole audience out there goes, why?

1148
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,020
Because they've been trained to.

1149
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,420
They've been trained without questioning.

1150
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,220
Then now question authority.

1151
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,300
Like a bunch of robots.

1152
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:07,960
Exactly.

1153
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,400
A bunch of automatons, they say.

1154
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:10,480
Why?

1155
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,200
It's like him.

1156
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,180
Why should I question authority, Reverend Stang?

1157
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:14,460
Why?

1158
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,720
But they're not really asking that question.

1159
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,940
They're just saying it because I told them to.

1160
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,520
They're saying it by rote.

1161
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,040
Right.

1162
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,660
They're posing back at the demagoguery.

1163
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:27,720
And the point and question you make in your flimsy, flaccid arguments are hardly borne out,

1164
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,460
I'd say, by the airborne diseases you carry.

1165
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,120
You better watch the way you say that word flaccid, buddy.

1166
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,360
Oh.

1167
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,840
Well, it's coming up near to end of showtime.

1168
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,540
And I'm sure that there are many people out there who have cause to celebrate.

1169
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:41,680


1170
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,820
We have a little bit of Hungarian in this, don't we?

1171
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,680
Is that what tomorrow is?

1172
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:48,460
St. Oro's Day?

1173
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:48,960
Yeah.

1174
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,560
Hungarian Day.

1175
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,120
It is the anniversary.

1176
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,160
St. Vlad the Impaler's Day.

1177
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:59,100
Everybody wear your little white teeth on your lapel.

1178
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,560
That's Carpathian.

1179
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,400
That's not Hungarian.

1180
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,720
No, that's not Hungarian.

1181
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,860
Actually, that's Romanian.

1182
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,500
I'm sorry.

1183
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,420
Terribly, terribly sorry.

1184
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,080
Romanian.

1185
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,800
I don't want to offend anyone.

1186
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,200
I'm sorry.

1187
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,000
No, I don't want to start another fight over Carpathia.

1188
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,600
No.

1189
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,520
Don't get all dracul.

1190
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,920
Certainly not.

1191
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:16,840
Okay.

1192
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,620
Okay.

1193
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,160
Okay.

1194
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:18,540
Okay.

1195
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:28,700
I'm going to let over janitor Philo finish the show off so that the next show can come in and take over.

1196
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,600
Is that okay with you guys?

1197
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,840
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name.

1198
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,840
Dr. Hal?

1199
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:43,960
That's your statement.

1200
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,480
Well, I...

1201
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,720
I wish I knew.

1202
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,960
I think they're still readying it.

1203
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:53,620
They're primping it and propping it into shape and lightly slapping it and powdering it.

1204
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,840
And really, they're doing everything they can.

1205
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,220
Clipping its umbilical cord.

1206
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,620
Well, they may be buffing its nails.

1207
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,260
That works.

1208
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,500
That'll wake it up.

1209
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,100
That'll devour its placenta.

1210
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,560
A complete peanut butter facial.

1211
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,500
A lube job and acupuncture.

1212
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,400
A double facial.

1213
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,460
Rolfing, ralphing, and retching.

1214
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,800
But when it's all done, it's not only going to be a radio station, it's going to be a cafe.

1215
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,440
Cool.

1216
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,240
It's a radio station.

1217
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:24,880
It's a cafe.

1218
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,360
It's a radio station.

1219
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,740
It's a cafe.

1220
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,960
Hey, you're both wrong and you're both right.

1221
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,780
It's a radio station and a cafe.

1222
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,120
So while you're trying to do a show, there's a bunch of geeks googling you.

1223
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,660
It's a radio station.

1224
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,420
Through a window or a sheet of glass.

1225
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,320
And they probably don't have a permit for either one, right?

1226
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,300
Yes, they don't realize that they have to...

1227
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,340
There's the Brother Hal guy.

1228
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,780
They've opened a real mare's nest now.

1229
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,080
A can of squirming, hydra-headed, medusa-like worms.

1230
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,880
Brother Hal, yeah.

1231
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,200
Because they're going to have to run a cafe as well as a radio station.

1232
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,580
And to run a cafe, that means you have to have multiple bathrooms and they have to have wheelchair rides.

1233
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,300
Captain Stang.

1234
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,140
Yes, and wheelchair rides, too, so no one feels left out.

1235
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,400
Captain Stang.

1236
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,500
Commissar evidence.

1237
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,540
Yeah, okay.

1238
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,940
Anyway, Pirate Cat Radio.

1239
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:12,380
And what's Philo?

1240
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,700
There's only one more of those shows.

1241
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:14,900
No, he's the overman.

1242
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,520
No, no, no, he's like Janitor Overman Philo.

1243
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,720
Janitor Hyperthete?

1244
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,400
He gets three names.

1245
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,260
Over Janitor Philo.

1246
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,860
You know, there's...

1247
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:25,960
Oh, well.

1248
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,800
I don't care.

1249
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,640
All right.

1250
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,940
That was a great band, I don't care.

1251
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,920
I don't care.

1252
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,060
It was a great band.

1253
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,600
So vigorous.

1254
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,780
I don't cares on fourth.

1255
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,480
But who's on first?

1256
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,160
What about if you had a guy whose name was...

1257
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:43,920
Your hair's on.

1258
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:44,300


1259
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,540
Then you have a mayor of Cleveland.

1260
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,720
If his hair actually did catch on fire...

1261
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,180
The mayor of...

1262
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,880
And you said, hey, your hair's on fire.

1263
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,860
He'd go, yeah, so what?

1264
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,360
So you're yelling my name at me.

1265
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:56,840
Big deal.

1266
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,340
From PR News in Washington, I'm committed to helping PR's reports.

1267
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:07,120
Pentagon officials say that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should be totally different,

1268
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:12,240
but they have a high degree of confidence that they should be larger than the size of a football.

1269
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,280
But they can't tell for sure just yet.

1270
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,280


1271
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,300
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton collided off the Florida Panhandle yesterday.

1272
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:24,780
They crashed into the Gulf of Mexico after a crippling PR News from Washington.

1273
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,880
PR News by Lee Moore.

1274
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:35,400
And now to take us out, dear friends, Bob Walkenhorst live at the Record Bar with an old song.

1275
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,000
The Record Bar.

1276
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,560
The Record Bar.

1277
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,920
The Record Bar.

1278
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,880
The Record Bar.

1279
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,260
The Record Bar.

1280
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,500
The Record Bar.

1281
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,940
It's about recordар norm.

1282
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:51,940
The Record Bar.

1283
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:51,940


1284
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:51,940


1285
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:51,940


1286
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:51,940


1287
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:51,940


1288
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:51,940


1289
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:51,940


1290
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:51,940


1291
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,600
I'd be Conventional on that record.

1292
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,020
I'm a football coach, of course and I could be somewhere else.

1293
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,240
So here we are.

1294
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,240


1295
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,240


1296
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,240


1297
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,240


1298
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,240


1299
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,240


1300
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,240


1301
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,440
Morning as my son Dorry writes the super fetish trotters.

1302
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,880
Rachel dozen said it's Come On пор Traven.

1303
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:10,260
So Billy smells, NEWS.

1304
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,040
ar, let her come over.

1305
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,480
See you next week, bye.

1306
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:13,900
Bye.

1307
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,260
Bye.

1308
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,300
Take a load off of Manny

1309
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,800
Take a load off of me

1310
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,040
Take a load off of Manny

1311
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,660
Manny

1312
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:32,080
You put the load, you put the load right on me

1313
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,100
Manny

1314
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:35,400
Manny

1315
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,620
On my big piece of the flag

1316
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,340
I went a-lookin' for a place to hide

1317
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:52,900
I went a-saw a-comin' in a hill walkin' side to side

1318
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,120
Say, little Dick Thomas

1319
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,120
Come on, let's go downtown

1320
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,480
Say, I got a boy

1321
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,140
But my friend can't stick around

1322
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,600
Take a load off of me

1323
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,480

1324
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,700

Take a load off of Manny

1326
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,720
Manny

1327
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,760
You put the load, you put the load right on me

1328
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,440
Manny

1329
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:39,000
Crazy chance to find me

1330
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,600
And if I feel like I'm gonna die

1331
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:41,600


1332
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,060
I'm gonna call the police

1333
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:46,200
Said, how did you get here?

1334
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:46,860
Said, I'm next to the head

1335
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,040
And you can take a check on the file

1336
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,120
Said, wait a minute, Chester

1337
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,380
You know I'm a piece of the bag

1338
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,940
Said, that's okay, boy

1339
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,120
Won't you leave him there, you can

1340
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,580
Take a load off of Manny

1341
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:13,060

1344
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,680
Manny

1345
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,280
You put the load right on me

1346
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,840
You put the load right on me

1347
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:36,280
Go down to Spores's

1348
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,340
There's nothin' you can see

1349
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,220
It's just so blue

1350
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:47,340
And it's was waiting on the children's name

1351
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:51,660
The old man with a mouth of brandy

1352
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,420
Put a valium in the oven

1353
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,660
Said, do me a favor, son

1354
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,000
Won't you save me now

1355
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,320

1358
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:09,320


1359
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:09,320


1360
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,720
Take a load off me

1361
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,240
Take a load off Fanny

1362
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,780
Fanny

1363
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,060
Take a load right off me

1364
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,700
Catch a cannonball

1365
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,000
Now take me down the line

1366
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,680
My bag is stinking low

1367
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,080
And I do believe it's time

1368
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,320
To get back to Miss Fanny

1369
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,480
You know she's in a hurry

1370
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:01,720
To send me in with dirty guards for everyone

1371
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,460
Take a load off Fanny

1372
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,300

1373
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,580
