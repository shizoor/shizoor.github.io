1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,380
Ah, the one that's not real. That's the one you must listen to, darling. Now, just come over here and sit on my lap.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,240
But it doesn't really make noise.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,100
I know my knee looks a little strange.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,000
It only makes noise when I turn the pages or when I close it or open it.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,040
I had a few additions made. What now? What did you say?

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,720
It only makes noise when I open it or close it. It doesn't make noise. And, like, talk to me like I thought you meant when you said that.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, we'll try and close it and open it very gently.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,480
Wrap it around your head and listen real carefully to the printed letters on that book.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,980
The Bible is a beautiful story, but this book is even better.

10
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,960
The Bible is a beautiful story, but this book is even better.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Humans, on the other hand, don't have to. We have a choice.

12
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,740
If you don't like your place in the world, you can get off anytime you want.

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,860
Suicide. That's right.

14
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,620
If you don't like the way your life's going, you don't like the way you are in the world, anything around you, you can check out anytime you like.

15
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,120
Animals aren't allowed that thought.

16
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,980
And believe me, if they were.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,540
They would use us.

18
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,280
There'd be a lot of dogs and cats owned by assholes who live in high-rises diving out the windows.

19
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,820
Zebras, if they even had remotely that thought, would take a look at themselves and go,

20
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,180
What the fuck?

21
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,620
Black and white, the green and brown world.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,900
Now, this blows.

23
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm just gonna jump in the river.

24
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,440
I don't have a thumb to work a gun or hold a knife.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,040
I don't have a jar of pills.

26
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,260
I'm just gonna dive into the next lion's mouth.

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,780
Why even bother?

28
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,800
Now, monkeys have the opposable thumb, so they could kind of do it the exact same way we do.

29
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,700
Now, there's a bunch of people that say, oh, it's against the law.

30
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,700
Well, it's only against the law if you do a crappy job and you get caught.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,460
Other people say, oh, we should save them.

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,780
Yeah, well, you know what?

33
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,000
Not everybody wants to be saved.

34
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,040
Not everybody should be saved.

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,640
And who are we to force our will upon them?

36
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,440
I mean, isn't that one of the joys about being a human?

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,060
Freedom of choice?

38
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,140
Now, it's not all bad.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,600
Now, I'm not saying kill yourself.

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,300
But if you're gonna be an idiot and do it anyway,

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
there's no sweat off of my back.

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,300
There's a lot of good that could come from it.

43
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,480
A little bit of bad thrown in.

44
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,600
Some of the things, a job will open.

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,120
An apartment will become available.

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,940
There'll be more air for me.

47
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,920
They say there's two girls for every guy.

48
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,720
If you're a man, there'll be four chicks for me.

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,520
There'll be more Kettle One vodka for me.

50
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,960
There'll be one less idiot in line at the bank

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,940
who gets up to the window without their fucking slips filled out.

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,560
I won't ever have to go to the store

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,780
to buy my favorite salt and vinegar chips

54
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,560
and have the clerk point to you and say,

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
they bought the last bag.

56
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,580
You won't help change the McDonald's sign

57
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,220
to 100 billion served.

58
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,100
You'll never get AIDS.

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,080
You won't have to worry about calories ever.

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,560
No more.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,600
Hey, does this make me look fat?

62
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
There'll be one less polluting human.

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,380
You won't have to recycle.

64
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,620
There'll be one less car on the road.

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,920
There'll be more ringdings for me.

66
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,100
50 or so chickens' lives will be spared.

67
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,860
Your fingers won't ever get red from eating pistachios.

68
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,100
You won't be forced to visit your grandparents on Sundays anymore.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,180
No more church.

70
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,180
You'll be saying, hey world, kiss my ass.

71
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,980
No more wet dreams about to come true.

72
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:54,980


73
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:54,980


74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:54,980


75
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,940
No more about supermodels.

76
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,340
No more Barry Manilow.

77
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,220
For a few years, anyway.

78
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,560
Wondering, am I a loser?

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,960
Will be a thing of the past.

80
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,700
Say goodbye to crappy Xmas presents from aunts and uncles.

81
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,360
You won't have to suffer through a motley crew reunion.

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,640
Fuck flossing and brushing.

83
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,880
You'll never lose sleep over a pregnancy scare.

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,520
Adios, acne.

85
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,240
Worrying whether you fit in or not won't be on your brain.

86
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,900
See you later, homework.

87
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,300
You'll never have to sit through another movie brought to you by the creators of South Park.

88
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,200
School's out forever.

89
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,060
No more paying bills.

90
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,980
You won't have to do chores.

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
You won't be able to run over toads with a lawnmower, though.

92
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,100
You'll also miss McDonald's french fries.

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,360
Bugs Bunny.

94
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,320
The amazing electrifying feeling that surges through your body when you kiss someone for the first time.

95
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,200
You won't be able to watch the letterbox director's cut of Jaws.

96
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,260
Candy.

97
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,960
Living above ground.

98
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,080
Pudding crust.

99
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,040
You'll miss the rush of getting your first apartment.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,780
Getting to the point in your life where you can tell your parents to fuck off.

101
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,380
I gotta make my own mistakes.

102
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,100
You did.

103
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,500
You'll miss sex.

104
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,760
You'll miss thinking about it, looking for it.

105
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,580
Sex by yourself.

106
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,780
Sex with a partner.

107
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,100
Sex with multiple partners.

108
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,720
No more summer nights that seem to go on forever.

109
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,840
Roller coasters.

110
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,280
Naming your kid the name you always wanted.

111
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,880
Making a difference in the world.

112
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,760
You'll miss the experience and pleasure of hallucinogenics.

113
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,960
Watching your neighbors watch.

114
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,800
A wife change clothes with her blinds open.

115
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,780
A lifetime of masturbating.

116
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,960
Watching your favorite team sweep the series.

117
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,420
Music.

118
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,020
You will definitely miss music.

119
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,580
Trying to sneak into your house drunk three hours past your curfew.

120
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,640
You'll miss the blazing glory of the 4th of July fireworks.

121
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,200
The taste of Captain Crunch.

122
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,040
If you're a boy, you'll miss the feeling the first time you reach up a girl's shirt.

123
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,560
If you're a girl, the feeling the first time you reach down a boy's pants.

124
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,020
You'll miss your favorite coat.

125
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,880
Waffles with whipped cream and strawberries.

126
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,080
Beating your friends at video games.

127
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,560
You won't be around to see what shape and color the new marshmallow and Lucky Charms will be.

128
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,980
You'll miss the feeling you'll get when reminiscing about your first love 30 years after the fact.

129
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,300
The joy of giving and receiving at Christmas.

130
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,340
Skinny dipping.

131
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,640
Getting stoned.

132
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,840
Reading Green Eggs and Ham.

133
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,280
And eating like a horse that got loose in the grain bin.

134
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,380
Flying cars.

135
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,180
Hey, you were born.

136
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,500
Finish what was started.

137
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,660
The guy who slagged the football team.

138
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,960
Those jobs were not for him.

139
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,480
He turns into a real estate agent who believes in discipline.

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,020
The guy who's first to use cocaine.

141
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,500
The wild boy breaking free.

142
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,080
He'll end up in a court of law as a prosecuting QC.

143
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,860
Remember the school captain?

144
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,880
Success was a matter of time.

145
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,180
I can hear her now as she screams,

146
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,780
Greg, you missed the stop sign.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,660
Forget Snoop Doggy Dog.

148
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,260
Forget old iced tea.

149
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,600
The true word out on the streets is produced by the DAC.

150
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,700
What's the use of striving?

151
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,860
Life's road in front unravels.

152
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,600
We get to do the driving.

153
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,440
Don't choose the direction we travel.

154
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Do your homework and wait for weeks.

155
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,000
Completely the damn, don't lie.

156
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,340
It don't matter much when you hear that scream.

157
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
Greg, you missed the stop sign.

158
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,760
Greg, the stop sign.

159
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,500
Greg, the stop sign.

160
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,000
Greg, the stop sign.

161
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,720
Greg, the stop sign.

162
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,780
Sometime in the next ten thousand years,

163
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,540
a comet's gonna wipe out old Tracer Man.

164
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,520
I'm banking on it coming before my end of year exam.

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,820
The rich kid becomes a junkie.

166
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,640
The poor kid an advertiser.

167
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,400
What a tragic waste of potential.

168
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,480
Being a junkie's not so good either.

169
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,360
Your folks work hard for what you got.

170
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,960
You are the fruit of their vine.

171
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,220
Who cares what you sow and what you reap?

172
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,160
It's Greg, you missed the stop sign.

173
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,680
Hey, it's Greg.

174
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,460
Home for your daily good Albar,

175
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,460
Home for your daily good sleep.

176
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,760
Home for leaving your books to sleep.

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:21,760

183
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,260
Home for one Quel Inurita.

184
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,540
Home for приходatib running in the thaw.

185
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,120
Man, could that baby run?

186
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,780
But you know what they always say

187
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,540
There's always a better one

188
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,240
Got a tumor in my brain

189
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,100
It's creeping to my lungs

190
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,560
And I'm searching around in vain

191
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,380
Can't find me a better one

192
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,960
I'm winding to everyone's head

193
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,240
Is the person it gonna be?

194
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,700
Growing up's not a matter of choice

195
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,980
It's a matter of wait and see

196
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,380
So kids, yeah, you can do it

197
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,820
You can be your best

198
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,660
Girls can do anything

199
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,540
You can pass the test

200
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm okay, you're okay

201
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,300
We're okay, we're fine

202
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,460
I thought I heard a semi-trailer

203
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,540
Glad you missed the stop sign

204
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,820
Freaky stop sign

205
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,700
Freaky stop sign

206
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
Freaky stop sign

207
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,060
Freaky stop sign

208
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,780
Freaky stop sign

209
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,620
Freaky stop sign

210
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,440
Freaky stop sign

211
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,880
Freaky stop sun

212
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,040
The Thousandth and Tenth Day of the Human Totem Pole

213
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:34,680
The morning was the temper gray of the thousandth and tenth day of the human totem pole.

214
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,860
The man at the bottom was smiling.

215
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,760
He had just finished his breakfast smiling.

216
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,200
It hadn't rained or manured for over two hours.

217
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,040
The man at the top was starving.

218
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:02,540
The pole was a horrible looking thing with all of those eyes and ears and waving hands for balance.

219
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,960
There was no way to get a copter in close, so everybody was starving together.

220
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:16,060
The man at the top had long ago given up but didn't have nerve enough to climb down.

221
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,780
At night the pole would talk to itself and the chatter wasn't too good.

222
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,460
Obviously the pole didn't like itself.

223
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,500
It wanted to walk.

224
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,060
It was the summer and it was hot.

225
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,760
And balance wouldn't permit a skinning to undergarments.

226
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,260
It was an integrated pole.

227
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,860
It was taking on a reddish brown cast.

228
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,140
Exercise on the pole was isometric.

229
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,400
Kind of a flex and then balance.

230
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,080
Then the eyes would roll together.

231
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,700
The ears wiggle.

232
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,040
Hands balance.

233
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,520
There was a gurgling and googling herd.

234
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,380
A tenth of the way up the pole.

235
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,460
Approaching was a small child with Statue of Liberty doll.

236
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,560
The

237
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,980
chance to giggle?

238
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,460
all have been ever since came from a

239
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:41,460


240
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,720
forget it!

241
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,380
and then again travel down across the

242
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:53,060
Madeleine unhappy犬iv scent magic

243
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,960
Astounding! Captain Beefheart there and the Magic Band.

244
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:09,620
The 1010th day of the Human Totem Pole from the album Ice Cream for Crow.

245
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:20,180
Before that, friends, that song, Greg the Stop Sign, is by a British group called This Is Serious, Mum.

246
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,620
That's the name of the group, This Is Serious, Mum.

247
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:32,300
And you can get more information about them from www.tism.

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,660
That's short for This Is Serious, Mum.

249
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:42,020
www.tism.wanker.com

250
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
tism.wanker.com

251
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,620
And friends, before that, that incredible song about suicide.

252
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,900
And why and why not, is by a comedian named Bobby Gaylor.

253
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,820
Dr. Lagune sent me a copy of that.

254
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,220
It's from an album called Fuzzatonic Scream.

255
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,200
And you can check out bobbygaylor.com.

256
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,660
That's spelled G-A-Y-L-O-R.

257
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,980
Bobby Gaylor.

258
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,400
Just amazing.

259
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,340
And it helps set the theme of anti-slack.

260
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,800
As it is taken away from us.

261
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,640
And somehow it always returns back to slack.

262
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,140
Friends, yes, slack.

263
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:39,200
And for more slack, we're going to go back in time to the old subgenius Media Barrage number 11.

264
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,860
Once a tape, and now a CD.

265
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,820
We're remastering it.

266
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,120
Made from tapes created in the early 1980s.

267
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,460
1980s.

268
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,240
And, uh...

269
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,580
And friends, after that, I don't know what we're going to play.

270
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,900
I ain't going to make any decisions right now.

271
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,620
This music by Tipsy in the background from their album Uh-Oh.

272
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,380
Is...

273
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,040
It just makes me want to slack off.

274
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,740
I'm going to duck the responsibility, dear friends.

275
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,440
As Aleister Crowley once said, if I can't be God, I'm not going to play.

276
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,220
This ain't no video game church.

277
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,680
It ain't no church of bingo.

278
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,500
It's a church.

279
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:19,920
It's a Bob.

280
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,820
It's a Bob Rice's church.

281
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,960
I don't see what the hell's going on here.

282
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,720
What the hell?

283
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,180
Did you know that heaven, Christian heaven is hotter than the Christian hell?

284
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:28,960
Yes.

285
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,440
The Christian heaven is hotter.

286
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,680
That's because there are seven sons.

287
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,100
And the subgenius hell is fun.

288
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,740
Oh, yeah.

289
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,160
All your friends will be down there.

290
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,480
No.

291
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,360
There's seven sons.

292
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,520
There's seven sons around the Christian heaven.

293
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,040
This is true.

294
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,540
You can find it in their own Bible.

295
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,160
They admit it.

296
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,440
And seven sons would make it much hotter than the gaseous molten threshold of brimstone.

297
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,600
That means that heaven is hotter than hell.

298
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:49,840
Hell.

299
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,460
They've been lying to you all this time.

300
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,180
Without anything open, they lie about friends.

301
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,280
They lie about that.

302
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,400
The world isn't coming to an end right away.

303
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,600
In 15 years.

304
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,540
Of course it's coming to an end in 15 years.

305
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,200
It can't last any longer.

306
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,840
It wasn't built to last.

307
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,240
It wasn't meant to last.

308
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,040
It's inferior.

309
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,540
Well, it's a Spartan universe.

310
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,400
The cult is full of superstition and mysticism.

311
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,140
We're scientists.

312
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,840
We're able to argue anything us and ask any questions about ourselves.

313
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:33,320
In the hands of a human instinct in that universe, our Wall Street odds were across,

314
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,320


315
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,960
All day, you lie about.

316
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,840
So drop your quarters, or hang yourself a column from the wall or notice this paper to find somebody.

317
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,520
I might, I might do it again.

318
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:42,700
But it can't be.

319
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,240


320
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,320
But we've got to do it again.

321
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,580
But, but how we do it again.

322
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,740
issued a press statement that the world was coming to an end.

323
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,920
Now, that's the same story the cult of the Book of Revelations had been preaching.

324
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,160
Now, when a scientist backs that up, it's news.

325
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,100
Our conclusions have nothing to do with the cult.

326
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,920
Well, today we deal with Bible prophecy.

327
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,560
But the Word of God tells us we can expect nothing but trouble and turmoil in the Middle East

328
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,700
until our Lord returns to be the Prince of Peace.

329
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,780
Bob?

330
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:17,940
Bob?

331
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,260
It's been known for some time that the fossil record contains several very pronounced mass extinctions,

332
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,600
when large numbers of quite unrelated species from all kinds of habitats

333
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,800
appear to die out during a relatively short period.

334
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,440
You have, say, an asteroid about 10 kilometers across,

335
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,320
impacting on the Earth at a speed of about 40 kilometers a second.

336
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,200
Did you hear what he was saying?

337
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,940
Did you hear what he was saying?

338
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,660
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

339
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,980
Perhaps in the form of an atomic holocaust?

340
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,120
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

341
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,180
The White House will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.

342
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,660
And our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

343
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,600
Those missiles have all gone off.

344
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,320
They pushed all the punch...

345
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,140
You know what that means, don't you?

346
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,980
Either we fired first and they're going to try to hit what's left,

347
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,920
or they fired first and we just got our missiles...

348
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,080
out of the ground in time.

349
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,320
Either way, we're going to get hit.

350
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,120
So what are we still standing around here for?

351
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,080
Of course, since all human life has been under the surface of Earth for 16 years,

352
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,740
there was no actual loss of life in the sense we know it.

353
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,800
What you see is what you get.

354
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,160
What you get, what you get.

355
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,480
What the hell did you expect?

356
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,880
What you expect, what you expect.

357
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,220
Pretty red roses.

358
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,200
White puppy noses.

359
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,820
Mammoth rubber hoses in his small leg.

360
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,240
Yes!

361
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,220
Oh!

362
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,060
The strange worshippers pull at their faces.

363
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,200
Despite himself, a strangled cry escapes Brent...

364
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,340
Ah!

365
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,940
...as he sees the ghastly heritage of atomic radiation.

366
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,720
Hey, Tony! Let's have some!

367
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,780
Get me out of here!

368
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,920
I mean, hell, this turn, the other cheap thing could be carried a bit too far, you know.

369
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,820
Hey, neighbor, let me give you some advice.

370
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,520
The Russians are about to pulverize those in our sleep tonight.

371
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,740
That is if the crazy Arabs...

372
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,440
...social rights don't get us first.

373
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,700
And the fire will rain down from the sky.

374
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,600
The fire will rain down from the sky.

375
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,980
The fire will rain down from the sky.

376
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,320
People die.

377
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,260
People die.

378
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,240
People die.

379
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,100
People die.

380
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,400
The gurgle of a death rattle.

381
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,420
The awful heat.

382
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,880
And I couldn't see...

383
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,380
...the smell.

384
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,900
The terrible rotten smell of burning flesh.

385
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,180
Help me, please.

386
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,820
You're just a bomb!

387
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,200
Yeah! Get a bomb, you son of a bitch!

388
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,680
...

389
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:52,680


390
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,640
...

391
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,280
Why did we come all this way?

392
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,700
Why did we come all this way?

393
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,640
But the trouble is that all this knowledge I've got hold of is useless.

394
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,240
We're going to come back in just a moment.

395
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,100
We're going to have some strong comments about this.

396
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,500
And we're going to continue with it.

397
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,500
It's no wonder one group of kids said we're a...

398
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,360
...a generation that's been born under the mushroom cloud.

399
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,400
Here on the subgenius death ship, we approach San Francisco.

400
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,900
Our mission, destroy anything.

401
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,300
Somebody help.

402
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,540
Help me, please.

403
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,020
Has this ever happened to you?

404
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,840
Meltdown.

405
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,280
Please remove all humans from container area six.

406
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,380
Doug, pull over. We've got to scrape the collar off the front of the show.

407
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,280
If we have another collar...

408
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,300
If we get another collar on the front of this show smeared like that last one, we're going to be in severe heat damage.

409
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,260
Well, I don't think we should drive the show so fast.

410
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,920
Well, you're right.

411
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,540
It's just stupid to keep wasting fuel running over listeners like this.

412
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,900
There is no collar.

413
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,800
There never has been a collar.

414
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,200
We're listening to tapes. All the collars are gone.

415
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,520
The show was just a tape, right?

416
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,840
Yes.

417
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,960
This joke has been real.

418
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,160
Well, but they did survive and they're willing to give us their wristwatches and most of their...

419
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,060
Imagine listening to this show and surviving.

420
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,940
Internal organs.

421
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,420
Unfortunate. Yes, it was.

422
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,280
We do have some...

423
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,900
The doctors were still here.

424
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,120
Good morning, tiny collar.

425
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,680
Don't drive any faster.

426
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,680
Yes, well, it would have been nice to hear your message, but at this hour we're asking all messages.

427
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,540
Ten minutes left to rotate your message toward the war and off the planet.

428
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,520
So aim high with us. To find out more, all you have to do is speak with your nearest Air Force recruiter.

429
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,820
Ah, that's more like it.

430
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,040
We're all in the Air Force now. We're all heading toward Grenada.

431
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,840
Los Angeles approach control. This is...

432
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,340
No, no, wait. We're over Los Angeles. Don't drop the bomb now.

433
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,620
Oh, look out. It's too late.

434
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,020
...Los Angeles.

435
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,400
...Los Angeles.

436
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,680
...Los Angeles.

437
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,600
Holy cow, that's an L.A. stadium down there.

438
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,400
...five-two at five thousand, especially around control.

439
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,520
Oh, this is awful. What are we going to tell the newspapers?

440
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,180
...Los Angeles.

441
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,940
...and no one can catch anything, but it's exploding bright.

442
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,020
They're congratulating us.

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,960
They're congratulating us.

444
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,680
Look at that beautiful bomb pattern.

445
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,160
...as half the Olympics taken out in one final sweep of sub-genius terror.

446
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,560
I'd say that was one of the most beautiful patterns I've seen in the performance so far.

447
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,760
I think that'll get a nine for most of the judges, don't you?

448
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,980
Down there on the floor.

449
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,140
That was a flawless performance on that last explosion.

450
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:34,500
The Olympic nuclear explosion competition has been a fierce and competitive one with some unexpected contributors.

451
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,220
Oh, yes, the LA Olympics, this certainly...

452
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,840
...smaller countries, but this...

453
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,980
I'm glad I got my tickets there.

454
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,660
...so close.

455
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,320
I got my ticket for my Cabbage Patch Doll.

456
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,000
Well, I hope you left that Cabbage Patch Doll at the door.

457
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,780
The baby's gone.

458
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,920
There's no place in the future...

459
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,060
...because you know they said some of them have a mind of their own.

460
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,740
...the minks of the rich have...

461
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,140
But silence did not follow.

462
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,960
The awful heat.

463
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,400
And I couldn't see.

464
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,640
Oh, ground zero...

465
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,700
I couldn't stand it.

466
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,620
...is the place for...

467
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,760
The smell.

468
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,480
...the smell.

469
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
...the terrible life...

470
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,560
...the terrible life...

471
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,700
No, the terrible experience was far und Adele's Wilcoel.

472
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,880
Ground Zero...

473
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,720
...is the place for me.

474
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,640
images of bunch of people

475
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,640


476
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,640


477
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,640


478
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,640


479
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,640


480
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,320
ground zero

481
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,400
Is the place for me.

482
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,400


483
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,400


484
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,380
I can't believe it...

485
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,480
ground zero

486
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,800
ground zero

487
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,660
ground zero

488
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,220
have we met again?

489
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,780
Bon idotif means I'm here for you.

490
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,000
Andy, Marty, andob以

491
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,000


492
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,540
I can't believe it, because Idotif iske

493
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:37,540


494
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:37,540


495
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,660
Can someone help me?

496
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,600
irane

497
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,080
that was good.

498
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That's utter nonsense.

499
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,760
The future is always nonsense

500
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,860
until it becomes the past.

501
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,740
I'm sorry, but you see,

502
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,900
it is my curse to tell the absolute truth.

503
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,640
Oh, gloom and destruction.

504
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,920
Despair, hopelessness.

505
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,260
Dark foreboding of consciousness.

506
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,200
Oh, poverty and hate.

507
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,040
Oh, kill little kids.

508
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,020
Oh, Brian De Palma movies.

509
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,680
A world of destruction.

510
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,640
Darkness and despair.

511
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,620
Gloom, chaos, anarchy.

512
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,420
A hopeless culture.

513
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,320
Self-indulgence.

514
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,320
Inter-evil perverseness.

515
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,080
It's like Jones told me that one time.

516
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,320
He said, if you can't X that tractor out of your ass,

517
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,200
you don't ever get to heaven.

518
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,320
Oh, darkness, gloom, destruction, despair, poverty,

519
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,860
and other bad shit.

520
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,000
I fall like a dead man

521
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,800
in the canyons of my mind.

522
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,800
Oh!

523
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,480
In the canyons of your mind.

524
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,060
In the canyons of your mind.

525
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,060


526
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,060


527
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,480
In the canyons of your mind.

528
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,460
In the canyons of your mind.

529
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,380
In the canyons of your mind.

530
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,760
They're like those wagon wheel rocks

531
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,200
on the bottom of the canyon in your mind.

532
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,180
They're like those tiny little turd things

533
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,060
in the bottom of the rocks in the canyons of your mind.

534
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,600
They're like those tiny little turd things in the canyons of your mind.

535
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,900
Now, these aren't just little valleys.

536
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,780
They're not just little grooves or ditches in the earth.

537
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,640
No, no.

538
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,480
No, no.

539
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,140
But they're canyons!

540
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,320
Mighty-sized, deep, wide canyons.

541
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,020
Canyons.

542
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,420
Canyons.

543
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:34,600


544
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,580
Oh, yes.

545
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,480
The swingin' love corpses

546
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,800
with that lovely, lilting tune.

547
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,080
Canyons of my mind.

548
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,620
Or I should say, falling like a dead man

549
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,980
through the canyons of my mind.

550
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,160
The swingin' love corpses.

551
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,520
And before that, KPFA Berkeley radio

552
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,860
with Palmer Vreedy's Gary the Broke Friend

553
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,180
and Puzzling Evidence, Doug Wellman,

554
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,260
with Glass Madness singing.

555
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,700
And all of that, friends,

556
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,320
and the collage material before that

557
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,300
was all from the old subgenius,

558
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,340
Media Barrage number 11,

559
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,080
edited by yours truly,

560
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,700
with St. Byron Werner

561
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,860
and Doug Wellman,

562
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,560
Puzzling Evidence.

563
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,460
Friends, there was also a lot of Devo

564
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,120
and Oingo Boingo clips in there

565
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,240
because it was the 80s.

566
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,520
Now, it's the 80s.

567
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,840
And as the old pass on and pass out

568
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,100
in the fields of Asgard,

569
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,360
the uppity youngsters come along.

570
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,060
Such as,

571
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,980
Reverend Alex Thompson,

572
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,600
age 14.

573
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
In fact, we're going to listen to

574
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,940
Reverend Thompson's first sermon,

575
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,400
in public anyway,

576
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,900
recorded live at the 4X Day Drill 2001.

577
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,280
And after that, we'll hear a nice piece

578
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,420
of Connie from Reverend Protectrix Amazonia.

579
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,500
But now, friends,

580
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,620
Reverend Alex Thompson, age 14.

581
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,920
Whenever I interview,

582
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,020
I introduce an unsaved friend,

583
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,820
friend to the church and subgenius.

584
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,000
They'll read the pamphlet number one,

585
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,420
and they'll read the pamphlet number two,

586
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,280
and they'll read through the long, long paragraphs

587
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,360
of confusing and arcane text

588
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,440
typed up by Stang and Drummond

589
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,780
so very long ago.

590
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,900
Oh, they'll read through it as they'll say,

591
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,480
ah, this is what it is, this is what it is,

592
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
this is so bizarre,

593
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,040
and off the wall,

594
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,420
but what about Bob?

595
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,520
What about him?

596
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,880
He looks just about as straight as Ward Cleaver.

597
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,600
He looks like your ordinary, everyday dad,

598
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,760
dad-man, father image.

599
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,580
He's got the way about him.

600
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,780
But, you know, and they get this image in their heads

601
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,940
of the pipe-smoking businessman

602
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,020
in the three-piece suit,

603
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,480
chatting up Jesus or the devil or whoever.

604
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,760
The most important thing to remember

605
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,440
about the image of Bob has always been

606
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,060
that no matter where you go,

607
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,440
you see a job saying you know what it stands for.

608
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,340
Yeah!

609
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,240
Slut!

610
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,800
It's simply him, a man, smiling and smoking a pipe.

611
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,540
Yeah!

612
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,500
A pipe filled with the uncut word of himself.

613
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,540
Yeah!

614
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,400
A pipe filled with his holy f-!

615
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,900
A pipe filled with the word of Bob!

616
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:44,500
Amen!

617
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,900
Preach it!

618
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
Preach it!

619
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,620
That the we mortals are only now beginning to understand it.

620
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,200
That's his image, that's his way,

621
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,660
that's Bob, praise Bob,

622
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,780
and if no one else, then by all means,

623
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,140
turn to Connie because, you know,

624
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,560
because let's not kid ourselves guys,

625
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,360
she's the real power behind this church.

626
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,520
You know, she's the one we all know.

627
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,260
Hail Connie!

628
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,340
Woo!

629
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,220
Woo!

630
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,600
Woo!

631
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,000
Ladies, gentlemen, fellow travelers,

632
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,520
here ended the rant.

633
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,400
Good evening.

634
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah!

635
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,840
Yeah!

636
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,460
Woo!

637
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,160
Woo!

638
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,540
Woo!

639
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:27,660
Woo!

640
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,740
Right, Saint Alex, friends,

641
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,000
14 years old!

642
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,560
Woo!

643
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,460
So, don't even think about it, girls,

644
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,540
that's general practice.

645
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,140
Yeah, the church of the subgenius is much older than that young man.

646
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,940
Jesus pointed out we're celebrating our 25th anniversary soon.

647
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,420
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man and woman is woman.

648
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,080
I think you're just a big bully.

649
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,320
I don't care if you like us,

650
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,260
because we don't like you,

651
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,500
and we don't give a flying what you think.

652
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,680
I thought you were trying to French kiss me!

653
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,760
Boys have a vagina.

654
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,520
Girls have a vagina.

655
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:08,860
Men have a penis.

656
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,240
Man is woman and woman is man.

657
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,300
Guys for girls and men for men.

658
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,680
Hummin' a, hummin' a, hummin' a.

659
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,400
A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman?

660
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,040
Ridiculous.

661
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,500
It's preposterous.

662
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,440
In fact, it's so preposterous no one would ever believe it.

663
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,400
I find it mind-bending.

664
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,620
There is going to be hell.

665
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,480
Medically impossible.

666
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,160
It's not really hard to believe.

667
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,380
It's just hard for you to accept.

668
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,860
Guards!

669
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,080
You can't spread his.

670
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,820
Good heavens!

671
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,700
Ah!

672
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,500
You can't hurt me while I'm here.

673
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,260
I whip this out.

674
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:39,820
Ah!

675
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,540
Guards!

676
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,720
Castrate him.

677
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,720
No!

678
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,860
No!

679
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,360
No!

680
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:45,560


681
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,780
Guards!

682
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,020
Castrate him.

683
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,280
This is not a haphazard maneuver.

684
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,280
Careful planning for it started months back.

685
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,680
Beware.

686
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,580
Beware.

687
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,980
Beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep.

688
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,480
Ah!

689
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,680
He eats little boys.

690
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,420
Please have some of my time.

691
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:13,880
I'll be downstairs.

692
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,400
Ah!

693
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:15,720
Be.

694
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,640
That.

695
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,860
Nailed it.

696
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,840
Ah!

697
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:19,400


698
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,200
Ah!

699
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,300
Bob is not what you would call a brilliant man.

700
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,260
Hence the word church of the sub-genius.

701
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,380
You notice this isn't church of the genius.

702
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,920
Some geniuses out there may have noticed that by now.

703
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,160
What Bob has been trying to say is that it's not the intelligence that counts.

704
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
It's just plain, plain old sense.

705
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,660
Horse sense, common sense, sense of humor, and most importantly of all, dollars and cents.

706
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:55,040
J.R. Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs was on the number one list of frauds and phonies

707
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,200
for Time Magazine, and I didn't know who he was.

708
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:57,660
Exactly.

709
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,600
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the church of the sub-genius.

710
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,620
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

711
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,100
Disciples.

712
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,120
Disciples.

713
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,920
Disciples.

714
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,800
Yeah.

715
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,580
All right.

716
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,240
You know, it's funny.

717
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,920
I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

718
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,220
Or Bob.

719
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,300
Oh, baby.

720
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,960
Life is grim, is it not?

721
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,280
Yes, life is grim.

722
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,480
Yes, life is grim.

723
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:31,720
Yes, life is grim.

724
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,600
And you drive through town and see that a boy who is not a good man is a child of God.

725
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,600


726
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,600


727
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,600


728
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,600


729
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,600


730
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,600


731
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,600


732
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,600


733
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,600


734
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,840
Abandoned factories.

735
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,160
Yes, yes, yes.

736
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,980
The ice caps are melting.

737
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,160
We hate it.

738
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
The water is rising.

739
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,780
We hate it.

740
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,440
The world will soon be drowned.

741
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,600
Yes, yes, yes.

742
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,500
The plague is spreading.

743
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,460
Yes, yes.

744
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,900
The bubbles are on everyone, master.

745
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,500
All is lost.

746
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,580
Yes, yes, yes.

747
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,260
Barbarism and inhumanity reign in the trees.

748
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,420
Yes, yes, yes.

749
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,340
The children are lost souls.

750
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,800
Yes, yes, master.

751
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,400
The world is coming to an end.

752
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,680
Yes, master.

753
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,220
Yes, master.

754
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,040
These are all signs of the end time.

755
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,520
Yes, master.

756
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes, master.

757
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,620
Yes, master.

758
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,300
Yes, master.

759
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,940
Bob spoke of it before.

760
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,840
He wrote of it in the book.

761
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,140
Is your name written in the book of life?

762
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,220
Yes, master.

763
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:55,340
Or will you be cast into the lake of milk with the pink ones?

764
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,720
Okay.

765
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,200
Oh, they like the lake of milk.

766
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:09,840
Oh, well, maybe you don't care about the end of the world, the end of freedom, the end of the ability to think.

767
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,920
My master.

768
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,080
My freedom.

769
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,100
My master.

770
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,120
My master.

771
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,300
My master.

772
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,240
My master.

773
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,420
My master.

774
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,660
My master.

775
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:16,660


776
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:16,660


777
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:16,660


778
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,540
They just want the law read to them.

779
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,780
I guess they like Johnny Law.

780
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,680
I guess they ain't going to send in that $30.

781
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
I guess they ain't going to play.

782
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,300
Send in Johnny Law's bill.

783
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,460
Thank me, master.

784
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,400
But friend, what will you do when you're called up before the judge?

785
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:36,340
You know, you tied your shoes this morning, but will the undertaker untie them tonight?

786
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,820
And saw your feet off to fit you in that coffin because your family couldn't afford a big enough one?

787
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,740
Things are bleak.

788
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,880
Things are rough.

789
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,940
Sure, you can try to think positive.

790
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,460
That's just when they're going to come up behind you.

791
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Sneak up on you.

792
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,840
They sneak up on you, man.

793
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,120
You know they're after you.

794
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,180
Oh, yeah.

795
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,360
They're coming for you.

796
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,840
They're not being paranoid.

797
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,820
They really are after you.

798
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,060
They're coming for you.

799
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,320
That means you better know who your friends are, buddy.

800
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
They're coming for you.

801
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:19,940
You better know where you're going to find Sukor, an aide, when the big hammer comes down.

802
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,060
You know what I mean.

803
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,560
Can't get it with the Sukor.

804
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,040
Who are you going to go to?

805
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,500
You going to go to the cops?

806
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,720
You going to go call 911?

807
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:30,780
Oh, yeah.

808
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,700
The earthquake's sucking you right down.

809
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,780
The giant volcano's going off in the middle of Kansas.

810
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,900
The mosquitoes the size of dinosaurs are sucking your blood.

811
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
You're going to call 911.

812
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,760
Oh, yeah.

813
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,140
Mm-hmm.

814
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,740
Oh, yeah.

815
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:41,800
911.

816
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,620
Are you going to go to the...

817
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,060
You're going to know who your friends are and go to the man with the pipe.

818
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,480
You're going to call 669.

819
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,800
669.

820
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,100
911.

821
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,580
Yeah.

822
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:51,780
911.

823
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,360
You call 669.

824
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,900
You talk to the man with the pipe.

825
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:56,860
Yes.

826
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,420
Yes.

827
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,300
Yes.

828
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:58,740


829
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:58,800


830
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:58,940
Yes.

831
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,220
Yes.

832
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,380
Yes.

833
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,540
Yes.

834
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


835
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,560
Yes.

836
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


837
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


838
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


839
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


840
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


841
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


842
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


843
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,720
Might even offer you a light himself.

844
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,640
Yeah.

845
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,720
Where's that pipe?

846
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,320
Lean back.

847
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,160
Uh-huh.

848
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,120
Big old...

849
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,520
Take a big old hit of that church there.

850
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,580
You know everything's going to be all right.

851
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,360
You get turned off.

852
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,880
You'll be down.

853
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,580
Don't hang down.

854
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,920
Or are you going to screw up?

855
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,760
Or are you just going to say, well, that was a real funny little skit.

856
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,240
It's pretty.

857
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,120
But I'm...

858
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,940
Yeah, sure.

859
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,400
I read in the newspaper that...

860
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,940
That the child murderers are killing their mediocrity parents and putting them in jars.

861
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,860
Oh, yeah.

862
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,060
I read that the ozone layer was almost completely gone.

863
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,660
And that's why me and all my neighbors happen to seem to have cataracts.

864
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,980
I know that the electrical wiring in my home is giving me cancer.

865
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,780
But, you know, well, nothing's perfect.

866
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,020
You know, every cloud has a silver lining.

867
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,880
Tomorrow's another day.

868
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,880
What you know won't hurt you.

869
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,060
Yeah.

870
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,660
You know, Bob's not real.

871
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,760
I don't need slack.

872
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,960
I guess I'll just go down with the rest of them.

873
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,980
Look at these.

874
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,620
Look at these joyous little Morlocks below.

875
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,220
Sure, today the Morlocks are little friends.

876
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,420
It's stunted.

877
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,140
Rather depressing looking as they are.

878
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,300
They love Bob.

879
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,000
They may be pathetic and sad.

880
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,420
But you know that in the future they will be the ones who run things.

881
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,140
Sure, the Pinks may live in their mansions up above ground.

882
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,360
Being fed mysteriously every night somehow.

883
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,940
Fattened up.

884
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,300
And they never grow old.

885
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:59,060
Because when they turn 30, they're taken away by the Morlocks at night.

886
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,540
And fed to Morlocks.

887
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,060
And fed to Morlocks families.

888
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,880
That is the destiny of the subgeniuses who are left behind on X Day.

889
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,860
Yes, you may...

890
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:14,160
If you're left behind on X Day, your grandkids will get to be Morlocks and feed off the Eloi.

891
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,080
But if you're truly saved, friend, you ain't gonna have to worry about that.

892
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:28,740
You're gonna have universal luxury on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

893
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,100
Universal luxury.

894
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,680
Little boy.

895
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,080
Come on, baby.

896
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,980
Come on, baby.

897
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,260
Little boy.

898
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,920
Universal luxury.

899
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Little boy.

900
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,060
Come on, baby.

901
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,880
Come on, baby.

902
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,160
Little boy.

903
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,860
Universal luxury.

904
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,020
below record

905
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,020


906
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,680
What you buy now

907
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,860
The circumstances

908
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,620
Then you cannot go out

909
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,620
Oh yeah

910
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,640
What you find out

911
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,100
The circumstances

912
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,060
Then you cannot go out

913
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,020
Oh yeah

914
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,200
Little girl don't you know

915
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,780
That the stars up above

916
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,000
Are running all alone

917
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,920
Little girl don't you know

918
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,480
That they're blinking at you

919
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,440
Now the sun can sunburn you

920
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:58,760
But

921
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,620
Now the sun can sunburn you

922
00:41:59,620 --> 00:41:59,620


923
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,860
Not as bad as the lost

924
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,020
Old people do

925
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,320
Yeah

926
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,060
guitar solo

927
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,480
guitar solo

928
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,860
guitar solo

929
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:28,980
I

930
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,620
I

931
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:29,720
I

932
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,680
I

933
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,160
I

934
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,280
I

935
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,840
I

936
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,160
I

937
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,340
I

938
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:34,620
I

939
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:34,960
I

940
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,760
I

941
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,400
I

942
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:36,500
I

943
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:36,600
I

944
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,460
I

945
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:50,500
Now the sun can sunburn you

946
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:07,760
Can sunburn you, but not as bad as those old people do.

947
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,960
I want you, once you find out the circumstances,

948
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:52,300
then you, then you, then you, then you can go out.

949
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,200
Oh yeah, you can go out.

950
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:07,900
You can go out.

951
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,060
You can go out.

952
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,160
You can go out.

953
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,620
You can go out.

954
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:05,740
You can go out.

955
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,180
Bay.

956
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,280
You can go out.

957
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,000
I could die.

958
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,560
I know where that jive is at.

959
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,780
One thing I do have on my mind, and it terrifies me too.

960
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,360
Will you call me another guy's name when I try to make love to you?

961
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,960
And you, sir.

962
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,420
I love you.

963
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:26,520
I love you.

964
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,340
I love you.

965
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,820
So if your baby leaves you, got a tale to tell.

966
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:50,260
Just take a walk down Roman Street to a heartbreak motel.

967
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,940
I've hit the zone lonely, baby.

968
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,300
I've hit the zone lonely.

969
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,180
I've hit the zone lonely, baby.

970
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,460
I could die.

971
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,040
I could die.

972
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,120
Heartbreaker.

973
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,440
Heartbreaker.

974
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,360
Hotel.

975
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,140
Hotel.

976
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:25,880
Hotel.

977
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,360
Hotel.

978
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:30,800
Hotel.

979
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,840
Heartbreaker by Dread Zeppelin.

980
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,760
And before that, we heard Circumstances by Captain Beefheart

981
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,080
and the magic band from the album Clear Spot.

982
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,380
Ah, yes, and a little clip of my life with the Thrill Kill Club.

983
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:56,120
And a lot of old, old ESO swamp radio on WCSB Cleveland

984
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,600
with Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy, and the band.

985
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,460
Cowboy Dave, special guest princess, we are dough, and yours truly,

986
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,140
from February 1995.

987
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,260
Reverend Chaz Smith there providing the live music.

988
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:19,500
But now, let us go even further back before the Morlocks and the Eloy and the ESO

989
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:25,780
to Berkeley, California, the KPFA radio station back in the day

990
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,000
before they changed with Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence,

991
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,320
and?

992
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,900
Glass Madness.

993
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,400
Glass Madness.

994
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:40,040
I first had my experience with Bob at a Bob's Big Boy on the corner of Bellevue Drive in

995
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,020
Los Angeles, California in 1959.

996
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:50,140
It changed my life and I became able to open my third nostril and snort the divine wisdom

997
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,260
of the subgenius.

998
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:56,920
Every morning before breakfast, I find it helpful to go into my sternutrition room,

999
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,020
as we call them, and sniff up.

1000
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,600
Sternutrition.

1001
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,360
Yes, violent sternutrition may be observed.

1002
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,620
Named after the famous sternio?

1003
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,920
Well, yes, the famous sternio does practice sternutrition,

1004
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,100
as does everyone who possesses the simple accoutrement of a handkerchief

1005
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,840
and a head full of ideas that need to be relieved.

1006
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,900
Subdivide the box brain.

1007
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,940
Oh, Bob, with your square little gray brain, how do you use that thing?

1008
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,860
It's hooked up all wrong.

1009
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,900
Oh, Bob, what about this rumor that your pipe is a living organism?

1010
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,860
Yes, that has invaded your brain and made everything all wrong.

1011
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,480
Yeah, what about that Bob grinning malarkey turkey flunky prop?

1012
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,960
What about them aliens, as you say, or us aliens?

1013
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,800
We're not aliens.

1014
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,560
How about it, Bob?

1015
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,920
And who's this anti-Bob?

1016
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:35,900
Some relation of yours?

1017
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,880
Some nepotistic cousin on the payroll end?

1018
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,720
We dare to question our supreme epopt-Bob, because we have the freedom within the Church

1019
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,240
of the Subgenius to question even the basic verities, like whether or not there is a Mokele

1020
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,900
Mbembe, whether it's frog-like bellow does echo over the South American or even the African

1021
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,440
swamps.

1022
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:54,640
Swamp?

1023
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,140
Swooms?

1024
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:55,860
Swamps.

1025
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,960
Yes, swamps.

1026
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,320
Right now.

1027
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,000
That's where they live.

1028
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,220
Glass Madness is in that swamp.

1029
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,020
Yes, he's gone down.

1030
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:00,580
There's a green hill.

1031
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:05,820
They say Mokele Mbembe lives in Lake Ukabalabonga, which is only four feet deep, but the creature

1032
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,140
of...

1033
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:06,880
Balaboomba.

1034
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,180
No, Ukabalabonga.

1035
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:08,980
All my other rubbish.

1036
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,960
These people are making rubbish.

1037
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,440
Let's just keep walking.

1038
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,100
That's not stop.

1039
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,420
Buy the book of the Subgenius.

1040
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,320
Up there it went.

1041
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,320
And here...

1042
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,100
Oh, wait a minute.

1043
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,860
I think it's time for a commercial.

1044
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,140
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

1045
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,040
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

1046
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,300
He is a hater, he's a hater.

1047
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:27,300


1048
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,400
The subgenius church.

1049
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,420
That's why he's super cool.

1050
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,240
Like Glass.

1051
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,080
He's Bob Dobbs.

1052
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,200
He's no slob.

1053
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,960
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

1054
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,320
He is the head of the subgenius church, and he is super cool.

1055
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:56,040
Glass Madness, friends, from Media Barrage 11, and now it's time for you to get your

1056
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,280
pencils out and start working.

1057
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,720
And write down the address of Bob so that you can figure out what the hell this church

1058
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,540
and the subgenius thing is all about, and maybe get some free weird little pamphlets

1059
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,400
with stuff printed on them.

1060
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,740
Or you could just check out www.subgenius.com on the internet.

1061
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,960
But to get that pencil ready, friends, while this background music by Tipsy from their

1062
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:25,940
album Uh-Oh is playing, you can write down the address of Hour of Slack at P.O.Box1411.

1063
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:27,260


1064
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:39,960
That's Box 1403-06 in Dallas, Texas.

1065
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,680
And the zip is 75214.

1066
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,380
P.O.Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1067
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,800
And here now is little Theodore.

1068
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,420
And Babushka.

1069
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:03,080
Then, live at the XXX Day Drill in 1999.

1070
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,780
And after that, friends, we're going to take some calls.

1071
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,920
Praise Bob!

1072
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,500
There is only one hope for me.

1073
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,320
I want to be Bob.

1074
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,440
Sit and smile all the time.

1075
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,340
I want to be Bob.

1076
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:25,780
I want to be Bob.

1077
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,720
I should've stayed in his grave.

1078
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:26,720


1079
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:26,720


1080
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:26,720


1081
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:26,720


1082
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:26,720


1083
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,300
I think every day is a

1084
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,900
Don't wanna be Jesus!

1085
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,120
You always look so sad!

1086
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,480
Don't wanna be Jesus!

1087
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,160
Ha ha!

1088
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,860
He must have had an awful day!

1089
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,660
I wanna be Bob!

1090
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,820
Tell everyone about Slack.

1091
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,940
I wanna be Bob!

1092
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,520
Let the pigs kiss my crack!

1093
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,800
Don't wanna be Jesus!

1094
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,920
Don't wanna be no slave!

1095
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,320
Don't wanna be Jesus!

1096
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,940
He should've stayed in his grave.

1097
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:55,780
Don't wanna be Jesus!

1098
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:55,780


1099
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,440
I wanna be Bob.

1100
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,040
Never have to work a day.

1101
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,220
I wanna be Bob.

1102
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,420
All eternity's a play.

1103
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,800
Don't wanna be Jesus.

1104
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,920
Don't wanna carry no cross.

1105
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,380
Don't wanna be Jesus.

1106
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,000
Don't wanna speak for no half-boss.

1107
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,720
I wanna be Bob.

1108
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,980
See everything all so clear.

1109
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,060
I wanna be Bob.

1110
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,460
Shitty to grin, ear to ear.

1111
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,900
Don't wanna be Jesus.

1112
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,120
Always trying to figure things out.

1113
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,520
Don't wanna be Jesus.

1114
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,700
Who needs all them fucking cosmic doubts?

1115
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:32,720
I wanna be Bob.

1116
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,280
Yeah, I wanna be Bob.

1117
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,420
I wanna be Bob.

1118
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,320
I'd even like an InnoJersey.

1119
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:40,940
Yahoo!

1120
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,320
Yahoo!

1121
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,380
Maybe I could go over to...

1122
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,820
Back in the days when we lit up...

1123
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:54,520
That was possible.

1124
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,940
Good will and see if I could find me a nice pink suit coat.

1125
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,420
Find you?

1126
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,060
What's with the reflection stuff here?

1127
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,660
You're from Appalachia, too, and I mean, you know, find me this, I'm gonna get me that.

1128
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,540
You know, come on, man, what's up?

1129
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,040
No, I'm sorry.

1130
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,720
I'm gonna get me some.

1131
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,460
Find me this.

1132
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,820
I'm gonna get me one of them.

1133
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,700
I'm gonna get me one of them.

1134
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,920
I'm gonna get you one, too.

1135
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,560
I'm gonna get them one.

1136
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,240
I feel like that I'm gonna get me one of them.

1137
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,720
I'm Femskip.

1138
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,200
Go out there and get me one.

1139
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,140
I'm fitting to get me one.

1140
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,100
But if you're...

1141
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,500
I'm gonna keep you.

1142
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,320
I'm gonna keep you.

1143
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:23,800
I'm gonna keep you.

1144
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,740
I'm gonna keep you.

1145
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,480
That is one of the most frightening words to any...

1146
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:27,780
Yes.

1147
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,100
Hello?

1148
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:28,920
It's a female.

1149
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,240
Hello?

1150
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:29,760
Hello.

1151
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:30,400
Hello.

1152
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,220
How are you?

1153
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,080
You're so beautiful.

1154
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,120
Oh, thank you.

1155
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,500
You sound like a soft spring breeze has wefted into the room.

1156
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,300
Oh, it's because I haven't been showering too much.

1157
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,260
Oh, you have just taken a shower.

1158
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,540
I bet that your skin is still moist and a little bit warm, huh?

1159
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:46,340
Mm-hmm.

1160
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,460
And the little evaporation of the vapors come in can smell very well, huh?

1161
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,900
You can smell it?

1162
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,120
Really?

1163
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:52,740
Oh, of course.

1164
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,360
No way, man.

1165
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,440
I'm like, oh, my God.

1166
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:55,840
Oh, boy.

1167
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:00,860
That's why it's perhaps the smell of lilacs and diseased ovaries.

1168
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,500
No, no, no.

1169
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:01,920
I don't need that.

1170
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,880
I'm using my third nostril to whiff-read your psychic stench.

1171
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,440
Have you been watching the movie Sinbad the Sailor and eating garlic popcorn?

1172
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,180
Mm.

1173
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,540
You had many important past lives.

1174
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,620
More of a book.

1175
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,220
You have had many important past lives.

1176
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,340
You are an old soul.

1177
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,420
You are a very old soul.

1178
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,520
Want some more soul?

1179
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,600
Well, what did you call it?

1180
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:23,680
More?

1181
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,820
Axe about your old soul.

1182
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,160
Show?

1183
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,180
Go.

1184
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,140
Some more.

1185
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:26,880
Get even, Barber.

1186
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,420
Think of the fun you'll have taking Barbie and Ken on dates.

1187
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,880
We've already had all that fun.

1188
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,000
We're taking Barbie and Ken on dates.

1189
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,820
With Krabby and Barber?

1190
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,260
No, we've already executed them out in the ditches way beyond Panoria.

1191
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,700
You dress them up real pretty and put the caveman outfit on one of them

1192
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,500
and sometimes a little skinny tie on the boy and take them out on a little date.

1193
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,860
Oh, that would be my favorite thing to do.

1194
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,120
That's always my favorite thing to do when I'm home.

1195
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,320
I like to take the caveman and take the, you know, the necktie from the business suit guy

1196
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,960
and strangle them all up.

1197
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,360
When you're home or at the home.

1198
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,720
Strangle them with them.

1199
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,640
Now when you're home or at the home.

1200
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,220
That's before you start burning them.

1201
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,640
I have to stay home lately.

1202
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,920
Yeah, the home lately?

1203
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,040
I have to stay home.

1204
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,560
Oh, a shut-in.

1205
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,120
And what is your problem there, dear sister?

1206
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,460
I have a busted up knee.

1207
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,840
Oh, what a bust.

1208
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,840
A beautiful bust.

1209
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:22,840


1210
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:22,840


1211
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:22,840


1212
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:22,840


1213
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:22,840


1214
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:22,840


1215
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,960
A bust and money, you say?

1216
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,580
Yes, when you need your bust.

1217
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,280
Busted up money and knee.

1218
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,960
I went to the bank and they said I didn't have any.

1219
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:30,140
Knee?

1220
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:30,140


1221
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:30,620
Even more needful.

1222
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:34,080
It seems to have hit the concrete and been pushed to the side in every direction.

1223
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,680
That sounds beautiful.

1224
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,580
I would like to watch that in slow motion.

1225
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:47,260
So, uh, would you be interested in joining the Bonobo sect?

1226
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,260
Um, what's in it for me?

1227
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,940
Oh, everything go in there.

1228
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,640
What's in it?

1229
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,160
For you?

1230
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,420
Yes, everything go in there.

1231
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,920
What's in it?

1232
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,120
Or should I, should I say, what, what will be in me?

1233
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,520
What would you say rubs you the right way, my dear?

1234
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,260
The spirit, the spirit!

1235
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,260
You will be filled.

1236
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,100
Will, will, will fill you up.

1237
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,840
The spirit of slack.

1238
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:13,900
The spunk of some diseased, mentally ill old gentleman who believe the world is coming to an end.

1239
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:14,640
And course and speed and spray!

1240
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,960
In actuality, their own minds are coming to an abrupt halt.

1241
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:18,900
And they will flee at a time.

1242
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,100
They'll join you soon in that home.

1243
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,160
They'll be there next to you.

1244
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:22,680
The David's.

1245
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,780
He just closes his eyes and he just goes.

1246
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,740
He's there, man.

1247
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,640
He's there.

1248
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:26,660


1249
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,580
It doesn't matter.

1250
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,540
It's just like, yeah, see, that's why.

1251
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,720
That all sounds really, really nice.

1252
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,220
It does.

1253
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,220
Yeah.

1254
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,900
The spunk of an old diseased man?

1255
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:36,560
Yeah!

1256
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,680
Don't you get pleasure out of the most mundane things?

1257
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:46,080
I think the old diseased man Dave is referring to may be Dave.

1258
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,580
I was referring to you.

1259
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,680
But if there was ever a diseased...

1260
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,600
That's not Evangela, is it?

1261
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,540
Mm-hmm.

1262
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,540
I thought so.

1263
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,160
I thought that...

1264
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,240
I thought it was...

1265
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,060
How's the mutated eunuch you're letting live in the basement?

1266
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:00,880
Because I was afraid she'd be great.

1267
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,760
Oh, I don't have a basement.

1268
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,840
I don't have a basement.

1269
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,260
I don't know who you mean.

1270
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,040
Well, then how the hell is a mutated eunuch living in your basement?

1271
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,720
