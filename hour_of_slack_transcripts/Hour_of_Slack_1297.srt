1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:13,600
Now I'm not making this up, but in the latest issue of Railway Modeler, there's a little house you can build with a little projector in it, and you actually get the impression of people moving behind the little plastic window.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,340
Only a sick person would do that.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,080
No, it's part of an advanced model railroad layout, in H.O. scale, whether I'll leave it or not.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,620
They shrink down these people to a tiny size.

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,580
As a kind of a punishment.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,880
You squint really close, you can see them shrink.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,360
Hey, hey, but no, thank you, Michelle, I'm going to go to the hospital, no!

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,580
No, they whine that they can't escape from the town, like that old Twilight Zone.

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,200
You ever see that one where the people keep getting on the train, but they keep coming back to the station?

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,120
Who are you talking to, Hal?

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,740
And then finally a huge kid's face looms down, and they've been captured by the giant alien's attack.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,000
What? He's talking so much.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,940
Wow.

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,640
Oh, we're all talking.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,300
Wow.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,300
I've lived that Twilight Zone.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,340
And that's why they can't make it through.

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,180
He's talking about it.

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,340
One is a guy, he's talking about it.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,960
Double follow the story.

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,620
The world is now experiencing strange astronomical phenomena.

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,780
Reports have come in from all over the globe of inexplicable objects being sighted in the sky.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,060
Surely you're not telling me a scientist like yourself believes such nonsense.

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,020
It was all very queer.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400
But queerer things were yet to come.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,920
That's a chance, that's a chance!

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,060
That's a chance!

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,240
Sir!

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,500
I could have stopped you.

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm properly dressed, but in my pajamas.

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,600
Yes, sir.

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,880
I've never...

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,220
It's Lansing!

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,800
Good work, you're all right!

35
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,860
...known in the city of Spokane.

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,060
We can't waste any more time.

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,840
More time!

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,260
I'm in the middle of the helicopter.

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,300
You know the part underneath that thing where it lands?

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:37,940
Do you?

41
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,520
Do you know the part?

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,400
Yes, I know that part.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,480
I've never hung on to that.

44
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,900
I've never even commentated a vehicle.

45
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,820
Now that sounds like a lot of fun.

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,080
Oh!

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,020
I don't know.

48
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,000
Lately I just don't feel like there's anything special about me.

49
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,060
You are an incredibly talented scientist.

50
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,060


51
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,060


52
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,060


53
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,840
You're a very sensitive man who inspires joy-joy feelings in all those around you.

54
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,840
Oh!

55
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,240
Oh!

56
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,620
Excuse me, sir.

57
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,220
We're the clever ones.

58
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,980
Most of that bunch are like dinosaurs in suits.

59
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,960
They have absolutely no idea we're playing with their little brains.

60
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,000
That's who you remind me of.

61
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,320
An evil Mr. Rogers.

62
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,400
You know, when my kids start recombining the DNA of a frog and mutating it into a giant

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,040
monster who lays waste to our town, that means we're going to have to do something about

64
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,200
it.

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,860
That means I've been spending too much time at the office.

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
You know what feels great?

67
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,780
All those jerks at the company who never thought I'd go anywhere.

68
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,800
Well, this'll show them.

69
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,140
Doug, I have to tell you something I think you might not want to hear.

70
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,540
Uh-huh?

71
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,440
Hey, look, I didn't mean to be on the radio, but there's no law against it, is there?

72
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,820
In jail, in hell.

73
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,800
It's an effective attack on everything that bugs me.

74
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm sorry.

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


82
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


86
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


87
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


88
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


89
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,040


90
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,180
I'm sorry.

91
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,860
You've got to get up.

92
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,960
You've got to yell and make my head explode.

93
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,820
I want everybody to keep trying.

94
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,500
That's it.

95
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,700
Go!

96
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,400
Go!

97
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,960
Go!

98
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,400
Go!

99
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,880
Go!

100
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,400
Go!

101
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,820
Go!

102
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,260
Go!

103
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,340
Go!

104
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,560
Amazing.

105
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,980
Just amazing.

106
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,200
Well, according to your brainwave charts, your solution is pretty darn simple.

107
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,700
And, uh...

108
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,720
What's happening here?

109
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know.

110
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,400
It's...

111
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,220
There's this bleed over that's coming in.

112
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,160
Yeah, what was that about?

113
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,220
Uh, the church is gonna rub...

114
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,900
People are gonna rub fog.

115
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,500
... something about that.

116
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,860
Bleed.

117
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,280
Yeah.

118
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,380
I think he's breaking down.

119
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,140
The clutch of the...

120
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,840
Birch of the...

121
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,260
Punch.

122
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,080
Menius.

123
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,500
What?

124
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,360
The crutch of the...

125
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,820
No, I know, but...

126
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,540
Evil genius.

127
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,500
Of the crutch of the...

128
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:39,540
Bleed.

129
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:39,960
Yes?

130
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,460
Dub.

131
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,300
Penius.

132
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,260
Oh, no, it's...

133
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,220
Church crossover.

134
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,720
The...

135
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,000
The, uh...

136
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,060
I don't know what to believe in.

137
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,200
It's Saint Slack Day's parade.

138
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,260
No, but...

139
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,380
It's...

140
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,600
That's what's, uh...

141
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,080
No, no, never.

142
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,740
... throwing us off.

143
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,660
It's that, uh...

144
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,140
No, no, never.

145
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,140
... Bishop Joey and his, uh...

146
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,020
Yeah, Mr. Stupid Pants over there.

147
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,020


148
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,440
Oh, he thinks he's so stupid.

149
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Mr. Stupid Pants.

150
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,540
Oh, he thinks he's stupider than he said genius.

151
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:03,820
Comes right through your window.

152
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,240
He thinks he's the stupidest guy in the world.

153
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,420
I believe that.

154
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:05,420


155
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,480
He's the one who's doing it.

156
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:07,540
The guy who's doing it.

157
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,200
Bishop Joey's...

158
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,380
He's right over there, officer.

159
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,420
... he's been arrested for distributing child pornography, right?

160
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,060
And...

161
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,200
To a minor.

162
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,700
To a minor.

163
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,180
The children.

164
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

165
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,620
Mr. Stupid Pants.

166
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:17,620


167
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,080
We're stupid as you are.

168
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,520
We're stupid as you are.

169
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,020
Mr. Stupid Pants.

170
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,640
Top that.

171
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,320
Come on.

172
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,100
Top that.

173
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,800
Now, don't you mean Stooped Pants?

174
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,740
Not stupid.

175
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,040
Stupid.

176
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,200
You know, he stands pretty straight up.

177
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,840
He's lost the stupido.

178
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,460
He's something stupido.

179
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,800
He lost the stupido.

180
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,060
In fact, the...

181
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,500
The comment that was heard after the viewing of the Puzzling Evidence videos of Saint's

182
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,840
Stupid Day Parade of 2010...

183
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,420
Oh, really?

184
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,320
... heard all through subgeniusdom, was...

185
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,500
Oh, my God!

186
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,440
Oh, my God!

187
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,840
There's thousands of them!

188
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,780
How come we don't have that many people at X Day?

189
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,200
Ha!

190
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,580
And the answer, of course, is because rather than holding X Day in a city full of weird

191
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,520
artists and rich young people, we hold it in the middle of the most God-forsaken wilderness,

192
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,280
Amish-controlled, strange, hard-to-reach...

193
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,180
In the desolate wastes, reaches of the earth...

194
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,940
Frozen wastes of rural New York.

195
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,500
Actually, it's being moved to the West Coast.

196
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,500


197
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,900
That's right.

198
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:16,960
The West Coast...

199
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,020
That's right!

200
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,020


201
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,020


202
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,180
And the last thing we have is the worst waste of the burning...

203
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,260
... No man knows...

204
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,860
... ... forest of Southern Ohio.

205
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,660
... what size this beast may grow.

206
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,960
So, kids, your chance to go to X Day Drill at Brushwood is gone.

207
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,240
Already?

208
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,020
Yes.

209
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,160
There shall never be another X Day Drill at Brushwood because there is no more Brushwood.

210
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,000
However, there will be...

211
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,680
The sun shall never rise and fall again upon...

212
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,260
A mysterious next day at Wisteria in southern Ohio.

213
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,860
A hysterical place to have a big party.

214
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,800
The mystery of Wisteria.

215
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,880
The Wisterian mystery.

216
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,640
Did you ever see that Japanese movie, The Wisterians?

217
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,640
Yes.

218
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,060
The giant robot with pointy hands.

219
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,700
Yes, and a big pointy nose on that rock.

220
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,720
Yes.

221
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,680
It came bursting out of the cliff.

222
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,220
That was a terrifying, unexpected thing.

223
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,660
The Wisterians.

224
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,040
A robot?

225
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,480
A giant robot was concealed inside a massive cliff.

226
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,480
And at the beating of alien instigators,

227
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,280
it emerged from the surrounding rocky formation

228
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,600
with enormous rock fall and loss of life.

229
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,680
We don't know how many giant robots.

230
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,000
The insouciant robot begins to take a little stroll,

231
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,040
crushing property and creating havoc.

232
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,640
Perhaps on next day, the saucers,

233
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,960
the saucers won't lower themselves down to us from the sky,

234
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,000
but could rise up out of the earth.

235
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,940
Maybe they were here all along.

236
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,080
It is possible that some of the account, as we understand it,

237
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,380
is distorted because our understanding is not clear enough

238
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,740
to perceive the ultimate truth in this matter.

239
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,840
So it's possible it may be, in some few particulars,

240
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,620
slightly different from what we've always assured

241
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,460
our followers would be the case.

242
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,600
But really,

243
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,660
the basis,

244
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
the basic message is,

245
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,020
and always will remain the same,

246
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,540
that at the rupture,

247
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,520
if at the assembly point and fully paid up,

248
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,120
all will be accepted, saved,

249
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,040
and seized up into the clouds,

250
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,060
taking off into the air,

251
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,100
as the French say,

252
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,680
with the sex goddesses aboard the spaceships.

253
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,720
And that right there, friends,

254
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,840
is why you shouldn't commit suicide.

255
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,660
Because you don't really know the future.

256
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
And it might get a whole lot better just like that.

257
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,300
Just because you heard this show.

258
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,880
Just be for that reason only.

259
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,760
What you're hearing right now could lead you to

260
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,340
perhaps your life's true love.

261
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,560
Your mate for life.

262
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,240
Whatever sex or species that might happen to you.

263
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,700
I'll set you up with the love of your life.

264
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,580
What I'm telling you now,

265
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,840
could have repercussions that will benefit you forever.

266
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,640
Or,

267
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,620
it could plunge you into an endless nightmare.

268
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,060
A veritable hell.

269
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
The choice is yours.

270
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:21,960
Yes.

271
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,540
Actually, the choice is not theirs.

272
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,180
The choice is Bob's.

273
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,440
Only Bob may choose who is worthy and who is not.

274
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,780
And his standards may not conform to ours.

275
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,640
In fact, they almost certainly will not.

276
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,860
No, they would not, would they?

277
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,240
But the idea is not to,

278
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,360
to depend on Bob for a lot of, or a lot of chance.

279
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,160
You can't second guess J.R. Bob Dobbs.

280
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,940
It's not up to us to decide who is a true subgenius and who's not.

281
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,380
No, sir.

282
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,640
To attempt to...

283
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,460
Now, anybody can purchase somehow

284
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,800
some sort of little sign that says they're a subgenius.

285
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,980
Sure, anybody can do that.

286
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,880
Well, if you...

287
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,280
But only Bob knows.

288
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,740
And, well, and also his friends from outer space.

289
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,900
The men from Planet X, the X's.

290
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,580
The X's.

291
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:12,580


292
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:12,580


293
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,020
Who know if I've...

294
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,360
Pure telepathy and whiff reading.

295
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,980
They can whiff read the stench of your DNA.

296
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,960
Reverend Stein, you know the people...

297
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,500
Is that, uh...

298
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,840
...this part memorized?

299
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,340
Is that Reverend Diva Schematic in the background singing?

300
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,680
Oh, yeah, I think so.

301
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,160
With the...

302
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,120
The Athery squash?

303
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,840
The Athery squash.

304
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,360
The Ather...

305
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,900
See, I've seen on MySpace.

306
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,460
I hear an overbang mask.

307
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,500
There's more somewhere right now.

308
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,200
The rubber and the...

309
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,020
Totally wear the...

310
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Cypress lawn

311
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,520
Table stall of cypress lawn

312
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,420
Holiday decent shoulders

313
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,300
Six foot by two foot

314
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,040
How can you be in a deal like that?

315
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,960
Really, that guy laid it out

316
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,000
Since he was laid out

317
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,300
What the hell's going on here?

318
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,540
I don't know, I'm just

319
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,420
I think I'm losing my mind

320
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,260
Just try to remember where you put it

321
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,900
Oh, the train

322
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,100
We're going to have to wait here while it goes by

323
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,180
Go 2.3 miles

324
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,720
And turn into a giant

325
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,060
Jesus

326
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,080
Jesus

327
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,320
Jesus

328
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,520
Jesus

329
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


330
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


331
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


332
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


333
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


334
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


335
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


336
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


337
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


338
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


339
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


340
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


341
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,520


342
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,060
Is this a background music

343
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,660
That new genre known as

344
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,540
Flubstep?

345
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,020
Remember Flub-a-dub on the old

346
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,140
Audi duty show?

347
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,260
No, I don't, actually, Dr. Powell

348
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,320
How many animals

349
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,000
A horrible composite of various animals

350
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,440
How many can you recall Flub-a-dub being?

351
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,420
Well, a duck

352
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,880
Who was

353
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,420
Who was

354
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,620
Probably

355
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,580
That's the main

356
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,520
aspect of Flub-a-dub

357
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,200
A giraffe's neck

358
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,260
A giraffe's neck

359
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,440
Yes, with immaculate

360
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,360
Yeah, this is something I've been doing

361
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,960
It's all

362
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,120
Look what happened this afternoon

363
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,680
It's all this weird stuff this afternoon

364
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,000
Wow, I bet if you did an advanced image search

365
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,040
On Flub-a-dub

366
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,200
You'd see a picture of Flub-a-dub

367
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,620
Flub that duck

368
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,240
And the duck it rode in on

369
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,820
That's what I mean

370
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,780
It's not a duck

371
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,800
I'm telling you

372
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
A composite

373
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,680
A chimera

374
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,860
A composite creature

375
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,840
Well, this can be

376
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,400
Looked up at something like that

377
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:39,400


378
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,640
time, I suppose, so

379
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,820
no one cares to follow these

380
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,540
instant sessions. I'll just make another note.

381
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:46,980
Must

382
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,520
view Flub-a-dub.

383
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,680
Flub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub.

384
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,440
How does the rest of that go?

385
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,720
The butcher, the baker,

386
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,860
the candlestick maker.

387
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,940
If the tub had been stronger,

388
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,620
the tail had been longer.

389
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,300
What are they talking about?

390
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,280
Uh, rub-a-dub-dub,

391
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,820
three men in a tub.

392
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,340
Rubbing and dubbing and all

393
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,220
that rubbing. I'm still back with this

394
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,380
UFO stuff of the pleasure

395
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,860
saucers. Did they ever get all that?

396
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,840
UFO-ders, Big Feet,

397
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,540
and the mystery of the

398
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,840
Bermuda Delta Drive. You can think

399
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,440
all you want about those pleasure saucers.

400
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,580
I hope you're

401
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,500
thinking pleasant thoughts when you're

402
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,420
lifted up onto them, because if you

403
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,360
get paranoid at the last minute, why

404
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,840
everything could go completely wrong.

405
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,420
What could

406
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,160
go wrong on a pleasure saucer?

407
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,780
Really?

408
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,100
That's just oxymoronic.

409
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,780
Your attitude going in, as we say,

410
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,860
will be of extreme importance

411
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,300
in whether or not your ride is comfortable

412
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,440
and viable, as Bob intended when he made

413
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,300
the original deal with the Exes.

414
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,620
This interstellar contract is the legal basis

415
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,580
for the salvation of the subgenius population

416
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,380
via escape vessel operation.

417
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,660
I hope you go on the ride

418
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,100
with God, on the next day at

419
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,940
X hours.

420
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,880
Calm the F down.

421
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,100
I urge each and every one

422
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,780
of you to have a stress pill

423
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,240
ready to take when this

424
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,560
apical event begins...

425
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,920
Mississippi.

426
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,960
You're not spooky yet.

427
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,940
Just under and.

428
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:46,640

welcoming the space invaders our local police chief george

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:31,880
his wife former alicia douglas alicia wiggins and their visiting aunt from schenectady new york

435
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,860
now they're about to approach the head of the alien

436
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,600
delegation and we're going to listen for what they're going to be telling us in this special time

437
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,860

443
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:31,920

444
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,960
yeah yeah whatever you got to work coffee yeah get the sponge

445
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,460
it's quite fatiguing to use the crell device eat another sponge also pleasure this is the best sponge

446
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:49,360
cake i've had in weeks the brain itself is like a sponge a meringue don't listen to your brain right

447
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,720
now it's like your brain on drugs yeah maybe communicating with angels or devils who knows

448
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:04,700
your brain is not the big boss of this area what did we figure out about angels earlier

449
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,860
i remember something about angels right now

450
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,680
reverend stang what was it about an angel they're not going to be of any help to us

451
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:19,020
the angel of the world wasn't that what it was yeah subgenius is the angel

452
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,900
but the angels themselves have they're by bound by a non-aggression pact and uh

453
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:35,120
are not going to be any help at all uh contrary to what you might have heard when x-day uh begins to

454
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,500
move

455
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,560
the devils on the other hand it's uh oh they've free for all really they're going to be everywhere

456
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,260
they they don't play by anybody else's rules and that's why they're devils and uh

457
00:16:50,040 --> 00:17:01,400
that's why we need jr bob dobbs as the broker the uh the deal maker and the midnight toker to keep

458
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,360
you to keep the devils on our side

459
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,940
meekard

460
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,020
the devils on our side

461
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,020


462
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,020


463
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,020


464
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,020


465
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,100
the darkanto flower

466
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,400
the handle foil

467
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,740
the

468
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,400
jara

469
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:24,860
is this matter cast music from earth i hate that actual seriously aliens wants inhabited our own world

470
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,800
These ancient pictographs in a cave in Oslo, Norway, conclusively and convulsively demonstrate

471
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:43,380
that our Earth has been diddled ages ago by an alien invasion vanguard,

472
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,020
which may still be here operating in an unknown zip code.

473
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,860
And this History Channel special is the ultimate proof of ghosts and life after death.

474
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,980
Thank you, Ivan Stagg.

475
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,680
Yes, there may be an alien listening to this or living next to you.

476
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,980
The question is, what to do about it?

477
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,100
Keep listening, and we're going to provide the answer.

478
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,000
Will the real Martian please stand up?

479
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,360
No, not you, the guy in the back with the two sets of...

480
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,580
Yeah, that's right.

481
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,460
Could you come forward, please?

482
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,040
He doesn't have a microphone.

483
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,660
He needs two microphones, one for each head.

484
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,300
That is, I think, just a breathing orifice.

485
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,320
Oh, you could be right.

486
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,340
Well, they're bringing him a mic in just a moment.

487
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,120
Their language, I'm told, is a kind of wheezing noise.

488
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,940
It's been described as like a concertina shooting air out...

489
00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:00,360
Well, but then I believe this particular radio show has been described exactly that same way.

490
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,360
That's true.

491
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,780
We've had to fight smears and allegations.

492
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:10,640
We've had to roll up our sleeves and tangle with the tufts and turts of radio repression.

493
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,800
As a matter of fact, we've got some...

494
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,500
We've had labor difficulties and many problems that we're not allowed to talk about here on...

495
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,100
Listener-sponsored radio.

496
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,080
But we're still in there and we're still punching.

497
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:27,120
And we're fighting the good fight until bruised, beaten, battered, and bloody,

498
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,540
we stumble from the ring with eyes swollen, shut, fractured jaw, and collapsed zygomatic process.

499
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,100
I'll zygomatic you, young man.

500
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,040
Oh, is this on?

501
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,900
Why are you playing this old-timey Cleveland piece?

502
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,040
To get the audience in the mood, you know.

503
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,860
Now they want to see the kill.

504
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,260
They've seen just about the march to death's gate.

505
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:02,480
But now we're going to go through the aperture into death's horrible hall.

506
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,720
These are the sub-teeny singers.

507
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,780
Oh, it's back to real life.

508
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,780
A lot of freedom of choice stuff going on.

509
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,660
Yes, freedom of choice dog food.

510
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,640
Your pup will love freedom of choice.

511
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,220
He looks one way, he looks the other, he runs in circles and he falls down.

512
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,740
Freedom of choice dog food for your dog.

513
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,300
Yes, freedom of choice dog food will make your canine...

514
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,080
Freedom of choice is what you've got.

515
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,780
Whoa!

516
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,820
At your local Safeway.

517
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,040
With a hearty woof, woof.

518
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,740
Dr. House, Governor Rocknoy.

519
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,900
Good evening, Governor Rocknoy.

520
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,080
Hi, if it isn't...

521
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,940
Welcome to our...

522
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,260
Governor, almost Congressman Rocknoy.

523
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,540
Sub-genius symposium of the airwaves.

524
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,360
I gave it my best, but I only got 22 votes.

525
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,100
How many votes did you say?

526
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,100
Doesn't sound like your best was...

527
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,740
Well, but you got out there and met the York constituents and gave them a taste of your ideas.

528
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,860
Young people these days.

529
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,160
They just don't try.

530
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,940
Governor Rocknoy tried.

531
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,240
Well, I was talking about the young people these days.

532
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:26,720
Oh.

533
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,200
Well, Governor Rocknoy's kind of young, I guess.

534
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:30,800
He's young.

535
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,180
You know what?

536
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,220
I've been...

537
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,520
I'm sorry that this is the first time I've called in a long time, but I've been working a new job over at the convenience store.

538
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,220
What is that job?

539
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,020
Yeah, I'm working 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

540
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,780
So I'm total graveyard shift.

541
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,160
Now.

542
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,260
Ah, man.

543
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:58,160
Is this still at a Speedway or is this a Downer Way or a Wakeway or a Worldway?

544
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,020
It's a Speedway, yeah.

545
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:08,020
And one of the barcodes on one of the bakery pastry goods items, which is a cheesecake.

546
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,780
Cheesecake?

547
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,300
Oh, you're getting me started.

548
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,400
One of the barcodes ends at 13013.

549
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,980
What?

550
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,640
How about that, Governor?

551
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,900
The sacred number of dobs appeared in what?

552
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,000
Way in a cheesecake?

553
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,260
In a UPC barcode for one of our bakery items, the cheesecake.

554
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,680
The disguised letters spelling out Bob's name.

555
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,580
13013.

556
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,260
Yes.

557
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,560
In a cheesecake.

558
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,960
You know, a lot of people never have figured out why 13013 was a special number.

559
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,480
Apparently, they didn't write the...

560
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,160
The special positioning of the ones and the threes.

561
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,720
Right.

562
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,540
Where the three...

563
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,540
You know, it's like a magic eye when you look at it and you say,

564
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,480
Oh, there it is.

565
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:48,900
Right.

566
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,220
Eliminate all kerning between the one and the three.

567
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,300
And the secret will be revealed to you.

568
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,180
You kind of unfocus your eyes and then you see the Bob in the 13013.

569
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,500
Smoosh and blend together, yeah.

570
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,800
You see the Bob all too late.

571
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,860
Yeah.

572
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,200
Hey, I'll tell you a couple of stories of when it happened.

573
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:09,820
Number one.

574
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,660
A few nights ago, we had a couple of kids at the Speedway.

575
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,020
They were driving recreational vehicles.

576
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,140
Uh-oh.

577
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,380
Uh-oh.

578
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,480
And I asked them, it's like, you know, hey, I showed them a way to save six cents off a gallon.

579
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,540
You know, part of, you know, my little battle against the conspiracy.

580
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,400
And they said that they were headed to festivals out in California.

581
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,140
And I told them that there was a festival at Wisteria.

582
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,220
And they said that they knew where Wisteria was.

583
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,080
And they were planning to go to the festival called X Day between June 30th and July 5th.

584
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,520
You're kidding.

585
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,240
Someone walked into the store and informed you of this?

586
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,160
Well, I kind of told them, you know, about, I suggested to them that they go to X Day Wisteria.

587
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:53,700
Oh.

588
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,960
So, you know, we're going to see two kids in a pretty big recreational vehicle.

589
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,320
Oh, at least somebody will be there.

590
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,660
Yeah.

591
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,440
Those psychos.

592
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:01,880
Yes.

593
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,360
Oh, goodness.

594
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,280
It's true.

595
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,740
At least two people will attend X Day 2011.

596
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:07,880
Yeah.

597
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,420
You know what?

598
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,880
You heard it right here, folks.

599
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,260
It's way closer to me.

600
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,280
It's only a couple hours away from me.

601
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,280
I could actually go to Wisteria.

602
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,620
And.

603
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,180
Be there in a day.

604
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,320
Well, you know, friends.

605
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,000
You don't have.

606
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,460
It doesn't matter where you are on the planet Earth.

607
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,360
You will still be ruptured if your name is in the book of life and you are a true subgenius.

608
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,500
And what's that cost?

609
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,260
It can.

610
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,640
It can.

611
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,120
You can.

612
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,700
How much does that cost?

613
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,120
What?

614
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,200
How much?

615
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,000
You know how much.

616
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,160
You can't put a value on that on a public station like this.

617
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,640
You can't.

618
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,140
But you do.

619
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,800
So, well, I mean, you can't say that, but only a dollar.

620
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,060
I tell you how much.

621
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,920
I can't even say.

622
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,600
One dollar.

623
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,420
Oh, OK.

624
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:47,880
Only.

625
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,860
You can't say anything.

626
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,980
All you can say is for free information.

627
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,260
You might be interested in checking out subgenius.com.

628
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,020
That's right.

629
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,640
Let's go to your online resource.

630
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,400
We can't do a call to action.

631
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:02,980
That's.

632
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,480
We can't.

633
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,840
That's right.

634
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,020
We tell you to turn off your radio right now.

635
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,220
We can't do that.

636
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,200
It's against the law.

637
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,060
It is.

638
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,960
We wouldn't do it.

639
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,360
We can't.

640
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,560
We can't direct you to do anything.

641
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,920
Can you threaten?

642
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,020
Threaten?

643
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,320
Control?

644
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,540
And neither do we want to manipulate you into changing your opinion or mind about anything.

645
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,800
No, that would be wrong.

646
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,440
I really just hear that.

647
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:26,580
It would be wrong.

648
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,380
Your opinion is all right with us.

649
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,860
It's your facts we have a problem with.

650
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,680
You're entitled to your own opinion.

651
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,200
Is that Princess Wee I hear squealing with laughter?

652
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,500
Yes, you can interpret it as that.

653
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,580
I can't believe I heard that from him.

654
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,240
Get this.

655
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,080
Get this, Princess Wee.

656
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,440
Get this.

657
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:47,920
Get this.

658
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:47,920


659
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,940
Last night I had a drunk chick pinch my nipple at Speedway.

660
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,460
Ooh.

661
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,340
Story number two.

662
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,500
Well, there we go.

663
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,300
She was cute, dude.

664
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,660
She was definitely, she was definitely a cute.

665
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,680
A nipple pinching drunk chick.

666
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,760
She was a milk.

667
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,520
Nipple pinching a milk.

668
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,840
At an acute angle.

669
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,880
I heard that band one time, a drunk chick pinched my nipple.

670
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:06,780
Yeah.

671
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,480
What the?

672
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,320
Hold on.

673
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,440
Total cougar.

674
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,960
I mean, this woman was a total cougar.

675
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,220
What is going on?

676
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,560
Why?

677
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:14,560


678
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:14,580
I don't know.

679
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,080
I don't know.

680
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,080


681
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,080


682
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,080


683
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,320
And then she just, she just called me, you know.

684
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,300
She's like, coming in 2005.

685
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,540
I am.

686
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,940
Hello, mom.

687
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,720
Can I call the MF mom.

688
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:24,800
I'm scared.

689
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:24,800


690
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:24,800


691
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,620
Because that's what she said.

692
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,100
She said she was expecting MF.

693
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,660
Good Lord.

694
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,360
It is somebody in 2005.

695
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,320
Yes.

696
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,180
One hardly recognizes the old place.

697
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,580
All right, we're entering your mind now.

698
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,520
Oh, Tempura.

699
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:37,880
Oh.

700
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,500
Oh.

701
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,860
Oh, moris.

702
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,100
Oh God.

703
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,140
It smells horrible in this mind.

704
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,760
It's so dark in here.

705
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,700
We have to go in through the ear.

706
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,640
Are these spider webs or what?

707
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,020
I think they are, but they're so incredibly tough.

708
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,320
They're slimy.

709
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,820
Yeah, you can wrap your camera in them.

710
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,860
Stringy.

711
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,140
It's all slimy.

712
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,500
There we go.

713
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,380
It's pulsating.

714
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,340
Now we're choking down the spinal tap cord.

715
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,960
It's throbbing and yellowing.

716
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,840
This is chunky fluid I'm standing in.

717
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,980
It's like, you know, kind of growing against my ankle.

718
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,040
That's the replacement fluid.

719
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,340
Oh, brains are gross.

720
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,960
I'm glad I'm a subgenius.

721
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,720
There we go.

722
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,960
I won't describe what just happened, but...

723
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,080
This is a common standard side effect.

724
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,320
Nothing really to worry about.

725
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,800
It looks a lot worse than it is.

726
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,340
You're fine.

727
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,340
It just does look a lot worse.

728
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,880
There's actually not much really even to remark on here.

729
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,580
This is such a common event and simple and really harmless in its own way.

730
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,920
It looks bad.

731
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,900
We'll grant you that.

732
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,640
The show must...

733
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,440
It's almost up to my knees.

734
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,180
Are you sure this is going on?

735
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,260
I, uh, I'm very sorry about that.

736
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,780
What's that happen so fast?

737
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,280
You know, if it's possible, we'll try to keep, uh, stuff like that from, uh, bothering you, uh, from, for the rest of your stay.

738
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,880
And then he gets a, uh, job as a truck driver for the Forest Service.

739
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,660
I know a guy who drives a truck.

740
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,620
Mama, don't let your babies grow up to be truck drivers.

741
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,160
Burp, burp, burp, burp, burp, burp, burp.

742
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,740
Stop, yeah.

743
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,580
He can't drive, but he's short.

744
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,500
He can do the multiplication table backwards and upside down in his sleep.

745
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,660
He can saw and whistle Yankee Doodle through a mouthful of soda crackers.

746
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,640
Put a brew in his mouth and it'll sweep the floor for you.

747
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,820
I recommend that...

748
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,280
What the hell?

749
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,900
Hire the...

750
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,300
I recommend it.

751
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,440
You're right.

752
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,940
I recommend it myself.

753
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,180
Okay, it's some kind of...

754
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,960
I recommend it...

755
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,420
I think it's some kind of cult, folks.

756
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,080
Don't call 848-4425.

757
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,880
And the police of my mind will come and rescue you if you call that.

758
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,280
Police?

759
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
848-4425.

760
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,880
I called in.

761
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,240
Don't call that number.

762
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,860
Now, if you call that number while the hour of slack is on, you'll get a completely different show.

763
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Isn't that number gone?

764
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,600
In another state, and it won't even be this particular show.

765
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,120
Although it will probably be in this state.

766
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,880
Does the guy not edit that out?

767
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,200
The guy that runs those shows?

768
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,780
This week, that guy might not have time.

769
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,500
Okay, so...

770
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,760
There's not enough time for him to have edited it.

771
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,780
So in Cleveland, you should be hearing it like...

772
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,800
You're not going to...

773
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,620
Don't try to call that number unless you're...

774
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,640
848-4425.

775
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,380
Yeah, to call California.

776
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,980
848-4425.

777
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,320
Yeah.

778
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,760
An area code in Washington.

779
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,060
Wall-Way?

780
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,260
Wall-Way?

781
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,460
Wall-Way?

782
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:44,480
Wall-Way?

783
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,480


784
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,480


785
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,480


786
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,480


787
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,480


788
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Wall-Way?

789
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:45,700
Wall-Way?

790
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,160
Wall-Way?

791
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,560
Oh, wake up, women here.

792
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,420
Listen to old Jenny Appleton.

793
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,000
Oh!

794
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,900
Let's remember.

795
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,020
You see?

796
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,780
A sunny smile plastered on your face.

797
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,280
Yes, it is.

798
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,140
You see?

799
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,080
A lie from an appleton is dropped into the car.

800
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,700
Get on track.

801
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,560
Why are you bothering us, old lady?

802
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,140
She's just trying to sing a splendid song.

803
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,860
But she's dead.

804
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,920
That doesn't matter.

805
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,140
It happens to the best of us.

806
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,300
She sings on and on.

807
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,720
It's actually my landlady.

808
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,780
I think.

809
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,140
She sounds so far away.

810
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,480
She's already moved on to bigger and brighter things.

811
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,100
So thankfully far away.

812
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,000
12 seconds.

813
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,980
That's the new world for you now.

814
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,260
Wall-Way?

815
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,660
Tall-A-Way?

816
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,800
Downtown's not the same as it used to be.

817
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,320
Well, she'll talk and then put the phone down and go putter around the house and then talk again.

818
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,160
That's your cue.

819
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,620
You call her.

820
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,060
All right.

821
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,360
Thanks.

822
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,540
I'm just, you know,

823
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,720
Petula Clark was a child.

824
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,180
Good job.

825
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,960
Good job.

826
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Even as a young subteen girl, she was a singing sensation on the British airwaves.

827
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,780
In fact, she was even the subject of a British comic strip.

828
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,480
I was coming in here.

829
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,300
Are you talking about Petula Clark?

830
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:07,860
Petula Clark.

831
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,340
Yes.

832
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,860
That's right.

833
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,140
It's true.

834
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,080
Petula Clark's career stretches back.

835
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,020
Back into the 1930s when she was the beloved.

836
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,060
Get a piece of pie, bud.

837
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,480
Childhood singing star.

838
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,280
Where are they now?

839
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,040
Sweet Petula.

840
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,520
Shut up the both of you.

841
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,920
Who cares where are they now?

842
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,820
Shut up the two of you.

843
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,560
If only.

844
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
If only.

845
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,140
Shut up.

846
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,760
I'm trying to listen.

847
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,580
Nice try.

848
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,100
Dr. Ducky Doolittle.

849
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,580
This is Ducky?

850
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,520
Oh, no.

851
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:43,700
No.

852
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,460
Who's that duck in the duck it rode in on?

853
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,700
If only it were her calling them.

854
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,100
Shut up.

855
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,740
I'm trying to listen.

856
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,760
Then it would be a more scientific sample.

857
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,840
You're a bunch of quacks.

858
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,500
Call yourself doctors.

859
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
But you're quacks.

860
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,900
The ducks rebuttal.

861
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,100
Quack, quack, quack.

862
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,180
That's why we spell doctor with a K.

863
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,760
Oh.

864
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,500
Doctor.

865
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:12,900
Doctor.

866
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,120
Doctor.

867
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,260
Doctor.

868
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:13,500


869
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:13,500


870
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:13,500


871
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,800
Doctor Howell.

872
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,420
Doctor.

873
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,220
Donald.

874
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,820
Doctor Howell.

875
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,780
I'm like certainly enlightened.

876
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,640
Is this X-Day right here?

877
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,700
It might be.

878
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,200
These are common waterfall.

879
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,180
Mergens are ducks lying over the X-Day site.

880
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,740
Well, you know, the saddest of all is the subgenius who has so little imagination

881
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,240
that when he or she is ruptured up onto the escape vessel,

882
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,740
he can only...

883
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,700
I can only imagine his or her cheesy little apartment and crappy job.

884
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,360
And that's what the escape vessel becomes for that person.

885
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,440
And they never know that X-Day happened.

886
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,660
That could have...

887
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,820
Could that have happened to you, my friend?

888
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,180
No actual cheese.

889
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,220
Just cheesiness.

890
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,580
If you'll give up your record collection and your comic book collection here on Earth,

891
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,580
you'll have a better one when you get to Planet X.

892
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,140
I'm waiting for you.

893
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,920
Wow, look.

894
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,500
What is this?

895
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:13,500


896
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,820
Planet X has neon lights, not sodium vapor lights like Earth.

897
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,480
Actually, St. Palmer Vredes reminded me this very afternoon

898
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:31,820
that we ran the shark under the bus when we concentrated on X-Day and Bigfoot

899
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,760
instead of doing what he said, which was motivational seminars,

900
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,760
which I was supposed to direct.

901
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,480
He just would have the idea and then I would do all the dirty work.

902
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,320
Proving Palmer Vredes is a true subgenius.

903
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,760
...some time.

904
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,480
And has learned a lot from Dr. Philodrumon.

905
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,560
Find some other guy to do it.

906
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,620
What?

907
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:53,820


908
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,160
What?

909
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,960
Nemzlow was an expert at that, too.

910
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,740
He would announce that something would happen and then wait for others to make it happen.

911
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,140
Usually it happened ineptly and poorly.

912
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,100
Causing him to rage against the dying of the light.

913
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,700
But it's not his fault.

914
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,900
Somebody else did it.

915
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,660
...against the dying of the light.

916
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,320
Cool.

917
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,520
No, he was still in...

918
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,620
Well, the probe is still in...

919
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,780
Nemzlow.

920
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,280
What was the worst devival?

921
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,760
Which was the worst subgenius show?

922
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,680
And what was the worst episode of that show?

923
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,600
Call in and let us know, friends.

924
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:34,260
I understand we were criticized internationally for our performance last week.

925
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:42,440
Lacking Dr. Howell, we apparently were not interesting enough or informative enough, perhaps,

926
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,640
for certain individuals overseas.

927
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,780
Who are these mouth-eaters?

928
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,020
Said that with all that talent, the show should have been a little better.

929
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:57,500
Certain Finnish-Mexican Americans have been known to actually criticize the show.

930
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,980
Who reside in China.

931
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:10,300
To raise a question as to whether the quality was up to the potential of the talent, such

932
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,020
as it was.

933
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,360
Do you approve teaching Chinese as a language in California's public schools?

934
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,720
...what's happening in Egypt?

935
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,800
...I wanna hear what's going on in Egypt.

936
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,500
...well, y'all, you got Pee-jo.

937
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,380
There are plenty of other stations covering that right now.

938
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,220
We're taking like a little rest.

939
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,280
It's all very easy to understand.

940
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,760
I don't think I can get a Pee-jo until after 6.

941
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,520
Somebody's mad and somebody else is mad and they're both like really, really mad at each other.

942
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,780
I'm mad too, Rachel.

943
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,500
I'm mad too, Eddie.

944
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,880
I think I had some of the stickers.

945
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,520
Yeah, right.

946
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,760
...you guys came back free, Rachel.

947
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,140
I'm mad too, Ed, I'm mad too, Bob.

948
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,500
I'm too mad, Bob.

949
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,220
I'm too mad, Alfred E. Newman.

950
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,140
I'm mad too, Alfred.

951
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,540
...I'm mad, Todd Bud.

952
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,580
...I'm mad-ow for mad-ow.

953
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,920
Yeah, I'm mad too, Mad-ow.

954
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,820
...that's a lot better than I'm-mad-too, Rachel.

955
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,300
Isn't it?

956
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,180
God, thank you, Princess, Wei,

957
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,400
for having that other half of the brain cell at home.

958
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,900
Sui-gaaaaaah!

959
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,860
Yeah, it's nice having the other half of the brain.

960
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,860
the brain cell? At least in the same

961
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,500
vicinity.

962
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,860
I've been driving around all day with just

963
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,400
my half of the brain cell.

964
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,840
So I could remember everything

965
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,040
but I couldn't enjoy it

966
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,980
and didn't know what any of it was for.

967
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,740
I'm the hard drive

968
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,040
and she's the processor.

969
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,000
Yes, you ain't seen

970
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,020
hard until you've seen my drive.

971
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,880
And now we're getting into a junior

972
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,860
version of the brag of the

973
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,320
subgenius.

974
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,220
The junior brag of the sophomore subgenius.

975
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,600
Brag of the imitated

976
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,880
subgenius actually is the most common

977
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,180
one.

978
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,680
Yeah, that is

979
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,480
very...

980
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,580
The worst, you know, almost worse

981
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,700
than the I'm a Bob, which is the

982
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,340
psycho who thinks he's Bob,

983
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,040
is the I'm a tater

984
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,260
who thinks he is tater.

985
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,820
Tater Gumfries of

986
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,160
scrub genius fame.

987
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:10,720
Yes.

988
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,000
A clear and plain

989
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,300
imitator, as you call him.

990
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,920
Imitating Mr. Gumfries.

991
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,880
And then the worst

992
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,720
is the dictator. Of course.

993
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,860
Yes, that's true. He can't keep it

994
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,800
in his...

995
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,400
What's the difference between

996
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,080
Castro and a jockey strap?

997
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,260
Castro motor oil.

998
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,740
One is a dictator

999
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,920
and the other

1000
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,540
is the late Rudy Ray

1001
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:37,860
Moore.

1002
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,580
Did he die?

1003
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,500
Yes, the great Rudy Ray Moore died

1004
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
of complications from diabetes

1005
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,340
I think last year.

1006
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,920
Damn.

1007
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,460
I hate thinking of that.

1008
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,200
Yeah, he was known...

1009
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,740
Most people knew him more for his

1010
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,360
exploitation action movies such as

1011
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,700
The Human Tornado

1012
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,740
and Dolomite.

1013
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,460
But I best knew him for his

1014
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,300
Party records, released on

1015
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,540
Kent Records, which he later

1016
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,100
explained to me was his apartment

1017
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,900
in L.A.

1018
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,660
And, uh...

1019
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,080
You know, the sad thing was, Dr. Drummond,

1020
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,760
the whole time that we were worshipping

1021
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,860
the Party records of Rudy Ray Moore,

1022
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,820
he lived in Dallas,

1023
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,200
was working as a waiter

1024
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,460
at the Adolphus Hotel,

1025
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,740
and occasionally doing shows,

1026
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,080
but not at the kind of clubs

1027
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,220
that we were cool enough to know about.

1028
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,220
Oh, man.

1029
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,480
Did you know that? No, I didn't know that he was in Dallas.

1030
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,040
Yeah, he was in Dallas the whole time

1031
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,100
that we thought he was in L.A.

1032
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,380
L.A.

1033
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,960
We thought he was rich and famous, and he was actually

1034
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,040
famous and poor.

1035
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,080
Right down the street.

1036
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,580
Right there, ready for revival.

1037
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,360
But his fortunes changed,

1038
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,040
and as he told me in person,

1039
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,940
Blockbuster had been

1040
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,160
really great for him.

1041
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,740
And here comes the check now.

1042
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,060
Yes, the check, the royalty check

1043
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,660
of Rudy Ray Moore from

1044
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,240
Blockbuster.

1045
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,020
Wow.

1046
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,980
Ooh, that is a...

1047
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,840
It's a little late, making a royalty check.

1048
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,160
For a genius of comedy like Rudy Ray Moore

1049
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,120
and his film crew.

1050
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,380
But he was in his 70s.

1051
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,760
He made it to his 70s.

1052
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,340
Didn't he?

1053
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,700
He didn't hit 80, did he?

1054
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,980
No, he was 75 or so.

1055
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,040
77.

1056
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,840
He told me I looked like Bela Lugosi.

1057
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,280
Well, at the time,

1058
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,480
I didn't have the mustache and goatee,

1059
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,020
and I wasn't...

1060
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,060
He was, in fact, made up

1061
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,240
as Cagliostro,

1062
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,060
the ageless mason

1063
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,180
magician.

1064
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,160
And I did kind of have a

1065
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,480
Bela Lugosi look.

1066
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,800
I guess to him, to him, all of us...

1067
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,100
So you gave him a pass on that one.

1068
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,380
Gringos look alike, I suppose.

1069
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,140
Yeah.

1070
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,880
Well, they all look alike to me.

1071
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,380
Yeah, you were saying,

1072
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,520
Dr. Drummond, that you don't differentiate

1073
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,760
between people's...

1074
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,680
races, genders,

1075
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,960
skeletal...

1076
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,300
No, to you, everyone is exactly

1077
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,720
the same.

1078
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,700
Yes, I believe that, and sincerely,

1079
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,900
that we all are here.

1080
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,480
We've all got heads

1081
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,140
and eyes and...

1082
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,060
Do they work or not?

1083
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,880
You've got...

1084
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,060
Almost all of us that are alive do have a head

1085
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,220
of some kind.

1086
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,380
Some have more head than others.

1087
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,280
Some have more head and some have

1088
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,060
gray head.

1089
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,420
Some have grand, swollen,

1090
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,720
great heads.

1091
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,280
We saw that great head today.

1092
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,160
That's right.

1093
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,840
Actually, we saw the tomb of great head.

1094
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,040
A grave marker

1095
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,840
marked great head.

1096
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,640
Right next to the tomb of stupid.

1097
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,820
You can get your advice

1098
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,600
from the tomb of the unknown

1099
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,160
struggling evidence show.

1100
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,860
You never went to the Rosicrucians?

1101
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,340
No, we never did make it

1102
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,580
to the Rosicrucian temple.

1103
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,040


1104
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,820
Although we still got 15 minutes.

1105
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,600
We could probably get over there.

1106
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,920
Let's hurry.

1107
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,740
Let's hurry.

1108
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,200
Let's put the show in warp drive.

1109
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,300
We'll make it over to...

1110
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,380
Do you know the way to San Jose?

1111
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,380
Yeah, it's right down that way.

1112
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,740
That is where the Rosicrucian city is.

1113
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,360
It's no match for Dobstown.

1114
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,560
Not even the little American Dobstown.

1115
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,240
A brawling, fighting young man

1116
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,100
or the Brazilian Dobstown.

1117
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,820
Or about a fortune for himself.

1118
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,120
But no sissy-footed

1119
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,420
liberal city council member

1120
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,500
to tell him he can't have a barbecue

1121
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,560
in his own backyard

1122
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,460
or an electric train set in his garage.

1123
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,920
A land as big as the mountains

1124
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,800
and as wide as the green

1125
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,580
rustling forest.

1126
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,280
The call of the moose is heard echoing.

1127
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,820
A sissy-footed great head.

1128
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,020
And they do have that.

1129
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,620
Hey, sissy-foot.

1130
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,920
Your call screen.

1131
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,460
Your call screener just now

1132
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,760
was asking me some really weird

1133
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
personal questions.

1134
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,520
Really?

1135
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,220
Well, we're trying to profile

1136
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,280
everyone that calls now.

1137
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,020
Do you have any searches on YouTube?

1138
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,080
Yeah, we just, we have to know.

1139
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,900
You know the way things are.

1140
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,640
Do you guys really need a photocopy

1141
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,560
of my house key?

1142
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,920
Well, it would help.

1143
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,080
It's not mandatory, but...

1144
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,840
A clay impression.

1145
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,180
If you could press it in a piece of clay

1146
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,280
and mail that would be better.

1147
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,360
This is me, see.

1148
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,980
I'm an essential man.

1149
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,020
Dental work clay stuff.

1150
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,420
I gave you guys my social numbers.

1151
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,840
I might as well just give you

1152
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,260
fingerprints and...

1153
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,640
Put your passport in there too

1154
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,280
if you don't mind.

1155
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:36,880
Okay.

1156
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,420
There we go.

1157
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,120
Yeah, that's all.

1158
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,560
I just wanted to make sure that...

1159
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,160
Really not that much.

1160
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,720
I mean, we just know it's...

1161
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,180
It's not like we're actually

1162
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:42,840
going to use it.

1163
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,040
No, but it's profitable these days

1164
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,380
to...

1165
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,120
The identity theft rings

1166
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,280
that we circumnavigate.

1167
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,340
I just didn't want to make anyone...

1168
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,580
It's good that my...

1169
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,680
At least my thoughts and ideas

1170
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,160
are identified as my own

1171
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,640
by copyright when I contributed

1172
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,340
them to the show.

1173
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,280
Pin number, please.

1174
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,780
There's no price too high to pay

1175
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,920
for attaining cosmic consciousness.

1176
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,920
That's good.

1177
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,120
Satisfaction, much satisfaction

1178
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,860
was mine.

1179
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,420
All I had to do was purchase

1180
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,560
the introductory package

1181
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,300
and I'm still as depressed as ever.

1182
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,160
I cannot carry the package.

1183
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:19,820
Yeah, it's...

1184
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:20,780
Whoa.

1185
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,620
You have to pack the package.

1186
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,820
Now remember...

1187
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,840
Pack that package.

1188
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,020
As handsome as your package is,

1189
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,320
you need the other junk.

1190
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,260
The accessory kits available

1191
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,040
at our subsidiary...

1192
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,020
Our subsidiary...

1193
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,100
At your free post office box.

1194
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,640
The warehouse outlet

1195
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,040
on eBay.

1196
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,040
But I am much better dressed

1197
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,720
than I was when I was following

1198
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,640
them damn Jehovah's quitlessness.

1199
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,200
Quitlessness, this says.

1200
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,140
You mean like Michael Jackson?

1201
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,100
So have you experimented

1202
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,860
with many religions?

1203
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,100
Uh, only...

1204
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,260
Only this religion, A.

1205
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,540
Religion A.

1206
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,780
What am I supposed to say here?

1207
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,020
The script is missing the phrase.

1208
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,720
Say the first church of the last life.

1209
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,700
Say first church of the last...

1210
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:05,800
Laugh.

1211
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,780
No, no, no.

1212
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,240
Go back, go back.

1213
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,580
Start again.

1214
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,400
First church of the last life.

1215
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,660
No method to unend the last life.

1216
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,680
Proselytize the fruit members of the very...

1217
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,920
I renounce all church.

1218
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,980
I renounce the church.

1219
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,060
I renounce Bob's...

1220
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:22,380
The last church of the end of the world.

1221
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,940
Don't listen to him, caller.

1222
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,200
Say no.

1223
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,440
Bob loves you.

1224
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,860
It's the same old thing.

1225
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,440
Now do the dance.

1226
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,080
Do the dance.

1227
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,020
Just separate it between...

1228
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,480
That's enough, that's enough.

1229
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,720
Okay, I know you know it.

1230
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,760
I love you.

1231
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,640
We know that you know the dance.

1232
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,700
If you know the dance.

1233
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,980
I live on the second floor.

1234
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,480
I can't dance that much right now.

1235
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:42,940
I just...

1236
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,640
I'm already in trouble with this first floor guy as it is.

1237
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,000
Once we make it to the first...

1238
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,920
The hundredth caller.

1239
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,400
All the callers will do the dance.

1240
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:53,920
Together.

1241
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:54,820
When the...

1242
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,540
They won't have any choice.

1243
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,000
I just have to recital...

1244
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,320
Critical mass.

1245
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,080
I just have to recital Fireside Theater albums now.

1246
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,700
Yeah, the hundredth caller.

1247
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,580
The hundredth Hitler.

1248
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,340
The hundredth Manson.

1249
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,220
Two Twilight Zone for me, man.

1250
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,120
The hundredth.

1251
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,580
It takes a thousand months.

1252
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,060
It takes a thousand.

1253
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,160
It's a sign up ahead.

1254
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,460
It takes a hundred monkeys in our religion.

1255
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,200
Not a hundred.

1256
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,720
I hope Dick Cheney knows where you live.

1257
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,660
You've just crossed over into...

1258
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,460
We need a four thousand monkeys in our religion.

1259
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,720
I hope the Fireside Package has arrived okay.

1260
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,560
Chain Dicky.

1261
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,120
Dick Cheney will walk the streets on the day he dies.

1262
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,780
He's on the Fireside Theater.

1263
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,560
He's back to doing a weekly show.

1264
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,060
Dick Cheney shall rise.

1265
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:36,760
Yes, I do.

1266
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,860
Send one to each show.

1267
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,560
He shall rock the streets of this land.

1268
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,860
I didn't send one for Bishop.

1269
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,920
I'm sorry, Bishop Joey.

1270
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,460
I didn't send you a Fireside Package.

1271
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,220
I was probably joking.

1272
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,060
Oh, man.

1273
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,160
Oh, man.

1274
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,080
Do you want one?

1275
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,100
Bring it to the party.

1276
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,080
Only now you see the error of your ways.

1277
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,560
The folly.

1278
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,540
The sheer folly.

1279
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,580
What the music says is I am going to...

1280
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,460
The pieces of error.

1281
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,020
Oh, the damnation of imprecision.

1282
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,460
The music is too damn loud.

1283
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,520
Her bathroom.

1284
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,680
It is too damn high.

1285
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,500
Her bathroom is a special kind of place.

1286
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,480
Oh, my God.

1287
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,180
He turned it down.

1288
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,100
There's a smile on everyone's face.

1289
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,400
I actually...

1290
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,760
I was trying to get him to turn it up, but he actually...

1291
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,220
Is Doug sick?

1292
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,460
Is there something wrong?

1293
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,840
No, he's just a little out of sorts.

1294
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,440
You see, he's been...

1295
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,660
Oh, just a moment.

1296
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,820
There's only one toilet on this floor.

1297
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,960
You know, we're performing a mass ritual.

1298
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,860
His aspirin worked too well.

1299
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,700
Ah, yes, mine is burning too.

1300
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,420
Well, all we're going to do is move the medicine cabinet a little bit over to the left.

1301
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,760
We're going to keep all these...

1302
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,780
The same medicines...

1303
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,060
Watch the medicine.

1304
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:49,820
Watch the medicine.

1305
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,860
Yeah, no, we're watching.

1306
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,020
So, you want to keep the...

1307
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:59,480
Don't let it fall and keep the sink there from falling off the wall when we loosen the bolts.

1308
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,940
Protect the saint at all costs.

1309
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,340
I knew this would happen when I moved.

1310
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,140
Too late.

1311
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,280
Is this what we get on the album, or do we have to pay extra?

1312
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,980
Oh, no, they're free.

1313
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,580
I sent you guys a book.

1314
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,020
Ah, okay.

1315
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:15,980
Oh, here it is.

1316
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,600
I found it.

1317
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
Put down the book.

1318
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,240
Slowly.

1319
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,600
Come to the window.

1320
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,060
Come to the parade.

1321
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:23,860
Sweet is the night.

1322
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:24,720
That's right.

1323
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,500
The 33rd annual Saints' Day Parade will be taking place this year in San Francisco.

1324
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,140
Wait for it.

1325
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,220
We're going to get the Embarcadero Plaza hat and boots.

1326
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,740
And then that night at Rhythmix Cultural Works,

1327
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,120
the...

1328
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,000
You stupid art show.

1329
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,220
We'll be having a big...

1330
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,320
Here it comes.

1331
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,520
Rhythmix Cultural Works.

1332
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,280
So be there.

1333
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,020
Here come the youth.

1334
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,340
I know, I know.

1335
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,960
But you know, you never know.

1336
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:52,020
I'll be there with you, Bishop Joey, as will all the other members of this self-same cast of crazy...

1337
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,180
And then again, again.

1338
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,740
I am so glad I became a subscriber.

1339
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,020
I get to go to the parade before everybody else.

1340
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,940
Yeah, you were the guy that got there real early, right?

1341
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,820
I am already at the parade.

1342
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,240
Such pointless boasting.

1343
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,640
You're already waiting for the parade.

1344
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,860
Vainglorious bragging.

1345
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,900
Where are they?

1346
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,760
You know you never know, but you know you never know, but you know you never know.

1347
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,780
The parade was so good, I became trapped in Echoplex.

1348
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,140
Parade of Progress.

1349
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:23,960
Echoplex.

1350
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,000
Echoplex.

1351
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,200
You know you never know, but you know you never know, but you know you never know.

1352
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,040
Am I dreaming, or am I dreaming?

1353
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,300
Or am I dreaming?

1354
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,600
Or am I dreaming?

1355
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,620
But you know you never know, but you know you never know, but you know you never know.

1356
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,900
No, seriously, I sent a book to the station, I hope it arrives.

1357
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,460
I sent another book to the station.

1358
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,820
No, seriously, this show is messing with my head, man.

1359
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,360
I guess I'll go and look and see if there's some book.

1360
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,800
Or if you're just talking some jive.

1361
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,920
If you're just talking some jive.

1362
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,900
jive. They're great.

1363
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,960
Now it's messing in

1364
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,960
my head. Puzzling evidence

1365
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,240
went out of the station

1366
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,880
to look for the book you

1367
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,180
had sent. The show is out of control.

1368
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,100
And as far as I can look, you didn't come back

1369
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,860
with no book, so you're right.

1370
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,320
You lost my friend.

1371
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,980
He was driving a minute ago.

1372
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,620
Yeah, your book is here.

1373
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,320
The show is about to hit a tier.

1374
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,640
Yeah, your book is here.

1375
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,380
Yes, your book

1376
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,860
all for next week and

1377
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,380
yeah, an end further than that.

1378
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,620
The book of death.

1379
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,680
Companion to the book of life.

1380
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,860
Not to be confused with the

1381
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,780
Tibetan book of the dead, which

1382
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,400
goes with those zombie movies.

1383
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,080
In the hall of Anubis, the lord of the

1384
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,920
dead, when your

1385
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,280
judgment shall be made,

1386
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,980
your good deeds

1387
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,020
weighed against your evil ones

1388
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,560
and your soul

1389
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,720
given under the custody

1390
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,120
of the sealed and sacred

1391
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,260
forbidden valley of Hadoff

1392
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,740
in Neferab.

1393
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,020
Hot dogs, cool.

1394
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,820
But beware,

1395
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,500
the shambling reanimated

1396
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,240
mummy may enact

1397
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,260
terrific vengeance.

1398
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,600
This is what most Americans know about

1399
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,080
Hobo Chang Bao.

1400
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,420
Hobo Chang Bao.

1401
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:31,440
Hobo Chang Bao.

1402
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,700
Hobo Chang Bao.

1403
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:32,700


1404
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:32,700


1405
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,440
The stupid of you.

1406
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,500
Oh, God.

1407
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,220
Yeah, that's what I wanted to say.

1408
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,200
I heard a rumor that the

1409
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,720
St. Stupids Day parade is not going to be

1410
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,500
held this year.

1411
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,480
No, no, we have to we have to skip it.

1412
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,420
But but since next year is canceled,

1413
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,700
we have to move next year's up.

1414
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,240
So we're going to do next year's parade

1415
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,860
this year.

1416
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,360
OK, so they all move back one year

1417
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,880
for the next century.

1418
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,140
So this will be the 2012

1419
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,780
parade. This will be the 34th annual.

1420
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,640
OK, good.

1421
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,160
We're skipping the 33rd.

1422
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,340
We won't do it this year.

1423
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,040
What happened? Somebody mistakenly

1424
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,780
Well, our lawyers, I think we got a call from the Christians.

1425
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,600
They said 33.

1426
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,820
They own 33.

1427
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,340
And we look good later when they try to figure out why there's no 33.

1428
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,620
Yeah, so we skip.

1429
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,000
It's like a building with no 413.

1430
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,240
This is a religion with no 33rd anniversary.

1431
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,000
We sure didn't have an extra.

1432
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,860
Every time this happens, we do this.

1433
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,040
That's why they call it a tradition.

1434
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:26,960
Yeah.

1435
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,000
You can count on it.

1436
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,500
I mean, you know, every 33rd year, skip.

1437
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:31,620
Skip.

1438
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,060
We'll do this the 66th year, too, right?

1439
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,220
Yeah, but only half as fast.

1440
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,220
Oh, okay.

1441
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,960
What about the 99th year?

1442
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:39,480
We'll do it.

1443
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,500
We can do that upside down.

1444
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,000
We'll do it.

1445
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,500
We'll do it.

1446
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,180
That's great.

1447
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,840
When we come to it, young fella.

1448
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,040
We're pretty much in the 99th minute of the show here.

1449
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,360
And then, of course, Rhythmics, Cultural Works, the Art Gallery.

1450
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:54,340
Okay, well, I guess we go back to the regular thing next week, right?

1451
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,920
Yeah, yeah.

1452
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,320
Just regular.

1453
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:56,740
Just regular.

1454
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,800
Everybody, just take a step.

1455
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,480
Take a breath.

1456
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,740
Regular or pay attention.

1457
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,280
Take a step backwards.

1458
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,240
A puzzling evidence show.

1459
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,280
A puzzling evidence show, but also like the religious summit of all the various, well,

1460
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,160
two various religions.

1461
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,360
It's a veritable potpourri, a potpourri.

1462
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:11,920
Bingo.

1463
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,160
A potpourri of potpourri.

1464
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,960
Yes, that's what it is.

1465
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,560
It's an ecumenical salad or perhaps sandwich being shared by two great religions.

1466
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,100
Yes.

1467
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,280
Ecumenical moment.

1468
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,240
Would you pass the ketchup, please?

1469
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:31,260
And we're here to commemorate it, the closing moments of our special version of the Puzzling

1470
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:35,900
Evidence Show featuring Reverend Ivan Stang.

1471
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,480
That's right.

1472
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,100
The head of our order, the Church of the Subject.

1473
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,640
I'm just going to go out chanting and dancing over here.

1474
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,020
Yeah.

1475
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,600
Thank you.

1476
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,240
Well, it was the cleaner of the head of our order.

1477
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:53,660
The head of the order is down the hall.

1478
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,540
Oh, good.

1479
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,940
I got the 13 minutes delay on it.

1480
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,040
Now we're approaching the most amazing part of this ceremony.

1481
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,360
The ceremony of sacrifice.

1482
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,100
As the bobbies give forth one of their nines.

1483
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,060
To be the food of the bomb.

1484
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,380
In this mysterious and obscure mystical way.

1485
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:23,860
Somehow the immolated flesh of the willing victim shall be converted to that of the

1486
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,120
E-pop of the Church of the Subgenius.

1487
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:31,080
They say themselves the semi-legendary J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

1488
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,700
In a moment we'll see the playing begin.

1489
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:42,540
The first round of special torment being prepared by the International Board of Nurses Assistance.

1490
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:52,560
And from Oslo, Norway, this is Ralph Fielding Snell signing off and wishing you happy sportsmanship

1491
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,000
in the future.

1492
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,140
My ears hurt.

1493
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,040
It's wrong, I know, but it's a national security matter.

1494
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,360
And that's all there is to it.

1495
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,580
Well, they're kind of like them Smurfs.

1496
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,260
They're real mean and they ain't blues.

1497
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:08,720
Psychodromic.

1498
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,140
Don't play.

1499
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,700
Standard tool for therapy.

1500
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:15,540
Done.

1501
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,640
Ten to twelve hours tops.

1502
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,460
All of the cells of your body will dissolve into a kind of organic stew.

1503
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,660
I'll give you this in full flow.

1504
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,400
I'll be the force of the region.

1505
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,280
So much has been happening.

1506
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,340
So many strange things.

1507
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,760
This place is driving me crazy.

1508
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,780
There's a dissident hiding in the hotel.

1509
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,960
It's like the Nazis never ended.

1510
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:56,140
And from where I'm sitting, I don't see any sense in you jumping off any building.

1511
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,180
No.

1512
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:57,560
No.

1513
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,180
Well, thank you for listening.

1514
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,760
Go to sleep now.

1515
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,740
You must get a good night's sleep.

1516
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:16,300
I wake up and there are many totally unfamiliar surroundings and noises in the morning.

1517
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,400
Let's imagine that you're deaf to the word and the bricks kicking right now.

1518
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,220
The morning bird has scared me nuts.

1519
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,320
When suddenly...

1520
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,260
Eww!

1521
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:31,020
I have to scrape it off my shoe and get it off.

1522
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,000
I've read a bit once and for all.

1523
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,380
It was great.

1524
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:37,780
Just let it talk.

1525
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,820
Fine, great.

1526
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,280
Not thinking of the past.

1527
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,580
Me too.

1528
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,100
It wasn't strange.

1529
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,360
Maybe impossible.

1530
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,500
The experience was strange.

1531
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,800
It was almost...

1532
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,460
Erotic.

1533
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,100
I don't want you to think that it was casually, wantonly sexual by any means.

1534
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,640
I never would have occurred to me in a million years.

1535
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,020
Now, why?

1536
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,120
It was something...

1537
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,320
It was friendly.

1538
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,160
You know, this would be vaguely feminine.

1539
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:06,820
Guiding.

1540
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,460
Quick, run.

1541
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,520
The car's been lit a spit.

1542
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,320
It was a hot fire.

1543
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,920
I thought I told you to go to bed.

1544
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,420
You'd better go to bed.

1545
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,540
I'll let you both just see what happens when the birds go with you.

1546
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,480
What do you know about this?

1547
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,040
You had a long, good time, your own...

1548
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:29,540
Special.

1549
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:30,620
I'm sorry.

1550
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1551
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1552
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1553
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1554
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1555
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1556
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1557
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1558
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1559
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1560
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1561
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1562
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1563
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,620


1564
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,080
I was just just trying to get at you.

1565
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,600
You know, we never followed you.

1566
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,820
There were no rules for you.

1567
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,480
Do you believe it?

1568
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,180
I wonder if I can use it when you get away with it.

1569
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:43,140
You're everything I wanted, everything I want to be, everything we all would like to be.

1570
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,760
We know better.

1571
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,140
We don't take the chance.

1572
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,700
We know sooner or later it always catches up with you.

1573
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,600
A few minutes long, the wind out, and you'll be spinning in the wind.

1574
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:00,600


1575
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:00,600


1576
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:00,600


1577
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:00,600


1578
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:00,600


1579
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:00,600


1580
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:00,600


1581
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:00,600


1582
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,180
What is it going to end?

1583
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,940
Oh, you can try and forget the whole thing.

1584
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,000
I like to work.

1585
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,440
It's better to go home, see the apartment, or see a movie.

1586
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,380
Just when I think I've got it, visualize it.

1587
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,880
I just don't know what to write.

1588
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,520
I start seeing old-fashioned classical reality again.

1589
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,420
No one out there can help us.

1590
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,580
What's that supposed to mean?

1591
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,060
Nothing.

1592
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,920
Didn't you hear about it?

1593
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,160
It was awful.

1594
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,260
You ought to have heard about that.

1595
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,340
That nut who listened to the radio?

1596
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,380
Well, the sun comes up at six in the morning.

1597
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,220
Got 50 men, jeeps, horses, dogs.

1598
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,540
I want to call Flagstaff and get two helicopters.

1599
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,580
That'd be enough.

1600
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,420
I don't know.

1601
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,680
He talked so fast I got confused.

1602
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:44,940
Imagine.

1603
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,720
A thousand-year-old mind inside a 30-year-old body.

1604
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,020
You don't mind my saying so, Doctor?

1605
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,560
You seem a little tense.

1606
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,440
Something the matter?

1607
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,900
No, nothing's the matter.

1608
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,580
You seem tense.

1609
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,620
Like a cup of coffee?

1610
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,280
Isn't that mind control?

1611
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,480
What do you call compulsory education through high school?

1612
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,580
Okay, that's it, fellas.

1613
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,340
Now you're my friends.

1614
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,240
I'm not your friend.

1615
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:13,320
I'm your friend.

1616
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,080
I'm your friend.

1617
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:14,520
I'm your friend.

1618
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:14,840
I'm your friend.

1619
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,480
And I take classes at the Ajax School of Broadcasting.

1620
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,660
Would you possibly please take a look at my tape, you know?

1621
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,220
Please?

1622
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,200
This is the tape?

1623
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:22,880
Yes, sir.

1624
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,640
It sucks.

1625
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,320
Just one thing.

1626
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:27,960
What?

1627
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,560
What?

1628
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,240
The next time someone wants to see me, I'm going to be the one to do it.

1629
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:29,240


1630
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,660
The next time someone wants to blow their brains out on camera, let them.

1631
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,100
Now.

1632
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,980
Open the mic, you did it.

1633
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:46,600
Well, another tragic tale of what happens when condoms and firearms are mixed.

1634
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,160
The next time you see me, I'm going to be the one to blow their brains out on camera.
