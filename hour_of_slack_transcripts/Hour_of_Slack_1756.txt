Meanwhile, gaseous rhetoric and stupid, bombastic, empty speechifying.
The subgenius power of swat.
They need Jesus.
Come forward and open the flaps of the oxygen tent.
There you will find Farley Granger.
His nostrils held tight.
He is called a gape with jewel-encrusted tongues.
He offers you an appetizer of auricula and possum.
Braised in ash bar.
Nestled on a soft bed with organic free trade quinoa.
Bombardier beetles work boiling anal chemicals
to make the best of the skin.
Their throbbing owners of moral indignation
form a burning pentagram through which you must pass.
Into the twilight of the unknown.
Into the recesses where your darkest anxieties reside.
Where you will land face down in a hobo's yard.
Through a hole.
Intoラs, portal.
In the dark.
Into the Helen Greenwbage.
Into a campfire.
Into a remembrance murky old hospital.
divisel everyone knows him.

Axe is kind of the feel of rehci.

I smile at them, baby.
and all the people.







God gets you up.

Thank you.

Thank you.
Oh, there you go, friends.
The slot rods.
Surfing glue.
That one's called Push Start the Fury.
But actually, that's not a proper rug for a radio show
because it's too good.
It's not a rug.
A proper rug.
It fights the laid-back ambiance of the blabbering blatherers.
Reverend Angry Lay is here.
We're the blabbering blabberers.
He's the agent for more than one of these bands, though, now.
He's got this whole stable of bands that he represents.
Wow, there's even the vinyl slack hole.
From PR News in Washington, I'm the guest PR supervisor.
Reporting.
There are reports, but there have been no reports.
The New York Times reports the FBI began shooting.
The report says the FBI were unjustified.
On Wall Street, 936-1313-612.
81% of 54,000, as well as 71% of 118,000, as part of PR News.
This is PR.
French commuters are stuffing themselves in front of Justice Department employees.
The Army said it pushed back French workers
fighting against workers.
Authorities in Chile say there has been some damage following a major PR news.
Oh, you just woke up.
Will one of you guys make room for Reverend Angry Larry, since you're just going to be
poking at your phones and being, you know, button pushing modern day millennials?
Hey, that was a question.
I answered you.
I said no, I'm not.
Oh, okay.
I'm not.
I'm not.

I'll make some room at the end of the table.
But I'm not going to let it encroach upon my tiny little two square foot area.
Yes, there's only so much that one might reasonably expect.
I'll sublet my six square inch area, though.
There are new, there's new business on the docket, and we will waive the-
I'm going to send him a line with a microphone on it.
The reading of the minutes will not necessarily have to happen.
But-
There is new business.
Oh, Reverend Angry Larry, I bet you haven't gotten your prescription yet.
What about your new album?
Handing out prescriptions.
Don't you want to talk about Reverend Angry Larry's new album?
You'll have to untie the arthritis proof knot before you can give him the pill.
In that case, I need a big sharp sword.
Are those those pills, Bob?
Alexander the Great.
Are those the pills, Bob?
Yeah.
We're going to give you some of those pills.
As soon as we can get through the knotage.
Give me the pills, Bob.
Give me those pills, Bob.
Some wiry old sailors tied some semen knots in the bag.
Give me those pills, Bob.


There you are.
Here you go.
Can I get some pills, Barry?
Right.
Now, don't allow those to overwhelm you with the side effect.
Them kind pills.
I need kind pills.
They're them kind.
Oh, they're kind enough.
To you?
They're kinder than they might be.
The kind pills?






Yeah.
Hey, I noticed that you bought your car at Dobbs Auto.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's awesome.
Pretty good, huh?
Yeah, Dobbs Honda, actually, even though that's a Toyota.
Yeah, but that's all right.
You know, there's a lot of, oh, there's cotton batten in these pills, too.
You don't see that very often anymore.
No.
Oh, that's professional.
You get fake cotton now.
It's from a real pharmacy.
Yeah.
It's not made, it's not really made with, you know, cotton.
They don't want you to have cotton anymore.
No, I don't blame them.
Who wants cotton?
Princess Wee went shopping for my cotton.



She had cotton socks, and they wouldn't sell them to her.
She had to have a prescription.
Cotton Mather socks.
I didn't have my cotton sock prescription with me.
Sock and cots.
Box and cocks.
Right in the cot.
Right in the cocks, coccyx.
Right in the fat cot.
Good Lord.
This is what happens.
You put them on the radio, and that's what you get.
Overweight people sleep in fat cots.
Yeah.
Them and their fat.
Yeah.
They're fat cots.
How juvenile.
Big fat.
Trying to fat shame people in this day and age.
Yeah.
Yeah, because by the end of, by the time they wake up, no, they just sweat a lot.
So therefore, it's big, fat, wet cot.
No wonder this is a sausage fest.
Hardly any chicks are hanging around.
Actually there are some, but they're all among themselves.
They don't like being referred to as chicks.
They're looking askance.
Dames.
Well, of course not.
Dames.
Rods.
Dames.
Babes.
Oh, it's dames.
You know, the gals.
The fair sex.
Yeah.
Yeah, my better half.
Actually, she's not.
The smart ones.
My sleeping half.
Let sleeping halves lie.
Yeah.
Let lines your email.
I found it, but it wouldn't come up on it.
It says, welcome, Harry, but then it doesn't proceed far.
And it's a little bit of a, you know, a little bit of a, you know, a little bit of a, you

know, a little bit of a, you know, whatever.




That would be me.

That would be me.
What does it do?
Can you say that?
Oh, you oh, F u c h.
Yeah.
Right.
Reverend Mad magazine's and stop publishing.
Oh, well.
Rory G Fox.
Yeah.
From PR news in Washington on safer than previous models.
Several airline executives hold a house panel today that their companies targeted senior
police officials.
At least six people were killed.
Police officials were badly wounded, including several bad children who were on their way to school.
On Wall Street 38132896235,
the Democratic candidates don't care for stranded passengers in the event of weather or PR.
PR's bad.
French commuters killed at least two people for nearly 11 hours.
President Bush is expected to announce a set of measures today intended to reduce PR news in Washington.
PR comes from cholera.
Hey, have you noticed that a lot of these new folks on subgenius sites are spelling Bob's name completely wrong?
I noticed. It's terrible.
They're talking about some guy named Bob, and I don't know if they're talking about the guy that washes their car, cuts their meat, does something like that.
But I always go, who is this Bob?
And it's really kind of funny because they'll go, you shouldn't be on this page if you don't know who Bob is.
And I'm like, I know who Bob is, and I spell it properly.
And yeah.
Then I was told.
I was told that I was being too much of a Bobby hipster by Bobby hipsters.
By being so strict.
Yeah, by being so strict.
It's like, listen, I take this religion nearly seriously.
Oh, usually they get dogpiled by the older and wiser ones.
Right.
Depends on which Facebook group you're looking at.
Well, I was looking at the official X Day.
The official X Day?
There shouldn't be anybody on there but members.
Right.
They should know.
That's why.
I asked the question.
Like, all kidding aside, how do you spell our Savior's name?
That's a tricky one.
The Saint of Sales name.
And then somebody will type out the Saint of Sales.
Oh, that Savior.
Yeah.
Oh, I love it when they go, who are you to be more slackful than me?
Right.
It's like, well, but for one thing, I'm actually Reverend Ivan Stang.
And you'd know that that was my pen name if you'd ever really bothered to read anything about this religion.
Oh, yeah.
The newest one is somebody going, how come Stang and Philo are never on here?
Oh, yeah.
Right.
People were like, uh.
That was on the Church of the Subgenius one.
So it's kind of funny.
Which one?
Well, there's two Church of the Subgenius, at least two.
I don't remember which one.
I just remember I kind of monitor it and listen to these people go on.
There's an asinine one and there's an official unofficial one that's run by our friends.
Yeah.
G. Gordon Gordon and Pease.
They're banning each other every other hour.
And.
Pickles has a pickup truck now.
Yeah, he does.
He picks up a lot more deliveries that way.
Pickles up truck.
Mm hmm.
Yeah.
I dig that.
You can find out what's up with pickles and a whole bunch of other things just listening to this program.
Oh, no.
Your tomfoolery is about to end.
Well, we've got this is our audience has doubled in size from two and a half to five.
Yes.
These are very favorable trends.
Our ratings.
They're certainly increasing.
And the back office is very pleased.
Guardedly.
They say, just keep doing what you're doing.
Constantly for that.
Well, the word just got out from from our announcement five minutes ago.
The Susie made it here.
So that's important.
You know, a bunch of people weren't OK.
Well, in that case, it's a real X day and all kinds.
Well, it's no phony X day with no Ivan staying there.
There's you know, I.
Call.
Talk about bait and switch.
I don't know.
There was some kind of standing on there, according to the tapes I heard.
I don't remember the original.
I just met Dr. X last night in the dark.
Paul Z did inferior.
And I think that's him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, I've had terrible conversations out here that went on for 15 or 20 minutes with some with the wrong person.
I thought I was talking to somebody.
That happened yesterday.
It happened again today.
Happened horribly two years ago.
I thought this person was peas.
And I just went on and on and on.
He thought I was insane.
And I felt rather embarrassed when I figured it out.
Well, who did it turn out to be?
Reverend Christian, strangely enough.
And that was his real name.
I mean, his human street name.
Conspiracy name as well as that's a double conspiracy name.
Isn't it being called Christian?
There's well, that was his last name.
Oh, okay.
There's another way.
And there's Christian Blatter who sends me a lot of very strange recordings and collages.
And he's an all analog musician.
Well, that's a good thing.
Yeah.
He uses only analog synthesizers.
And he only reads analog.
Analog magazines.
Yeah.
Analog magazines.
Yeah.
Analog magazines.
Yep.
So.
He's in the true cut and paste.
Christian Blatter.
What about.
With a name like that, you don't need a funny name.
Christian Blatter informs us.
Cool Hand Chris is the name he goes by.
Oh, wow.
Anyway, but he'll never make it here.
If he can't make it here.
Like most of them.
He can't make it here.
He can't make it anywhere.
Right.
Yeah.
That's right.
He was just a big five minutes.
It was serious.
So true.
Well, you know, we've talked about holding X days and gatherings at staying ranch, which is.
Yeah.
I brought that up to you one year and you were like, oh, no, never.
Oh, I'm sure.
I just cackled out among the red hot rocks, razor sharp cactus and scuttling scorpions.
Well, the cannibal rednecks.
And there's dinosaurs that walk around your property.
I've seen them.
Radioactive mutants.
Rednecks.
Rattlesnakes.
Engorged with venom.
I've gone to Google Maps.
A hundred and fifteen in the shade.
Ghosts go and watch the dinosaurs walk on staying ranch.
There are dinosaurs everywhere.
And I can prove it when I take my phone down off that tripod.
Profane normals will never understand subgenius esoterica.
Oh, he's going off to his camera now.
Oh, he took the camera itself off.
Well, it was only a half hour attempt to record.
It looks like a harp machine.
Well, it was only a half hour attempt to record.
It's a little bit of a mess.




It's a little bit of a mess.
I'm going to record us in any case.
I know what it is.
I wanted to show you that we're...
Anybody.
In fact, if you have the right to filter, I got this from Miskatonic University.
It's kind of specially made for me.
It'll show you that the ghosts and spirit creatures that are walking around a place
like this.
Very well.
Oh, here it is.
Oh, wait.
Let's see these.
But I'm not interested in the sprites or pixies.
Creatures that you're speaking of.
Yeah, all right.
Anybody can...
Now, you'll get your sprites and pixies anywhere.
Oh, yeah.

Very well.
Let's see what...
Oh, my God.
There's a triceratops walking right across the green room.
Oh, I remember seeing that.
That looks like a stegosaurus to me.
Look, here.
Hold on.
You have to hold it and follow the action.
The sound of a triceratops eating children.
Oh, there's some stegosaurus in the background.
That's the sound of a triceratops walking.
Eating children.
Walking children.
Walking on children.
Yeah, they are eating on Philo's head.
Now, this is very disturbing.
So...
That looks a little more real.
Triceratops and stegosaurus never met, like Queen Lizzie and the other ones.




Oh, that's the sound of Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots.
Philo?
That's too loud.
Shh.
Philo.
He's playing the Philo drumming theme, the pulsating TV theme.
The Philo phone.
It's terrible the way I have to scold him like that, but it's like a romper room that
gets out of hand.
It's like the Alvin show, and he's Alvin and you're Dave Seville.
Oh.
Watch me go take a break.
Once upon a time they sang the vodeo do.
But that was long ago.
Then everybody started in to boop, boop, a do.
They got tired of that, you know.
How do you like those guys?
Everybody puts in extra notes.
I'll overlook it.
But the tune for you and me is that swinging symphony.
Ding.
A-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do, a-ding-a-dee.
Oh, what a tune for crooning.
Ding.
A-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do, a-ding-a-dee.
It's got the whole world spooning.
Eskimo bells up in Iceland.
Are ringing.
They've made their own paradise land.
Singing.
Ding.
A-ding-a-dee.
A-ding-a-do, a-ding-a-dee.
Stiffly me ding, a-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do.
Ding.
A-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do, let me hear that choir.
Oh, what a tune for crooning.
Colossia.
Ding.
A-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do, let me hear that band.
Stupendous.
Now let me hear the trumpets.
That's not a trumpet
That's not a trumpet
That's a trumpet
Oh, what a tune for crooning
That's enough, fellas, I'll take it alone
Adink-a-dee, adink-a-doo
You know, boys, last week I sang for the Sultan of Passion
And the Sultan offered me his harem of 500 beautiful wives
But I turned them down
Because when I get up every morning
Who wants to find a thousand stock and tank it in the bathroom?
Not Durrani
Adink-a-dee, adink-a-doo
Adink-a-dee
Adink-a-dee
That note was given
To me by Bink Crosby
And was he glad to get rid of it
Simply means
Adink-a-dee, adink-a-doo
Now, listen, Dr. Howell
You spent about half an hour yesterday
Bad-mouthing these millennials
That are glued to their telephones
I did?
Well, I'm simply trying to access my e-mail
You see?
But, oops, this page was not found
Oops, we broke out
There's no service here
Yeah, you can't surf here
No, you cannot surf here
There's no surface here
It's a hard metal road
There's no surface
No, and see, you can see with Dr. Howell
The surface tension is getting a little out of hand
Because he cannot read his e-mail
This has to do with girlfriends
Yes, I got a...
Oh, my God
Girlfriends
Directing girlfriend traffic from far away
With no e-mail
It's our...
I agree
I'm speaking of female stand-up, you guys
Two women just entered the room
And at one agent
All right, now
Reverend Susie DeFluzzi is here with the...
She's our favorite buxom redhead
Yes, with Reverend Lucy
Oh, look, Miss Star-Sis-Star's getting his head ensconced in the...
Balcony of the Flues
The kindly...
What are you doing under the table, sir?
Susie DeFluzzi
She's a Flues with a heart of gold
What is that you're touching?
And a head of Swiss cheese
I'm talking over him
But her golden heart is loved by everyone who invests in gold
She just tiptoed away
Gold, you understand?
Gold
She's lured Miss Star-Sis-Star away
Well, I'm not sure if she's a Miss Star-Sis-Star


Well, she probably has a special gift
You know the way she is
She fabricates those gifts in her workshop
My house is entirely furnished with Susie DeFluzzi gifts, decorations, clothing, furniture, everything
That same happens in my house
You mean that...
There's a lot of Susie DeFluzzi things that I run across in my house
Yeah
You know, we're...
The painted rocks that she did a few years ago
I've got those
I have those interspersed with my house

I have those interspersed with my fossil collection
I've got those proudly and prominently displayed
Squat a few
On the archway to my chamber
The first time my grandson saw the word shit written out
All right now, keep it clean
It was in a piece of artwork
Original A&W root beer cup
The framed piece of art by Susie that we put up there
Squat a few
Oh, look, well this will be...
Susie just brought me a water glass
With a fisherman and fish theme that says
Take two pills
Pills spelled with one L
The subgenius way
Pilsner
Well, I know, but it's...
Yeah, but it's more them kind pills
Get this
They do not what they do
Take your pills
There it is
The more them kind official pills
Oh, wow
Official pills
There's real cotton batting in there
Are these...
There's cotton bunting and...
Suppositories?
Well, they have the other...
It's real 100% cotton batting
Oh
From that Texas suppository building
They're sugary, I'll tell you that
Oh, good, my cheeks will stick together
Sugar, the vital building block of life
Mmm
Yeah, those two
Along with vitamin dough and vitamin grease
Oh, I like those cotton pills, Bob
And vitamin V
This is from the original...
Yo, you can take those
Oh, wow
These are for everyone
We got...
We...
These actually came from Sandy Boone Productions
You always have a bag of pills
And there it is
Well, I always have a bag of something, but...
Yeah
You have baggage
It's just one thing in it
Got a whole bunch of pills this time
You have luggage that...
From PR News in Washington, I'm in jeopardy
President Bush is accusing John Negroponte of genocide in Paris
On Wednesday, once again
Negroponte is bad
Negroponte derailed tracks
And the president of Pakistan
It isn't clear, though, that the Greek local power won its return
Congress knows to do
It is clear, though, that PR News is bad
From Washington, this is PR
More than 1,600 people completed a five-page report
The 26-page report summarizes the latest findings on Thanksgiving
A special 500-page report
Which documents France's role in this busy Thanksgiving holiday week
This holiday season is also the busiest time for PR News
PR offers you the gift of PR
Oh, oh, oh, oh
But now we need to focus on the locusts
And get some traction on the action
We need to stop spinning our wheels
The show is starting now
Now it's the hour of slot number 1,730
By the old rock and roll
And then we get our next game
The game is starting
One of Hollywood fans
About 200 miles from the barn, yonder
No, that's not gonna happen
I'm sure 22 x day
That's got to be it
That's got a ring to it, doesn't it
It does have a ring to it
It is, or otherwise it'll technically be the 24th drill
All these subgeniuses armed with 22s
Well, after all the mathematic equations and whatnots
When will 1998 actually be here?
It has already come according to the Dobbs down nano heliograph
Well but in that case these pills are expired
So I prefer to think that it isn't 1998 yet
It has just come so those pills are freshly
So maybe there's hope
Maybe it's tomorrow morning
We've got to get up at 6 in the morning you guys
Tomorrow?
Yes
Oh well I
Yes Hal it's July 4th
These nosebleeds keep me on my back
You know I might not be able to
Well at least I remember that tomorrow the world ends
And some people don't bother to know what day it is
The horrible wrenching sound
The day before
Those guys without earphones can hear you
Maybe you should go up here
Kelly
Kelly

I've been out of the way
Put on some earphones
So you get on the same page with us legitimate broadcasters
Philo's just sitting up there trying to irritate me with this
I'm talking, listening, doing the whole thing man
We're what you call color commentary
You guys are the guys doing the stuff on the sidelines
And we're accentuating the
The peanut gallery
Yeah
We're like Jim Ross and we're like Jerry the King Lawler
You're Eric Severite to our rocket launch
We try to make the dirty jokes
Fly past the censors
Hmm
Alright
Even if there isn't a delay
Delay
Delay
On the censor
That background noise sounds like what my gas station sandwich is doing to me right now
It is
Gas station sandwich
Oh dear
We actually got that from
This thing is an amazing thing
It actually picked that up
It is
And that's how
That's what we're listening to
We're listening to
To the remote Borgerigmus broadcast
Yeah
Borgerigmi Bluetooth
Borgerigmi Bluetooth
Borgerigmi
Yeah
Bob Origmi
Yes
The careful rites and rituals of the Borgerigmi people
That's
There you go
Okay
You're hopelessly lost in the
Cisgender patriarchal paradigm
With your evil egeomarchy
Here is my Bob Woodsism
Today is
In
Deep

Ants

Dependance
He's got ants in his in-deep-endance
I guess
So
The ants in your depends are dancing
In da pants

In the plants
In my depends pants
Hello
Who should I say is calling

Al de Pantsio
Boy that was
Al de Pantsio






Some era when you could make prank calls
I'll cut the Z's on your two cheeks
No are we reverting to red again
We did that yesterday
No we did that this morning
We didn't do that yesterday
It was yesterday
As in Red's sugary cider
Red's pineapple AR
Red's tube bar
Red's
Red's
Yeah
Why don't you come over to my joint
You come over here and say it to me
Yeah
You come over here and say it to me

You come over here and say it to me

Red bastard
See I don't want to start into that
No
It'll never end
It'll trigger
It triggers me
I know the red bastard personally
Red bastard is a friend of mine
And you sir
Red bastard was friend of mine
He's a New York performer
He's very famous in his performance
He used to take me fishing all the time
He used to throw the ball to you
When you were just a kid
They say he shot the president
I don't think he did
I don't think he did
I don't think he did
Um
Cause red bastard was friend of mine
Hey Rudy, why is that guy across the street loading grenade launchers into his SUV?
Oh don't worry Waldo, that's just Trig.
He's probably loading up for his weekend retreat at the militia camp.
What the fuck is that thing?
I think it's either an Uzi or an AR-15.
Hard to say since I'm just a student.
I'm just a stupid fucking libtard.
Yeah, I guess we should just live and let live, right?
That's right Waldo.
In fact, I've even written a little song about our Republican friend.
Gosh, will you sing it for me?
Well, okay.
My Republican neighbor
Has a wife and a house and a company
That lobbies for deregulating privatized prisons to feed his family
Sometimes he wonders just how much money he's going to make
How big his daughter's tits are gonna be
He's my Republican neighbor
Hey, I've got a neighbor too.
Would you like to hear about him?
I sure would.
Okay.
My Republican neighbor
Has a white trash wife and an unemployment check
A Nazi flag that's the color of his neck
He's saving up his ammo for a new job
And for that glorious day
When the white man takes a stand
And the race war purifies the land
We're watching Dixie Land
But until that day he can masturbate
When he's watching Tucker Carlson
Look away, look away, look away
Dixie Land
Look away, look away, look away
Dixie Land
Dixie Land
Dixie Land
Dixie Land
Dixie Land
My Republican neighbors got a flag on the porch and knees that jerk
Dress it up on Sunday for they toddle off to church
Where a guy who fucks hookers tells them who they oughta hate
And there ain't no separation between the church and state
And Jesus hated taxes just to sure that you're born
But he'll always forgive you when you stare at kiddie porn
So long as you can pull your weight
When the good Reverend Hooker Fucker passes round the plate
Cause he's raising cash, oh yes sirree
For the lily white tent called the GOP
They're my Republicans, your Republicans
His and even hers
Everyone's Republican neighbor
And that was the Rudy Schwartz Project from the new CD
Take Me in Your Arms and Sing to Me Like Dick Powell
And now back to 22X Day Drill at Tarzan's radio station
Well that's a good robot noise that one is
A robot?
Yeah what?
Okay here's a doc, ask Dr. Howell
Why do some people call them robots and some people call them robits?
I don't know it always bugged the be jabers out of me
Me too
Somebody who says a robot you know
A robot or a robit?
Yeah that's just a
We, Dr. Howell actually Princess we and I say robot because of you
We learned it from you Dr. Howell
I'm riffing on it because I find it aesthetically unpleasant not to say robot
Robot
Or robot is the way it acts
It actually should be pronounced from robota meaning a worker, a servant, a slave
Row, row, row your bot
So robit is just off
It sounds like you're getting ready to say robit-a-son to me
Oh that reminds me
Down with more quack medicine than nostrums for desperate Ivan Stang
No actually I don't have a robot in other judge for now
No see you're giving the robot a command
Go ahead swill another shot of drugstore generic robit-a-son
Robot-a-son, D-M
You're telling the robot he's on your team
The D-M is a scary book
A-son
Right
Not them-en, a-son
It could be robot, robot listen
Robot this-en, them-en
This-en
Robot them-en
Aren't you glad you had this chair brought up here for me?
You brought this chair up here for me
And then you've got Shemp over here
And the others
Look we have a question from the audience member
I believe Mr. Sistar has something to say
Where do robots go for lunch?
Where?
To the robot-a-son
Oh well okay I would have said the
What do they eat their batteries?
The lube shack but
They get a fill up, a battery fill up
They plug in their USB connector into the handy USB port
They jack on
They jack on
Yeah there was a long Futurama thing about the guilt of robots jacking on
I believe my Ukrainian ancestors would say ra-bot
Well here's yet another way to pronounce it, ra-bot
That's just more commie fake news
Fork, fork like
This dirty joke that Philo is telling
Oh let's walk down the hill
Why don't you just phone Reverend Angra-Leary and tell him not over the phone Philo
Say what?
So it's just a mumble
A phonus
What?
He's telling you
It's an inside joke and I'm like well there's a microphone right there
It's not like you have to worry about FCC you know
Okay here's how it goes see I'm covering up the mic
You know that's the first good sound I've had from that mic off you
So I need to have a hand dampener
You should keep your hand on your mouth whenever you're on the radio
Okay no
No no
How about now just turn it the other way
Alright
He was telling the story of a hickory bull in the swelter of summer come in his great good time to the sultry biting herd
Oh I've heard that one
That's the one
That's the one that's what he was telling
I've heard that one
We've all heard it
Oh that's right we're gonna be at Drummond Farm next year right?
The tater farm, are you a tater farmer now?
I'm a tater farmer do you wanna come by and get some taters or I'll bring them down to you?
He's digging the taters out of the craters out there
I'll bring them down to you
Let's have Beck stay at your place
I'm a lot
Am I bleeding?
Huh?
Am I bleeding?
Where? From where? Your eyes?
Well you know you looked at me like I thought I had a hatchet in the back of my head
I was looking for potatoes in your ears
Firelar your face is on fire
I felt this unknown pain
Oh you got a bunch of ants in your hair so
It was not directed at any specific spot
It was just general pain
He's being complimentary
Boy Philo your face is on fire today
No I wasn't he's
Thank you
Jesus
My own suite of facial injuries has completely healed
Even the hole up here in the top of the head seems to be filled in
He's not exaggerating when we picked Hal up at the airport there were holes in his face
I had a bit of a mishap
Besides the normal ones?
Yeah
I did it
Extra ones
Someone's trying to hit a golf club off his face
Now he had, Hal had dived a hundred feet into it, three feet of water
One and a half feet of water
A bunch of rocks yeah
There were no rocks fortunately
Oh
Just the bottom that
Some sort of a side show thing
Slammed my poor face
Part of the flying Walendas
Yeah that was a performance gig yeah
Oh okay
I made a little money off that one
It was a bottomless abyss that turned out to be only one foot deep
A foot and a half deep
Yeah he says he got paid
What it was was some kid said I'll give you a dollar if you jump off this cliff here into that swimming hole down there
He was like show me the dollar first
Well the kid gave him the dollar and then he jumped a hundred feet into a one and a half foot deep pool
A kiddie pool
Scraping, scrunching along the bottom
He's now a dollar richer
Yeah
And a day later
Yeah
That's a sub genius for you
I needed it
Make a risk game
I needed it
They'll do anything for money
Every bit of
They'll take any risk
Currency in order to lift off and come here especially with
Encounter any displeasure
Roommates saving all the bills to present to me at the last moment
I had to get everything together and I did but it wasn't easy
For a dollar
For a single
That dollar tipped the balance
Hey would you do it again if I gave you two dollars
I have several two-way bills

I had to spend mine
They're not the ones that are colorfully decorated with images of TVs beloved monkeys and so forth that you can buy online
My dad
No I wish I knew about those
My brother stole my two dollar bills and used them to buy heroin
Oh your brother
You know what I don't have my wallet on me
Ah likely story
You don't need your wallet here a thousand miles from the atmosphere
He didn't do heroin but he sold it to I mean he used it to buy heroin


My brother stole my two dollar bills so he could buy banana peels
Are you talking about Phoenix
To smoke banana peels
Project Phoenix
We rarely discuss it
Project Sphinx
Woodrow's seeds
Hawaiian woodrow seeds
Besides phyllo
Hey I just noticed that
What did you notice
That he has a PH in his name too
Ah but it's his last name is his PHD
PHD
Philodrumon
Right
No Sphinx
Yeah
Sphinx has a PH
Right no I know that but there's no PH
High PH
Very high PH
Sounds like the beginning of the monsters there
This is my arse
Are you referring me
Ah no NO
A door right here

Ahew
Come on
I've never heard of it
죄다
I'm notús
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, skeletons.
Psycho, that is.
The psychoskeletons.
The psychoskeletons.
That sounds like Mr. Sister's stomach again.
That's the borgerigmus detector.
Oh, don't remind me.
This sounds like he's talking.
It's rattling from tube to tube, from system to system.
Remember, man is a food tube.
The food goes in here and it comes out there.
A little too loud, Fyler.
Buddy, settle down.
I'm going to have to put you out.
He's like dad outside the door when you're trying to listen to some Peter Frampton.
You don't want me to come in there.
Shut off that squirrel music.
You kids keep it down.
This is my last warning.
Confine your shenanigans to the rumpus room and keep it down to a dull roar.
Fuck it.
Listen, we're going to be put out.
It's raining.
I know you don't like it outside when it's raining.
Well, that was a nice show we had once there.
I have no control over the dog.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
We're receiving wild sound effects.
He'll bite some valuable piece of furniture or videotape and look at me.
Are you noticing me yet?
Are you noticing me yet?
I'm noticing I'm about to place my dog.
Doggy lips and palate on these valuable pieces.
There's a dog over here looking at him.
And as soon as he turns to look at the dog, the dog turns his head and looks away.
But as soon as he goes back to the sandwich, the dog looks again.
Yep.
It's hilarious.
The hope that springs eternal in the canine breast.
It's hilarious.
Hilarious.
You see what I have to deal with?
Well, why don't you deal a new hand?
Here, we can just go on with our broadcast.
Ouch.
Don't worry.
It's just as loud out here as what it is on your headphones.
It's electronical music.
It's actually much louder out there.
The latest thing from the avant-garde.
I'm not out there.
I got a prescription last week for my scaly toes.
An extension, you say?
Really?
I've got scaly toes.
What did you use?
You have scaly ptosis?

Honchitalisine or something like that.
Can you email it to me?
I can email you.
It costs $74 a tube at Walgreens.
Well, that's fine.
It'll be good.
Yeah, it's good.
You don't have to skitch your scaly toes as much.
You have to scrape the Glaxo out from between those toes.
It definitely reduces the jam.
New wild mountain blackberry.
I saw there was some Amish people selling toe jam.
By the...
By the...
I don't know.
By the pint.
More homage to the Amish.
Do you know where I can get some butt paste?
Yes, I've got some calmacine butt paste at my camper.
He's got it right up there in his trailer.
That's actually his toe jam, isn't it?
I don't know.
He's trying to trick me.
It's definitely real butt paste.
He sells toe jam as butt paste.
Can't be on the Matrix.
I have a great story that a lot of people don't know.
I used to run an adult bookstore.
Okay.
And we used to sell things, you know.
I had an old man that used to come in all the time.
Marital aids?
Yes.
Yep.
Had an old man that used to come in and buy stay hard cream.
Okay?
All the time.
Well, we were out of it.
Stay hard cream, anal ease.
They were all the same exact thing.
Okay, so the guy was out of his stay hard cream.
And we sold him the anal ease and said,
it's the same exact thing.
Use it the same exact way.
The guy came back the next day.
Very angry.
And said that he wiped this all over his asshole.
And it did not make his dick hard.
And we told you, put it, use it like you would the other way.
But see, he read the instructions.
And today that old man sits on the Supreme Court of the United States.
Yes, he does.
And he looks a little bit like a turd.
A little bit pissed off still.
Yeah.
Because he hadn't been whacking it.
Nope.
But that's just to go, you know.
Yeah.
Certain things are certain things.
You've got to be whacking it.
Yep.
You know, just blow out some impurities.
Is any of this suitable for air play?
Wanking.
This all shocking vulgar waste.
You didn't like the noises I was making on my machine.
So I figured I would try a different tap.
She made the noises in his mouth.
Well, you can't let the poisons of the flu nads build up.
It distorts your thinking.
Now what?
Well, you got to.
You should give your tips.
He's just been a really expensive piece of furniture and he's just looking at you now.
Just waiting to see if you saw him or heard him.
He's got the whole X-Day folder in his mouth.
I'm not biting it.
I'm just putting my mouth around the leg.
I could.
I could chew it.
Just laying there with my mouth around like this.
You could close his iron jaws on you.
I could chew it if you don't take me out and play.
Yeah.
If you don't feed me, I could eat your chair leg.
What a playful pup.
Yeah.
I'll get a bunch of delays on her.
You left me ours.
I am so drunk.
The Kid Show.
The Stan Kid Show.
Welcome to Dobbs Town Kid Show.
Going to show some cartoons?
Kids have got to have something to do.
Yeah.
In this one, we put an iPad in front of our littlest one over here.
And just let him go to town while we shop at Walmart and look at the marital aids.
Isn't that cute?
What a well-behaved group of youngsters we have in the peanut gallery today.
It's a lot like the times that I've invited my grandsons to be on Hour of Slap.
And what happened?
I have to edit it down to five minutes out of ten minutes of screaming and nonsense.
Saying fuck and things like that?
Or it's even, no, they're doing the exact same thing Philo does.
Because they can't, their attention span is just like, woo.
Irritate grandpa.
They're sampling.
You're irritating grandpa, now be quiet.
You mean I'm bad grandpa?
No, you're irritating grandpa.
You're irritating grandpa.
Another form of...
Oh yes, you are irritating.
That's like a superhero name, irritating grandpa.
A form of irritation.
He wears his suspenders and belt.
And belt.
Yep.
That's a super villain name, irritating grandpa.
Yeah, irritating grandpa.
Of course, the super villains all think they're the superheroes.
Well, they're super something.
And vice versa.
You know, the Joker thinks he's the one who's on the side of right.
And Batman's a hypocrite.
Which, they're both right in a way.
Sure.
Well, they're both operating outside the law.
Vigilantes.
No one elected the Joker.
No one elected Batman either.
That's right.
Batman has no super powers.
He's just a man.
Oh yes, he does.
Wealth.
He's just a man.
No, he's rich.
He says he's just a man.
He pointed that out to The Flash in that last movie.
Oh, did he?
Yeah, The Flash goes, so what's your super power, sir?
I'm rich.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's the only good line in the whole movie.
I drive a really bad ass car.
Yeah.
You've just heard everything in the movie we're seeing.
Actually, it wasn't too bad.
And what was the name of that movie?
Batman versus Aquaman versus Superman versus Wonder Woman versus Lex Luthor.
Was that the Justice League of America?
I don't know.
They're all on the same team.
Just Us League of America?
Oh, now I get it.
It's like a religious thing.
All the religions all believe in the same thing, but they all want to kick the snot
out of one another.
Yeah.
I wasn't kidding.
That's the same thing with all the superheroes.
I find it hard to keep these movies, sir.
The only thing they all believe that's in common is that they have the right belief.
Yeah.
Which movie was that?
And all the other guys are wrong.
The Ten Commandments.
Justice League.
Oh, Justice League of America.
Yeah.
Yeah, I saw the Ten Commandments again.





I saw the Ten Commandments again too recently.
Basically, in the end, as usual, like in real life, Wonder Woman has to come in and kick
everybody's ass and get them to, you know, go to bed.
And clean the furniture.
And clean the furniture.
Yeah, right.
And clean up your room and go to bed.
Stupid superheroes.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
A bunch of smelly, tight-wearing creeps.
Oh, it's just the women's conspiracy is making all the women superheroes into the, you know,
top dogs.
Yeah.
Captain Marvel, I don't understand.
Somehow, this female character, what happened to the Big Red Cheese?
They had to change his name because the Marvel trademarked the Captain Marvel thing before
the Shazam guys did.
The Big Cheese?
Is that like Flaming Carrot?
Yeah.
They used to call Captain Marvel, or the villains in Captain Marvel, used to call
him the Big Red Cheese as they mocked him.
Remember, Captain Marvel was a super being, but he was secretly, actually, crippled,
rich, Warszaw be-b guilt, apparently.
He was a poor MALE.
He was a poor little minnow.

The captain of the big awesome crew.
It's right.



I can't believe races where you can change someone's actionว
because you can't change the expression that seems unscientific, but just the focusing
levels of bracome.
Trying to get those mountains, like in Cycl Scot.
Yeah, like in IPYO today.

Just like in the班уш시죠 Jun death movie, which is considered to be Königreich


All these are like either Y两kalena here, or night?
As long as you can remember.
Junk and the Mori people.
Right?
But now it's like Mary Marvel turning into Captain Marvel.
We'll gently fade out on that nerd comic book yak fest
with a big thanks to Dr. Howell, Philo Drummond, and Reverend Angry Larry.
We'll surely continue this next week or year.
In the meantime, you can know everything worth not knowing
at subgenius.com,
the cobweb-wrapped archive of the Church of the Subgenius.
Yeah, it's old, but the front pages will point you to current subgenius activity
which is best followed on social media,
which I can't and don't have to edit or archive
because there's just too damn much.
Praise Bob.
That's subgenius.com.
Yeah.
