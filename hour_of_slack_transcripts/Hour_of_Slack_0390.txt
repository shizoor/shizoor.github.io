You say the taxman just took away your barrel and your bleep is freezing in a high wind.
Your car just made a sound like a dying moose and came to a halt on the off-ramp
after spitting out a bucket of gear teeth.
Just finished knocking back your third bottle of NyQuil during the Ren and Stimpy Festival
and you feel like taking a whiz on the electric fence.
The aliens removed your brain for their pathology studies and you don't even care?
Well, my friend, you're ready for a big healthy dose of the subgenius hour of slack.
No one knows how to put the m-huh back in Christmas like J.R. Bob Dobbs and his twisted henchman,
the Reverend Ivan Stang.
Your good friends and prayer partners in your bid to secure your place in hell
and stop worrying about all this unapproachable crapola.
So, refuse to take your medication for a week and tie yourself to the kitchen chair
for the next neuron-popping episode of the subgenius hour of slack
on that bastion of bogus southern hospitality, K-N-O-N.
K-N-O-N.
93FM in almighty Dallas, Texas, where the horses have silver wings,
the whales all speak French, and the politicians are honest.
Yeah, right, and Ross Perot's gonna pay off my student loan, too.
I mean, praise Bob!
Have the technology, have the tapes.
Bob told me to make this, not gonna resist.
And if during the proceedings a small chlorine-oxypropylene bag should drop down,
open the receiving flap and inhale deeply.
Don't ask questions.
Prepare to have your mind scanned for possible boson-sore traces.
Scanning now.
Only people here are people.
There is the advanced tech mode.
Whoa.
Technodroids can't hold up much of a conversation now.
The first of the subgenius.
For amusement, they toss children into pits with hungry dogs.
Are we not, men?
We are the subgenius!
Ah!
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
None of sense of humor.

He is the top one.
We are incidentally guested this morning by a distinguished member of the clergy,
the Right Reverend Archbishop.
I am happy to say that I have received a vision from J.R. Bob Dobbs
that you have been promoted to Archbishop.
Oh, God, that's news to me.
That's pretty exciting.
I was just a sacred.
I couldn't even describe until half an hour ago.
Well, I guess being on this national broadcast has had a very good reaction.
We had a story yesterday that I'd like to get to the bottom of, frankly,
about cow mutilations.
Now, these cows were suffering from having their udders removed.
Their peni were sliced off, surgically, I might add.
With incredible surgical precision.
Yes, it was.
And the other thing that was reamed out was,
I have no idea why anyone, and I quote from the Bible
to give some testimony to the fact that this is going.
The fire of God is fallen from heaven
and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them.
Am I only the escaped one alone to tell thee of?
And, of course, is Job chapter 1, verse 16.
Job.
Nowadays, when you've got a stale economy, you call them Job.
Job.
Cattle mutilations.
Can I give you some facts and see if you can verify these for me?
Oh, please do.
I am advised by a study done by my research director, Rob Robbie.
A tiny percentage are done by miscellaneous small cults
like Satanists and the Davidians, bikers, etc.
About 10% are done by one major Odinist right-wing Christian cult
composed mostly of Texas oil millionaires
who are essentially seeking, I guess, a ritualistic way of curing their impotence.
Now you know what Ross Perot does in his spare time.
Cow mutilations.
Yeah, well, he's got the silent choppers and, you know, all the equipment.
Well, I guess you really need...
And the motivation.
I am advised, sir, and I am glad I have you face-to-face
because I'm not going to be able to do that.
I don't like to back down from these types of confrontations.
But I am advised that a great deal of subgeniuses, part of your church,
all right, fresh from Dobstown on their first initiation test,
are involved in these mutilations.
And that it's not done as a test of their mettle.
It's a scientific fact that the only proper way, well,
to divine the future is by reading fresh animal bowels.
Well, I'm sorry.
This is a serious matter.
Hey, it's right there in Book of the Subgenius.
It says so right there in Black and White.
It does say that, then.
Then you have admitted to that.
Well, sure.
I mean, you haven't lived until you've gone out on a nice little cattle mutilation initiation hunt.
Probably the largest and most ruthless gang of saboteurs in this country.
I know.
For six months, they thought I was one of them.
...assurance for all the lawyers, dockeys, ex-wives, and all the other gold diggers out there.
What is it, man?
Oh, and let them die with dignity.
Why, you dirty...
But, boss, but, but, but, but...
Isn't it wonderful what you can do with some wire and a few electric bulbs?
A little child looks up at me, sometimes with their eyes open.
You know, right about 500 grams is when their eyes,
they begin to open.
My half-staff turns to me and says,
Dr. Foreroth, what do we do?
I didn't come in here with three points and a poem today.
I could care less whether you think I can preach a lick or not.
You understand that?
All I care about is saying, thus saith the Spirit of God.
All I care about is getting in the mountain and standing behind that desk with lips anointed
from coals off the fire, ready to declare the Word of the Living God.
Thank you.
And I'm ready.
They were red as crimson, now they're white as wool.
You don't have to encourage somebody that knew they were a dirty rotten hunk of stinkin'
sinful flesh.
And yet, no matter how you slice it up, no matter how you dice it out, it's still another
eucystic, if it feels good to do it, anything goes.
Drug-induced hallucinogenic experience.
Well, uh, we're speaking to the Lord.
We're speaking now, of course, as you know, with Fr.
Joe Mama, who is at the end of the Democratic Convention parties.
We're looking down on the floor.
You can see at the Subgenius Convention just what happened.
We heard the news about Jesus and the handgun.
We'll be going to descriptions of that soon.
We just wondered if you- what you saw from where you were.
Well, I felt that the proceedings were very interesting from an academic standpoint, of
course.
Oh.
I can say that.
I can say that without any hesitation, that is, without any hesitation, that the chaos
that ensued was typical of that involving any sort of political assassination.
I personally think Jesus is a patsy.
Yeah.
He, uh, he's- I don't- this magic bullet theory is a magic bullet theory.




Yeah, me too.
The magic splinter theory also.
There are all these theories.
They're just theories.
Well, I mean, you know, I mean, they'd only try to- only Jesus would be accused of being
able to kill a man with one bullet with three different entry rules.
I mean, you know, would they think this guy is some sort of God?
I mean, let's get real.
I believe we got a whole lot of folks sitting in church think they're saved that aren't.
That's the reason we gotta hire 14 more preachers to counsel them.











We gotta counsel them all day long.
Shout now!
Shout now!
Oh!
Brother Rod, don't put that condemnation on me.
Let's play God.
My dear young man, you know as well as I do that God is dying all over the world.
Man invented him but doesn't need him anymore.
Man is God now.
Man is God now.
As a matter of fact, he always was.
Overpopulation, pollution, famine, nuclear holocaust, war.
This civilization is driving us into the sea of extinction.
The keynote is control.
Bless the province of politicians, not scientists.
Yes, but we're the only ones who are trying to combat the problem now.
In 20 years' time, we will be the only ones who will be able to do it.
We will be in positions of power, and then we'll be ready to act for the good of humanity.
Ah, just like the Church of the Subgenius, dear friends.
We've been, uh, enjoying media barrages here on the Hour of Slack from many of our friends,
starting with the P. Leece by Brain Rot Theater.
I'm not sure if you've heard of Brain Rot.
It's a show that's been going on for a long time.

Uh, Hell Pope Huey's new contributions and promos,
Reverend Joe Riley's evil bulldada barrage,
and the barrages of Dr. Legume,
and, uh, KHSU Subgenius Show,
and good Reverend Morton Downey,
and a wonderful collection of Reverend Parsley
from our dear friends, the P. Leece.
And Reverend Uncle Jimmy.
As well as some KPFA Berkeley puzzling evidence,
and Papa Joe Mama,
and more of these things coming up, uh, friends.
Uh, by the way, as, uh, Vincent Price was just saying there,
we got an amazing document in the mail.
Uh, a top, uh, a copy of what supposedly is top secret material,
a document called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars,
a blueprint for your eventual enslavement.
And, uh, I, I don't want to say who sent this to us.
Of course, this could, I suppose, possibly, uh, be a hoax.
Uh, whoa.
Oh, I can't put, I can't use that tape, friends.
That tape deck.
I'm gonna use this one up here.
Did you hear that?
That noise that came in?
There's no telling what they were trying to do to us there with that one.
But, you know, as the preface to this thing says here,
conspiracy theories are not new in history.
For example, plots to kill Caesar and overthrow Rome abounded.
But there are many who go out of their way to ridicule and silence
those who today speak of conspiracies.
Why do you think they don't want people to think about conspiracies?
As seldom does hard evidence emerge that by its very content indicates
it serves as a blueprint for a conspiracy.
Yet the very nature and information in the top secret Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars
introductory programming manual reads like a government technical manual
from some secret group of think tank planners
who have put many years of research and development into creating a new science of social engineering
so they can better manipulate the masses.
This document was uncovered quite by accident on July 7th, 1986,
when an employee of Boeing Aircraft Company purchased a surplus IBM copier for scrap parts at a sale
and discovered inside details of a plan hatched in the embryonic days of the Cold War,
which called for control of the masses through manipulation of industry,
people's pastimes, education and political leanings.
It called for a quiet revolution, pitting brother against brother
and diverting the public's attention from what was really going on.
And friends, here are some of the excerpts from this amazing document.
Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on Earth.
Natural science is the study of the sources of control of natural energy
and social science, theoretically expressed as economics,
is the study of the sources and control of social energy.
All science is merely a means to an end.


The means is knowledge.
The end is control.
Beyond this remains only one issue.
Who will be the beneficiary?
In 1954, this was the issue of primary concern.
Although the so-called moral issues were raised,
in view of the law of natural selection,
it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence
are no better than him.
Animals who do not have intelligence.
Such people are beasts of burden and stakes on the table by choice and consent.
Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace and tranquility,
it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public
with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy,
or wealth, of the undisciplined and irresponsible many
into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible and worthy few.
In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure and apply new weapons,
which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated
in their principle of operation and public appearance
as to earn for themselves the name Silent Weapons.
In conclusion, the objective of economic research as conducted by the magnates of capital, banking,
and the industries of goods and services,
is the establishment of an economy which is totally predictable and manipulatable.
In order to achieve a totally predictable economy,
the lower class elements of society must be brought under total control,
i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke,
and long-term social duties from a very early age,
before they have an opportunity to question the propriety of the matter.
In order to achieve such conformity,
the lower class family unit must be disintegrated
by a process of increasing preoccupation of the parents
and the establishment of government-operated daycare centers
for the occupationally orphaned children.
The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort,
so that the mote of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class
is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class.
With such an initial handicap,
even bright lower class individuals will have little, if any, hope
of extricating themselves from their assigned lot in life.
This form of slavery is essential to maintaining some measure of social order,
peace, and tranquility for the ruling class.

What hadn't been done
in vertex- behaves basically everyone,
instead of a military general.
The public cannot comprehend this weapon,
and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon.
The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong,
but because of the technical nature of the silent weapon,
cannot express their feeling in a rational way or handle the problem with intelligence.
Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help.
The silent weapon
Ah yes, and then it goes on to describe the silent weapon, dear friends.
Mr. Rothschild's energy discovery,
apparent capital as a paper inductor, and so forth.
And they use a sort of shock testing by which the prices of commodities are shocked
and the public consumer reaction is monitored.
The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted
theoretically by computers,
and the psycho-economic structure of the economy is thus discovered.
It is by this process that partial differential and difference matrices
that define the family household make possible its evaluation as an economic industry,
or, in other words, the household as dissipative consumer structure.
Then the response of the household to fear,
and the future shocks,
can be predicted and manipulated,
and society becomes a real regulated animal,
with its reigns under the control of a sophisticated computer-regulated social energy bookkeeping system.
Eventually, every individual element of the structure comes under computer control
through a knowledge of personal preferences,
such knowledge guaranteed by computer association of consumer preferences.
Through the Universal Product Code, or UPC,
the Zebras cite pricing codes on packages with identified consumers,
identified via association with the use of a credit card,
and later a permanent tattooed body number invisible under normal ambient illumination.
The document, dear friends, then goes on to, uh, per-
describe the formula for the economic model of the silent weaponry,
with various, uh, diagrams of the three industrial classes,
and looks sort of almost electronic,
the way it's laid out with the E-model of economic inductance,
time-flow relationships, and self-destructive oscillations.
And then it comes to this little situation,



here, dear friends, by which we find that
the social welfare program is nothing more than an open-ended credit-
credit balance system,
which creates a false capital industry to give non-productive people
a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs.
This can be useful, however,
because the recipients become state property
in return for the gift of social welfare.
They become a standing army for the elite,
for he who pays the piper picks the tune.
Those who get hooked on the economic drug must go to the elite for a fix.
In this, the method of introducing large amounts of stabilizing capacitance
is by borrowing on the future credit of the world.
This is the fourth law of motion,
and consists of performing an action
and leaving the system before the reaction returns to the point of action.
A delayed reaction.
And by this means,
politicians become popular in their own time,
and the public pays for it later.
In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time.
The same thing is achieved by a government printing money
beyond the limit of growth,
and by the growth of the gross national product,
an economic process called inflation.
This puts a large quantity of money in the hands of the public
and maintains a balance against their greed,
creates a false self-confidence in them,
and for a while, stays the wolf from the door.
But they must eventually resort to war to balance the account,
because war ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor.
And the politicians are the publicly hired hitmen
that justify the act to keep the responsibility and blood off the public conscience.
If the people really cared about their fellow man,
they would control their appetites, their greed, their procreation, etc.,
so that they would not have to operate on a credit or welfare social system,
which steals from the worker to satisfy him.
Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint,
there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the system.
One, let the population bludgeon each other to death in war,
which only results in the total destruction of the living earth.
Or two, take control of the world
by the use of economic silent weapons in a form of quiet warfare,
and reduce the economic inductance of the world to a safe level
by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.
The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option.
At this point, it should be crystal clear to the reader
why absolute secrecy about the silent weapons is necessary.
The general public refuses to embrace the idea of the silent weapons,
and the government's own mentality and faith in its fellow man.
It has become a herd of proliferating barbarians,
and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of the earth.
They do not care enough about economic science
to learn why they have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality,
and their religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems
to solve the problem unreachable by them.
It is left to those few who are truly willing to think and survive
as the fittest to survive,
to solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care.
Otherwise, exposure of the silent weapon would destroy our only hope
of preserving the seed of future true humanity.
And see, dear friends, I have gone and just exposed the secret of the silent weapon over the radio,
destroying their hope of preserving the seed of future true humanity.
But since when, my friend, did we need to preserve full-blooded humanity?
Why, the full-blood human has not a drop of humanity.
Yeti blood in it.
And I don't see any point in us mollycoddling those people.
And as far as I'm concerned, you should respond to this,
the secrets revealed in this document,
obviously written by the higher-ups in the conspiracy itself,
by contributing to your voice of the church of the subgenius in your area, dear friend.
Ah, yes.
Because we love you and want to save you from that evil, evil conspiracy.
Ah, yes.
To my home, on always glory forever I'll share.

Yes, I was flying high and leaving a trail of delightful turmoil in my fetid wake.
But just as I thought it couldn't get any better, just when I thought I was about to be elected God,
so as I could fix this mess good and proper once and for all,
Niggies sucked me dry.
Niggies sucked me dry.
Niggies sucked me dry.
I was set to run through the fields of middle-class complacency.
I was set to teach the fair maidens of the cheerleading society what it meant to be left widespread,
grass-stained, and sweaty in the wake of my gladular excesses.
All thoughts of Tupperware, pink bows, and evening news over a nice dinner
skewered on the pike of my flaming societal rage.
Oh, yes!
I was fully prepared to set fire to everything in sight, burning new pathways in the brains of the pink and mewling scum
who haunt the malls.
Making even my occasional excursions thereof in pursuit of some minor plastic crap,
a sleigh ride through hell unbounded.
I was fully loaded and snorting with hellish anticipation of the unforgettable rampage
which would splash the front pages of magazines and newspapers worldwide.
But suddenly,
Niggies sucked me dry.
The lab was fully stocked.
The quivering subjects strapped to the ground.
The batteries charged and the electrodes in place.
The drill bits were sharpened.
The clamps well-oiled.
The beakers filled with the vile fluids of my intent.
The hookahs were primed.
The incense burning.
The sacrificial chickens, goats, former employers, and imaginary enemies drugged and ready.
The generators were churning.
The light bill paid.
The guns loaded with the best explosive shells money could buy.

yeah
cant, marshmallow smell of a female fly in heat. Ah, lucky fellow, he's found one. Yes, her mysterious
dance seems to lift up his day and light up his night, but it's all right. As she comes to accept
him, it's no secret that the fly's orgasmic pleasure is matched only by his built-in proportionate
inability to remain in a fixed location for any length of time, for no sooner has the mating
couple filled each other's goby nodules with albumin and spoo than the fly, ever touring,
ever seeking nectar, flies off to another destination, smiling all the while as the
facets in his mirror-like covering reflect grace, land, and mansions of endless stars,
thus filling in the blank spaces of nature's lost address book. Is it all in the name of love,
or is this conscious pest but a note in the marvelous symphony of nature's universe?
Perhaps we'll never know, but the next time you see a common fly, remember, there's more to this
pesky fellow's life than rancid oatmeal and his attraction to that light bulb over your bed.
Yes.

Dr. Legume's media barrage,
Dr. Riley's media barrage,
Bleepo Abernathy talking about flies in rut.
And that was the Fire Sign Theater.
Very rare recordings doing the Filipino ads there.
And coming up,
we'll hear some ranting by Reverend Mike Cole in Cleveland.
A little bit of that.
And then we'll hear some,
an amazing little piece about snake handlers that was sent in on a tape called
America Freedom Acts by a devil guy.
I got a bag in the mail that had a,
it had inside a black hood,
an envelope of ashes,
a piece of paper with devil writing and blood on it,
and a vial of some milky fluid.
Ugh, dear friends.
And that tape.
And, um, more KPFA coming up.
And, well, we'll just see.
We'll try to get down to the Rudy Schwartz project.
Uh, uh, yes.
Are we not men?
We are the subgenius!
Ah!
Oh, and Crop Circles.
That was another one.
You're doing Crop Circles now.
Yeah.
It's, it, it, those two little old gentlemen.
Yeah.

Those gentlemen in England took credit for those 13,000 crop circles.
But obviously it had to have been a lot of subgenius help.
Well, I knew they had to have some help of some kind.
But I always thought that this was perhaps from a UFO.
A lot of them are from UFOs.
But they're, they're little minor, uh, joyriding UFOs.
Not the important UFOs that Bob Dobbs is in touch with.
Bob Dobbs is in touch.
Uh, one of Bob's main messages is that the world is going to end on July 5th,
1921.
And that's the date of the first of July, 1998, at 7 o'clock in the morning.
Why, why, why that particular time and that particular day?
Uh, just, I guess it's a random choice on the part of the aliens.
The men from Planet X, or the sex goddesses from Planet X, have found themselves better.
Oh, my God.
I, I...
You're listening to the Church of the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack with your host,








the Reverend Ivan Stang.
He'd never steer you wrong.
Tell me where to turn.
Here.
Well, I was, I was thinking just the other day that we don't have that many of them subgenius holidays.
Oh, well, yeah.
Oh, well, yeah.
Every, every day is Bob's birthday.
But, uh, that gets me a little bit tiresome after a while.
But I was thinking about July 5th.
Oh, it's, it's kind of a ways away.
You know, it's not that far away.
July 5th.
I remember, I remember...
Reverend, uh, Reverend Stang.
He was, uh, talking, he was talking about that, uh, what goes on.
And he was telling the importance of X-Day 1998.
And he, he, he was a-saying, he was saying...
Oh, wow.
What was he saying?

Oh, Bob, Bob, what was he saying?
He was saying...
He was saying...
But I've stayed up all night
Frobing and frobing and dooning and, and gleaning.
And, uh, doing X-Day chants about how the time is nigh for their arisal.
And, uh, songs, you know, X-Day holiday songs, like Take Me Off to Space,
which we'll be playing soon.
And, uh, on X-Day morning,
Of course, well, the grown-ups have been up all night, but the kids get up real early because on X-Day, the children are allowed to eat breakfast.
When we pulled up in the yard, I told the children here, I said, we're going to have ourselves a time tonight.
I just knew that old church was going to be full of spirit, and it was, honey. It was.
We went in there, after we sung about three songs, they were shouting all over that church.
I've never seen so many people in one church shout.
And in a little while, they shouted themselves right around in back of us.
Three ladies and two men.
Well, now, when we were hooking up, we saw some curtains or something laying over some boxes back there.
We didn't pay any attention to it, didn't know what was in there, and didn't care.
But in a little while, they came out around us with five of the biggest rattlesnakes I have ever seen.
And I never laid my eyes on them.
I like to dive.
When the service was over, they told us that the biggest rattlesnake they had in that service was five feet long.
Honey, the one they brought by me was 27 feet long.
Let me say this.
I'm not knocking these people.
I promise you.
I'm not knocking them.
I don't know if they're right or wrong, you know.
I'll tell you.
They claim that they read in the Bible where Moses had enough faith to take up the serpent.
And some members of their congregation claim to have that much faith.
And I'll tell you one thing I found out before I left there.
They had a whole lot more faith than what I had.
Now, this one woman stopped about two feet from where I was trying to pick.
And she said,
I didn't even know what kiosk is.
She took that rattlesnake with a head as big as your fist and held it up and stuck it right down in her face and shouted in its ear.
If a rattlesnake's got an ear.
She wrapped that thing around her neck.
She threw it down on the floor, kicked off her shoe, and put her bare feet on it.
Foot on top of its head.
When she threw that thing down on the floor.
It's tail missed my foot about that far.
I done a little shouting myself.
And she thought I was in the spirit.
And brought me one up.
What in the world are we going to do?
And I said, just take it easy.
Don't panic.
I said, just look around and find out where the back door is.
She said, I already looked and there ain't none.
I said, reckon, where do they want one?
And this lady walked up to me.
She said, Brother Wendy, you mean to tell me if the Lord commanded you to take up the serpent, you wouldn't take him up?
No.
I said, yes, ma'am, I surely would.
But he didn't and I ain't.
Then the devil pulls off a mask.
It's me, Bob.
I'm a flower.
I'm a flower.
I don't know.
We better get back, because it will be dark soon.
And they mostly come at night. Mostly.
I need your money as a dwelling place while I am here on your earth.
Where do you put it? You got a hollow leg?
It exists in almost every city and hamlet in the country.
And you must stand united on this, and stamp out this frightful assassin of our youth.
Because it is only through enlightenment that this scourge can be wiped out.
Hooray!
Hooray!

Ah!
Ah!
You're going to be ready for the finals in 1998, my friend.
Let me be slack.
Hooray!
Ah!
Let me give you this shit. You don't do anything to stimulate me.
Why don't you buy me a vibrator?
Why don't I put it in your mouth and you hum?
A person walking down a sandy beach barefoot, whose foot has been numbed by Novocaine,
steps on the jagged edge of a broken bottle, slits their foot and bleeds to death.
Because they never knew there was a problem.
My loss was his gain.
This was a manipulation.
A tilting of the luck plane in his favor.
And what goes up must come down.
And when you're talking about the luck plane, you're talking about both sides at once.
One goes up, the other goes down.
I happen to be on the wrong end of the luck plane.
But Mr. Rob Dobson, you see, was on the right side of the luck plane.
And I bet he had a damn good seat for tonight's game.
Yeah.
Yeah.






Wonderful paradise.
He's got a paradise?
Sort of.
He's on the coast up north here with all of his, well, what can you say, aliens or friends?
Oh, it's a family reunion.
What about me?
That's the code word we use, too.
Yes.
It's a mighty big family tree we subgenius grow from.
That's right.
You never can tell what sort of branches.
You can branch off here.
Well, we're going to the convention floor right now for that report about Jesus and the handgun.
Let's see what they have to say down there.
Jesus was running around at the spa last night with a handgun.
Really?
Okay.
You can see Reverend Stang there.
Yeah.
And a wounded side and a crown on his head and a loincloth and a handgun.
He was hunting for Bob.
He was hunting for Bob.
And so what happened?
Well, he was bumming drinks.
Yeah.
He was real upset.
I didn't see him running.
He was running around town.
You'd be on the lookout.
Okay.
There he was.
And a wound in his side and a crown of thorns, a loincloth.
Yeah.
And then I saw him going off with Connie, too.
That's a drinking, fighting Jesus for you.
I tell you.
He was fighting one of them.
Very bad.
Did he hit Bob?
Yeah.
I wasn't around at that point.
I don't think he hit Bob.
He missed him.
Yeah.
Something must have happened.
We think the bullets were caught in some sort of void time warp or something.
Yeah.
I saw it.
He was in an office.
He had three different heads.
Boy, I love time warp.
Yeah.
That's always a problem with those deities.
One of the main things you have to do on the show here is wash the little H-bombs.
Over here in the corner is a sink over here.
And you can wash their white bodies.
That makes them all happy.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
We might have to leave the floor.
It looks like the crowd's getting ugly down there with the river and I'm staying.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
They busted through the...
Are you afraid to die?
No.
No.
No.
No.




No.








Well, there you go.
They busted through the third medium into Stang's brain.
They now reside there until we can perform the radio exercise on the second half of the show.
Yes, I was there in the bar that night, the night that Jesus was allegedly running around,
but that was no handgun in his pocket.
Was it?
Let me tell you...
He was just happy to see another cult.
He wanted those followers back.
Customer service.
Yes, dear.
Papa Joe here.
You know, you're far too young to remember this, but when I was a boy, we didn't have
any of these.
We cleaned Jesus with a handgun.
Jesus.
Jesus.
We only prayed to an almighty God that puts fear, fear in his disciples.
I'm talking about Jesus with a hand grenade.
Fear in his cereal?
No.
Jesus, back in my day, Jesus had AK-47.
Jesus had a Stinger missile.
I know.
I just understand that's the old world.
They're in new thinking now.
See, that's what's happened today.
People get sloughed off with these cheap imitations.
Yeah.
Papa Joe, Mama, I can't believe you have a list of high-ranking officials that were
there that night and were actually subgenius.
All right, punch it up.
Name?
Well, it has been alleged that certain hierarchies have carried weapons of destruction on their
persons during public appearances, but this is merely a defensive measure, let me assure
you.
These allegations of opening up on the audience, dispensing with people that didn't applaud
loud enough.
These are...
These are purely exaggerations.
They tell me it feels something like...
Okay, all right.
There was some shooting on the audience, but it was target practice.
We were deliberately missing.
Tell the truth.
Okay, okay, so, all right, a few people were hit, but that was from...
Yeah, we dialed up Rocket Man.
What a beautiful future it is.
And how many people were taken in?
Listen, what I lie to you, what I lie to you...
We're the elite of the world.
Those people that died, those were people that wanted...
They wanted to die.
They jumped up in the line of fire.
Would you lie to me?
What about that night you told me you were...
Well, never mind.
Never mind, never mind.
Close the raven, never mind.
Head of home, Shelly!
He screamed at the orderlies, when told he was actually Farlow Fudd, doctor of dental
surgery.
He struggled with his bonds and snapped his jaws at them viciously, his mouth foaming
like a St. Bernard's.
The drug's head showed some beneficial effect at first.
But as time...
Time wore on, his violent reassertion of his fictitious persona pushed aside any hope that
chemical management would lead to a breakthrough.
Get the electrodes, sighed Dr. Fine.
He shook his head in resigned frustration.
The man had already absorbed the full charge of four die-hard batteries and was still no
better.
His burning devotion to this Bob Dobbs was most disturbing.
Either it was the product of a fevered, sick mind, or this Bob had somehow tormented the
man into a state of burning psychotic loyalty unlike anything they'd seen before.
Perhaps it was both.
Hell-poke Huey and Dee.
Well, regardless, I have a job to do, thought the doctor, as he pulled on his thick rubber
gloves and goggles.
And to think I used to enjoy this, he thought.
Something had to work soon.
There were only three orderlies left, and one of them refused to approach this patient
again, even with the peril of being fired over his head.
As the raving men had put the others in the ICU, with snapped bones and large pieces bitten
out of them, the doctor couldn't really blame him.
Perhaps he really was a doctor.

He was the pope of hell.
He was certainly earning his self-imposed title.
Oh well.
One last try with electricity, and then it would be time to turn to firearms.
Suddenly there were screams in the hall, followed by a terrifying, rumbling crash that sounded
like someone had loosed a thunderhead in the building.
The multifaceted sonic chaos made him feel like a frightened child again, and his bladder
loosened violently.
Against his better judgment, he ran from the room and turned the corner to see the orderlies
in pools of their own blood, their arms ripped from the sockets.
Unimaginable burns, smoking and filling the air with the acrid tang of ozone.
Worse yet, one of them had been separated from his head, which lay forlornly in the corner
like a discarded ragdoll, except that ragdolls didn't ooze loops of intestine and purple-pink
brain matter.
My dear God, his nose has been bitten off, Dr. Fine thought as he vomited.
I guess he shouldn't have called the man names when all this started, he thought absently,
part of his fractured mind shutting itself off in a bid to prevent a complete death.

He was in a state of complete breakdown.
There was a huge hole in the wall, jaggedly rent as if some unimaginable force of nature
had gone berserk, which was, ironically, exactly what had happened.
A few bricks fell from the smoking edges of the gash as he watched, mouth agape, vomitous
unwiped, as he tried to wrap a protective cocoon around his mind until he could get
to some tranquilizers.
Hmm, Bob Dobbs and Hell Pope Huey, he mused absently.
I'll remember those names.
HOPE is the name of the emperor Alan fixing his celebrate, Edmund complacently writes
abouthorals in a 5000 page old comic.

I'm going to give you a couple of different addresses tonight.

Oh, yes.
There's a lot more besides this radio show that you need to know about at P.O.
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.
And our good friend Onan Canobite is apparently doing a book about SPK, the band SPK.
And he is looking for anything you've got, like interviews, discographies, tour data,

Bob does it.
I know.
No.
But this might.
Now, the conspiracy talks about something called deviant sex.
To the conspiracy, deviant sex is anything except having, trying to have a baby in the missionary position.
That's the only thing we consider to be a sin.
All right!
I'm a preacher.
