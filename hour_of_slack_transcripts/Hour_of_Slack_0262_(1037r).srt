1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,800
For men on the go, it's not what's in the pipe, it's the pipe itself.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,720
The Bob Dobbs Classic Meerschaum, hand-carved by the finest craftsmen in Malaysia.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,440
This and other fine Bob Dobbs smoking accessories cast a spell on the room for the discriminating smoker.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,920
Bob Dobbs pipes never go out of style.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,980
Available at Kmart, Walmart, Target, and Hypermart.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,080
Oh, too much church now.

7
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,420
Praise the Lord.

8
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,300
And welcome to the subjealous radio ministry.

9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,580
Praise the Lord.

10
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,180
Praise the Lord.

11
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,500
Yeah.

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,940
Now, before we really get going with this sermon here, I'd like you all to share something.

13
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,800
This is something we've done.

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,820
We've been in Texas and Arkansas for many years.

15
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,580
It's just to kind of make people understand the solemnity, the profundity of the whole thing.

16
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,000
Lower your heads and we'll share a sacred moment of noise.

17
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,620
People, people, people.

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,180
All right.

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,100
Yeah, here we go.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,500
I see some people that are in there.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,920
These people have slack.

23
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,420
The sound.

24
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,880
The sound itself.

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,020
It has a stink to it.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,140
It's bad.

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,160
It's bad.

28
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,600
It's bad.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,400
Who's going to drive that greyhound, children?

30
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,300
Greyhound.

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,520
Who's going to drive that greyhound, children?

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Sonic and Sonic are coming to the middle.

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,100
Sonic and Sonic are coming to the middle.

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,400
Sonic and Sonic are coming to the middle.

35
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,100
For the sake of Christ.

36
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,320
The floor was dry, 55.

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,060
Oh, I'm by the bridge, educated.

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Water故-

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:45,720
They're hitching a ride to the Holy Nation.

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,620
There's no smoking here, or thrashing over armor.

41
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,400
A soldier rows and down in a taką oito.

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,300
Thank you.

43
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
Thank you.

44
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,740
Thank you.

45
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,420
Thank you.

46
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,180
Thank you.

47
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,260
Thank you.

48
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,160
Thank you.

49
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,500
Thank you.

50
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,520
Thank you.

51
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,720
Thank you.

52
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,500
Thank you.

53
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,280
Thank you.

54
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,880
Thank you.

55
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,680
Thank you.

56
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:32,680


57
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:32,680


58
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:32,680


59
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,680
I dare you to kill me.

60
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,380
This is the mark.

61
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,340
You can always tell it's going to be a Bob

62
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,420
righteous revival when there's technical

63
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,180
problems and headaches.

64
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,380
And when there's

65
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,180
always a

66
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,260
normal group and not normal

67
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,400
group.

68
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,160
the potheads always seem to show up wherever the subgeniuses do.

69
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,480
As a matter of fact, I went in the restroom to make sure my fly was up,

70
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,660
which is the most important part of any public preaching, by the way.

71
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,380
And somebody in there said,

72
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,480
Hey, Reverend Stang, you want to blow one before the show?

73
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,920
I said, man, Bob is the only drug.

74
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,120
That's the only drug. You can't come down from Bob.

75
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,260
I just say no.

76
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,420
Just say no.

77
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,360
That's it.

78
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:38,940
Ah, yes, dear friend.

79
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,220
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

80
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,400
All right, I can see we got the spirit.

81
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,300
The spirit is moving tonight.

82
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,960
All right.

83
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:17,080
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

84
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,900
Spreading the seed word of KR.

85
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,700
Bob Dobbs.

86
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,280
High Epoch of the Church of the Subgenius.

87
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

88
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,240
Wow.

89
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,900
Wow.

90
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,500
Wow.

91
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,440
Wow.

92
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,940
Wow.

93
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,780
Wow.

94
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
Wow.

95
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:45,560
Wow.

96
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,000
Wow.

97
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,160
Ha .

98
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,160


99
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:10,040
Proudly crowd, we strangely tripping and tripping.

100
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,720
Tonight, the primary source is that this is going to be a big

101
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:13,740
day.

102
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,560
These players have совершенно naturallyеровtraining.

103
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,120
Ha, Ha, Ha.

104
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,160


105
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,880
Let's see if he's remembering how to control himself through

106
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,160
Well here we are at Columbia University's Halloween Spook House.

107
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,200
I recognize your voice man.

108
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:32,920
Hello.

109
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,380
Hello.

110
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,980
You are the radio guy.

111
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,760
Yeah.

112
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,220
Yeah.

113
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,020
Dude he's the radio guy.

114
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,440
I heard about him.

115
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,180
I've read the book.

116
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,660
That would be you.

117
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,060
I've read that book.

118
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm kind of one of the.

119
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,800
Okay wait you gotta explain something.

120
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,120
You know what.

121
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,480
Yeah I got some.

122
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,400
I got on the senior 21st floor.

123
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,400


124
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,400


125
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,400


126
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,920
I'm gonna send him an opinion.

127
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,440
Then you're still peeing in the eyes of Bob.

128
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,560
That's why you gotta keep reading.

129
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,520
You gotta keep reading that book because those mudflats are gonna be angry.

130
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,940
Well anyway as I was saying some people think the church is like some sign of the end times.

131
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,440
The mockers that will come at the end times and those people should be damn glad we're

132
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,420
helping to fulfill biblical prophecy.

133
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,680
To us who've been with the church a long time it's a mystery.

134
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,460
We don't know what the hell this thing's gonna turn into.

135
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,380
If we did it'd be fantastic.

136
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,380


137
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,380


138
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,380


139
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,380


140
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,380


141
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,380


142
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,380


143
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,400
It'd be boring to us.

144
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,380
It founded, the church actually was founded in 1953 by that man J.R.

145
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,280
Bob Dobbs.

146
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,700
Hey Bob.

147
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,000
Bob founded his church when he discovered that there was a conspiracy, a conspiracy

148
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,700
of normals robbing away the slack of the true subgeniuses as opposed to human beings.

149
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,620
Mere fumes as we call them.

150
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,080
It's sort of a do it yourself.

151
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,640
Mere self religion.

152
00:12:52,900 --> 00:13:00,220
Bob founded his church not on a rock but rather on sort of a shifty, shifting sandy beach

153
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,280
of hypocrisy.

154
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,800
Every church must have its fair measure of hypocrisy and certainly we've got more, we

155
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,480
dole out more of it than anybody else.

156
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:16,160
Like I said it's a non-organization for non-joiners which makes it a little bit difficult to raise

157
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,420
funds at times.

158
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,060
But the point of it is that all subgeniuses, people say well what the hell is that?

159
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,060


160
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,060


161
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,060


162
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,700
What the hell is a subgenius?

163
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,820
There's no definition.

164
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,880
They're all different.

165
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,060
That's what it means.

166
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,220
There is no typical subgenius.

167
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,440
If any two are alike one must die.

168
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,960
The only thing that the subgeniuses have in common is that they have nothing in common

169
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,240
with the conspiracy.

170
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,440
What we're trying to do is tempt sinners away from the devil.

171
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,100
Because Bob is a better tempter than the devil.

172
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,040
However, what they, where they're going.

173
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,560
Where they go after that it's up to them.

174
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,580
The subgeniuses believe in the God that doesn't want you to believe in it.

175
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:06,080
And our, one of our missions, we're, the headquarters is in Dallas, Texas, what they often call

176
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,660
the buckle on the Bible belt.

177
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:14,660
What we try to do is unbuckle the Bible belt so that its pants may drop and it may gaze

178
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,640
unflinching upon its own private design.

179
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,020
It's a wonderful thing.

180
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,020


181
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,020


182
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,760
It's a war, dear friends.

183
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,780
It's a war against the normals.

184
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,800
And we're just the regular kind of mutants we're talking about here.

185
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,040
These are more like the monsters, the monster type of mutants.

186
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,700
It's the humans versus the subgeniuses.

187
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,560
And the ironic thing is in the early days of the church, 80 million years ago in fabled

188
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,760
Atlantis, we helped to design the humans.

189
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,040
Probably our biggest mistake.

190
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,480
So.

191
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:49,920
So.

192
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,260
So.

193
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:51,980
So.

194
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,380
So.

195
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,720
Friends, as I said, you know, the fact that Chester, Jesus smoked Chesterfield's, even

196
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,520
though they didn't exist 2000 years ago, it's an example of our faith.

197
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,620
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

198
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,000
You just feel it.

199
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,040
You feel it in your heart.

200
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,480
Bob sold it.

201
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,580
I smoked it.

202
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,820
That settles it.

203
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,940
It's a question of faith.

204
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
This is like the sorrow of world religions.

205
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Putting those two C's on both cheeks.

206
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,320
the bloody marks on the beefy seat of the conspiracy.

207
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,080
It's like the Robin Hood of world religions,

208
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,160
robbing from the lost, who were mostly thieves to begin with,

209
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,040
and giving to the saved.

210
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,540
And if you, my friend, can make it,

211
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,660
can buy this book of the subgenius,

212
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,260
that videotape on sale for only $30 tonight,

213
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,600
if you can make it to the jungle encampment in Dobstown, Malaysia,

214
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,620
if you can survive the acubating, the excrementation,

215
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,360
the pirate flatulation, and the head-launchings, my friend,

216
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,640
you will be a weapon for Bob,

217
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,640
a weapon for J.R. Bob Dobbs,

218
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,980
a minister of Bob, praying for slack!

219
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,820
You and your subgenius fools shall never defeat me, Bob Dobbs.

220
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,540
Oh, no? Then have a taste of my stark fist of removal, Dr. Conspiracy.

221
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,640
Neegy's henchmen won't get any slack

222
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,660
when they face Bobco's new Bob Dobbs action figure

223
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,280
with flying rocket fists,

224
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,420
flamethrower pipe,

225
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,100
and magic briefcase.

226
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,880
Too much is always better than not enough

227
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,640
when you collect the subgenius universe.

228
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,740
Bobmobile not included.

229
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,520
Batteries and some assembly required.

230
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,120
Action figure sold separately from Bobco.

231
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,280
I am a subgenius!

232
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,200
And by that threat you would touch what falls to scrap!

233
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,280
You are a man!

234
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,720
My power wasn't given to me in exchange for prayer or meditation.

235
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,900
I paid for it in cold, hard American dollars.

236
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,140
Salvation you get for free is worth just that.

237
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,420
Doesn't you, queer?

238
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,720
Of course, your money ain't worth jack anyway.

239
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,960
The conspiracy sees to that,

240
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,440
but a very important element of your soul

241
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,680
adheres to those otherwise worthless greenbacks

242
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,740
that Bob needs.

243
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,600
Bob needs a job.

244
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,660
In order to pursue his plan for world domination.

245
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,940
I say, Bob guides my head in all things

246
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,040
and pays me off in pure slack!

247
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,200
So I say to you whips, you fools, you dupes, you pigs,

248
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,960
give me your money!

249
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,180
You own the end of the future!

250
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,660
The future offers you naught but destruction!

251
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,280
You know what I mean?

252
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,180
I mean...

253
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,800
I!

254
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,060
I dare you to kill me!

255
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,480
I need to be, I mean, I'm one of the good guys!

256
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,680
My cards shall prevail!

257
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Let out the crazy man inside you, he knows what's what!

258
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,220
Smile when you call me a fanatic!

259
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,580
Oh, you say, me!

260
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,040
Me!

261
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,180
Crying me!

262
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,040
Me!

263
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
Over man!

264
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,620
You think I'm dumb, but you are blind to the conspiracy that runs your life!

265
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,960
And you have your geniuses running things for you

266
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,520
and you think they're gonna make things safe and simple!

267
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,400
And I'm gonna make things safe and simple and easy for me!

268
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,120
And the entire sub-demon's rich!

269
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,180
Even if it means wiping out your sick society in total!

270
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,600
With no more sentiment that involves swatting the blind!

271
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,560
All right!

272
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,400
I'm gonna make you all just say, we might survive the end times!

273
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,640
You know why?

274
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,980
Because I am!

275
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,840
I am!

276
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,880
I am!

277
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,160
I am!

278
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,300


279
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
A sub-D!

280
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,980
I say, all you blow-dried, white-wired, sippin', designer, jean-clad, French film watchin',

281
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,260
walkin', totin', hip-wimps, a few house-coated, inquirer, riddin', trailer and temp, mall-shoppin',

282
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,500
hair-curl, motorheads, cock-holsters, all you dupes!

283
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,220
Stop corporate big money!

284
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,940
Oil, explore, tree-killin', land-raping, food-freezin', desk-warmin', tryin'-natterin'!

285
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,720
The establishmentarian vote!

286
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,280
Huntin', backstabbin', poverty-spreadin', bomb-wieldin', meringue-headin', pencil-neck, eraser-headed,

287
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,560
politicals!

288
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,140
Kill the conspiracy!

289
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,440
Kill them and eat them!

290
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,780
Kill them and eat them and f*** their wives!

291
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,260
Who do you think you are?

292
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,600
What do you think you're doin'?

293
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,500
Do you think you got it good?

294
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,820
Well dispose of those illusions!

295
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,700
Dispose of them all right now!

296
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:58,300
Because on July 5th, 1998 at 7.30 in the morning, you shall be judged!

297
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,900
Calculating alien races!

298
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,940
I'm your own!

299
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,160
If you don't want to fight, you won't escape their scrutiny!

300
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,540
You will fight!

301
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,700
Well we will party!

302
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,760
Bottle of Thunderbird, I'm gonna get down and do it right here, nasty and dirty!

303
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,880
You know why, daddy?

304
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,820
You know why?

305
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,020
Cause...

306
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,680
Now some of you Christians out here may be getting a little upset at what I'm saying,

307
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,220
but I'd like to remind you that the founder of your religion was not quite so squeamish

308
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,580
as some of you!

309
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,280
Yeah!

310
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,640
Yeah!

311
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,760
Yeah!

312
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,120
Yeah!

313
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:58,620
Yeah!

314
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,240
Yeah!

315
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,240


316
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,240


317
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,240


318
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,700
Yeah!

319
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:00,800
Yeah!

320
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:00,800


321
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,180


322
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,260


323
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,260


324
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,640
Yeah!

325
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah!

326
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,580
Ogre King!

327
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,800
Billy King!

328
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,900
Bit ofug houses get smacked!

329
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,540
You brats picking always get heла took some old which again, not up we shall cut off.

330
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,400
You bring in lesser surprise and raise the Turbo SP prosecutors there will bite you cheap!

331
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,560
Trollora Monster!

332
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,040
What better word thatrove others thus can give a big war if those robots are so spare!

333
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,780
Farewell you smoothies!

334
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,560
O equal Fnumbered Raid cœury!

335
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,180
As if you are auve ha, hunted the

336
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,180


337
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,060
Hey hey Cidreiro your buddy P Micro you are Software.

338
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,980
Oh, yes, dear friends.

339
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:03,540
This is your host and good prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

340
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,760
And the amazing rant that you heard just a little while ago

341
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:21,340
was a heavily censored version of Brother Cleve Duncan's testimonial

342
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,900
with background sampled music by huge,

343
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,300
huge voodoo.

344
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,980
More on that in a minute.

345
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,580
I'm really sorry about having to put cuts in that rant

346
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,460
where the taboo verbal expressions were excised.

347
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,320
You may or may not have noticed it.

348
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,560
But, you know, until the grudish, word-fearing conspiracy is defeated,

349
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,380
well, you know, we're not allowed to play certain words.

350
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,680
Because of the assumption in some quarters

351
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,220
that some words can actually harm you.

352
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,200
More than the images of rape and violence

353
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,980
shown pretty much all the time on television.

354
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,220
Uh...

355
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,660
Someday these things will change under Bob.

356
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,060
Now...

357
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,360
Now...

358
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:24,360


359
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,500
Almost all of the rest of this show

360
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,580
was recorded this weekend.

361
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,440
It's almost all material recorded this last weekend.

362
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,380
Last weekend.

363
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,420
In New York and New Jersey.

364
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,020
By myself, Reverend Ivan Stang,

365
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,060
and especially the Reverend Dr. D.K. Jones,

366
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,280
as well as his friend, Reverend Bruce Grant.

367
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,780
Before, during, and after,

368
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,360
a subgenius revolted,

369
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,320
a revival at Columbia University.

370
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,020
D.K. Jones, uh...

371
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,100
is a subgenius musician you'll be most familiar with.

372
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,500
I guess from his score for the subgenius video, Arise.

373
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,960
And, in fact, the music that'll be coming up

374
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,560
and that you've heard some of already,

375
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,700
the stuff with preachers,

376
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,960
sampled bits of preachers over it,

377
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,880
is by Bruce Grant and D.K. Jones,

378
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,420
going under the name of Huge Voodoo.

379
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,400
The more linear instrumental background music,

380
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,760
such as the stuff behind us right now,

381
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,940
is by D.K. Jones and myself,

382
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,260
believe it or not,

383
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,220
but mostly D.K. Jones.

384
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,240
I would like to thank

385
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,460
all of those who helped support the station

386
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,600
with their pledges

387
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,160
last couple of weeks,

388
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,720
and especially,

389
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,660
to those who helped with the pledge drive,

390
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,120
such as Reverend Willa Dobbs,

391
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,480
and the good Pope S. Cecilia,

392
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,620
and the bad Reverend Trickster Shaman.

393
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
Praise Bob, dear friends.

394
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,020
Stay tuned, and, uh...

395
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,400
you'll eventually hear the post office box number

396
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,600
to write to for information regarding

397
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,860
this mighty church of the subgenius.

398
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,860
This radio voice program,

399
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,860
you're now hearing the subgenius radio ministry,

400
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,160
Hour of Slack.

401
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,880
Praise old Bobby.

402
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,920
Bob?

403
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,640
Bob?

404
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,680
Um, do you think I could have more of them,

405
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,860
kind of,

406
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:53,860


407
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:53,860


408
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:53,860


409
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:53,860


410
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:53,860


411
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:53,860


412
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:53,860


413
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:53,860


414
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,760
and I want you to play some Pills.

415
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:22,860
You don't want to remembered,

416
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,840
he was trying to put you on that desired path,

417
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,840


418
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,840


419
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,840


420
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,840


421
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,840


422
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,840


423
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,840


424
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,840


425
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,280
You don't need no cocaine.

426
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,740
With hip hop or Jesus,

427
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,680
it enjoys you, okay?

428
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,820
They warned me, but I didn't listen.

429
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,980
I went ahead and tried the frappy.

430
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:58,080
They said, just one time, it won't hurt you.

431
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,160
But they lied to me.

432
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,820
So that's our background track, huh?

433
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,520
Yeah.

434
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:18,720
Yeah.

435
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:18,760
Yeah.

436
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:18,960
Yeah.

437
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:18,960


438
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:18,960


439
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:18,960


440
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,100
Sir Valpert at 16.

441
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,780
This is soundtrack for Cleve walking home,

442
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,360
light it.

443
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,580
The lonely Cleve walking home,

444
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,280
light it now.

445
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,720
He's had, you might say, one too many.

446
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,780
And suddenly, he ran into the brick wall.

447
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,980
Oh, my head.

448
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,640
What happened?

449
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,500
Where am I?

450
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,760
The last thing I remember, I was trying my first hit of frog.

451
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,740
Oh, what has it done to me?

452
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,780
I never should have joined that church.

453
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,660
It was...

454
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,220
There's only one thing left to do.

455
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,540
I must kill Bob.

456
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,600
Yes, that's the answer.

457
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,220
It is my duty to kill Bob.

458
00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:00,660
Oh, my God.

459
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,200
Oh, my God.

460
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,280
Harvest what you can and what remains because

461
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,640
tomorrow you'll be empty and alone.

462
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,520
I feel like I'm doing this for nothing

463
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,600
Don't have a house campaign to rent

464
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,420
Somebody, would you believe it?

481
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,360
You weren't bleeding your head on a Thursday.

482
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,980
Why was you wearing them big green straps?

483
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,960
You know you should not do that, Benny.

484
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,640
Take it easy, Doug.

485
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,020
Doug?

486
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,960
Doug, I'm gonna call a doctor.

487
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:04,660
Doug.

488
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,560
Doug, there's something I want you to know.

489
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,100
You were the best assignment I ever had.

490
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,560
You wouldn't shoot me, would you, Doug?

491
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,500
After all we've been through.

492
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,840
If things have gone wrong, I'm talking to myself,

493
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,320
and you've got a wet towel wrapped around your head.

494
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,020
No, no, I'm sorry, Bob. We didn't mean it.

495
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,580
We didn't mean it to...

496
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,680
We won't call you anymore, Bob. Please don't call me that.

497
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,480
Don't.

498
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,700
No, Bob. Don't do it, please.

499
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,980
Once that bomb comes in here, Bob,

500
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,340
I already filled up my will.

501
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,940
Excuse me.

502
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,080
I'm gonna call the little one.

503
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,000
Niggy.

504
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,420
Bob, frog Bob.

505
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,620
Where in the world can Niggy be?

506
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,220
Niggy.

507
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,660
Where is to, Niggy?

508
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,900
Where is to, Niggy?

509
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,640
Niggy.

510
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,020
Where is to?

511
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,460
I know you are there, Niggy.

512
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,700
You're not going to get me this time, Niggy.

513
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,240
Because I have the gun.

514
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,800
And the diamonds.

515
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,420
And the map.

516
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,560
And the documents.

517
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,540
And I have the device.

518
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,480
Yes, I have the device.

519
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,400
And you are foiled finally, Niggy.

520
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,800
Niggy?

521
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,840
Where did you go?

522
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,200
Where did you go, Niggy?

523
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,480
You can't fool me this time, Niggy.

524
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,980
I signed the papers already.

525
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,280
You can't.

526
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,900
What?

527
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,640
No, what is this?

528
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,600
The tapes.

529
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,540
The blank.

530
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,780
The documents, they've fallen to dust.

531
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,720
The negatives.

532
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,740
What about the negatives?

533
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,380
What, they're gone.

534
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,480
They're gone.

535
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,760
I had the negatives.

536
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,720
I had the device.

537
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,620
I had the girl.

538
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,320
The gun.

539
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:04,800
The map.

540
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,100
But, but, but, Niggy has them now.

541
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,960
I should have told you, Niggy.

542
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


543
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


544
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


545
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


546
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


547
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


548
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


549
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


550
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


551
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


552
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:12,960


553
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,160
I should have listened in the temples of the old ones when they told me.

554
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:26,060
They told me that for every Bob particle, there must always be a, a NIGGY PARTICLE.

555
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,180
Why didn't I listen?

556
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,040
Oh, oh, the, the pain.

557
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,220
To think, I could have had it all.

558
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,180
I could have had everything, but, but, Niggy has it now.

559
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,280
Uh-huh.

560
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,380
You can go to Dotson Town and get the formal training for coming over, man.

561
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,020
I skirted him.

562
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,580
In Malaysia?

563
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,620
Sure.

564
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,740
I skirted the formal training.

565
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,740
I sort of came in and it all happened.

566
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,220
Did you go to Malaysia?

567
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,920
Oh, man, I laid the first cornerstone.

568
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,520
It was a human skull.

569
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,040
A human skull, not a subgenius skull.

570
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,980
Have you ever seen Have a Nice Day?

571
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,380
It was spelled out in the skull of a normal human.

572
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,880
Get right back.

573
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,120
It's sweet.

574
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,800
It's kind of neat.

575
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,940
Or save the earth spelled out in the chopped off arms of a Peruvian peasant.

576
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,180
It's a joyful play.

577
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:27,620
Yeah.

578
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,120
It's so neat.

579
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,880
It's like the new age.

580
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,140
Yeah.

581
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,040
Ray.

582
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
What are you?

583
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,260
Shh.

584
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,120
It's all right.

585
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,040
It's okay.

586
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,160
I'm all right.

587
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,080
I got it.

588
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:46,840
Ow!

589
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:47,780
Damn.

590
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,760
Don't let her go!

591
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,740
She's got to make a move.

592
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,340
Where'd she go?

593
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,940
Here, here, here.

594
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,460
Here, here.

595
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,600
Let's get you.

596
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,100
Keep back.

597
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,720
Keep back.

598
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,260
Don't care.

599
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,620
Grab her, man.

600
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,520
We're going to lose her.

601
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,280
Damn it.

602
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,060
Keep back I'll grab her for you.

603
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,360
Get back.

604
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,560
We'll show you.

605
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:38,600
Stop.

606
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,260
There.

607
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Thank god its working.

608
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,160
There.

609
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,160


610
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,160


611
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,160


612
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,160


613
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,160


614
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Oh, there we go.

615
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,560
I'm the king of the animals.

616
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,220
I'm the king of the animals.

617
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:58,920
Wait.

618
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,420
No, you don't.

619
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,820
It's OK.

620
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,720
You're going to be all right now.

621
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,040
Shh.

622
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:07,880
Be.

623
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:08,980
Be.

624
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,080
It's going to be OK.

625
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,160
It's all right.

626
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,160


627
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,080
You're going to be OK.

628
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:13,740
No.

629
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,380
Shh.

630
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


631
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,520
Shh.

632
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,500
Shh.

633
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,300
Oh, yeah.

634
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,900
You know, there was this woman in line ahead of me at the post office this morning.

635
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,640
She was wearing a new Connie Dobbs perfume, you know.

636
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,340
And that reminded me of you.

637
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,680
And.

638
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,820
Oh.

639
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,120
Oh.

640
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,640
Oh.

641
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,240
Oh.

642
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,700
Oh.

643
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:54,520
And I don't know if it's too late now, but our search has already begun.

644
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:10,640
I, I, I don't think I can control this time of the, of the, of the time.

645
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,140
I, I, I, I don't know.

646
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,140


647
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,600
The light is always on

648
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,740
I'm the king of the world

649
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,600
I hold the control

650
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,280
I hold the control

651
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,080
I'm the king of the world

652
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,980
I'm the king of the world

653
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,080
I'm the king of the world

654
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,680
The world is my own

655
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,500
I'm the king of the world

656
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,480
I'm the king of the world

657
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,900
I'm the king of the world

658
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,020
Where is our lucky groom and poor pathetic bride?

659
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,740
And poor martyred bride?

660
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,780
Let's see, I guess if y'all would see Brandy and Glenn.

661
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,340
If y'all could stand.

662
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,220
Yeah, right there.

663
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,020
Wait, wait, we gotta get...

664
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,200
Woo!

665
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,380
I'm more used to preaching in tents.

666
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,620
Ah, yes.

667
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,720
Hey, if Reverend Sun Yung Moon can marry thousands of people who've never even met,

668
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,100
then a Church of the Subgenius short-duration marriage could be the answer.

669
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,560
Yeah, as a matter of fact, this is one thing you can do as a subgenius minister.

670
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,060
You can do legal weddings.

671
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,480
You can also do the short-duration marriages.

672
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,840
This certificate here produced by Reverend Bucknaken in Dallas

673
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,700
can come in very handy.

674
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:50,280
Because a short-duration marriage can last for an hour, a night, a week, a year, whatever.

675
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,480
And the divorces are cheap.

676
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,500
They come with the certificate.

677
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,980
All right.

678
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,080
Anybody else want to get married tonight?

679
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,340
Step right up, get your holy short-duration marriage certificate here.

680
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,900
Test your mettle and win the little lady a rubber Snoopy doll.

681
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,660
Guaranteed, friends, to absolve and sanctify all otherwise illicit couplings.

682
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,060
Free short-duration divorce if you're not completely satisfied.

683
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,240
All right, now you two stand together and face me.

684
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,540
Ooh, I like that.

685
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,080
All right.

686
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,560
Let's be solid now here.

687
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,420
Do you, Glenn, take, uh, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

688
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,260
and nothing but the truth, and tell the Snoopy Bob?

689
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,420
I do.

690
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,700
Do you, Brandy, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

691
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,880
and nothing but the truth, and the Snoopy Bob?

692
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,340
Yeah.

693
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,140
All right, good.

694
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,620
Okay, now, how long do you wish for this period of sanctified couplings to last?

695
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,920
One year.

696
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:50,860
One year?

697
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,820
Oh, yeah, that's right.

698
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,340
You told me that.

699
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,480
One year.

700
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,240
Me.

701
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,100
Uh, you sure?

702
00:44:59,600 --> 00:44:59,960
Yeah.

703
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,680
All right.

704
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,440
Oh, yes.

705
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,660
Dearly beloveds,

706
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:10,040
we are gathered here today in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs and, uh,

707
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,260
insert other deity names here, any, any other deities,

708
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,060
uh, to join this man, Glenn, and this woman, Brandy,

709
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:23,760
in the bondage of holy matrimony, for better or for worse, but not for long.

710
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,980
Do you feel the spirit?

711
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,660
Then put your hands on each other.

712
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,360
If there are any here who feel this man and this woman should not be joined temporarily,

713
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,360
just hold your peace, because we don't want to hear about it.

714
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,360
Hold tight.

715
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,500
Hold tight now.

716
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,260
Oh, lovely.

717
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,480
Lovely comments.

718
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,960
Do you, Glenn, take this woman, Brandy, to be your lawful wedded wife and short-duration

719
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:56,080
subgenius matrimonial, to have and to hold for richer or poorer in sickness and kinkiness

720
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,840
for the next year?

721
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,480
Say, say, I do.

722
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,700
I do.

723
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,340
Do you, uh, Brandy, take this woman, Brandy, to be your lawful wedded wife and short-duration

724
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,440
subgenius matrimonial, to have and to hold for richer or poorer in sickness and kinkiness

725
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,840
for the next year?

726
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,560
Say, I do.

727
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,000
I do.

728
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,740
Shake on it.

729
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,100
And say, it's a deal.

730
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:20,740
Woo!

731
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,240
Now, get out.

732
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,680
Oh, we're not over.

733
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,560
We're not finished yet.

734
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,480
We got a really important part, the symbolic part's coming up.

735
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,220
Get out the ring.

736
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,180
You do have a ring.

737
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,820
The best man.

738
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,320
The best man here in seven years.

739
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


740
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


741
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


742
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


743
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


744
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


745
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


746
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


747
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


748
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


749
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


750
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


751
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,320


752
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,040
Give the hands to the best man.

753
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:44,000
All right, um, we take this ring, give that to, uh, to Glenn, and Glenn, you, uh, and she

754
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,880
inserts, uh, her finger into the hole.

755
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:52,340
We take this, we take this ring as a holy symbol of the estate of marriage as well as

756
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,000
of the pole going deep into the hole repeatedly, obviously.

757
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:01,460
By the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dobbs in defiance of the laws of the state

758
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,320
and of nature, I pronounce you man and wife of the state.

759
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:04,320


760
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:04,320


761
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,560
You are now officially married for the next one year.

762
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:11,380
You must, you must now kiss each other right in front of all these people.

763
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,560
Praise Bob!

764
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,340
This is so, yeah.

765
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,300
Take it off.

766
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,060
Yay, yay, yay.

767
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,540
Praise Bob, praise Bob.

768
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,340
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

769
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:34,160
You are now duly authorized and excused for sexual couplings of any perverse and unspeakable

770
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,320
couple.

771
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,320


772
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,260
for a period of one year.

773
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,860
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

774
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,160
it is done, amen, and a-women.

775
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
Praise God!

776
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,000
Praise God!

777
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,960
The Philippian ball garages

778
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,420
of rock and roll music

779
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,320
is obviously a meaning

780
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,780
by which the white man

781
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,280
is driven to the level

782
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,840
with a nickname.

783
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:43,880
The Philippian ball garages

784
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,540
of rock and roll music

785
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,000
is obviously a meaning

786
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,000


787
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,000


788
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,000


789
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,140
The Philippian ball garages

790
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,140


791
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,140


792
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,140


793
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,140


794
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,140


795
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,120
The evil feeling that you feel

796
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:19,580
when you sing.

797
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,060
Why I believe that

798
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,500
is because I know how to beat.

799
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,100
The evil feeling that you feel

800
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,560
when you sing.

801
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,400
And all the last positions

802
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,640
you get into, the beats.

803
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,200
Well, if you talk to

804
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,380
the average teenager of today

805
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,700
and you ask them what it is

806
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,160
about rock and roll music

807
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:43,780
that they like,

808
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,400
if they're playing bad mites,

809
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:48,600
it's so simple.

810
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,360
If you talk to the average

811
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,300
teenager of today,

812
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,000
Drops his and call his name.

813
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,220
You've all put theedor

814
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,220


815
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,220


816
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,720
If you talk

817
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,380
to the average

818
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,920
teenager of today.

819
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:08,920


820
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:08,920


821
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:08,920


822
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:08,920


823
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,160
teenager of today

824
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,660
a beat, a beat, a beat,

825
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,860
a beat, a beat, a beat.

826
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:13,860


827
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,540
The evil feeling that you feel

828
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,460
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels

829
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:40,880
In the name of Jesus

830
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,560
Go!

831
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:41,560


832
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,420
Make my words

833
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,960
The devils of hell

834
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,220
I believe that is because I know how it feels

835
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,480
In the name of Jesus

836
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,140
I know what it does to you

837
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,680
I know the evil feeling that you feel in the name of Jesus

838
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,860
I know the lost position that you get into

839
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,440
In the feet

840
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,160
Well, if you talk to the average theater of today

841
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,620
And you ask them what it is about rock and roll music that they like

842
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,460
The first thing they'll say

843
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,840
Is the beat, the beat, the beat

844
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,160
Go!

845
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,740
The beat, the beat, the beat

846
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,020
Make my words

847
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,760
The beat, the beat, the beat

848
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,900
The beat, the beat, the beat

849
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,760
The demons are the righteousness of God

850
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,840
The evil feeling that you feel is sacred

851
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,900
Now I want you to hear it

852
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,500
Come out, come out of this place

853
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,800
Come out of this place

854
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,060
Come out of this place

855
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,340
Come out of that place

856
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,440
Come out, come out, come out

857
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,360
In the name of Jesus

858
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,020
It is the beginning

859
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,340
We want your body

860
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,560
It is the beginning

861
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,860
We want your teleport should have been

862
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,240
The guy's party

863
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,300
The open the door

864
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,540
It is the beginning

865
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,240
Beweep

866
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:37,460
It is the beginning

867
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,700
We want the truth

868
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:38,700


869
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,440
Beweep, picture the fighting

870
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,380
The beat, the beat, the beat, the beat, the beat.

871
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,140
The evil feeling.

872
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,560
The beat, the beat, the beat.

873
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,260
Why I believe that is because I know.

874
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,400
Sub-genius hell.

875
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,380
It's a cold, cold kind of hell.

876
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,500
Cold in here.

877
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,300
Wish I could light this here pipe.

878
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,000
They gave me all the frappy in the world.

879
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,760
And it's too cold to light this pipe.

880
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,440
Oh, Bob, where are you now?

881
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,020
Why did you leave me in the hands of me?

882
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:31,980
However, Bob will offer you eternal salvation or triple your money back.

883
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,740
Which unfortunately gives some the image in their minds of,

884
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,200
Bob.

885
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,160
Bob standing at the gates of hell handing out $60 checks.

886
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,340
Well, that's real funny.

887
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,540
I hope you boys are having a good time.

888
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:56,900
I bet you thought this old church thing of yours was going to be big, big fun, big barrel of laughs.

889
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,560
Oh, yeah.

890
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:08,200
I bet you thought you were going to be some kind of high school lawyer with that Bob fellow of yours.

891
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,480
Well, you're looking at a pretty damn long eternity.

892
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,200
Oh, by the way, here's that triple your money back.

893
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,700
That's what?

894
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,420
$60.

895
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,620
One for you, Smith.

896
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,880
One for you, Jones.

897
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,860
And don't let this deter you from doing business with us again.

898
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:32,320
Yeah.

899
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,100
Yeah.

900
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:33,480
Yeah.

901
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,220
Yeah.

902
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:34,700


903
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:34,940
Yeah.

904
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:35,900
Yeah.

905
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,000
Yeah.

906
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,000


907
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,020
Yeah.

908
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,180
Yeah.

909
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:37,720
Yeah.

910
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,060
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

917
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,380
Well, Dennis locked me in this little box.

918
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,460
I can't feel anything.

919
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,780
I can't see anything.

920
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,320
It's totally black.

921
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,820
I have no sensation in my hands.

922
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,680
I don't know if I'm moving or what.

923
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,080
I'm just in this little box.

924
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,860
He said I could talk to you.

925
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,900
He said you'd know what to do if you wanted to help me.

926
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,240
Oh, good.

927
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,080
Happy Peter Wellman.

928
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:57,640
I promise I'll pay you all the royalties that I didn't tell you about.

929
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,540
And whatever you want.

930
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,260
I mean, anything.

931
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,380
Tevis.

932
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,300
You can have Tevis.

933
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,360
Just get me out of this box, Wellman.

934
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,680
Please don't.

935
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,000
No.

936
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,160
Don't believe what Paul told you.

937
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,020
It's all a lie.

938
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,960
It's all a lie.

939
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,420
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

940
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,080
I'm sorry.

941
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,540
I let you out of the box, Wellman.

942
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,340
I can't.

943
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,820
This is a bad show, Wellman.

944
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,320
This is a real bad show.

945
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:27,360
She says she'd almost rather see me in Tevis than in nothing at all.

946
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,920
Bright, perky, almost psychedelic.

947
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,620
The Tevis line of fine men's undergarments.

948
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,440
Underwear you'll never change.

949
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,960
Sweet talk me all you want, but you'll never get me out of my Tevis.

950
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:50,160
And if you think that was bad, friends, you should be glad you didn't hear what was originally

951
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:58,400
on the end of this show, which was some music by DK Jones and myself, which unfortunately

952
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,360
had myself in it.

953
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:04,500
So to close out, let's go to some modern.

954
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,860
Goodyear pimps.

955
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,700
From the pimps.org.

956
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,580
The Pimps.org.

957
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:47,640
The Pimps.org.

958
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,540
The Pimps.org.

959
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,840
The Pimps.org.

960
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,980
The Pimps.org.

961
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,240
The Pimps.org.

962
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,920
The Pimps.org.

963
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,340
The Pimps.org.

964
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,100
They'll get you out of the jail, man, crickets, come on.

965
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,240
They'll open the bag, next to the bus, cheerleader, and pound.

966
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,760
They were jumping around, they don't like that cricket sound.

967
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:24,280
People freaking the pound, I'll get those bitches out, without a doubt.

968
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,520
That's when I heard the principal shout, hey, crickets, what you talking about?

969
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,580
Hey, crickets, hey, crickets.

970
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:35,500
They'll get you out of the jail, man, crickets, come on.

971
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,280
So if you're in a situation that you need to get up,

972
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,560
unleash your crickets and spite them around.

973
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,680
They'll create a distraction, and you can finally slip away.

974
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:54,020
Tell me one, one, who unleashed those crickets?

975
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:58,860
They'll get you out of the jail, man, crickets, what you talking about?

976
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,560
They'll get you out of the jail, man, crickets, come on.

977
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,100
They'll get you out of the jail, man, crickets, come on.

978
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,680
They'll get you out of the jail, man, crickets, come on.

979
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:14,060
They'll get you out of the jail, man, crickets, come on, crickets, come on.
