1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,960
And, had to just grab it, had to just grab the show, and do the sudden show, the unexpected, subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,700
Ah yes, so good, so good to do it all over again.

3
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,820
Ah yes.

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,320
Yes.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,460
Well, I certainly have a great ending for this show.

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,020
We can make it to the end.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:44,680
Yes, unexpectedly, regular normal human show, caught out of town, disasters happened, he couldn't make it.

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,700
We have to be on the air for another two hours.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,780
Now Will, you haven't called any, the ranger reader and told her to send anybody else down here.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,740
Good, good, okay.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,360
Because I,

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,680
I'm ready to preach, oh yeah.

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:06,560
This is my favorite time, my favorite kind of subgenius show, when, when you're like ovaries to the wall, you might say.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,260
He, he, he, he.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:18,120
Yeah, yeah, that's a, now let's see what we have in the show bag, this, the sudden panic stricken show bag.

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,160
See, I can't keep playing tapes of the subgenius convention.

17
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,180
Because, why?

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,560
There could be cursing and things like that.

19
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,540
And I know that my listeners would have their ears terribly offended to hear cursing.

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,420
But, let's see what kind of, oh there's some CDs.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,560
But, you don't want to hear those, they're just old acid rock stuff that I like to listen to.

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,660
Crazy.

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,100
Look at these tapes.

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,140
Little Wellmans we call them.

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,340
Little Wellman heads.

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,320
They run across the metal heads and bring a show.

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,280
I was just, I'm bathing in tapes, yes.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,740
Bathing in tapes.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,020
Oh, oh gosh.

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,540
And, and scripts.

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,080
Yes, we have plenty of scripts.

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:14,860
Um, and uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, are we ready?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,620
Are we?

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,720
Oh yes, I think so.

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,140
Oh.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,220
Oh.

38
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,600
Oh.

39
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,980
And you know, when in doubt on any subgenius show, play other subgenius shows.

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,180
Flowers and nice feelings.

41
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,760
I'll take an omelet.

42
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,700
And there are phylo drumming laying amidst the flowers.

43
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,020
I'll take a din for omelets.

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,480
What's that?

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,740
A couple orders of hash browns.

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,340
No, no, no, no, no.

47
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,820
Uh, some orange juice.

48
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,240
It's the band.

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,660
Some pancakes.

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,360
Okay.

51
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,100
Oh, mmm.

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,560
We're getting all this on tape somewhere.

53
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,580
Let's see.

54
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,460
Food, food monster.

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,040
What else?

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,600
Food monster.

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,220
What else do I want?

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,100
Oh, uh, some baby Hal dinosaur bacon.

59
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,480
Yeah.

60
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,700
Some, yeah.

61
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,900
Bacon made from the sides of the dinosaur.

62
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,160
Fresh, fresh hash.

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,620
Hal laid.

64
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,700
Wait a minute.

65
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,940
Oh, Hal laid the dinosaur?

66
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,440
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, they call their friends long distance and talk about nothing.

67
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,540
Hal laid the dinosaur?

68
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,900
Yeah.

69
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,540
It was cat laid.

70
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,160
Well, so what?

71
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,820
It was terminally ill with Sherman's disease.

72
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,100
I did it and I'm proud of it.

73
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,180
Was it a small, it must have been a rather small dinosaur.

74
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,220
It was a small, it was a small dinosaur.

75
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,300
The earth moved, let me tell you.

76
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,320
It was, well, I saw it.

77
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,960
It was really neat.

78
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,020
They were suspended by wires and the earth moved and they fell right in.

79
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,060
It was on PBS and it was on national public access channels.

80
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,500
Well, did the dinosaur move or did she just lay there?

81
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,900
It was beautiful stop motion animation effects.

82
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,000
She lit up another cigarette and asked when it was going to start getting pretty fun.

83
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,100
That was afterward.

84
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,840
That was then.

85
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,760
This is now.

86
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,480
That was a mighty big cigarette.

87
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,640
Uncle Philo, you would have been proud.

88
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,840
Well, but you're now.

89
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,720
We gotta eat.

90
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,140
Well, you're a peppy now.

91
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,540
Well, I'm a peppy and I'm looking for my frappies.

92
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,940
Frappies.

93
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,620
I've been feeling mighty crappy.

94
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,460
Well, don't get frappy happy, Peppy.

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,780
Go over to Sappy's and get some more frappies.

96
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,640
And now we're taking that video tour of Dr. Drummond's house now.

97
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,740
And don't be grumpy or sleepy.

98
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,060
That's right.

99
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,620
Here's the beautiful little room where things twinkle and sparkle.

100
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,000
And look at that.

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,240
Look at that lady.

102
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,140
She's got two heads.

103
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,020
That's Cookie.

104
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,340
Oh, I'm sorry.

105
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,260
Oh, three heads.

106
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,780
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,120
Just ignore the other two.

108
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


109
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


110
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


111
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


112
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


113
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


114
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,760
That's what I always do.

115
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,420
Yeah.

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,540
Well, we've been dragging Ivan Stang from show to show here on Earthly, so we hope he'll

117
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,700
come out here soon and do the same thing.

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Please, Sappy, help me.

119
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,980
Please pick them up by me.

120
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,260
I hope they will.

121
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,120
Please, Dr. Drummond, you're the only one who can help.

122
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,440
Help us get the other show.

123
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,700
You have to help me, Dr. Drummond.

124
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,680
Pick that chain off your ankle, boy.

125
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,800
Help, please.

126
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,140
I can't do it myself.

127
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,820
You have to free yourself.

128
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,060
I can't do anything.

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,980
We need you.

130
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,100
Now is the time to get out of here.

131
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,100


132
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,100


133
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,100


134
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,100


135
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,100


136
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,100


137
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,100


138
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,060
We have the time with the brain is the most likely to float at the farthest distance

139
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,060


140
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,380
Most people die at this hour.

141
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,540
They're not where you are, but at what time it is here.

142
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,740
These are the hours when the human organism is...

143
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,200
It's too early on Saturday.

144
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,520
It's too early when we can start recording time yet.

145
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,620
Yes, it's true.

146
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Poodzilla is going to punish you.

147
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,380
He went all the way to the third year.

148
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,140
You think you could wake up Poodzilla for us?

149
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,260
Excuse me?

150
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,040
Wake up Poodzilla?

151
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,020
Poodzilla, yeah.

152
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,000
We'd like Poodzilla to be on the show with us.

153
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,220
Just look out.

154
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,300
Look out, Poodzilla.

155
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,360
Woo!

156
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
You share this with us.

157
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,080


158
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,080


159
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,080


160
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,080


161
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,080
magic moment. Come on, don't do that. It scares Gary.

162
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,500
I'm really, playfully trying to get us to awaken right now.

163
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,800
Nause on my stomach.

164
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,360
Well, actually, there is a dark side to this phone call. I guess it's time to tell you

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,420
now. We've come for your first born.

166
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,080
Oh, you have? Okay, well, here she is. Take her.

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,580
Well, Dr. Howell, put her in the back of the car.

168
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,400
Put her back there, Mrs. Andy.

169
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,500
That's a human being, Hal.

170
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,900
Either once a week, in water or daily.

171
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,340
Okay. Her water daily, or?

172
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,940
Hal's never touched a real person before.

173
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,520
Well, that's because this is the show of the submen.

174
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
Isn't it about time for your yearly ski adventure?

175
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,060
To tell?

176
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,740
Yeah.

177
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,580
Bob ain't paying you to lay a bed all day, is he?

178
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,580
Yeah, I'm actually being paid to lay here right now.

179
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,260
Friends, the slack comes true. Bob's promise comes true. You hear that?

180
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,340
Philo Drummond is...

181
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,740
I'm paid to lay in bed sleeping!

182
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,100
Actually, they'll pay me more when I get out.

183
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,880
Oh. That's no fun.

184
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:27,920
Hello?

185
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,900
Well, you know what they say...

186
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,180
Wait, they're not here. It's old show.

187
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,760
One man's bummer is another man's beautiful thing.

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,140
Hi, man. It's beautiful.

189
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:44,420
My friend, we shall dominate you, dear listener, as we have dominated others of your species.

190
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,840
There's no escape.

191
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,040
Okay.

192
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,560
You can only do your duty.

193
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,700
It... It was me give up on it anyway.

194
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,740
But you know, friends...

195
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,080
You start talking about that weird stuff. You start... start talking about...

196
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,540
The neither forces. You might end up summoning some of them things.

197
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,560
Yeah, we... we subgenius ministers here found out there's some things you just...

198
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,800
don't play around with.

199
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,360
You don't start messing with somebody else's religion, they say.

200
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,620
But you start messing with the elder gods, friends.

201
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,260
You... you stir up forces.

202
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,140
Suddenly, everything's going wrong.

203
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,700
What you gonna do about it, boy?

204
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,700
What you gonna do to get straight?

205
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,680
Not much you can do if you get everything out of... out of balance.

206
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,420
You thought it was real funny, didn't you?

207
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,240
Thought you'd go and pull the devil's leg, eh?

208
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,440
Well, go ahead, son.

209
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,580
Yeah, it's funny. Funny big joke.

210
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,500
Let's go... go ahead, little girl.

211
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,420
Let's go spray paint funny pictures on tombstones.

212
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,040
Let's go make a fake bleeding head of Arnold Palmer head and launch it.

213
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,400
Let's go set up a Bob altar and worship for ages.

214
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,900
Yeah, aliens!

215
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,740
Ah, let's do that worshiping, dear friend.

216
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,580
Worship for some aliens.

217
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,580
And... you know, it can be done.

218
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,680
We do it all the time here in Dallas, Texas.

219
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,900
Worshiping for them aliens.

220
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,180
Or...

221
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,700
as it sayeth here in...

222
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,900
Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon.

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,660
I picked up this ancient manuscript and dusted it off.

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,260
Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?

225
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,620
You see, you gotta be careful, friends.

226
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,020
Who sees you listening to this radio program?

227
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,400
You gotta be careful who hears you listening to this radio program,

228
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,760
or sees you carrying a subgenius book out of the bookstore.

229
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,040
Because it has come around.

230
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,080
It's time it has come around, dear friends.

231
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,420
The penultimate do-it-yourself end times religion.

232
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,500
The Church of the Subgenius.

233
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,000
The Church of the Subgenius.

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000


235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,240
God's answer to fundamentalists.

236
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,940
Psychic ejaculations from the repressed nightmares

237
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,720
of a million gland mutants of the no age.

238
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,360
Beyond Satanism.

239
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,260
Yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

240
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,980
Just drop this show now.

241
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,820
Go into any orifice and watch it go, go, go.

242
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,840
Because the divine program from a source not of this world

243
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,960
can yet be known to mortals if, if they have enough money.

244
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,120
This incredible new faith authorized to blaspheme by the gods themselves

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,760
is the first all-purpose belief system to be compatible

246
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,980
with all major world religions.

247
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,840
And most weird fringe cults with a minimum of expensive interfaces or surgery.

248
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Brought to you by the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated.

249
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:57,040
Dulling the pain of existence in a world without slack since 1978.

250
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,300
I can't believe I'm listening to this show, you say.

251
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,120
No, we can't.

252
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,320
You tuned in because it sounded different.

253
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,920
And most other people, dullards and fools, avoided it for that very reason.

254
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,640
But maybe, just maybe, you are as different as this show is.

255
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,380
If so, then you are one of the chosen.

256
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,420
And this show falling into your ears was no accident.

257
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,300
In the hands of the others.

258
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,540
What you're hearing now.

259
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,560
What you're about to hear would be forbidden knowledge.

260
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,200
But for you, it's what you've always wanted.

261
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,220
What you've always deserved.

262
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,960
What you thought you could never have.

263
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,160
Something for nothing.

264
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,340
But this is real, friends.

265
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,820
And everything you know is true.

266
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,960
Bob is the proof.

267
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,360
And we may now proceed.

268
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:14,020
The prudes, prigs, weezers and weenuses, the superpatriots and fundamentalist fanatics

269
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,820
all think that there should be more religion in this country.

270
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,380
Well, have we got a religion for them.

271
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,620
The Church of the Soft Genius, dear friends.

272
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,900
The world's first industrial church building a new heaven and earth on the rubble of the old.

273
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,040
Scarier than the Old Testament and Scientology put together.

274
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,000
More needlessly complicated than the Kabbalah.

275
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,900
More vague and ambiguous than the I Ching or astrology.

276
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,260
More sheer brazen bull than even the Book of Mormon.

277
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,560
And yet infinitely more accurate than Project Blue Book and the Warren Commission report combined.

278
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,280
You, you, my friend, are now on the path of least resistance.

279
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,580
Be not afraid.

280
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,620
You have no choice.

281
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,500
Bob is coming.

282
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,840
And it is useless, useless to resist.

283
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,060
Just a closer look.

284
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,200
Just a closer look.

285
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,460
Ah, yes, yes.

286
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:40,920
We slow down now for an examination of some of the church services and activities that we like to offer you.

287
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,100
Here in our special Church of the Subgenius religion.

288
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,980
Oh, dear Bob, let it be.

289
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,120
Let it be, let it be.

290
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,560
Let it be gospel missions.

291
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,160
That's one of the things we do in radio outreach.

292
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,360
That's what you're listening to right now.

293
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
The Church of the Subgenius radio outreach.

294
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,440
We offer bondage and discipline.

295
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,300
And, uh, devangelistic crusades.

296
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,920
Uh, sleeve jobs, prison work, and, uh, oh, excuse me.

297
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,360
Excuse me.

298
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,420
That's inappropriate music for prison work.

299
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,240
Oh, here we go. That's better.

300
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,140
Youth counseling, conspiracy infiltration, dominance training.

301
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,820
Did I say youth counseling?

302
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,660
I really enjoy the youth counseling.

303
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,220
A television ministry, which we're working on.

304
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,120
Whipping, especially with the riding crop.

305
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,460
Quirt, a taws, et cetera.

306
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:46,540
Tent meetings, high heels, seances, nipple piercing, faith healing, acu-meeting, alien contact.

307
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,300
See? See? We offered.

308
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,660
I told you, I heard you heard earlier in the show.

309
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,300
Alien contact.

310
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,280
Tantric deviant technology.

311
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,800
Sacrificial knife wielding.

312
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,680
If you're doing a sacrifice wield, we'll be glad to wield that blade for you.

313
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:07,840
Fortunes told, dirty phone talk, techno magic talismans, industrial sales predictions, uh, for your business.

314
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,000
Uh, sex hurt therapy.

315
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,080
That's not to be confused with hemorrhoids.

316
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,380
That's just sex hurt therapy.

317
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,180
Holistic brain watching.

318
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,340
The invocation of the dread powers of earth, water, fire, and air.

319
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,840
Now, now, that's something, that's rather expensive and kind of dangerous.

320
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,780
Uh, but, uh, many of you have heard of it.

321
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:32,760
Many people ask for the French prescriptions, and of course, everybody wants the answers and the miracles.

322
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,680
And you can get those by sending a free, for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

323
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,680
Uh, just a self-addressed stamped envelope will be all we need at Post Office Box.

324
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,520
Got that pencil ready?

325
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:53,280
Post Office Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

326
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,420
Ah, yes.

327
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,700
And, uh, we welcome contributions of any kind.

328
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,420
Letters, artwork, photos, clippings, tapes, sin materials, flesh sacrifices, videotapes.

329
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,300
But what will really make us notice you is money.

330
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,620
To the station, of course.

331
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,280
Because what we're preaching is the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

332
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,520
As, uh, they, well, he's the high epop of the Church of the Subgenius.

333
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,860
The Church of Industriosexuals, dear friends.

334
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,980
Uh, uh, people who got so high on life that they had to enter a 12-step withdrawal program.

335
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,960
Uh, yes.

336
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,480
But, you know, many people have asked us over the years, just how do I use this show?

337
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,220
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

338
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,440
And, well, it works just about exactly like the, the Bible.

339
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,640
Or any holy book or radio show that's worth a buoy.

340
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,140
Uh, you can find something in it to excuse you for anything.

341
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,460
Or to prove any point.

342
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,140
Indeed, uh, any, any number of mutually contradictory points.

343
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,420
It can be used to prove that the Earth was created only 4,000 years ago.

344
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,380
Or that it was never created at all.

345
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,740
Or it can show, dear friends, that all subgeniuses are misogynists who secretly believe in Jesus.

346
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,120
Or it can, uh, show that they're all feminists that are really serving Jesus.

347
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,960
They're all, uhh, react она бы как хухлом

348
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:38,300
Or the [? kingdom, obviously, that miъ notebook

349
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,300


350
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,940
Come on, ladies.

351
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,200


352
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,800
You gotta, uh,rez love of you, of, um, higher, um, qualms your59

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,860
Uh, press Milling Un Silicon 그

354
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:57,040
beyond even a bulldada. None of these are incorrect uses of the subgenius materials,

355
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,160
and in fact, you might someday need to use them in court. It doesn't matter what you tell others

356
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,680
about it, as long as you remember that those are only functions of the show, of the book,

357
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,780
of the church. Never forget their true nature as revealed by these three basic underlying facts.

358
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:21,180
Number one, this is not a parody. Number two, there is not a single contradiction anywhere in

359
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:28,000
our teachings. And number three, there is only one real interpretation, the literal one.

360
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:36,220
And to conspiracy-blinded doubters, dear friends, this church might at first just appear like

361
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,700
nothing more than a parody. That's understandable. I mean, after all, most people think that man

362
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,760
either evolved to be a god or a godless person. But that's not the case. It's not the case.

363
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:43,760


364
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:50,140
A man was born from apes or was created by a god, and they actually believe what they see on the news.

365
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,780
So we can hardly expect such a gullible species to distinguish Dobbs' truth from the morass of

366
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:04,940
false belief that they wallow in. We repeat, friends, subgenius teachings contain no elements

367
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,020
of parody. We might try for comedy relief now and then, but generally what we're preaching,

368
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,100
everything is meant exactly as written.

369
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:20,180
It's plain, it's blunt, maybe too blunt for the polished sensibilities of the modernist,

370
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,000
but don't you bother to search between the lines because there's nothing there.

371
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,100
Nothing there.

372
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,240
No interpretation is necessary.

373
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,980
Save yourself the trouble.

374
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,520
Just believe.

375
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:39,220
Trust in the bald, naked, stark word as it stands.

376
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,780
Ah, yes, dear friends.

377
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,820
Trust in Bob exactly as he stands there in front of you

378
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,360
because, you know, there's a lot of these weird, bogus churches around these days.

379
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,300
We're not one of them, although we might have inadvertently spawned most of them.

380
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,300
They're just making fun of organized religion or fringe cults.

381
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,440
None of them go the distance.

382
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,380
They don't cross the line and become replacements for those things.

383
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,480
Who can blame them?

384
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,500
Who can blame them?

385
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,520
It's dangerous as hell on this conspiracy mud world.

386
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,960
Uh, parodies, fine.

387
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,700
Oh, yeah, it can be clever and witty and so forth,

388
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:29,520
but, you know, it can rarely impart the seriously disturbing truth that we want to bring to you, dear friends.

389
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,380
It's that funny stuff can't...

390
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:41,380
It can't resonate with hidden, buried knowledge too hideous to apprehend in normal.

391
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,200
consciousness.

392
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,780
Oh, we'll try to develop a sense of the blackest, blackest humor, oh yeah,

393
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,380
along with a bunch of other glands,

394
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,320
but only as one of many buttresses, many reinforcements that allow you

395
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:05,220
to enter that toughened yet delicately balanced state of mind

396
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,420
wherein you can bear to hold the otherwise

397
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,460
unthinkable thoughts.

398
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,260
And that's where the other religions fail, dear friends.

399
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,160
The first part of your mind that they start eating away at is the sense of humor,

400
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,540
and when that goes, any possibility of maintaining perspective in your view of the world vanishes.

401
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,560
That's why they're so stupid.

402
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,300
They lose sight of the basics, just keep trying to force the natural contradictions of life

403
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,060
into making some sort of sense, and that is the ultimate folly.

404
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,060
Any apparent contradictions that you might find in these teachings, in this religion,

405
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,420
are precisely what allow it to operate.

406
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,300
Ah...

407
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Life itself is contradictory.

408
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,820
It prolongs itself for the most ridiculous reasons.

409
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,100
It fuels its own turmoil.

410
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,020
Contrariness is the one trait common to all the gods and all their creations.

411
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:29,300
The immutable rule is that for every nanosecond of pleasure and joy that the gods grant you,

412
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:36,800
there will, of necessity, be an equal and opposite nanosecond of pain.

413
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,620
There is no way to escape this fact of the universe.

414
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:52,480
However, through Bob, you can learn to amplify the pleasure energies,

415
00:22:52,680 --> 00:23:03,860
and to turn down the volume, we might say, on the pain as sensed and as reflected by you.

416
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,200
Ha ha ha ha ha.

417
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,940
I exist because the world's in my...

418
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,420
In my telephone, yes.

419
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,400
Well, actually, the church only exists because we have the paperwork on it right here.

420
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,620
Do you want the church to close me up?

421
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,180
Thank you.

422
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,860
My mouth works, therefore I am.

423
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,920
Well, I think I'm going to go out and stoke up the old wood fire.

424
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,460
I'll be back in just a few minutes with some tips on your future...

425
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,340
Yeah, let's be putting on some bogus live stuff and go out on the roof, boy.

426
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,620
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

427
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,780
Kiln fired an edible 25-year-old.

428
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,500
It's a 24-calorie silver.

429
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,460
Mm-mm, wish I was there now.

430
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,640
Never, never before in human history has the Pope, McKinley, Hardy, Coolidge, Dobbs, Mint,

431
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,220
not a U.S. government body, commissioned such a rarity.

432
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,180
Delicious and crackling with a cooked skin of prepared edible material.

433
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,700
I think about it.

434
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,600
I think about it.

435
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,180
I think I'll have one right now.

436
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,620
Well, I'll bet you have.

437
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,200
And they grow into the same kind of animal as I do.

438
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,040
He says he knows you, Doctor.

439
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,420
Well, let's tune in on the monitor over here and see exactly who that is that's calling.

440
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,740
Can you see me?

441
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,140
Yes.

442
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,900
Yes, we see you and it's disgusting.

443
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,220
And I'm bringing the mirror close to my nose.

444
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,220
Oh, it's great, Doctor.

445
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,480
Do you know who you're listening to?

446
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:13,980
Yes.

447
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,420
Which is the new voice?

448
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,160
People like your mother and father.

449
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,920
The new voice is the last voice that I heard.

450
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,700
Have human babies.

451
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,060
That does make sense.

452
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,180
There's the new voice again.

453
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,880
Must be one of those sub-dini hierarchical figures.

454
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,700
He knows all the passwords and the secret jokes, so let's send him a new cartoon by

455
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,520
Stang and Stanley.

456
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,800
Which one?

457
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,680
Which one?

458
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,600
It's either, I think it's, I'm going to take a wild guess.

459
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,440
It's Pope Meyer.

460
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:36,760
Pope Meyer.

461
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:36,760


462
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:36,760


463
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:36,760


464
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:36,760


465
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:36,760


466
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:36,760


467
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:36,760


468
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,100
That's pretty wild.

469
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,820
That's pretty wild.

470
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,580
That does seem wild.

471
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,540
South, south, go south.

472
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,600
Go south, go south.

473
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,900
It's Terry Thornley.

474
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,360
No, not, farther south.

475
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,280
Farther south.

476
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:46,660
Farther south.

477
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,060
Farther south and out of the country.

478
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,480
Oh, it's Robert Vesco?

479
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,200
Yes.

480
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,820
For the info.

481
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,220
You know, the same old people.

482
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Go to the London Grill.

483
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,020
We'll be doing our show from there.

484
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,000
You will?

485
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:58,960
Yeah.

486
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,380
You'll be on Friday night?

487
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,540
Your show's going to be from there?

488
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,480
Yeah, it's going to be from the London Grill in Santa Cruz on Friday night.

489
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,500
It's going to be a remote.

490
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,700
It's really a walk-through.

491
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:06,780
It's a remote.

492
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:06,780


493
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:06,780


494
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,320
I'll guarantee you find the London Grill in Santa Cruz and we will be broadcasting

495
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,580
from there on Friday night.

496
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,020
Then don't you do anything but bow your head and kiss your penny that you even know about

497
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,240
it.

498
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,960
You got the little white stuff you put on your nose so it doesn't chip in?

499
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,520
Are you people pro-capital punishment?

500
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,620
That's the white stuff you put in your nose.

501
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,200
I want the white stuff you put on your nose.

502
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,400
No, I asked if you were pro-capital punishment or amateur capital punishment.

503
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,760
We're amateur capital punishment.

504
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:36,760


505
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,480
I'm not pro-capital punishment or kill me.

506
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,580
Do you think capitals ought to be punished, Dr. Kebrogsram?

507
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,080
Well, you can always get your parents to call in.

508
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,860
Miniature puterine reproductions authenticated by the Royal Court at The Hague and sent to

509
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,960
you in moisture-resistant styrofoam chests of the front door letter slots of the subgenius

510
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,820
36 most beloved characters.

511
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,060
Don't blow into the microphone, young man, if you wish to receive a beautiful hug and

512
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,620
figurine.

513
00:25:59,740 --> 00:25:59,800
It's Candy Frappi.

514
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,980
It's Frappi Candy.

515
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:01,780
Stop.

516
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,160
Eh?

517
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,440
You're both right.

518
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,440
Introducing new Candy Frappi Frappi Candy.

519
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,760
It's Candy Frappi.

520
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,860
It has stripes and stripes and stripes of colors, colors, colors, colors, and colors.

521
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,700
Colors that go below infrared and way above ultraviolet.

522
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,640
And the taste?

523
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah, you're Frappi Candy.

524
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,720
Candy Frappi.

525
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,640
Well, I can see these two don't need any words or worms for several days now, I should say,

526
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:21,940
I think.

527
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,960
So don't forget, that's new Candy Frappi Frappi Candy.

528
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,340
Now with extra dimension Love Hamster 16.

529
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,100
Habitual not included.

530
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,580
Tell Jeff and all your Acer friends this one's the beans for maximum best fun.

531
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,460
Candy Frappi Frappi Candy from Squid Go.

532
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,680
The go-be-boppy.

533
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,360
people.

534
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,680
I'm Dr. Zhivago. Yes, a special Blue Ribbon

535
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,560
advisory panel will ensure that the Foundation's Council

536
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,540
is certificated and inscribed insignia as approved

537
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,460
by Dobbs, Master of Heralds, before the

538
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,860
application deadline. No way.

539
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,360
So the potential guests on this show...

540
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,120
Well, we are the potential guests. So wait a minute.

541
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,020
What we've got to do is concentrate on those potential guests,

542
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,620
and you can stay with us for right now.

543
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,460
Now, Doctor, I think we should return to the basic finances

544
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,560
of the Church, and just who owns the Church, and what we can do

545
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,900
with what's left of the Church. Right.

546
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,120
Well, Ivan's staying no longer owns the Church.

547
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,600
Bob still has the Foundation, but we've got papers on there.

548
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,700
Hold on here. Hold on. Wait a minute.

549
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,640
What we also can talk about, of course, is

550
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,460
what we can do with the Church now that

551
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,200
what's left is still here, and breathing.

552
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,540
Well, we could give it away, or we could

553
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,840
just let someone take the Church for a spin.

554
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,940
See, what I think is, people don't realize that the Church

555
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,460
takes two rooms to keep and grow

556
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,520
in your house. At least two. And the maintenance

557
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,180
involved takes up most of the week anyway.

558
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,500
And it does not run on unleaded. I'm sorry.

559
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,580
So...

560
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,460
You want the Church. If you don't have

561
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,080
at least two good-sized rooms in your house...

562
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,860
Yes, at least two good-sized rooms, and

563
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,580
a lot of money.

564
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,520
And a lot of... And neighbors that don't mind

565
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,260
Wotan showing up in the middle of the night.

566
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,040
Right, and you need stamps and gummage.

567
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,440
Get the idea?

568
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,920
Or kill me!

569
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,760
Or kill me!

570
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,920
Now!

571
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,400
And the guy, it got to the point where

572
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,480
the guy he was bothering pulled out

573
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,920
a .32 and let him have it.

574
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,020
And at which point

575
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,420
the bullet hit him square in the chest

576
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,040
and went through his lung

577
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,620
and came out his back.

578
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,140
But instead of

579
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,560
falling on the ground,

580
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,180
he walked back in the bar and ordered a drink.

581
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,480
Get the idea?

582
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,740
Or kill me!

583
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,960
Now! Now!

584
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,720
Let's have a body count!

585
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,300
Let's have a body count!

586
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,420
None dead, it's a miracle!

587
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,700
Friends, it's a miracle!

588
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,500
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

589
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,340
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

590
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,580
Pretty intense sequence there.

591
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,660
From the KPFA subgenius show.

592
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,600
Wait a minute, what's coming up?

593
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,000
Yes, lots of stamps and gummage.

594
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,540
Yeah, lots of stamps and gummage.

595
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,000
Puzzling evidence subgenius show there.

596
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,660
More than an hour less than a show

597
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,140
from KPFA in Berkeley.

598
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,260
Starring Dr. Howell,

599
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,600
Puzzling Evidence,

600
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,880
and on this particular show,

601
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,060
Gary Brogfran and G. Gordon Gordon.

602
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,680
And I don't know who else

603
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,540
because it's

604
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,960
it's that other show.

605
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,560
This particular show,

606
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,680
is of course the subgenius radio ministry,

607
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,360
Hour of Slack.

608
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,900
Ah, yes.

609
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,620
Preaching the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs

610
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,160
rather unexpectedly on the radio here tonight.

611
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,640
Filling in for what would normally be

612
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,720
an hour of Celtic music.

613
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,460
And instead,

614
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,540
while those poor folks are having to listen

615
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,580
to the preachings of

616
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,580
that man J.R. Bob Dobbs,

617
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,640
you're actually, well, you never hear his voice.

618
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,340
All right.

619
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,700
He sounds a little like Paul Freese,

620
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,640
the announcer.

621
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,880
But the preachers,

622
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,540
Bob the trance,

623
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,460
dictates of his message,

624
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,140
the original early apostles.

625
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,780
Ah, yes.

626
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,720
Of that man.

627
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,080
Who was it we were talking about?

628
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,940
What was that religion?

629
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,840
Dawn, praise Dawn.

630
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,100
Was that what they were saying?

631
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,680
I don't know.

632
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,460
It doesn't really matter.

633
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,900
But I should mention to you loving Christians

634
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,500
out there who want to kill us,

635
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,760
look, we're for peaceful coexistence.

636
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,760
You worship a dead guy on a stick,

637
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,300
we worship a chopped off head

638
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,500
that gets hit with a stick.

639
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,220
Isn't that enough common ground?

640
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,260
I mean, we're not really that far apart

641
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,220
if you think about it.

642
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,240
You've got your vindictive crybaby,

643
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,240
busybody, schoolmarm, prig Jesus.

644
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,120
We've got our fighting Jesus

645
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,380
and our weird Jesus

646
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,800
and our quarterback Jesus.

647
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,240
And Jesus and a whole bunch more besides.

648
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
And Jesus is just like Bob.

649
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,500
They don't want to kill anybody,

650
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,700
but merely to lead them.

651
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,760
As shepherds lead their flocks,

652
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,820
fattening them,

653
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,040
ha ha, yes, for the harvest.

654
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,700
You don't want you to believe in them.

655
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,940
Because they don't want you to know

656
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,340
what they're doing to you.

657
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,360
And that's exactly why we do

658
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,540
believe in those particular gods, friends.

659
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,360
Because somebody has to fight back

660
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,060
to defy or at least try to negotiate

661
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,920
with these gods, these dark, dark gods.

662
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,160
On the other hand, you know,

663
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,100
every time they're mentioned,

664
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,360
they become more powerful.

665
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,040
And here we are spreading their names

666
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,220
far and wide, happily as can be.

667
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,060
I don't know, maybe we shouldn't have brought this up.

668
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,400
Uh...

669
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,360
But whatever you do, kids,

670
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,580
just don't lift up that trap door

671
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,320
and chant, uh, chant

672
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,120
Yog-sa-thoth three times.

673
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,000
Flood happened, I always said.

674
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,320
Help me now.

675
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,140
That one time.

676
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,740
Right to dear Dr. Animal...

677
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,880
Back when we were running, buddy.

678
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,160
I remember old Madoff.

679
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,880
He was quite a swinger.

680
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,540
He sure could tenderize my meat, though.

681
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,320
Yeah.

682
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,580
Yeah.

683
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,460
Yeah.

684
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:56,740
Yeah.

685
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,980
Pass me some of that coffee.

686
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,920
Yeah, I need some of that coffee.

687
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,600
Pass me some of that coffee over here.

688
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,320
Hey, would someone hand me a gun, please?

689
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,320
Sure, here.

690
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:05,780
Here, here.

691
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,100
Thanks, thanks.

692
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,880
Aren't you down just a little bit

693
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,320
right out there?

694
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,160
Here's what there?

695
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,960
It's rather light out there.

696
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,940
Yes, it's rather 530.

697
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,300
...fire from the submarine

698
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,660
or even from across the ocean.

699
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,120
Gives no warning.

700
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,780
You have a few seconds

701
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,580
to take cover.

702
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,040
Ah, yep.

703
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,160
Before the heavy shock wave...

704
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,220
And the war's going on,

705
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,520
and right now, Ivan and Hal

706
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,260
have gone forward,

707
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,020
and they're firing rifles

708
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,500
into the street,

709
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,520
trying to scare away...

710
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,940
...heavy piece of furniture available.

711
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,580
Oops, sorry, yeah.

712
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,580


713
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,580


714
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,580


715
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,580


716
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,880
Well, if none is available...

717
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,380
They're spilling the really hot coffee

718
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,640
on the people trying to stop us

719
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,440
from getting to our cars

720
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,100
at the end of the show.

721
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,360
...along the side of the wall

722
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,680
and out of the window

723
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
to avoid flying glass.

724
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah, the little listeners out there

725
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,340
who've now stopped listening

726
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,320
or calling because they see

727
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,940
that we're calling,

728
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,720
all of our friends.

729
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,000
...and cover your cranium

730
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,820
with their own boots.

731
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,120
...pain.

732
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,040
We did try to call...

733
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,880
...pain is right.

734
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,020
We tried to call Cleve Duncan

735
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,120
to find out his real name,

736
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,220
and we called Sterno,

737
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,380
and he got blown up,

738
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,320
and then Buck hung up on us,

739
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,680
and you were next.

740
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,920
...Cleve Duncan's real name.

741
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,560
What?

742
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,560


743
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,560


744
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,380
Alfred E. Newman.

745
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
Oh, yo!

746
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,860
What does the E stand for?

747
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,280
What does the E really stand for

748
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,680
in that?

749
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,900
E equals M C squared.

750
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,000
Newman?

751
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:13,980
Newman.

752
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,180
Alfred E equals M C squared.

753
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,460
That's Newman's line.

754
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:16,700
Newman.

755
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,540
The Newman.

756
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,480
Not the old Newman.

757
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,040
Yes, it's always Newman.

758
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,800
Cleve Newman.

759
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,100
Uh-oh, the show silliness

760
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,020
has washed over in here.

761
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,360
Wee, wee, wee,

762
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,220
wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee...

763
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,740
Let me go.

764
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,400
I don't know.

765
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,360
I think I'm a lasagna.

766
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,540
You're a lasagna.

767
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:31,540


768
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:31,540


769
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,440
Cicada, and...

770
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,240
No, I don't think so.

771
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,860
...Linguine, and...

772
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,500
What about pasta?

773
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,520
I think the medicine is taking effect now.

774
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,600
Yeah, it's now encoding.

775
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,360
...Twenty cc's of pure methyl-libri-coat.

776
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,740
The glazed.

777
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,120
I'm not using that stuff again.

778
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,420
Glazed.

779
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:45,420


780
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,500
I'll take two of the glazed

781
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,580
and the cream-filled eclair.

782
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,420
Hey, we'll meet you over at

783
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:48,780
Scooby and Izzy's

784
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,220
Dr. Drum is now smoking...

785
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,360
...the esophageal capital.

786
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,200
...an essence of pure human soul.

787
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,200
This is how a subgenius minister

788
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,540
begins his day.

789
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,340
There goes that soul.

790
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,520
With one swift excision,

791
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,520
the soul is plumped

792
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:01,520


793
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,900
into a gleaming porcelain laboratory pan.

794
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,660
Now I feel real again.

795
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,680
The skull is kept as a trophy.

796
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,540
And the body is added to the munch.

797
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,000
It's worn around your neck.

798
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,020
You still wearing that skull?

799
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,520
It's one of my most prized possessions.

800
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,540
Oh, another little collar.

801
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,040
Something my boyfriends will want

802
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,740
and my girlfriends will secretly admire.

803
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,840
We're trying to push away the skulls in the spring.

804
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,700
Yep.

805
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,440
These skull farmers have brought you the finest skulls

806
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,220
in a long tradition of service.

807
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
If you want, give Robert service.

808
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,220
And if you don't believe that, I got a bridge to sell you.

809
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,500
Missouri skull farmers.

810
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,120
You know these kids nowadays can't farm a skull worth a hoot.

811
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,360
You gotta hold that skull down before you water it up.

812
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,380
You just gotta hole a hole and drop it in and farm it up.

813
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,860
You gotta actually get down in that furrow

814
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,880
and make physical love to the earth in order to seed it.

815
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,740
And then look what a nervous beast.

816
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,420
The children of the hyena.

817
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,060
Dangerous teeth.

818
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,460
Oh, I'm sorry that Philo Drummond wasn't here

819
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,560
when we were squeezing earlier

820
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,140
because I'm sure his sheer force would have helped the show

821
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,360
work behind it better.

822
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,340
You gotta hold that thing down.

823
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,700
You gotta hold that thing down.

824
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,460
Listen at them drums.

825
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,360
I'm the battle of the, I'm the battle of the,

826
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,640
I'm the battle of the, I'm the battle of the.

827
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,680
Well, I had a fight with my baby.

828
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,600
She just didn't understand.

829
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,540
So I left that old homestead.

830
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,340
Sit down.

831
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,840
I'm there for a foreign land.

832
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,700
Four cats out in the stormy sea.

833
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,880
I said, man, oh man, here's the enemy.

834
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,360
Listen at them drums.

835
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,720
Yeah, listen at them drums.

836
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,940
I just knew that I wasn't gonna.

837
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,400
But then in my final prayer,

838
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,840
I was topped up high and dry

839
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,160
on an island from nowhere.

840
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,260
The sand was cool, kind of soft at night.

841
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,620
I said, that's my soul.

842
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,580
I'm in paradise.

843
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,920
Listen at them drums.

844
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,420
Yeah, listen at them drums.

845
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:01,420


846
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,280
Listen at them drums.

847
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:02,960
Listen at them drums.

848
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,900
Then an owl went by my noggin.

849
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,980
Psst, I flipped over quick to see.

850
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,040
Made it caps with foes and fear.

851
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,880
That owl was meant for me.

852
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,940
In perfect English, the leader said.

853
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,040
Pardon me, old chap.

854
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
I must have your head.

855
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,000
Ain't hunting.

856
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,240
Please leave me alone.

857
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,080
I said, ain't hunting.

858
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,240
Please leave me alone.

859
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,720
I had a baby calling.

860
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,560
And I gotta go home.

861
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,420
Listen at them drums.

862
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,820
Listen at them drums.

863
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,220


864
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,500
Well, they tied me up to a palm tree.

865
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,540
And they started to dance around.

866
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,060
To the beat of a conga drum.

867
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,620
What a welcome, familiar sound.

868
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,680
It's then that I lost all my self control.

869
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,280
When I saw the head hunters do the rock and roll.

870
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,360
Listen at them drums.

871
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,820
Listen at them drums.

872
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,520
Well, I told myself from the palm tree.

873
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,220
I gave out with a wailing.

874
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:09,920
song. Them niggas got all shook up, cause I soon had them rockin' along. The leader clapped his hands and said,

875
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:20,400
Man, we dig you the most, now you can keep it in your head. Headhunters, please leave me alone. I said, Headhunters, please leave me alone.

876
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,600
Cause my baby need me, and I'm on my way home.

877
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:54,040
Uh, yes. Bored, confused, lonely, unloved. Weird? Bad? Not exactly a team player. Had enough? Have a nice day?

878
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:00,900
Tired of all that touchy-feely cosmic sweetness and light crap?

879
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:10,660
Do you get nearly irresistible urges to pound spikes into the eyes of namby-pamby gibbering religious nuts?

880
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:19,640
Do you hate everybody? Always known that there was something going on that they won't tell you about?

881
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:31,160
Do you find yourself wondering if existence is relevant? If God believes in you? If it's normal to be normal?

882
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:39,120
If reality should be what it is? If it's wrong to be happy? If health is a sin?

883
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,560
Do impure thoughts literally assail your being?

884
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,700
Are you more than ready to confront the dark side of your personality?

885
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,000
Are you constantly feeling the urgent need to abandon your hold on everything?

886
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,200
rational and indulge your abnormality?

887
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,700
Ever wanted to have crazed sex

888
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,140
with beautiful alien beings? Then this

889
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,100
may be for you. Or

890
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,220
do you think reason

891
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,840
can get you out of this holy hole

892
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,900
that your butt was dropped into? Are you driven to

893
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,660
cling in desperation to brittle shards of false

894
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,620
stability offered up by the artificial structure which

895
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,500
invisible institutions have imposed upon reality to

896
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,320
manipulate our lives?

897
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,540
When cold emotional trauma intrudes across

898
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,620
the backwash of your dreary life, does logic

899
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,560
that cold unforgiving language serve as your only solace?

900
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,660
Explaining the

901
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,280
vagaries of your otherwise inexplicable existence?

902
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,520
Driven, in short, to the very brink of

903
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,400
sanity by the conspiracy's false reality and the pressures of a

904
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,440
crumbling world? Then you may be in for a hell of a

905
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,360
pratfall on a cosmic banana peel. Slack

906
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,300
off while you still know how! Time is running

907
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:22,880
out!

908
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,520
They've already rounded

909
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,720
us up like cattle, herded us into forced slave labor camps and replaced our names with

910
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,900
urine test result numbers only most of us didn't notice because at the end of the day they

911
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,880
still let us clock out, go home to our cell blocks and punch in again for a few minutes

912
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,380
of quality time with the spouse and kiddies or the drugs and TV or all four. The takeover,

913
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,500
the domestication we believe they call it, happened so gradually, so quietly and so thoroughly,

914
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,500


915
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:04,640
that even if you happen to know who Bob Dobbs is, you might not really care. Of course,

916
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,400
there's considerable pressure on you from all sides, keeping you from caring whether

917
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,360
you care or not, and it's so much easier to just quit fighting it and do nothing but stand

918
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,140
there supporting that weight, rather than, uh, staggering around looking like an idiot

919
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:24,820
but at least trying to get out from under it. Ah, you're used to it, you can take it,

920
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,480
it's a living. You'll just go on about your own life and try to get over it if you want,

921
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:28,480


922
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:28,480


923
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:36,100
job doing as you're told getting along playing the game making the best of it why not nothing's left

924
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:44,860
elvis is dead john holmes is dead hendrix is dead the marlboro man has cancer love and kindness are

925
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:52,700
purchased commodities even the gay baby whales are endorsing big oil companies rock and roll is a

926
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:58,780
beer commercial punk is a hairstyle all the starving people in the world want back what they

927
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,380
think you took but you're supposed to work like a dog just to keep what you probably only think you

928
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:12,440
have you can't even die legally you can run but you can't hide ronald mcdonald and oliver north

929
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:19,440
are cultural heroes narco gusak bleats from every corner the beaver grew up and married his mom what

930
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,580
in creeping hell is going on the cop computer

931
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:29,300
are syncing up for the home stretch crackdown on all weirdness before 1998 you can't even tell a

932
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:35,220
damn joke anymore without some normality squad thought cop whining down your neck it's the new

933
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:45,460
hip puritans the scum lords the stud puppy p-boys frat brats the very cream of the crap that is the

934
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:52,380
failed genetic cesspool of doomed humanity and yet even while they

935
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:52,560
suck

936
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:58,840
shave off your wild hairs you find yourself reflexively thanking them for that spiritual

937
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:06,180
castration the amputation of your abnormality gland hey you paid good money and time for him

938
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:14,240
to do it you're damn well gonna enjoy it right well there is a hell all right friend and you're

939
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,380
already in it of course this is only the top floor of hell the easy part you know the hell

940
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,280
where you don't even know you're in

941
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,640
hell yet where when the demons start trying to tell you where you are you

942
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,740
think they're comedians doing satires

943
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:42,640
but everybody knows that you say oh yeah sure what's the difference everybody

944
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:52,260
knows and it's all this a bunch of a life's of b.tch and then you die to vo you've got it pal it's

945
00:43:52,260 --> 00:44:00,660
It's one big treadmill to nowhere, a cancer-ridden rat race around a sinking ship, a big-screen

946
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,120
corporate technicolored daisy chain.

947
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:10,500
You'll marry some bland, dependable entity and bear a brood of snot-faced, drug-snorting

948
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,700
brats who can't believe what a doddering dullard you are and can't wait to leave or kill you

949
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:22,400
as you sit there exhausted and trembling, sweating blood and staring at some mediocre

950
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,740
TV show, pondering your brain-wrenching degree of debt, desperately trying to drink yourself

951
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,620
into a stupor, wondering what the hell happened.

952
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,700
Well, by all means, go ahead, pal.

953
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,440
It's your soul.

954
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,920
We're getting pretty damn sick and tired of this crap ourselves, the way we were raised.

955
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,540
When habit be slaved.

956
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:51,540
Normalcy dupes start taking away your slack with their pro-social, fascio, humanist, whip-training

957
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,100
hammerlock systems and selling it back to you at a profit.

958
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,720
That's when the elect know to crank up the device and start splattering.

959
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:15,180
The normals, smug yuppies and po-bucker nutsies who are seemingly shopping in a blissful, self-sustained

960
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:15,560
ignorance.

961
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,600
All around you actually form a vast conspiracy against you.

962
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,980
It wouldn't be quite so bad if this conspiracy was trying to sell your soul only to the devil.

963
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,600
But they're bargaining with the anti-Satan, too.

964
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,140
And the stakes keep getting higher by the minute as X-Day approaches.

965
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:41,240
The big nosedive is already in progress and we'll all be needing shoots if we plan to

966
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,600
bail out in time.

967
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,580
We've reached the juncture in history.

968
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:50,920
At which two opposite, previously impossible things have suddenly become technologically

969
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,420
feasible.

970
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,640
The destruction of all higher life on Earth or infinite slack for everyone forever.

971
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,300
We can only pray that these are two different things.

972
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,360
However, it's never too early to start being bitterly pessimistic.

973
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,680
Unfortunately, belief in some old man in the clouds or a big Disneyland in the hereafter will never be the same.

974
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:15,680


975
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,260
It's not just a matter of time before you can finally get out of this wicked, wicked world.

976
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,300
Will you be ready?

977
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,600
Will you have an out when the whole thing blows?

978
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,940
Be not disheartened.

979
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,600
For there exists an underground resistance force.

980
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,740
An army of idiopathic deviates and angry mutations ready to help you lash out.

981
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,660
Pretending to obey the rules of the world.

982
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,960
They will obey by day like gorillas in a zoo.

983
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,680
But gorilla fighters by night and by coffee break.

984
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:59,220
These freedom fighters won't sell their obedience for nice cars, VCRs, furlough vacation trips,

985
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,120
or fantasy entertainment.

986
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,220
Nor will they trade it for a warm cage and three squares a day.

987
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,480
Nay, nay, my friend.

988
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,240
They continue to fight.

989
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,640
Or what was taken away will be taken away.

990
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:15,640


991
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,680
Only when they were born.

992
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,560
They're slack.

993
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,860
Thought slack.

994
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,180
Sex slack.

995
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,140
Medicinal slack.

996
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,100
All the slack.

997
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,220
Freedom of speech.

998
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,660
Freedom from work.

999
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,160
Freedom of religion.

1000
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,180
Yes, our religion. Only our religion.

1001
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:42,600
While the obedient Christians are content to drink the symbolic blood of their quitter god at the altar,

1002
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,160
our warrior priests demand the real thing.

1003
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,080
And guess whose blood it is.

1004
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:55,180
Oh, they call us fascists when we say things like that.

1005
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,320
And they're perfectly right.

1006
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,080
The conspiracy has hogged fascism for too long.

1007
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,320
We're taking it back.

1008
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,580
For the people.

1009
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,600
Where it belongs.

1010
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,240
The fascism for the people.

1011
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,720
Fascism for the individual.

1012
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,500
Join the party that is the rejection of all parties.

1013
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,420
Patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism.

1014
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,360
Every yard a queendom or kingdom.

1015
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,620
Every child and dog a serf.

1016
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,500
Every dad a duche.

1017
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,680
And every dinner on time.

1018
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:33,280
Abandon the corporate nation states and shop black market only.

1019
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,860
It's cheaper.

1020
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,360
Even the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

1021
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,780
I don't mind.

1022
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:46,780


1023
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:46,780


1024
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:46,780


1025
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,640
Ah, let's face it, dear friends.

1026
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,980
In an age when American corpo-merger capitalism,

1027
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,960
which is pretty much the same thing as the ol' communist party these days,

1028
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,080
is in a blinding, dizzying tailspin,

1029
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,520
the time is obviously ripe for a new faith!

1030
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,000
A new paradigm!

1031
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,280
A new prophet!

1032
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,220
One whose methods actually parallel

1033
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:15,620
parallel and parasitized the monolithic econoculture of the West, a religion based on pure capitalism,

1034
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:23,420
on the divine logic of supply and demand, but unfettered by conspiracy-implanted neuroses

1035
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,720
about what will sell.

1036
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:32,520
As J.R. Bob Dob said, offer it and they will buy.

1037
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:41,200
That religion is the church of the subgenius and that prophet, J.R. Bob Dob's avatar of

1038
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,820
slack, immaculator of the age.

1039
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:50,380
Praise Bob, his 999 system is here, born into this planet in the very nick of time as an

1040
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:57,280
equal opportunity, sin-as-sack religion for strange people, now a go-go mutant and descended

1041
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,340
masters.

1042
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,360
The newest post-ism-ism of tomorrow.

1043
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:08,600
The next to last movement ever, superseding all previous religious, scientific, political

1044
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,360
and artistic movements.

1045
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:18,680
Not theology, no sir ma'am, but the irony of vast improvisational spasmodic anti-social

1046
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:26,040
movement, whose definitively diverse members have in common only the quest for their own

1047
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,120
personal slack.

1048
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,540
Slack.

1049
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,320
Slack.

1050
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:32,320


1051
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:32,320


1052
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,420
The state in which you need nothing because you haven't already.

1053
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,280
And Bob brings slack without guilt, friends.

1054
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,520
Because you'll pay for it with no questions asked.

1055
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,300
Ah, yes.

1056
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,260
Praise Bob.

1057
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:32,360


1058
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:49,280
Yeah, he knew all the plot twists they were trying to grasp.

1059
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,880
Think you didn't elaborate on the exact sequence?

1060
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,100
Nah, I covered it.

1061
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,100


1062
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,100


1063
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:54,560
I've gotanut!

1064
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:54,560


1065
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,800
It'slenya that's teeth!

1066
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,580
I improved me little here!

1067
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,600
The entire planet is in danger.

1068
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,940
You just go ahead and do it, Mr. Subgenius.

1069
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,300
Oh, we're in it as deep as you.

1070
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,260
We took money for it.

1071
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,840
We know our souls are damned.

1072
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,880
Not much we can do now but try to stay so fropped up we don't think about it.

1073
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,160
Yeah.

1074
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:31,400
I frankly suggest, friend, that you may be in it too deep to do otherwise yourself.

1075
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,500
Pathetic Bobby.

1076
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,120
You're Bobby, ain't you?

1077
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,140
Thought you'd be cool.

1078
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,620
Thought you'd get in with the cool guys.

1079
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,060
Thought you'd live away.

1080
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,200
We're laughing at you, boy.

1081
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,340
B-O-B

1082
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,660
B-O-B

1083
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,740
B-O-B

1084
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,400
B-O-B

1085
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,080
B-O-B

1086
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,300
B-O-B

1087
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,240
B-O-B

1088
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,640
B-O-B

1089
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,040
B-O-B

1090
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,460
B-O-B

1091
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,140
B-O-B

1092
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,160
B-O-B

1093
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:04,160


1094
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:04,660
B-O-B

1095
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,080
B-O-B

1096
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,320
Watch in front of us blurs and distorts time.

1097
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,920
Soon we will be deep in a hypnotic trance.

1098
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,320
What wonders will we see?

1099
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:24,000
Hey kids, get some money out of your parents' wallet and send it to Bob.

1100
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:24,940
Here.

1101
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,860
Pull the lever, and you go.

1102
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,380
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the hour of slack.

1103
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,380
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

1104
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:43,360
living avatar of slack, and saint of saints on planet Earth.

1105
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,080
You have to love Bob.

1106
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,880
He loves you, but you love Bob.

1107
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,180
You have to.

1108
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,960
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

1109
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,900
He'll kill you.

1110
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,620
He'll bob you out.

1111
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,460
We're now deep inside the brain cavity of Doug Smith.

1112
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,020
As you can see all around you, they're sparking.

1113
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,640
There was a short circuit.

1114
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,700
Great.

1115
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,480
The brain seems to have recovered.

1116
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,220
There are sparking energy thoughts all around us.

1117
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,700
Far more than the normal human brain.

1118
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,680
But as we know, another misfire there.

1119
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,400
We know Doug Smith is not a normal human.

1120
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,620
No, and here inside the brain of Doug Smith,

1121
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,580
we can observe some of the differences that make this man

1122
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,680
a unique leader among men.

1123
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,400
Up in here in this corner are the memory bags.

1124
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:01,740
And over here is the main printout area.

1125
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,720
It is the Presidency of Greater ancestry,

1126
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:10,380
Hour ofexpansion KNON90 protoyin NINOL

1127
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:17,780
to be a good ...

1128
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,680
Radio ministry.

1129
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:21,680


1130
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,680
to turn on the machine.

1131
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,420
This is video Yerevan.

1132
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,220
My name is Franz Ivanovich Hagen,

1133
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,140
and this is the news.

1134
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,760
Thank you very much.

1135
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,700
The world is over now.

1136
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,420
You can return to your bed.

1137
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,160
Wow!

1138
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,980
We're trying.

1139
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,760
Well, we're not trying hard enough.

1140
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:43,960
Well, it's certainly great trying.

1141
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,460
Send us more money.

1142
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,640
Yeah, more money.

1143
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,700
How much would you like?

1144
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,300
$50,000, would you say that would do it?

1145
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,300
Checks in the mail.

1146
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,400
All right, thank you.

1147
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,140
You're welcome.

1148
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,260
Next caller, please.

1149
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:53,620
Go.

1150
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,440
We'll put on the automatic Bob Nelson.

1151
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,300
We'll put the automatic Bob Nelson on.

1152
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,100
Yes, okay.

1153
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,300
Where's my thesaurus?

1154
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,300
Ricky, Lucy.

1155
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,180
Here, Bob, here's your hat.

1156
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,140
Put this part on.

1157
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,260
Here we go.

1158
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,220
Now, get the automatic.

1159
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,900
Drive this station down Shattuck Avenue.

1160
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,160
We're going to stop.

1161
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,340
We haven't got a spare for this program.

1162
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,220
We don't have a jack for this program.

1163
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,660
We don't even have a hydraulic foil for this program.

1164
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,920
We're just going to drive

1165
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,660
until this program is over.

1166
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,480
This program is going to go and go and go.

1167
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,220
Welcome.

1168
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,980
I just want to say that Bob absolutely saved my life,

1169
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,560
and I'm so glad you're there.

1170
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,480
And I'm present at the Bill of Rights Club at Camp O'Fay Radio,

1171
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,300
so I'm going to write him a letter

1172
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,560
and tell him that you just aren't being treated like,

1173
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,440
like, like the good people you are.

1174
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,260
Goodbye.

1175
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,200
Thanks a lot, Mom, for calling and showing.

1176
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,620
And everything.

1177
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,660
Some of the mind control gone out of control.

1178
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,800
Some of the most basic things.

1179
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,560
They handed me this jar and said my brain was in it,

1180
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,980
and then when the police came, they poured it down the sink.

1181
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,380
He's been down to Bob's new subgenius.

1182
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,420
Well, what can we do for you, caller?

1183
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,280
Have you come to sing, entertain us,

1184
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,820
or do you have a parting question?

1185
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,440
I thought this weird thing, you see.

1186
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,820
You know how people often get reincarnated

1187
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,380
into this material plane, no matter how hard they try?

1188
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,540
Yeah, yeah, man.

1189
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,600
I must have committed suicide 300 times,

1190
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,600
and I keep ending up in the same lifetime

1191
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,000
in a slightly different observational universe.

1192
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:20,500
And I...

1193
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:20,980
Wow.

1194
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,600
I have to talk to you guys because...

1195
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,040
Yeah, man, that's really heavy.

1196
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,560
Yeah, it's deeper than I can handle.

1197
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,320
Whoa, just sling on us, man.

1198
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,720
I keep being born on October 21st, 1952,

1199
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,520
and I end up going through the same lifetime...

1200
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,480
Oh, well, okay, your problem is you got a bad case of the 50s.

1201
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,120
I've seen it.

1202
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,580
That grassy knoll just went around the country shooting people.

1203
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,660
There were 10 people there shooting that looked just like Terry Thornley.

1204
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,560
Got it, dead center.

1205
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,600
Terry Thornley!

1206
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,060
No!

1207
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:42,720
No!

1208
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,440
Terry Thornley!

1209
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,600
Yes, he was the guest that scared everybody.

1210
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,500
Even the other...

1211
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,000
No, no, no!

1212
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,600
Even the other stations were scared by Terry Thornley.

1213
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,460
Oh, my God.

1214
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,360
Is he going to be at your convention?

1215
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:52,900
Oh, yes.

1216
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,740
Oh, good.

1217
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,180
And here he is now, Gary Gibrofram,

1218
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,220
a little Doug Smith in the PE class.

1219
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,900
No, no, my name is Welton.

1220
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,560
Here they are doing push-ups in the shower.

1221
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,580
There's no water coming out of these showers, Doug.

1222
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,940
Just this funny smell of gas.

1223
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:07,760
No, no, no.

1224
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,420
Don't worry about those.

1225
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,180
That's the P of V.

1226
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,040
That's not water coming out of those showers.

1227
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,900
Wait, how the water affects...

1228
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,920
That's church air.

1229
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,060
Yeah, funny thing.

1230
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:15,860
Really tough hombre.

1231
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,120
Don't forget to use your drift meter.

1232
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,380
The music has gone and the mucus is up.

1233
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:20,660
Oh.

1234
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:20,880
Oh, no.

1235
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:21,800
Hello.

1236
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,580
We're really testing callers this morning.

1237
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:23,900
Good morning.

1238
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:24,460
Good morning.

1239
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,380
Are you man or woman enough to take the church?

1240
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,080
Yes.

1241
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:29,640
As a matter of fact,

1242
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,120
we're planning the overthrow of the convention.

1243
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,400
Ah, that's what we like to hear.

1244
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,120
That's what we hear.

1245
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,660
A true...

1246
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,100
Yes, yes.

1247
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:35,900
It's a kill ball.

1248
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,900
Are there any secrets you can share with us at this time

1249
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,240
about how you'll be taking over the convention?

1250
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:41,780
A bloodless coup.

1251
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,480
Yeah, by doing something so completely unpredictable

1252
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,820
it will totally blow...

1253
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,720
Oh, he's in the P-Dawg, Poop-Dawg school of...

1254
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,380
I can't believe it.

1255
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,200
The convenience whipping the dead dog with siloes.

1256
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,820
Yes, you see, I even wrote it.

1257
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,620
I even wrote it in Dallas

1258
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,500
and said how predictable even the show has become.

1259
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,240
It's James Joyce Nelson.

1260
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,600
He's doing a monologue, an internal...

1261
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,820
We can hear Nelson thinking.

1262
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,160
Listen.

1263
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,260
Well, at least there's no babies.

1264
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,560
Let's get out of here before the babies

1265
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,900
throw up the room with that poopy stuff.

1266
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,460
Oh, those stinking babies.

1267
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,400
Changing diapers.

1268
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,600
Well, if we walk out the door,

1269
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,480
the callers are going to call

1270
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,880
and we can't let Nelson have a call.

1271
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,420
Right, you'll just have to stay there all night.

1272
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,060
Yeah, well, only for another six and a half hours, actually.

1273
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,360
Meanwhile, they are yours, too.

1274
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,580
You can now inspect in the privacy of your own home,

1275
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,960
shop, office, den for 20 years

1276
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,440
or express permission already withdrawn

1277
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,380
by the Polk, McKinley, Harding, Dobbs, Coolidge men.

1278
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,020
They only may authorize stamp your application

1279
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:28,600
with its own seal.

1280
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,900
Looks easy, doesn't it?

1281
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,080
But it won't come off.

1282
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,400
Yeah, exactly.

1283
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,080
We were ripe the day we started this thing.

1284
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,320
Yes, that's why the shop only has ripe.

1285
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:36,960
You're dirty.

1286
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,440
You're right.

1287
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,440
Well, I've listened to Over the Edge

1288
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,080
and I've had my callousness reinforced

1289
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,380
and brutalization therapy advanced

1290
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,380
to a higher possible state.

1291
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,100
Well, what portion of Over the Edge

1292
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,240
really serves the life?

1293
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,220
Get you out of the 50s.

1294
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:51,820
Don't worry about it.

1295
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,900
This is the enlightened quarter of the hour.

1296
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,440
Yes.

1297
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,640
It is hard to deal with shows.

1298
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,700
We're going to be on until it dries out.

1299
00:59:58,820 --> 00:59:59,720
Or kill me!

1300
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,580
Or kill me!

1301
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,020
I wish we could.

1302
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,660
We all do wallow in our intellectual competence.

1303
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,360
Doug shorted the show out

1304
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,460
and spent the whole thing in one little three-second buzz.

1305
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,000
Sorry.

1306
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,500
I didn't mean to use up all of our tangible effects.

1307
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,480
We do there until you fall asleep.

1308
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,320
When you fall asleep,

1309
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:15,580
that means we're off the air.

1310
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,100
Towards the end of these shows, yeah.

1311
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,260
When you quit listening to us,

1312
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,480
we'll no longer be there.

1313
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,360
You have to.

1314
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:23,220
We have to make the primordial matter of nature

1315
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,740
stand up and salute.

1316
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,340
Do you think this was our idea?

1317
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,220
I just don't know what to say.

1318
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,580
We just wanted to do a funny show.

1319
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:32,320
Oh, they were broken up.

1320
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,120
See, they'll get together

1321
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,840
and that's why they'll cease to exist in April.

1322
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,140
Ah, okay.

1323
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,080
We're talking about literally cease to exist.

1324
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,260
Yeah, we're talking about flame out, you know?

1325
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,880
Ionization of most of the molecules involved.

1326
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,920
No dirty vreedies.

1327
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,080
Ball of fire in the studio.

1328
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,100
So did I win the figurine or what?

1329
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:48,660
Yes.

1330
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:49,980
You're going to get a figurine

1331
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,360
that lights up the world.

1332
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:50,360


1333
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:50,880
It lights up, revolves,

1334
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,780
and dispenses free chowder.

1335
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,280
Our miniature craftsmen have designed,

1336
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,380
cast, struck, etched, forged,

1337
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,740
and finished these authentic replications

1338
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,920
not available in any store,

1339
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,880
even on this radio station

1340
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,480
before their commission,

1341
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,800
literally without regard for any quality.

1342
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,260
They come with their own adoption papers

1343
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,740
and you can bring them into their own home.

1344
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,780
Here you come, you're crazy.

1345
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,380
Ah, but now my special arranger

1346
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,760
can be Postmaster General Grom.

1347
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,980
The Church of the Subgenius.

1348
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,340
Yes, and we're leaving now.

1349
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:16,660
No, we're not, really.

1350
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,680
We just have to say that for the tape.

1351
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,660
Uh, yes.

1352
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,220
And you know, you can get information

1353
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,320
about this church

1354
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,180
whose show you've been listening to.

1355
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,980
Get that pencil ready.

1356
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,420
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box

1357
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,380
140306

1358
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,180
Dallas, Texas.
