1
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,320
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,060
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,220
I'm out of fucking magic!

4
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,260
No trouble.

5
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,000
Get set, get going. Amen.

6
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,500
Recording.

7
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,560
Everything's going fine.

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,280
No trouble.

9
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,460
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

10
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,140
Bob?

11
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,040
Bob?

12
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,320


13
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,900
The message is now.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,840
A part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

15
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,960
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

16
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,120
What about slack?

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,140
That's your key phrase.

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,820
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,620
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

20
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,080
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,980
This is Reverend...

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,980
With Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,800
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

25
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:23,160
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of silence.

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,260
Oh yeah.

27
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,620
Well.

28
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,500
Here's your special message.

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,600
The Reverend Ivan Stang and Buck Naked are not here.

30
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,960
But yet I am.

31
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,120
I am the Lord.

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,820
Jesus Christ.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,680
And I have taken over the airwaves for Hour of Slack.

34
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,280
Which I believe is 594, but how would I know?

35
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,980
So let's get into it.

36
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,880
Shall we?

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,020
So now you've seen both sides.

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,560
Is that it?

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,820
What do you mean?

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Well, you like the feeling of looking like they do in the magazines or some of the girls at school.

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,860
But you didn't know there was a price tag with them.

42
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,860
Not really.

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,640
That's one thing people just don't talk about much.

44
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,920
You see, the things we say and do are only a couple of the ways we communicate with each other.

45
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,900
The way we dress tells people a lot about us too.

46
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,800
No kidding.

47
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,200
God wasn't making up stories when he said in the Bible that he looks on the inside of a person while man looks on the outside.

48
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,420
It's a fact.

49
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,980
We look at each other.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,140
And make judgments based on what we see.

51
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,160
You wear an outfit like you have on today and for better or worse, you're telling people something about yourself.

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,400
But I wanted to tell them that I've grown up.

53
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,060
That I know what's going on.

54
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,180
But you don't know what's going on, Donna.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,740
How could you at your age?

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,140
I don't want to looker at doggies, fucker.

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:59,540
This one guy I knew, he asked me to sing the kindergarten orgasm dance song for him when we were talking on the phone.

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:03:59,980
And I went,

59
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,900
In the kindergarten I had orgasms.

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,660
Back in the kinder I had orgasms.

61
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,980
Kinder-y in the kinder-y.

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,180
Back in the kinder I had orgasms.

63
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,320
He said, well I gotta go now Joe.

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,260
I'll see you later kinder.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,560
No he just, he didn't say Joe.

66
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,800
He said, I gotta go now.

67
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,960
See you later kinder.

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,080
See you later kinder.

69
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,760
See you later kinder.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:32,760


71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,180
See you later kinder.

72
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,700
See you later kinder.

73
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,140
Alright, it's me, I'm back.

74
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,880
Woah, woah, woah.

75
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,240
Friends, you don't even want to know the hell I've been through trying to get this show together.

76
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:53,800
It all started at 7 o'clock and it's about midnight now and I finally got all the wires straightened out.

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,940
The music picked out and I've got about, oh, a good five minutes of recording.

78
00:04:59,940 --> 00:04:59,940


79
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,100
I've got to hand it to Reverend Stang, I don't know how he does it every week.

80
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:14,380
In fact, I wanted to dedicate this entire show to Reverend Stang and play all of you some good old Reverend Stang clips, but I can't find anything.

81
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,560
I can't, there's just a stack of tapes and wires and music.

82
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,420
I'll tell ya.

83
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,820
And everyone's got another way to do it.

84
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,200
Everyone tells poor old Reverend Stang, oh, that he's doing it wrong and there's another way to do it.

85
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:38,220
And sure, when I was putting together this system and I couldn't figure out why the input wires from the 8-track were going to the output wires of the reel-to-reel machine,

86
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,300
I tried to change it and it just didn't work.

87
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:52,440
So, let that be a reminder to all of you that the sacred scribe's ways may be different than ours, but somehow, by the grace of Bob, they work.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,440
Broken smile.

89
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,500
Broken smile.

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:07,940
I saw her floating just off the carpet and made her mine.

91
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,320
Made her mine.

92
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,660
Go ice, he said now.

93
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,100
Me,查 살.

94
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,100
Man, I wish they'd leave me a bit of bar Pedro behind there or something.

95
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,140
Am I going to get in and help her tie abye?

96
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,160


97
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,020
I could bare이라고 hurt you.

98
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,020


99
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,140
Don't you see, you're too angry.

100
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,220
Yeah, reluctantly.

101
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,620
So you got to catch up with her?

102
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,500
Yeah, but keep it real, remember that that really is finding a way to get out?

103
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,240
Yeah.

104
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,960
I'll be ready, I won't have to hesitate

105
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,060
And I'll be fine upon my own

106
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,620
Well, as I said, I wanted to play some good rants for you,

107
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,720
but I guess you're going to have to be subjected

108
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,760
to whatever I have here in front of me,

109
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,940
get a little bit of insight into my musical tastes.

110
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,980
What have we been listening to?

111
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,440
A little bit of Joe Offric,

112
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,980
a little bit of Hour of Slack No. 1

113
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,640
is what we opened the show with.

114
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,720
That really cool, jazzy hit music in the background

115
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,200
is by the Valentine Six.

116
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,100
Oh, we've got a bunch more to go.

117
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,740
And now I think I've got ten minutes of good stuff.

118
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,860
So groove out on this song, all you slackers.

119
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,660
Some morning, some of these mornings

120
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,420
They'll be calling my name

121
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,880
Calling me to that heavenly plane

122
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,340
And when I see those pearly gates

123
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,600
I'll be ready, I won't have to hesitate

124
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,020
I'll be fine, I'll be fine

125
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,200
Like a bird in the sky

126
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,940
And I'll be fine, I'll be fine

127
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,520
Leaving this world, yes, I'll be saying goodbye

128
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,160
And there is nothing to lose and everything to gain

129
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,900
When they call my name

130
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,760
I'll be ready, I won't have to hesitate

131
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
I'll be ready, I won't have to hesitate

132
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,760
When they call my name

133
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,840
When they call my name

134
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,580
I'll be ready, I'll be fine

135
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:02,580


136
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,040
Mama told me about the sun

137
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,000
Get melanoma from the sun

138
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,900
Mr. Sunshine lights our way

139
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,680
And Danny took my mom away

140
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,820
Uncle Frank took me fishing

141
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,620
He said my mom would be fine

142
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,920
And I said, I'm not gonna be fine

143
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:24,920


144
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:24,920


145
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,640
I brought the worms

146
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,220
And she was dead by dinner time

147
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,360
Mama told me about the strangers

148
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,300
I'm never supposed to talk to strangers

149
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,100
Cause strangers mean to little kids

150
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,920
She says they sell them in my dreams

151
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,840
And they don't show up

152
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,880
And then one morning

153
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:07,900
I joined that young crew

154
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:07,900


155
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:07,900


156
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:07,900


157
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:07,900


158
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:07,900


159
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,180
I'm not était

160
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,800
Our sunrises are always delightful

161
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:10,800


162
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:10,800


163
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:10,900
I gonna get our dreams

164
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:10,900


165
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:10,900


166
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:10,920
There ain't anybody on our house

167
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:23,840
Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, No. No, no, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No.

168
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,520
Never tell on your daddy.

169
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,380
He only hates when he's mad.

170
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,260
And when he thinks mama's bad.

171
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,320
Uncle Frank took me fishing.

172
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,900
He said my daddy be fine.

173
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,220
He had to go for a while.

174
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,620
But he'll be back in three to five.

175
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,760
Mama told me about the sun.

176
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,700
Get melanoma from the sun.

177
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,640
Mama told me about the strangers.

178
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,580
Never supposed to talk to strangers.

179
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,540
Mama told me about my daddy.

180
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,460
Never tell on your daddy.

181
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,980
Uncle Frank took me fishing.

182
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,000
He said my daddy be fine.

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,860
He had to go for a while.

184
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,280
And when he thinks mama's bad.

185
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,460
Uncle Frank took me fishing.

186
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,460


187
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,460


188
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,980
Mama told me about the sun.

189
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,320
He said my daddy be fine.

190
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


191
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,820
Uncle Frank took me fishing.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,320
Mama told me about the sun.

193
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,600
And when he thinks mama's bad.

194
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:05,600


195
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:05,940


196
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,240
Uncle Frank took me fishing.

197
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,080
Mama told me about the sun.

198
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,360
He said my daddy be fine.

199
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:09,680
He said my daddy be fine.

200
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:09,680


201
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:09,680


202
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,040


203
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,860
Mama said mama's gonna die.

204
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,940
He called me on their phone.

205
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,420
You also will accept $30 in cigarettes, or really anything, even your goodwill.

206
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,780
So I want to dedicate this next song to them.

207
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,080
I hear the train a-comin'

208
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,280
It's rollin' around the bend

209
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,420
And I ain't seen the sunshine since

210
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,960
I don't know when

211
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,260
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison

212
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,660
And time keeps draggin' on

213
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,680
But that train keeps rollin'

214
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,680
On down to San Antone

215
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,240
When I was just a baby

216
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,500
My mama told me, son

217
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,140
Always be a good boy

218
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,160
Don't ever play with guns

219
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,420
But I shot a man in Reno

220
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,820
Just to watch him die

221
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,860
When I hear that whistle blowin'

222
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,960
I hang my head and cry

223
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,220
I bet there's rich folks eatin'

224
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,020
In a fancy dinin' car

225
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,360
They're probably drinkin' coffee

226
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,260
And smokin' big cigars

227
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,940
Well, I know I had it comin'

228
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,200
I know I can't be free

229
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,020
But those people keep a-movin'

230
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,240
And that's what tortures me

231
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,140
Well, if they freed me from this prison

232
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,260
If that railroad train was mine

233
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,240
I bet I'd move it on a little more

234
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,660
Farther down the line

235
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,940
Far from Folsom Prison

236
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,240
That's where I want to stay

237
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,920
And I'd let that lonesome whistle

238
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,940
Blow my blues away

239
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,180
Look at the cold bottom of them.

240
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,820
Uh-huh.

241
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,700
And look what's going on.

242
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,080
Look what Lauren wanted to give to me.

243
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,960
Uh-huh.

244
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,180
And look what's going on.

245
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,180
She got a great sale and gave to me.

246
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,060
Oh, Tim, you look out.

247
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,300
What's wrong with you, Sam?

248
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,680
You found a suit for Sandy today.

249
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,240
Give me a kiss.

250
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,020
Give me a kiss.

251
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,920
Your teeth hurt.

252
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,320
My feet.

253
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,100
Oh.

254
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,920
Give me a kiss.

255
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,320
Mwah.

256
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,300
That's what I said to Lauren.

257
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,880
Its name is Red.

258
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,020
That's what Lauren did to me.

259
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,340
Red and...

260
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,400
Mah-bogany.

261
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,400
Mah-bogany.

262
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,300
Mah-bogany.

263
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,800
Daddy.

264
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,680
There were these kids at Whataburger

265
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,240
and they were smoking.

266
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,380
They weren't much older than us.

267
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,180
They were like 10 or 11.

268
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,700
And they were sitting there smoking

269
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,360
and then they ran up to these 13-year-old

270
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,660
or 14-year-old or 15-year-old girls

271
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,160
and they started feeling on their legs

272
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,900
and they ran off.

273
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,480
Daddy, look.

274
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,300
God.

275
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,260
Daddy?

276
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,140
Well, Sandy, there's a lot of kids like that.

277
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,140
Well, Sandy, there's a lot of kids like that.

278
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,540
Oh, well, yeah.

279
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,820
I figure I'm going to get in all kinds of trouble

280
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,740
for ruining the setup of this equipment

281
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,160
so I might as well go all the way.

282
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,820
I'm trying to find your rants.

283
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,660
I'm trying to preach the word of Bob

284
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,380
but all I have are these tapes

285
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,800
and it seems like all these tapes I have are

286
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,460
pre-Bob stuff of, uh,

287
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,240
staying and his children.

288
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,940
I'm sure I'll find something related to Bob here.

289
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,320
But, uh, let's play this.

290
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,480
I'm sure this was supposed to never get on the air.

291
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,500
Ha ha ha!

292
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,220
Uh, hello, uh, I want to order a million dollars

293
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,840
worth of pizza, uh, hold the anchovies,

294
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,000
uh, but, but, but only on one condition.

295
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,780
Only if it's delivered by that guy

296
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,200
with that noid on his truck.

297
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,140
I just love that noid guy.

298
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,240
The kids love it, everybody loves it.

299
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,440
Flash! Noid mania is sweeping America by storm!

300
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,240
Calls are pouring in from discriminating pizza customers

301
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,300
demanding a close encounter

302
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,420
with this new outdoor advertising phenomenon.

303
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,500
Join us now for a visual confrontation

304
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,140
with the Noid Man.

305
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,620
The Noid Man!

306
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,500
Trucking through your neighborhood soon.

307
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,000
He turns your delivery vehicle

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,040
into a Noid Mobile.

309
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,580
Rocking and rolling all over the competition.

310
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,680
Dial 1-800-NOID-MAN

311
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,260
and your franchise will ascend to pizza heaven

312
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,360
simply because people think your delivery vehicle

313
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,200
is so cool.

314
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,720
Kids love it, grown-ups love it,

315
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,700
thereby increasing driver popularity and morale,

316
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,800
leading to increased penetration, productivity,

317
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,740
and free promotion.

318
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,960
Everyone's talking about it

319
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,720
and word-of-mouth advertising equals pizza frenzy!

320
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,860
Neighborhood Noid Watch Committee being formed now.

321
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,380
Call 1-800-NOID-MAN

322
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,220
and put the Noid on top of your truck.

323
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,160
New day. Thank you.

324
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,300
No, no really, really, really, it's not my fault.

325
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,400
It was in a drawer marked Good Stang Rants.

326
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,520
I swear to you, it's not my fault.

327
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,980
You should label the table.

328
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:44,980


329
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
I'm gonna go to the tapes more closely.

330
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,240
Uh, let's see if I can't find something about Bob.

331
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,820
Another thing, another thing about Bob

332
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,000
that you should probably know.

333
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,320
Old Pipeface ain't gonna die for your sins.

334
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,600
Okay?

335
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,340
You can get that straight right now.

336
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,780
Let's just get that straight up front.

337
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,060
Bob will not die for your sins.

338
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,960
He really does not give a shit.

339
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,040
He doesn't give a shit about your sins.

340
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,560
He doesn't care about your sins.

341
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,600
He is bored with your sins.

342
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,680
If anything, Bob merely comes and comes again and again

343
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,420
to justify your sins,

344
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,280
to rationalize your sins.

345
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
Friends, Bob brings not forgiveness,

346
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,180
but an excuse.

347
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,020
Do you really need to be forgiven?

348
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,920
For what and by whom?

349
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,140
Do you really feel that need?

350
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,500
No, you do need an excuse.

351
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,860
And if you don't need it yet,

352
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,700
you're probably gonna need it pretty soon.

353
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,940
So, uh, you just think about it.

354
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,940
We're not gonna do any kind of hard,

355
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,060
so, well, we're not gonna threaten you with,

356
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,280
with tales of some hell if you don't join up

357
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,940
and pay lip service to our invisible monster.

358
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,320
No, we won't threaten you with things like that.

359
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,980
It's just on July 5th, 1998,

360
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,320
all of a sudden, one day you'll wake up

361
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
and, well, there'll be an empty pile of clothes

362
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,840
where your spouse, your wife,

363
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,260
that dues-paying subgenius once was laying next to you.

364
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,920
And you'll walk outside,

365
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,000
and you'll have to go to work.

366
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,080
That spouse will be up on the escape vessels.

367
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,580
But we wouldn't want to threaten you

368
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,260
with the fact that your spouse,

369
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,080
once on the escape vessels, could then go,

370
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,680
you know, I've always wanted to show that asshole

371
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,540
a thing or two about Bob.

372
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,300
No, we're not into the vengeance,

373
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,880
the vengeance that comes with our religion.

374
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh, no, that, we wouldn't form a religion

375
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,440
just to feel superior to the next,

376
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,520
to everybody else.

377
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,620
No, no, that's what all the other,

378
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,760
I'll tell you what, friends, it's true.

379
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,060
This religion is based on hate.

380
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,640
And in that respect, we're simply the only religion

381
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,500
that'll sit, just come out and admit it.

382
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,940
They are all that way.

383
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,240
We're just up front about it.

384
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,700
We're better than everybody else.

385
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,540
Enough said.

386
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,460
Bob sold it, I smoked it, that settles it.

387
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,740
You know?

388
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,060
All right, well, there we go.

389
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,120
We finally got some of the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

390
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,480
And that was Reverend Ivan Stang

391
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,720
at the Rutgers University Divival.

392
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,240
And the good Reverend Stang is out preaching

393
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,580
the word of Bob right now as we speak

394
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,100
in New York, in Cleveland.

395
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,440
So I think this is a good time to tell you

396
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,580
about some shows coming up.

397
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,200
If you are in Texas or can make it to Austin,

398
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,240
you do not want to miss the September 13th

399
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,100
Austin Divival.

400
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,780
For more information on the Austin Divival

401
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,020
and any of the other upcoming Divivals,

402
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,660
you can call the Slack Crusade hotline.

403
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,300
And what is the Slack Crusade hotline number?

404
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,280
Good question.

405
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,440
Let me go find it.

406
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,840
Hold on.

407
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,960
I'm back.

408
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,840
Time control.

409
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,020
Beautiful, prepared subgenius is a dangerous subgenius.

410
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,560
The Slack Crusade hotline.

411
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,400
Get your pencils ready.

412
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,160
216-556-0338.

413
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,060
That's a 24-hour pre-recorded message, free,

414
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,240
except for long-distance charges.

415
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,220
216-556-0338.

416
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,900
Hey!

417
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,300
My turn to give my life away.

418
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,460
Oh, the wealth of meaning that is here.

419
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,940
And all I can stand off and listen to my Lord pray.

420
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,380
He's praying here about himself.

421
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,780
And in a moment, I'm going to hear him pray about you

422
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,480
and about me.

423
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,540
But that moment is not today.

424
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,840
It'll be next time.

425
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,280
And so instead of the hour,

426
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,880
the hour has come.

427
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,960
Well, the moment has come for us to get off the radio.

428
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,300
But we'll be right back here next time.

429
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,520
I can't help that when I stop,

430
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,180
I can't forget one day in my life.

431
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,340
...have any kind of degree for a ministry.

432
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,900
But these ministries are looking for people just like you

433
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,460
who want to make a difference in their world

434
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,540
and in the lives of others.

435
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,100
That sounds too good to be true.

436
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,880
Well, the people at Interchristo must be doing something right.

437
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,260
They've been serving Christians in Christian ministries for years.

438
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:36,260


439
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,100
They've been doing it for 30 years now.

440
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,760
Doctors in California can talk about medical marijuana

441
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,160
without fear of having their licenses revoked.

442
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,760
A San Francisco federal judge temporarily barred the federal government

443
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,620
from prosecuting doctors who recommend medical marijuana to their patients.

444
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,860
And whither I go, ye know,

445
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,820
and the way ye know.

446
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,460
Thomas saith unto him,

447
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,220
Lord, we know not whither thou goest,

448
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,260
and how can we know the way?

449
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,780
Jesus saith unto him,

450
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,660
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

451
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,160
The number you can call from...

452
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,920
Quite a boy you got there, Rob.

453
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,280
Yeah.

454
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,940
You really seem like an old chip off the old block tonight, eh?

455
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,740
Then I tell everybody going in,

456
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,080
Say, I'm having a party and need some booze.

457
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,540
I don't s'pose you'd get some for me.

458
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,200
Pretty soon somebody says,

459
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,560
Sure thing. Know how it is.

460
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,140
I was young once too, myself.

461
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,360
Woo-wee!

462
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,780
You sure got a system.

463
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,780
Hey, there's John.

464
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,420
Hey, John! Come on over.

465
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,800
Have a little snort before you have to face Miss Peters in the American Civil War.

466
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,840
Well, well, what have we here? The local beer fest?

467
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,080
Oops, sorry, Cary Nation.

468
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,940
I thought you were somebody else.

469
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,060
Funny, Mike. Very funny.

470
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,520
Surfing USA.

471
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,560
This is my commandment.

472
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,980
That ye love one another.

473
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,980
As I have loved you.

474
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,640
This is Pastor Gad of the Trueway Evangelistic Church, 3415 South Polk.

475
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,280
And the move goes on.

476
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,980
In spite of my mother's relief that it was alcohol instead of drugs,

477
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,980
Mr. Thompson was right again.

478
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,100
I was a drug addict.

479
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,540
Listen to us. I'm sure you'll be amazed.

480
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,100
Big fun to be had by everyone.

481
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,160
It's up to you. Sure they can be done.

482
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,300
He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.

483
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,380
All things that the Father hath are mine.

484
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,380
Therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you.

485
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,880
Within three months of his salvation, Dan is completely drug free.

486
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,120
Today, this father of four is a radiant witness to the saving power of Christ.

487
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,200
Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name.

488
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,620
Ask, and ye shall receive.

489
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,460
That your joy may be full.

490
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,780
These things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs.

491
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,000
But the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs,

492
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,300
but I shall show you plainly of the Father.

493
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Ringing now, sir.

494
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,560
Thank you very much.

495
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,400
Hello?

496
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
Ellen? Is that you?

497
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,380
Danny? For heaven's sake, where are you?

498
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,440
Here. Right here.

499
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,780
Where's that, Danny? Where are you?

500
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,460
Right here. In this phone booth.

501
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,260
I know, Danny, but where's the phone booth?

502
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,380
You give up, then?

503
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,520
Yeah, I give up. Now, where are you?

504
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,020
School.

505
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,100
Out by the field again?

506
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,880
Yep.

507
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,400
Okay, I'll be there. You wait for me. Do you understand?

508
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,260
Yep.

509
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,880
Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am,

510
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,800
that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me,

511
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,600
for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world.

512
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,900
O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee.

513
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,560
Danny, get away from the tracks!

514
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,960
You big bully train, just because you're bigger!

515
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,500
Hey, that kid's right on the track!

516
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,700
Danny! Danny! Danny!

517
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,260
Danny!

518
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,460
Are we controlled by secret forces?

519
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,480
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

520
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,440
Do people think you're strange?

521
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,540
Do you? Then you may be on the right track!

522
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,140
Are you abnormal?

523
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,740
Then you are probably better than most people.

524
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,680
Yes! Your time shall triumph!

525
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,040
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

526
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,660
This is it. The only faith that promises...

527
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,380
Action, thrill, success in sex and business.

528
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,520
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

529
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,220
Stand erect for your own abnormality!

530
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,660
Bob is a way of life to millions.

531
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,860
Yet half of them don't even know.

532
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,520
He's the one true living slack master

533
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,380
with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

534
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,640
He is the one real shortcut to success.

535
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:30,880
He's luck.

536
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,120
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

537
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,380
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

538
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,140
Become physically attractive overnight.

539
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,320
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

540
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,120
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

541
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,180
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

542
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,720
And coming right back.

543
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,680
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

544
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:12,340
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

545
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,060
To turn conspiracy-implanted personality disorders around.

546
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,820
And channel them into an illusion of creativity that will fool normals and get you sex.

547
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,400
Bob Holmes!

548
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,500
Bob Holmes!

549
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,300
Bob Holmes!

550
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:27,700


551
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:27,980
Bob Holmes!

552
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,460
Bob Holmes!

553
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,200
Bob Holmes!

554
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,720
Bob Holmes!

555
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,320
Bob Holmes!

556
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,120
Bob Holmes!

557
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,220
Bob Holmes!

558
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:38,900
Bob Holmes!

559
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,240
Bob Holmes!

560
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,840
Bob Holmes!

561
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:39,840


562
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:39,840


563
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:39,840


564
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:39,840


565
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,700
Oh, Bob!

566
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:41,980
Bob Holmes!

567
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,660
Bob Holmes!

568
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,520
Bob Holmes!

569
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:43,980
Bob Holmes!

570
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,220
Bob Holmes!

571
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:44,880
Bob Holmes!

572
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,240
Bob Holmes!

573
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,240
Bob Holmes!

574
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,160
Bob Holmes!

575
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,960
Bob Holmes!

576
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,660
Bob Holmes!

577
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,440
Bob Holmes!

578
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:58,180
Bob Holmes!

579
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,080
So glad to be back on the air in Dallas.

580
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,080
You know, because it's about time that this city got the word of Bob.

581
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,740
Oh, yeah.

582
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,980
These are the end times, friends.

583
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:21,540
And, yes, that was Reverend Ivan Stang and Pastor Buck Naked from Hour of Slack number one.

584
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,240
594 tapes ago.

585
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,860
Amazing.

586
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,020
We also heard some radio outtakes made by me.

587
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:41,220
And earlier we heard the Hentai Santas, a great subgenius band performing Melanoma.

588
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,100
I would give you their address, but I just wrote them and the letter came back.

589
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:53,240
Welcome to side two of the most painful hour of my entire existence.

590
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,060
This is the Lord Jesus Christ.

591
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,260
I was surprised.

592
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,560
Wow.

593
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,040
That last half hour was tough.

594
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,940
I was in the middle of a story and the tape just ended.

595
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,520
And I was so glad to hear that click.

596
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,220
Oh, I can't wait to hear the next one.

597
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,720
I can't even imagine.

598
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,400
There is no slack for the slack fool.

599
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,500
Friends, I erased my Joe Opryk tape.

600
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,140
It's true.

601
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,380
And because I erased it, I feel that I should play for you the song that I erased it with.

602
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,180
It has absolutely nothing to do with the Church of the Subgenius or Bob, but it is a great

603
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,040
piece of bull dada.

604
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,580
This is a remake.

605
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,200
of a song that was very popular here in Dallas, Texas,

606
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,540
and was probably very popular wherever you were,

607
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,840
called The Macarena.

608
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,680
The Macarena

609
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,560
The Macarena

610
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,140
The Macarena

611
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,560
The Macarena

612
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,060
Macarena

613
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,640
Macarena

614
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:57,640


615
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,140
Macarena

616
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,180
Well,

617
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,860
that was an amazing podcast.

618
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:24,560
that was an amazing podcast.

619
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,020
That was it. Pretty exciting, huh?

620
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,780
Wow.

621
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,680
Now I know what you're saying.

622
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,540
You're saying, Jesus, you're back.

623
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,720
You gotta have a message for us.

624
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,820
Well, I really don't have much to say, but here's a tip.

625
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,120
Never trust a man named Bob.

626
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,060
If your name happens to be Bob, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

627
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,120
You just have to trust the Lord, and it's very hard to do that.

628
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,500
It is. When you're getting beat up, it's very hard to do that.

629
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,180
But?

630
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,540
There are things that I know now that I didn't know before.

631
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,800
Like what? What have you learned this week?

632
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,900
There's things the devil told me that were not true.

633
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,440
When I read the Word, I took them literally, too literally.

634
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,300
Sometimes they meant to be strictly for the people.

635
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,460
And so he just kind of twisted things around?

636
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,540
He made one sentence and twisted it around.

637
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,800
He twisted it and made me believe it.

638
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,400
Linda's voice and mine, Linda's voice and mine, stay with me.

639
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,480
Linda, there's also been a severe warning about the occult, about the New Age, Eastern religion.

640
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,880
No, no, you mustn't do that.

641
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,740
You mustn't do what?

642
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,580
It mustn't have anything to do with that.

643
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,100
That's right.

644
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,900
Very dangerous.

645
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,500
But you got into these things, and you thought you were doing the right thing.

646
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,920
This is the way of the world. The way of the world is deceit.

647
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,400
The devil deceives.

648
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,720
The evil spirit can bring beautiful things and beautiful experiences.

649
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,260
That's right.

650
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,660
And the spirit will come into you through these beautiful experiences.

651
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,440
Now, I think people need to understand this almost staccato way in which you're speaking right now.

652
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,180
The spirit is fighting. He's trying to get you not to say these things.

653
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,780
He's trying to take control of your mind right now.

654
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,400
We're down to this final battle right now, and he is doing everything he can to keep hanging on to things.

655
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,960
And as a result, it's very difficult for you to keep your consciousness and to keep your articulation.

656
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,860
This is a real fight.

657
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,040
He doesn't want me to say these things.

658
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,200
No, he doesn't. He doesn't want you to say these things.

659
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,600
Wow. Pretty deep. Thanks, Bob.

660
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:39,720
Normal people have to stay far away from subgeniuses because the wobble in the subgenius mind will poison the normal and all other normals the victim comes in contact with.

661
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,940
Scholars and scientists all agree with this.

662
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,860
The book of the subgenius says all who follow Bob will live forever.

663
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,540
This means all normals are under the curse of immensely painful death.

664
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:58,120
All normality must be cleansed from the face of the earth.

665
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,100
This is the valuable teachings of J.R. Bob Doss.

666
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,780
For his teachings alone bring slack.

667
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,100
Amen. Praise Bob.

668
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:16,000
It seems their kind will never evolve to the function of the universal order.

669
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,540
Therefore, they must be terminated.

670
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:23,520
The cowboy days, the psycho pathfinder, and scabby days have set out to find out if the reverend Stang is fully conscious.

671
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:23,520


672
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,120
Or is being coerced by the Republicans.

673
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:33,740
They took a look at the DNA building of the sea near the government political mutation factory and discovered a room full of Stang clones.

674
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,640
He's a great man.

675
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,480
Yes, brethren. To the normals, sex is a sin.

676
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,060
Something to fear and a means to control their fellow pinks.

677
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,860
Oh, they can't have too much of that sex stuff going around.

678
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,580
People might start enjoying themselves.

679
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:03,680
And then they might forget all about those million and one little sins they've been taught to worry about.

680
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:11,260
And then they might decide not to listen to those sick idiots who preach about sin, sin, sin.

681
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,720
And then those mere human sin and guilt preachers would be out of good paying jobs.

682
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Well, I don't get paid to bring you the word.

683
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,240
I've heard of Bob, friends.

684
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,040
And I'm telling you that sex is all right.

685
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,260
Yee-haw!

686
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,840
Bob wants you to enter a subgenius short duration marriage with a prairie squid and get, I said, get down.

687
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,780
Yee-haw!

688
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,420
The normals.

689
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,760
The normals are taught in what they are pleased to call their holy scripture.

690
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,260
That the lust for money is the root of all evil.

691
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,220
The lust for money is the root of all evil.

692
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,460
And yet you walk into one of their churches and what's sure to happen?

693
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,060
That's right, brethren.

694
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,180
They're going to ask you for money.

695
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,240
Pink churches are the greatest property owners in the world.

696
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,900
They're tax exempt.

697
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,720
And make billions upon billions of dollars a year.

698
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,360
Yet they preach that lust for money is the root of all evil.

699
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:46,900
The conspiracy's strategy of keeping the dull normals trapped in a double paradox of sin and hypocrisy over sex and money makes them easy to control through guilt.

700
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:53,740
Hell, they'll even try to make you feel guilty about being smart enough to see through their game.

701
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,720
They're forever adding two and two and getting five.

702
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:03,580
But they think that's the right answer, even though all of their works ultimately come to naught.

703
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:10,180
Even though the real answer is literally blowing pipe smoke in their very nostrils.

704
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,400
Verily, they have noses, yet refuse to smell.

705
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,520
And that's the real sin of the pinks, my brethren in Bob.

706
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,040
Willful, willing, ignorance, and stupidity.

707
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,160
And that, brethren, is a sin in the eyes of Bob.

708
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:39,020
And as far as I'm concerned, that makes it the only sin worth listing as a sin.

709
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,580
Do it. Do it. Do it.

710
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,160
Just as a bitchamentos away!

711
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,360
Happy new year ...

712
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:03,160
Oh don't make fun of Bob's comedy.

713
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,260
God save you.

714
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,000

716
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:07,820
That's not

717
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:07,900
as I thought.

718
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,180
Thank you, Bob.

719
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,800
Here we go.

720
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,500
Here we go.

721
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:19,540
Here we go.

722
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,080
Here we go.

723
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,780
Here we go.

724
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,380
Here we go.

725
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:10,980
Here we go.

726
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,580
Here we go.

727
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:11,760


728
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,160
Here we go.

729
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,080
Here we go.

730
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,220
Here we go.

731
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,520
Very badly.

732
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,920
You can't deny your feelings.

733
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,580
Control is not the real answer to the truth of reality.

734
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,080
Never comes a world where love is sweet.

735
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,360
I'm sorry.

736
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,460
I didn't eliminate all of you.

737
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:47,820
The knowledge that wasские me back then.

738
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:53,120
It didn't have a sign to disimage the size of reality.

739
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,980
If a man cannot put his amnestical

740
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,060
These questions led me back,

741
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,160
Where I can gosp firmly.

742
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,780
I was a man until now.

743
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:19,260
This is Bill T. Miller from OBE and Kings of Feedback,

744
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,960
and you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

745
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,020
Slack off! Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack!

746
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,400
Yes, indeed.

747
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,980
That was Bill T. Miller,

748
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,740
the King of Slack,

749
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,460
with a rare recording of

750
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,420
Ginyadina, or You Rang, the backwards mix.

751
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,440
That was very beautiful.

752
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,100
And before that, we listened to a little bit of

753
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,760
Nolan Void ranting there.

754
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,280
Let me give you OBE and Bill T. Miller's address here.

755
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,300
Bill T. Miller can be reached at

756
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:01,400
Box 221, Boston, M, 02123.

757
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,900
That's Box 221, Boston,

758
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,780
M, 02123.

759
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,960
Or you can call him at

760
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,520
1-617-LICK-O-B-E.

761
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,680
All right.

762
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,200
I've kind of been slacking off on what we've been listening to,

763
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,340
and I can't remember, so I hope you're enjoying it.

764
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,260
Yes, this is the Lord Jesus Christ

765
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,260
with my first and hopefully last

766
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,120
Hour of Slack.

767
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:30,240
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fire!

768
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:38,920
.

769
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,400
.

770
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,400


771
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,540
.

772
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:43,820
.

773
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:43,820


774
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:43,820


775
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,580
Teenage drinking has become very widespread today,

776
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,660
and even younger children are frequently involved.

777
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,020
Maybe it'd be a good idea for us to go over the danger signals,

778
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,400
signs that alcohol is destroying your life.

779
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,900
All right. Here's the list.

780
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,140
And those people do not do the drug because of those consequences.

781
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,800
If there were no consequences,

782
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,960
I think that quite a higher percentage of people

783
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,640
People would be using it.

784
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,440
I doubt that.

785
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,080
I'll tell you what.

786
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,220
I would not be using angel dust if it were legal.

787
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,540
I've got to tell you right now.

788
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,440
Jesus answered him,

789
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,780
If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil.

790
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,060
But if well, why smitest thou me?

791
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,960
She was something else.

792
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,540
She was.

793
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,500
Now she's gone again.

794
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,020
Marry.

795
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,580
She's got herself carried off by somebody new.

796
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,420
Crucify him.

797
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,300
Crucify him.

798
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,220
Pilate saith unto them,

799
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,560
No, no, don't crucify him.

800
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,420
Don't crucify him.

801
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:51,380
And saith unto Jesus,

802
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,480
But Jesus gave him no answer.

803
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,500
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus.

804
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:13,440
Let us tell him all about our trust.

805
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,640
He will hear our greatest cry.

806
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,860
And he will answer my cry.

807
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,680
Now we need to hear.

808
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,100
In a little prayer we'll turn.

809
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,440
Then I'll know the little fire is burned.

810
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,360
You will find.

811
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:32,860
Finally.

812
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,840
We'll talk with Jesus.

813
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,780
Make some noise.

814
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,500
Pilate answered,

815
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,420
What I have written, I have written.

816
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,760
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus,

817
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,720
took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part,

818
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,040
and also his coat.

819
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,540
Now the coat was without seam,

820
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,280
woven from the top throughout.

821
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,540
They said therefore among themselves,

822
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,840
Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it,

823
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,600
whose it shall be.

824
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,740
That the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith,

825
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,200
They said,

826
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,740
They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.

827
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,300
Oh?

828
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,180
Yes, you know, we already have thousands of boys and girls that have signed up for adventures lessons.

829
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:12,800
That's true.

830
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,040
The adventures are packed with stories and fun things to do.

831
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,120
And if you sign up for these great lessons, you'll also receive the first cassette in your Story Hour's Life of Jesus series.

832
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:28,160
We will find a little talk with Jesus who makes it right.

833
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,460
Ooh.

834
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:30,860
Ooh.

835
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,100
Ooh.

836
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:33,100


837
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Oh, yeah.

838
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:44,660
You'll find a little talk with Jesus makes it right.

839
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,660
And now, let's get back to more slut.

840
00:49:53,900 --> 00:50:00,320
What we like to do is pull the wool over our own eyes, dear friends.

841
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:00,840
And I like to do that.

842
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:00,840


843
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:00,840


844
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:00,840


845
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:05,660
think you know what that means. You know, every time you turn on the television or the radio,

846
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:12,580
somebody's trying to trick you into buying some useless shit. Well, trick your, look, as Bob said,

847
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:19,700
sure, you're getting screwed every day, but you can learn to enjoy it. Some ways are fun.

848
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,140
You know, so if you're gonna, if you're gonna, if you're getting ripped off anyway, why not let Bob

849
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:37,140
do it, man? Uh, but it's true. We are selling something for nothing. I mean, we really are.

850
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,360
We really are selling something for nothing because, you know, what are, what, what, what is

851
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:47,460
money, for instance? Well, sure, it can buy you, uh, everything you want, just about, including

852
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:53,400
happiness, I guess. But, you know, there's some things that are more palpable than the money or

853
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,120
the fancy cars. You know, if you ask me, I'm not gonna tell you. I'm not gonna tell you. I'm not

854
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,420
gonna tell you. I'm not gonna tell you. I'm not gonna tell you. I'm not gonna tell you. I'm not

855
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:00,640
Elvis or Marilyn Monroe or Marilyn Manson. They'll all say, yeah, that, or Hendrix. They'll go,

856
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:06,240
yeah, that rings holla after a while. I, I, you know, Kurt Cobain, you know.

857
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,420
And, as a matter of fact, you know, you come to think of it, they've got kind of a,

858
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:22,140
they had a sort of a series going there. There was Jimmy, Janice, Jim, John,

859
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:24,640
Gigi,

860
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,680
And then they got to the Ks.

861
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,160
So who's next?

862
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,480
Jayner is saved.

863
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,700
We have to do something to stop this Trevino thing.

864
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,860
I have a grudge against Trevino.

865
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,080
People are trying to say that I'm crazy.

866
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,140
But the kind of things that Trevino is doing internationally,

867
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:53,560
people's rights in Central America are being oppressed by Trevino.

868
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,320
And then people come up to me and say, I'm crazy,

869
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,700
trying to speak out against Trevinoism.

870
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,340
Well, is there any church of the sub-Trevinas?

871
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,940
Not that you're familiar with.

872
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,800
I mean, it's all over the place.

873
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,880
This is part of the conspiracy.

874
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,600
Yeah, I mean, it's all Trevino undercover stuff.

875
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,480
I see.

876
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,300
I think Trevino is underneath it all, if you look close enough.

877
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,180
And we just...

878
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:23,540
You know, I've been...

879
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,600
I just felt like it was time that somebody spoke out against this.

880
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,900
Well, you mentioned the Central America issue,

881
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,400
and this was another question someone had mentioned to be sure to ask you about.

882
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,960
And that was the number of people you've killed.

883
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,220
Well, I don't...

884
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,720
I might have to take the sixth on that.

885
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,380
Oh, okay, because this is...

886
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,800
Yeah, someone might record this.

887
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,280
That's right.

888
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,440
But I'm trying to...

889
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,180
You know, I don't know how many people I'm going to have to kill

890
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,400
to prove that I'm not insane.

891
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,420
I'm more sane than Charles Manson and Son of...

892
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,480
Sam both put together.

893
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,880
You know, people try to...

894
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,800
You know, I went to a psychologist in Little Rock,

895
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,440
and he tried to say that I was hysterical.

896
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,040
Me, hysterical.

897
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,320
That I do feel like I've got an apartment complex

898
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,980
and delusions of adequacy.

899
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,680
Now, you're from Little Rock, Arkansas.

900
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,720
Yeah, that's right.

901
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,160
Mm-hmm.

902
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:13,820
This is...

903
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,700
There's also a pretty...

904
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:19,160
There's been a pretty high level of audience self-mutilation

905
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,440
just about through this entire tour.

906
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,620
We've been...

907
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,700
You know, we've been trying to get the teenage suicide

908
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,900
and the audience mutilation levels up

909
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,660
to what they were back in 84.

910
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,820
In the heyday.

911
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,120
When the whole Jader thing was really big.

912
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:36,600
Mm-hmm.

913
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,280
But...

914
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,440
Thank you, Bob.

915
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,960
For cleansing my memory.

916
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,580
Thank you, Bob.

917
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,760
For helping me see.

918
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,100
And, Bob, I'll follow you always.

919
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,820
That's right, Bob.

920
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,900
Until that next day.

921
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,080
Thank you, Bob.

922
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,820
For sending them pills.

923
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,980
Thank you, Bob.

924
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,600
For finding me willing.

925
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,020
Teenage girls.

926
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:22,600
Thank you, Bob.

927
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,720
I'll follow you always.

928
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,380
That's right, Bob.

929
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,360
Until that next day.

930
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,760
Thank you.

931
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,680

Original

00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,440
Mixed sound

951
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:50,820
Lyrics

952
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:50,900
Post- etwa

953
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,200
Voice acting

954
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,260
I just discovered I've been a little dumb and I'm sorry

955
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,960
I'm not too crazy about the whole idea

956
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,200
I can't remember a big day before

957
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,300
But remember, the end of the world may be much worse

958
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,360
And take much longer than you thought

959
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:33,520
The mere act of sitting in your home watching everything fall apart on TV

960
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,000
May be too much for even the stoutest brains to take

961
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,700
In fact, the more alert and intelligent you are

962
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,460
The quicker you'll likely be driven to suicide

963
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,820
By the sheer hideousness

964
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,180
Of what you'll be doing

965
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:49,500
You'll be seeing

966
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,400
Will you be ready?

967
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,260
Will you still be sane enough to laugh

968
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,180
When that which must come to pass

969
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,580
Comes to pass?

970
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,800
Will you ever get slack?

971
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,640
Break out of that glass box

972
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,640
And join the Church of the Subgenius

973
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,060
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution

974
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,020
Anything is likely to develop

975
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,960
Enter the Church of the Subgenius

976
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,140
Billing itself as the weirdest cult on Earth

977
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,660
What do they believe in?

978
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,240
Everything

979
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,680
Who do they believe in?

980
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,680
A mysterious character named Bob

981
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,720
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless

982
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,060
history

983
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:35,340
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth

984
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,740
And to you, young man

985
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:40,340
Bob founded the Church mainly to help unmask the conspiracy

986
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,120
We're talking about the conspiracy

987
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,060
What next?

988
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,420
Just believe in the power of the dogs

989
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,380
I believe

990
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,940
Believe in Bob and the Subgenius

991
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,280
Believe

992
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,540
Reach out for him

993
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,460
I'm reaching

994
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,180
Feel the healing power

995
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,680
See, there you go

996
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,200
See, now, do you remember anything?

997
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:57,680
Does it hurt?

998
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:57,860
No

999
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,640
See, no problem

1000
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,160
No problem with Bob, right?

1001
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:00,700
Yeah!

1002
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,520
Right!

1003
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:01,980
Yeah!

1004
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,800
Basically, two factions out there right now is us and them

1005
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,200
Friend, have you ever heard the expression, there's no slack in this world?

1006
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,220
A lot of people have to ask me what slack is

1007
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,980
And that's sad, mister

1008
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,840
They were born with slack

1009
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,340
Oh yeah!

1010
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,820
You were born with slack

1011
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,740
But the conspiracy took it away

1012
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,660
The conspiracy made you want to be normal

1013
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,140
That's what the conspiracy is all about

1014
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:31,160
And the conspiracy is a patchwork of different things

1015
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,700
Some are nations, some are products, some are hypnotic television shows

1016
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,700
Some are bad pills

1017
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,860
You'll find this if you find Bob!

1018
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,640
And you better find Bob right now!

1019
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,140
Yeah!

1020
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,080
And no one has ever met Bob

1021
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,120
The leader of our church, no one has ever met

1022
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,260
Because as you know, all cults, their leaders are usually pretty hard to find

1023
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,820
And Bob is no exception

1024
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:57,300
Bob will help you dig your own weirdness

1025
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,980
I was getting messages in the back of my brain

1026
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:07,720
And I just kept hearing the word Bob, Bob, Bobby, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

1027
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,880
They said your mind is in this jar and then they poured it down the sink

1028
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,060
Subgeniuses are the class of people who can't be normal

1029
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,020
And they're not the class of people who can be classified

1030
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:21,300
Bob has taken winos on the street and turned them into millionaires overnight

1031
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:27,920
By the same token, he has taken millionaires and given them the slack they always needed all along as winos

1032
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,240
Oh yeah

1033
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,040
Friends, friends and prayer partners

1034
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:41,280
This is the Lord Jesus and you're listening to the Hour of Slack

1035
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,040
For more information on the church of the subgeniuses,

1036
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,980
Send a self-addressed stamped envelope to

1037
00:58:50,660 --> 00:59:01,000
P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214

1038
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:10,440
That's P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214

1039
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,020
Well friends, yes, we're coming close to the end of another episode of the Hour of Slack

1040
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:24,360
You've been listening to the Hour of Slack number one with Reverend Buck Naked and Reverend Ivan Stang

1041
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,480
Who did really one heck of a job for their first show

1042
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,040
I hope you're enjoying my first show

1043
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:36,560
And before that, we heard one of Buck Naked's songs, Thank You Bob

1044
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,680
And you know what? I'd like to take this moment to thank you, Bob

1045
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,880
For giving me all the slack that one man could really ask for

1046
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:49,200
Keep those prayers and donations coming

1047
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,560
And here's a song that we played once before

1048
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,900
But it's so beautiful I need to play it one more time

1049
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,220
Listen closely to the words, friends

1050
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,080
All right, man

1051
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:04,300
I pay another man to do my taxes

1052
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,240
On account of that's another deduction I can take

1053
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,820
The postman brought my W-2 this morning

1054
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,860
And this year they're gonna take about one hundred thousand dollars

1055
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,300
And I'm gonna pay about one third of all I make

1056
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,720
I'm just as patriotic as the next guy

1057
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,100
And you know I love that red, white, and blue

1058
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,320
And I'm gonna help pay this rising cost of freedom

1059
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,900
But there's no way I'm gonna change my point of view

1060
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:39,460
Cause every time them bureaucrats run out of money

1061
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,680
Congress sucks into the working hand

1062
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,180
I don't think it's one bit funny

1063
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,480
When it takes so much of my money

1064
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,320
To do things with it, I don't understand

1065
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,900
I don't understand

1066
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,160
I don't know why they think they have to squeeze us

1067
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,500
But I'll tell you just exactly where I stand

1068
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,960
I believe if ten percent is good enough for Jesus

1069
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,300
It ought to be enough for Uncle Sam

1070
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,840
We have a house to build

1071
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,180
