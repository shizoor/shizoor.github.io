1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,060
No, no, no.

2
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,280
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your subs adjusted.

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,280
We're having operating difficulties,

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,240
which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,620
We have such a wonderful life.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,720
So wonderful life.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,100
We have such a wonderful life.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,560
We have such a wonderful life.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,960
No trouble.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,420
Get set and get going.

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,040
Amen.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,560
Recording.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,780
Everything's going fine.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,680
No trouble.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,220
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,100
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,780
Bob?

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,140
Bob?

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,400
That's your key phrase.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,480
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,720
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,420
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,140
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,140
With Pat,

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,340
and Mr. Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,420
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,960
Before the sermon,

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,120
a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,860
living avatar of slack,

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,380
and saint of sales.

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,880
On planet...

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,860
Are we controlled by secret forces?

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,240
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,840
Do people think you're...

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,900
strange?

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,240
Do you?

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,840
Then you may be on the right track.

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,580
Are you abnormal?

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,580
Then you are probably better than most people.

41
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,540
Yes.

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,740
Your time shall triumph.

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,380
Now at last the step-by-step process is revealed.

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,480
This is it.

45
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,220
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

46
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,220
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging hell.

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,220


48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,220


49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,740
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,260
Bob is a way of life to millions.

51
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,820
Yet half of them don't even know it.

52
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:46,500
He's the one true living slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,920
the locked doorway to financial heaven.

54
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,820
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

55
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,700
And the one real shortcut to slack.

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,000
Now, see another dimension.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,520
The dimension on your TV.

58
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,040
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

59
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,920
Become physically attractive overnight.

60
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,680
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

61
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,760
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,940
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

63
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
And coming right back.

64
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,360
Plus, you can bring back those.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,120
You couldn't make it on your own.

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,400
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,300
To turn conspiracy and kind of personality disorders around.

68
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,740
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

69
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,600
That will fool normals and get you sex.

70
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,280
Bob Wolf!

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,120
Bob Wolf!

72
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
Bob Wolf!

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,400
Bob Wolf!

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,120
Bob Wolf!

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:11,980
Bob Wolf, I'm Bob.

76
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,600
Bob.

77
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,580
Yes, good to see you.

78
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:24,600


79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:24,600


80
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,700


81
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,700


82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,700


83
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,460
Thank you.

84
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,540
Thank you.

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,540
Thank you.

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,100
The story so far.

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,480
In the beginning, the universe was created.

88
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,120
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,400
Many races believe that it was created by some sort of god.

90
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:07,560
Though the Jatrovatid people of Veltvodil 6 firmly believe that the entire universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkel Seizure.

91
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:15,340
The Jatrovatids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the coming of the Great White Handkerchief,

92
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:24,840
are small blue creatures with more than 50 arms each who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol,

93
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,480
deodorant before the wheel.

94
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,620
However, the Great Green Arkel Seizure theory was not widely accepted outside Veltvodil 6,

95
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:42,780
and so one day a race of hyper-intelligent, pan-dimensional beings built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought

96
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:50,660
to calculate once and for all the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.

97
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,520
For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed,

98
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,700
calculated, and eventually announced that the answer was in fact 42.

99
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,880
And so another, even bigger computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was.

100
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:14,040
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so amazingly large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet,

101
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:23,080
particularly by the strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.

102
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,160
And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge,

103
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,300
nothing that ever happened on Earth could possibly have made the slightest bit of sense.

104
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,480
At the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass,

105
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:52,080
and the only native Earth people to have survived the demolition are now being shot at behind a computer bank on the lost planet of Magrathea,

106
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,060
along with the Earth's own planet.

107
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,160
Another example is the second%, take the planet Earthточoon,

108
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,960
thisهance is debunked in its Dharma.

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,080
Then the Artemis appears.

110
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,860
This is strange.

111
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,120
Bitte欸s fail to guess!

112
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,060
The申

113
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,280
Whoa.

114
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,820
Hey, where are we here?

115
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,740
I think we're out in space somewhere.

116
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,960
I think we're on the inside of a...

117
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,940
Oh, this doesn't look like the studio we were in.

118
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,600
We're at the bottom of something here.

119
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,780
No, there's a light that's passed on.

120
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,120
Look, there's a giant mouth opening up and it's swallowing the earth.

121
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
The light of a giant pipe.

122
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,160
Oh, no, it's a giant pipe.

123
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
And out of here comes the light.

124
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,760
And here comes the giant mouth.

125
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,500
Oh!

126
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,320
Oh, now all the white powder froth is being poured up on top of us.

127
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,920
Oh, hey, wow.

128
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,260
Froth, man.

129
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,240
Froth.

130
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,620
Froth.

131
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,860
I never used to get enough froth before, but this is too much.

132
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,260
This is ridiculous.

133
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,460
Is everybody all right?

134
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,860
I'm still here.

135
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,280
Now he's going for another puff.

136
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,580
That one almost finished me off if he goes for another blow, I'm done for.

137
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,340
It's the giant Bob.

138
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,760
The giant...

139
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,240
This can't be the real Bob.

140
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,960
It's just a flat two-dimensional head made of dots.

141
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,460
A thousand miles across.

142
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,440
Boy, he's putting that pipe in a backwards universe now.

143
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,160
With a gigantic time warp black hole pipe.

144
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,100
Boy, that was horrible.

145
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,900
I've never been smoked by dots.

146
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,980
Oh, we're back in rock and roll hell now.

147
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,640
Oh, no.

148
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,440
Is this rock and roll hell?

149
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,160
Oh, man.

150
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,640
I always get stuck here at two in the morning.

151
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,120
Rock and roll hell.

152
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,160
Get down.

153
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,720
Party.

154
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,900
Shoot up.

155
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,200
Pray to Satan.

156
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,060
Rock and roll hell.

157
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,520
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,500
Rock and roll hell.

159
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,180
Go out and kill some kids tonight.

160
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,920
Make your life hell.

161
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,680
Rock and roll smells like rock and roll hell.

162
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,260
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,360
Beating the destroy.

164
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,960
Destroy your life.

165
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,120
Destroy your life.

166
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

167
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

168
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,500
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

169
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,580
Satan in rock and roll hell.

170
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,460
Rock and roll.

171
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,660
Sex.

172
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,820
Drugs and alcohol.

173
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,460
Where all the old DJs on this show.

174
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,260
Corruption.

175
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,200
Here at this station.

176
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,840
End of.

177
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,460
Vigilante.

178
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,280
Rock and roll hell.

179
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,080
Here is a special editorial.

180
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,460
Don't worry.

181
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Doctors for Bob supports the Parents Music Resource Center in its efforts to read rock music.

182
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,640
All your friends will be there.

183
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,300
Of its unnecessary references to the occult.

184
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,560
Hell, yeah, man.

185
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,820
We're having about eight kegs of bull down here.

186
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,420
All night.

187
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,400
That giant kill party by the flaming break of Brimstone.

188
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,400


189
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,240
Lines of coke crank.

190
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,600
We feel that today's teenager has too many other pressures.

191
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,280
Shootin' up smack.

192
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,480
Without having to worry about hate.

193
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,040
Hate.

194
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,560
Hell.

195
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,460
And now for the subgenius.

196
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,000
It's all emotional.

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,400
Hey.

198
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,760
Oh, god damn it.

199
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,400
Devil worshipping teenager stole my pill.

200
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,940
And all the gas you want.

201
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,280
The gas.

202
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,300


203
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:10,700
The gas.

204
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:10,740
The gas.

205
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,280
The gas.

206
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,400
The gas.

207
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,560
The gas.

208
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:11,620


209
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:11,620


210
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:11,620


211
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:11,620


212
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:11,780


213
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:11,800


214
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,060
The gas.

215
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,380
The gas.

216
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,380


217
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,560
You ain't wanna stop.

218
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,560


219
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,560


220
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,560


221
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,560


222
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,100
Or maybe you can moat.

223
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,500
If that's what floats your boat.

224
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,100
Hey, you!

225
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,500
I'm talkin'.

226
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,260
You listening?

227
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,840
Or you can pout.

228
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,000
Or you can break out.

229
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,060


230
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,060


231
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,060


232
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,060


233
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,760
Get up

234
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,120
Get out

235
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,500
Come on, step on it, step into it

236
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,200
Step into the flea

237
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,180
Girl, do what you please

238
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,360
Cause you ain't no twit

239
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,280
You ain't no twit yet

240
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,460
Step out of your clothes

241
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,460
Girl, step into homes

242
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,540
You'll be the latest hit

243
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,740
The latest hit, yeah

244
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,620
It's about time to let my hormones wake up

245
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,120
Put off the homework, let's put on the mail

246
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't wait a second, cause you'll stay in limbo

247
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,720
I'll give my old stuff to my sister, that bimbo

248
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,100
When I wear underwear, I'm liberated

249
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,020
It's like the movies, M.I.P.G. or X-rated

250
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,920
I feel just like a virgin in these clothes

251
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,720
I hope you like it

252
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:51,720


253
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,180
I'm a virgin, but then won't show

254
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,160
Step into the flea

255
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,280
Start being a tease

256
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,380
Hey, you ain't no nerd

257
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,340
You ain't no nerd yet

258
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,560
Step into the street

259
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,620
Put guys into heat

260
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,720
Be a little flirt

261
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,260
A little flirt, yeah

262
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,400
Wanna get you dressed up

263
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,320
Move around and prance

264

Wanna get you right up

All my fans will dance

Don't try to fight it

267
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:21,720
Don't try to fight it

268
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,500
Cause this is really you

269
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,620
Just burst your lips

270
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,780
And flare your nostrils too

271
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,960
I must be dreaming

272
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,820
This is just too cool

273
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,980
Cause in real life

274
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,160
I wet my lips and then I drool

275
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,260
I really love

276
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,460
Living the life I wanna

277
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,740
It feels so good to be a primadonna

278
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,460
Step into the sleaze

279
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,360
Girl, do what you please

280
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,540
Now you're not a wimp

281
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
You're not a wimp yet

282
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,880
Step into the lights

283
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,600
You know it's alright

284
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,540
If you wanna primp

You can primp, yeah

286
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,260
You can take your mind

287
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,100
Where it wants to go

288
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,140
Tell the boys to come

289
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,480
Or tell the boys to blow

290
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Whether I'm awake

291
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,440
Or if it's a dream

292
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,560
I can make my life

293
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,580

I wanna squish my nose

304
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,220

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,380
Well if you don't I'm gonna kill ya

379
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,800
Kill ya kill ya kill ya

380
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,280
We'll show you punk rock

381
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,500
You thought it was hair and hair

382
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,500


383
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,500


384
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,500


385
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,500


386
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:21,780
And clothes

387
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,280
You thought it was like big spikes and bracelets

388
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,600
Yeah you thought punk rock came from a record company

389
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,540
You thought wrong

390
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,360
You thought it was like

391
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,600
You are God participating in himself

392
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,440
Just me

393
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,700
Man this guy's

394
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,220
Wow this guy's a real prophet

395
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,760
His elder god may not be all that correct

396
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,300
He's a surdeuper Sam for sure

397
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,040
They cry for dominance when tomorrow becomes today

398
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,580
Oh

399
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,460
Responsible for this

400
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,260
Alright enough of this silliness

401
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,020
Yes

402
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,700
Say goodnight Stang

403
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
Ah yes friends

404
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,740
I'm all hooked up

405
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,800
And ready to answer your questions

406
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,640
Now we've been getting letters

407
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,240
And phone calls from

408
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,520
Noble subgeniuses

409
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,320
Out there asking

410
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,700
Reverend Stang

411
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
How can I be more subversive

412
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,500
How can I be more subversive

413
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,920
How can I be of more service to Bob

414
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,140
How can I be of more service to Bob

415
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,600
In bringing down the conspiracy

416
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,220
That enslaves us

417
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,160
And friends I'm afraid that

418
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,240
That is entirely up to you

419
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,520
That is entirely up to you

420
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,400
Now the conspiracy will tell you

421
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,000
How to be more subversive against it

422
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,080
How to be more subversive against it

423
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,120
So we sure won't

424
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,560
But I can give you one helpful hint friends

425
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:47,920
But I can give you one helpful hint friends

426
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,540
There's nothing wrong

427
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,500
With looking at the world

428
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
With looking at the world

429
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,380
If you want to be more subversive friends

430
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,640
If you want to be more subversive friends

431
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,320
You don't have to show off about it

432
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,720
If you wear a uniform

433
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,440
Like a high fashion punk haircut

434
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:04,900
Like a high fashion punk haircut

435
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,460
Or leather and spandex and whatever

436
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,500
Unless it's really extreme friends

437
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:10,640
Unless it's really extreme friends

438
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,480
You're just playing along with the conspiracy

439
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,340
You're just playing along with the conspiracy

440
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,720
Joining a conformity of non conformists

441
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:18,820
Joining a conformity of non conformists

442
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,300
You're labeling yourself as someone

443
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,660
Who the conspiracy doesn't really need to worry about

444
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,780
Who the conspiracy doesn't really need to worry about

445
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,520
Cause you're gonna follow a predictable pattern

446
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Cause you're gonna follow a predictable pattern

447
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,880
One that they've co-opted already

448
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,240
One that they've co-opted already

449
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,080
But what kind of subversion are we talking about anyway friends?

450
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,080


451
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,500
Bringing down the state?

452
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,860
Blowing up polluters?

453
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,560
Nay nay

454
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,040
That only kills people friends

455
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,300
That only kills people friends

456
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,980
And gets you in jail to boot

457
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,960
It's stupid

458
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,640
It's stupid

459
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,500
Well enough snow

460
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
We've really come a long way

461
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,380
Well enough snow

462
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,160
We've really come a long way

463
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,220
Although listen

464
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,500
Bob said

465
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:21,500


466
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,340
Oh, friends, an awful lot of subgeniuses are Republicans.

467
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:35,220
But, you know, subgenius doesn't mean left-wing pinko or right-wing anything.

468
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:42,900
All it means to most of us is patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism, friends.

469
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,960
Every yard a kingdom, every child and dog a serf.

470
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,660
It doesn't matter what party is in control,

471
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,840
as long as none of the parties really have that much control over how much you party.

472
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,900
Besides, what you're fighting ain't just a political system.

473
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,860
I mean, as political systems go, the U.S. is one of the least evil.

474
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:15,820
Just as Jesus is okay, it's just that some members of his fan club make him look bad.

475
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,940
Same goes with Bob and the Bobbies.

476
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,760
Surely some of you have met nerds on the street who started trying to talk Bob at you and you were just embarrassed.

477
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,540
Well, friends, see, the conspiracy is a great combination of things.

478
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,700
Work is one of the main ones.

479
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,560
That's how you're really controlled, friends.

480
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,220
You have to work for someone else to make a living.

481
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,160
Now, the subgenius actually likes to work at what he likes to work at.

482
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,460
Right?

483
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,860
The rub and the bub, my friend.

484
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The conspiracy is also ancient customs and new invented customs.

485
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,120
It's a whole background attitude.

486
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,320
The conspiracy is an attitude.

487
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,940
An attitude of hatred for anything weird.

488
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,520
So what you want to subvert, friend, is that attitude.

489
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,980
Now, some strange things are bad.

490
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,840
But all great inventions and ideas started out as strange.

491
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,560
So if you want to subvert the government or some manufacturer or blow buildings up,

492
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,600
that's just what the conspiracy wants you to do, my friend, so they can catch you,

493
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,080
make you look like a kook in front of millions.

494
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,060
Now, history proves that every time you overthrow something overnight,

495
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,700
ditch some old government, what replaces it always ends up just as bad.

496
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,620
We have to break that cycle, friends, and this isn't anarchy we're talking about.

497
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,600
Anarchy is just another political system, just like atheism is just another religion.

498
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:01,260
To truly subvert, my friend, you work alone, at your own pace, casually, but with alertness,

499
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,620
to subvert the attitude of hating everything weird.

500
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,520
Remember, leftists are just as guilty as rightists in this respect.

501
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,860
And you don't go out subverting by being an obnoxious Bobby enforcing weirdness.

502
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,600
You're just a bunch of idiots who can't possibly appreciate it anyway.

503
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,800
That just makes them hate weirdness more.

504
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,220
You should seduce them with abnormality, my friend.

505
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,600
You have to break them in a little at a time.

506
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,260
It depends.

507
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:39,040
And you can't indiscriminately hate all normals because that only proves that you are a normal yourself

508
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:46,940
because you don't understand yet that half of what you call normals are actually weirder than you are.

509
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Let's attack that'veout Shadow!?

510
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,580
You don't seem to get IT, goddamit!

511
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,220
Depending on the genre, the nature of the performances build everyone's Believe Me is one of the two main factors.

512
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,980
Most of the people such as White Jacket and Mki Paul love to watch this film

513
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,020
thirteen, twenty years ago, too.

514
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,160
They often cite Рitan's

515
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,160


516
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,420
Psycho photography with his likeness is a place however Court of Cru 보 Theater.

517
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:13,640
They've picked off many films already.

518
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,480
Every channel back there looks like Hojo,

519
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:15,720
foreigns,

520
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:17,940
cinema

521
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,200
You thread your seeds

522
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,460
And the things could be worse

523
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,600
Than when there's nothing on TV

524
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,360
I've never seen a couple

525
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,680
Laying at the table and got the walls

526
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,640
I've been hit more than so many times

527
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,420
I can't remember them all

528
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,220
And I say

529
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,220
Who do you want to be today?

530
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,200
Who do you want to be?

531
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,000
Who do you want to be today?

532
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,120
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

533
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,200
Just like somebody on TV

534
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,460
I think I'll be a telly boy

535
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,420
I think I'll be a hunk

536
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,980
I think I'll be a top guy

537
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,040
And I think I'll be a punk

538
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,060
I might just be a fashion star

539
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,120
All dressed in pretty rags

540
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,980
Or perhaps I'll cross the other side

541
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,760
And walk around in drag

542
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,560
Who do you want to be today?

543
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,540
Who do you want to be?

544
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,340
Who do you want to be today?

545
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,420
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

546
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,520
Just like somebody on TV

547
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,560
As your favorite aí

548
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,480
Let me be your man

549
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,860
I want to be your man

550
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,100
Let me be your man

551
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,800
I want to be your man

552
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,680
And land on your page

553
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:05,680


554
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,780
Everyone's back to their base

555
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,840
But my name ain't hispanic

556
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:09,840


557
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,640
Man, just for να

558
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,720
Laisse m'être

559
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,880
Care and walk with you

560
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
Please don't forget me

561
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,760
Do you like to live just like a rock in the middle of the sea?

562
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,680
Do you want to suffer by yourself in a pool of lead for misery?

563
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,380
Do you feel like a saint in artist's clothes with a rosary in your hand?

564
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,820
Do you want to be crazy like Bando, like a stranger in a strange, strange land?

565
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,880
Would you rather push the buttons and be feared by all humanity?

566
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,760
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum?

567
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,280
Do you want to be stupid just like me?

568
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,420
Who do you want to be today?

569
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,340
Who do you want to be?

570
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,220
Who do you want to be today?

571
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,340
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

572
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,520
Just like somebody on TV

573
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,740
Who do you want to be today?

574
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,860
This is 9-1-A-F

575
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,480
This guy's so loud

576
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,640
Man, why is my naan going to be on a paintball?

577
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,280
Who do you want to be today?

578
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,920
Who do you want to be today?

579
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,860
Who do you want to be today?

580
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,660
Who do you want to be?

581
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,660
Who do you want to be today?

582
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,480
Who do you want to be?

583
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,280
Who do you want to be today?

584
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,340
Who do you want to be?

585
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,080
To use my own super cool, studly self as an example,

586
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,980
now in person I don't really appear like a mad prophet of the airwaves.

587
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:50,300
I very deliberately look like an innocent computer whiz or something.

588
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,780
If a policeman stops me for speeding, I look like a regular citizen.

589
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,640
And part of me is.

590
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,280
And so he doesn't look in the trunk to see if I'm carrying 5,000 copies of subgenius pamphlets

591
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,360
to hand out to grade school kids, which I am!

592
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,360
I get away with murder this way, friends.

593
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,860
And that time the Secret Service,

594
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,200
came to my house.

595
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,960
They took one look and said,

596
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,760
Oh, he's just a poor humorist.

597
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,000
He isn't building bombs.

598
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,220
Not physical bombs, nay, my friends.

599
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:34,520
But me and perhaps many of you are from that 1970s post-hippie nihilistic generation, more or less.

600
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,540
And aside from not working for a living,

601
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,840
I and perhaps you are still that same devious hippie.

602
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,440
Not a commie, nay, not a pinko,

603
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,880
but a soldier for slack!

604
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,980
A warrior against the conspiracy of the normals.

605
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,940
And so, to truly suffer,

606
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,020
to smite them,

607
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,800
but not physically,

608
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,600
smite them psychologically.

609
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,800
With your jokes,

610
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,180
your cryptic statements,

611
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,180
your band, your paintings, your weird car,

612
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,980
your whole attitude,

613
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,380
not just your haircut and clothes, my God!

614
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,520
The normals can wear weird haircuts and clothes,

615
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,260
and they do it all the time!

616
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,040
If they are normals, my friend,

617
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,340
they'll recoil in fear and jealousy

618
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,540
to see a free man or woman.

619
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,740
But for latent subgeni who are ripe to be saved,

620
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,900
you're setting a good example

621
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,780
to be weird,

622
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,980
in your own way.

623
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,020
Achieve slack in your own life,

624
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,480
my friend, and those who are worthy

625
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,060
will turn toward it as towards a beacon,

626
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,780
as a moth dives headlong into the flames.

627
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,440
They're not trying to steal your slack

628
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,520
or to imitate you,

629
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,380
but merely to see what is possible.

630
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,720
Then and only then will they learn

631
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,260
to pull the wool over their own eyes.

632
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,460
So you don't have to talk about Bob, friends.

633
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,200
They have to just stumble upon Bob

634
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,920
in their own sweet time.

635
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,380
And I'm not saying,

636
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,380
be yourself,

637
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
quote unquote.

638
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,100
There are too many yourselves.

639
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,900
You might end up being your own

640
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,820
conspiracy normal lynch mob self.

641
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,820
You must try to try not to

642
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,180
achieve the development of your Bob self.

643
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,760
That in, that in you,

644
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,620
which is Bob-like.

645
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,680
And there is no rulebook for this,

646
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,440
my friend, except the one you make

647
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,700
and the one that you buy from Bob.

648
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,020
Praise Bob!

649
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,000
Help me, somebody!

650
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,880
Pull the lever!

651
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,720
Down you go!

652
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,980
You are listening to the Hour of Slack.

653
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,780
Praise Bob!

654
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,960
Yeah!

655
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah, people will go off and worship

656
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,140
their stylish fashion gods,

657
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,600
their everybody's,

658
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,340
their Madonna gods,

659
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,660
their Beatle gods,

660
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,280
their Jim Morrison gods,

661
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,400
Jim Morrison gods,

662
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,640
Mick Jagger gods,

663
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,720
All those are false prophets!

664
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,000


665
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,140
They're false prophets!

666
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,900
Jerry Falwell gods.

667
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,420
But how did you get in this terrible mess, listener?

668
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,760
Can I get a T.I.?

669
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,780
T.I., man. Far out, man. T.I., man.

670
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,040
Slave labor and nickel.

671
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,500
T.I. is making electronic parts, man.

672
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,660
A brain slave.

673
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,580
Far out, man.

674
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,760
A slave to their reality,

675
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,160
their world, their society,

676
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,540
their way of life, their religion,

677
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,080
their ideology, their conformity.

678
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,600
Because conformity and creativity

679
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,560
are the same in their world.

680
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,380
Imagination?

681
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,440
What's that?

682
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,220
I've got super dynamic overdrive.

683
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,840
The sidewalk circus

684
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,300
was dancing with tricks

685
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,920
In mad whirling circles

686
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,040
They love more kicks

687
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,700
They look each other

688
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,780
Like drugs to their blood

689
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,400
And drop trumps and tramps

690
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,960
When they're playing studs

691
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,220
And they're pretty folks

692
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,980
Pretty folks

693
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,860
Bending the trend

694
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,000
Pretty folks

695
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,760
Pretty folks

696
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,580
They'll never mend

697
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,540
Splitting their cells

698
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,940
Looking for pills

699
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,760
They blow their brains out

700
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,780
They're changing

701
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,220
They don't pay their bills

702
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,560
Modify the pot you love

703
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,820
Spend XTK

704
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,540
Blocks of flash zeros

705
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,260
There's nothing to say

706
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,820
And they're pretty folks

707
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,600
Pretty folks

708
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,480
Bending the trend

709
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,600
Pretty folks

710
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,280
Pretty folks

711
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,240
They'll never mend

712
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,280
Optimistic

713
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:11,780
And gloom

714
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,720
Just turn them everything

715
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:27,720


716
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:27,720


717
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:27,720


718
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:27,720


719
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:27,720


720
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,260
恁

721
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:33,260


722
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
generous

723
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,060
Pretty books, pretty books, ending the trend

724
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:45,820
Pretty books, pretty books, they'll never mend

725
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:53,520
In funhouse mirrors, they don't seem to age

726
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,940
As they decompose in memory's cage

727
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:06,700
But total loss is not something to hide

728
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:13,240
When the last big sleep has started inside

729
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,620
Cause they're pretty books, pretty books, ending the trend

730
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,380
Pretty books, pretty books, they'll never mend

731
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:59,620
In funhouse mirrors, they don't seem to age

732
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:09,700
As they decompose in memory's cage

733
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:29,560
As they decompose in memory's cage

734
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:59,920
They're pretty books, pretty books, ending the trend

735
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
In funhouse mirrors, they don't seem to age

736
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:11,640


737
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,340
But they're pretty books, pretty books, end the trend

738
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,260
As they decompose in memory's cage

739
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,700
They're pretty books, pretty books, ending the trend

740
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:17,900
As they decompose in memory's age

741
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:25,260
Get a big, old newspaper, save your life As they decompose in memory's cage

742
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,900
They don't love you, Bob Bob, get off me, Bob

743
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,020
I love you like I do.

744
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,100
The fist and the fear behind it.

745
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,180
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

746
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,840
It's not just the dull and emptiness taste for a smothered culture

747
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,360
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

748
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,240
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

749
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,680
It's not just the child zombies that murder their mediocrity parents

750
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,920
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

751
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,400
It's not just those starry old vics on the park benches

752
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,380
with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars

753
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,080
of Belsen and Auschwitz.

754
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,180
It's not just the anesthesiologist for Nege.

755
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,180
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

756
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,020
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

757
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,300
It's not just the broken headlight, snapped antenna,

758
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,680
and human excrement on your car hood.

759
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,840
It's not just that the old ways were best.

760
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,820
It's not just the pain in the head,

761
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,800
bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

762
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,040
It's not just the killer shit ganja from the dark side of the bush.

763
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,760
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

764
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,560
It's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.

765
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,820
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

766
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,660
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

767
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:42,240
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, non-entity son of a bitch who thinks workers are property.

768
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,340
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

769
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,540
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who think they're the only ones who can do it.

770
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,580
It's not just the police who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

771
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:03,540
It's not just some asshole with a pipe and a thing I know more than you do dog grin all over his homogenized face.

772
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,400
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made.

773
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,160
It's not just the doorway to doom.

774
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,320
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

775
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,860
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

776
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,240
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

777
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,300
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

778
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,900
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

779
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,800
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

780
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:50,520
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

781
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,600
Not off.

782
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,820
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

783
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,640
In his back pocket. Just you try it.

784
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,160
Bob is a clump of mud.

785
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,740
Bob is a paper quail.

786
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,860
Bob is things that don't always run.

787
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,240
Bob is masking tape.

788
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,500
Bob is a ball.

789
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,380
Bob is a ballpoint pen.

790
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,360
Bob is a rooster.

791
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,400
And Bob is a hen.

792
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:35,580
I don't know why they're saying, I don't poke bottles that have lives and they're squirming in it.

793
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,040
They're trying to take over everything.

794
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,380
Don't.

795
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,100
Bob.

796
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,300
Bob!

797
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,460
We want Bob! Where's Bob? We want Bob!

798
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,040
Right now!

799
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,360
We want Bob!

800
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,660
Okay.

801
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,800
Bob's probably not gonna be here in physical manifestation.

802
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,600
Oh, honey, where is Bob?

803
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,220
He's everywhere.

804
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:06,220
Check yourself and feel if you're Bob-gland and make sure it's overactive like it's supposed to be.

805
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,520
This is the headquarters for the Church of the Subgenius.

806
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,780
No, wait a minute.

807
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,520
No, wait a minute. I love that area.

808
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,240
And I...

809
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,800
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.

810
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,100
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained with expert...

811
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:38,980
men of vision, men such as you, Doctor, gathered here, exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success.

812
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,360
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead of the others.

813
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,980
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.

814
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,180
Well, there you have it.

815
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,080
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?

816
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:03,800
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such, we can accomplish wonders.

817
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,640
Like any other church!

818
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,980
Like any other church!

819
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,360
The Church of the Subgenius!

820
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,360
The Church has divine tenets!

821
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,360
Divine tenets!

822
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,160
Divine rules!

823
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,980
Divine rules!

824
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,420
Divine orders!

825
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,940
Divine orders!

826
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,000
First rule of the subgenius church is...

827
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,100
First rule of the subgenius church is...

828
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,480
Too much!

829
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,020
Too much!

830
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,100
Is always better than not enough!

831
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,720
Is always better than not enough!

832
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,280
Can I get a too much?

833
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,840
Can I get a too much?

834
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,160
Is it always better?

835
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,320
Is it always better than...

836
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,040
Praise God!

837
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,660
Praise God!

838
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,820
Hello, all.

839
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,840
Welcome to the End Times.

840
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,460
In today's End Time Essay,

841
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,960
we will be covering the following.

842
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,820
the difference between us and the bullfram and the bloodyhead launcher society itself

843
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,320
as seen here in our first slide the bloodyhead launcher society

844
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,580
goes on forever there is no end and there's no use resisting

845
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:16,580
time look at those heads fall in slow motion just bouncing down the celestial stairs

846
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,560
yes dear friends those are the things i want to tell you about today

847
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,580
or parables about the less traveled path

848
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:31,940
bob gives you the bulldozers you need to pave your own path

849
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,560
ignore those graceful

850
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:39,060
suit and hippos and those ferret space fashion clones are killing me you gotta stand up you gotta

851
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,940
stand up now and you gotta stand up which is under made illegal don't let them whitewash

852
00:44:44,940 --> 00:45:02,980
well forget it for now that's exactly the way they want you to behave so they can have an excuse to

853
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,460
mount their

854
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:09,080
gun turrets against all the supposed friends oh no no no come on keep those thoughts to yourself

855
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:15,240
you shouldn't depress anybody you'll be seen as a downlight spreading bad karma

856
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:21,800
people don't want to be reminded of it huh yes i think i'm a this is the theme of the neurotic 80s

857
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,580
well mr the human race is cracking up maybe you don't the toxic waste of the me generation

858
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,520
temple

859
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,560
then the cars

860
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,360
which hunters are back

861
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:31,780
today

862
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,180
only this time

863
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:33,560
only this time

864
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,740
They're out for us.

865
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,920
Physical perfection and mental vacuousness make the perfect set.

866
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,420
Oh, but don't bomb us out.

867
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,100
We want to have fun.

868
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:50,380
Just watch that softcore porno soda commercial work your boring job.

869
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:56,840
On some occasions, Baphomet seems to be associated with an apparition of a bearded head.

870
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:03,080
In any case, we found mosquito evidence for the charge of secret service.

871
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,060
Well?

872
00:46:33,080 --> 00:47:02,600
In any case, we found mosquito evidence for the charge of secret service.

873
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:33,060
In any case, we found mosquito evidence for the charge of secret service.

874
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,840
How do I know I'm here?

875
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,440
Not in some very lonely place.

876
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,080
How do I know I'm not...

877
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,840
Got a problem?

878
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,720
Bring it to the friendly people.

879
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,200
People touching people.

880
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,700
People rubbing against people.

881
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,560
People developing the nuclear first try capability to incinerate people.

882
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,220
Sound like a flash in the pan?

883
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,220
It's gotta be.

884
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,460
You don't settle for less.

885
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,380
You don't have to.

886
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,080
You're you.

887
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,780
And you've got needs bigger and more earth-shaking than your grandfather could have dreamed.

888
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,160
How do we keep bringing them to you, year after year, bigger and better?

889
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,260
By using the technology of tomorrow on the consumers of today.

890
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:28,960
The now people.

891
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,560
People on the go.

892
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:30,840
People on the go.

893
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,880
Going from smart...

894
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,920
Shopper to new low value in the time it takes to dial our number.

895
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,440
Call now, won't you?

896
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,860
For more of what you've come to expect from us.

897
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:44,860
Style.

898
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,560
Mood.

899
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,240
A certain dependable kind of image.

900
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,180
An image of the way you'd like people to be.

901
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,280
Passive.

902
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:56,640
Pretty.

903
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,740
White.

904
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,800
As white as the complexion of our finest women.

905
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,040
Grown right here by our special process.

906
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,380
As white as the hair of God.

907
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,180
White as it was in life.

908
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,140
As white as the blank sheet on which we write your mind.

909
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,180
Who are we?

910
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,080
We're the happy people.

911
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,200
Happy to live in a world of images.

912
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,180
Images of war.

913
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:27,660
Family.

914
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,380
Crime.

915
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,660
Fun images.

916
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,060
That help rinse away...

917
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,020
Unsightly self-images.

918
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,900
So you can get away from the privacy of your own home.

919
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,740
After all, aren't you what everything's here for?

920
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,800
You're what we're here for.

921
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,480
That's why we made everything.

922
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,180
And that's why everything made you.

923
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:59,860
And that's why you made us.

924
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:02,820
Who?

925
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:03,200
We?

926
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,640
We're the money people.

927
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,920
The people who take your money.

928
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,180
No more money hassling.

929
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,360
But what about little Dicky, you say?

930
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,040
What's little Dicky gonna do when you're working late

931
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,200
and Wilma's minding the fort and Sis is in and out?

932
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,780
Put away those straps and buckles.

933
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,160
Dicky's safe with us.

934
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,620
He's even learning to speak again.

935
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,660
Our way.

936
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,980
Best of all, he's safe with the people who know what it is you want from a world.

937
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:39,860
Simplicity.

938
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,100
Reliability.

939
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,880
A world you can go to without worrying about whether your money is safe.

940
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,640
You know, when we first got into this business, we didn't know much more than you.

941
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,740
Like you, we thought there was a world out there.

942
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,540
A world of value.

943
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,980
A world that needed meaning.

944
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,720
Beauty.

945
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,840
Love.

946
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,780
A world that needed a better product.

947
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,280
Uh-uh.

948
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,940
There's just you.

949
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,220
And you want to know something.

950
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:32,560
You want to know just exactly what it is you're supposed to do.

951
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,300
You don't really care why.

952
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,040
Just so long as it's the right thing.

953
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,260
It's natural.

954
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,920
Everyone wants to do the right thing.

955
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,580
But sometimes it's hard to know just what the right thing is.

956
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,360
Let's say you're black.

957
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,380
And you've just lost both your arms and legs defending U.S. interests in El Salvador.

958
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,060
You'll come home and get thrown in jail for life for beating up four people.

959
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,000
Or white cops.

960
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,900
You want to know just exactly what is it I'm supposed to feel.

961
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,520
We can't give you all the answers.

962
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,200
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.

963
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:23,240
At our labs, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.

964
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,100
Love.

965
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,140
Children.

966
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,340
God.

967
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:36,660
And the purest blend of money your needs can buy grown right here by our special process.

968
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,880
A process in use since our first mom and pop operation.

969
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,120
Who are we?

970
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,120
We're the normal people.

971
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,440
That was Michael Pepe.

972
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,280
Yes, Michael Pepe.

973
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,620
Remember that name, folks.

974
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:03,320
off his tape, Life Itself, The Greatest Tips of Michael Pepe.

975
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,200
You can find out more about Michael Pepe

976
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,340
and more creatures like that

977
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,980
from the Church of the Subgenius.

978
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,260
We'll give that Fox number at the end of the broadcast.

979
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,900
I am, I am to come, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am to come.

980
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,740
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am to come.

981
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,420
I am, I am, I am to come, I am.

982
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,520
Dynamic overdrive.

983
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,360
I'm operating in 10,000 revolutions.

984
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,580
My motor is being preserved

985
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:51,240
because I'm operating in supernatural overdrive.

986
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,940
I am certain you know what reality is.

987
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,320
No matter what I do to change it,

988
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,460
Normal I remain

989
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,620
Normal can be just as bad

990
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,900
As riding in a wheelchair

991
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,940
Today, serious heresy

992
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:19,680
is a deviant state of consciousness.

993
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,020
Not so much deviant opinions

994
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,920
as having a kind of experience

995
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:34,120
which is different from regular experience.

996
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,520
We are taught what experiences are permissible.

997
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:45,500
And therefore, if a person has so-called strange experiences

998
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,960
and endeavors to communicate these experiences to other people,

999
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,940
he is looked at in a very odd way and asked,

1000
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,120
are you feeling all right?

1001
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,380
Because people feel

1002
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:57,900
that they are not feeling all right.

1003
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:57,900


1004
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,820
They feel distinctly uncomfortable

1005
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,520
when they realize that they're in the presence of someone

1006
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,260
who's experiencing the world

1007
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,820
in a rather different way from themselves.

1008
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,440
They call in question

1009
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,140
as to whether this person is indeed human.

1010
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,920
A cigar or something.

1011
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,960
They look like a human being,

1012
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,640
but because the state of experience is so different,

1013
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,380
you wonder whether they really are.

1014
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,500
And in rather the same way,

1015
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,760
in a very everyday kind of circumstance,

1016
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,860
when you're sitting in a bar drinking

1017
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,120
and you find you have a drunk next to you,

1018
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,240
and he turns to you and says,

1019
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,000
I say,

1020
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:45,360
and you sort of move your stool a little way away from this man,

1021
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:52,260
because he's become in some way what we mean by non-human.

1022
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,380
We expect a high of about 65 degrees tomorrow,

1023
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,380
increasingly cloudy skies once again,

1024
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,760
with some rain in the forecast.

1025
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,000
So I found this little niche, crawled in,

1026
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,400
and I must say I'm happy.

1027
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,660
All right, boys.

1028
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,260
Bob's got you hooked.

1029
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,280
Bob's got a monkey on your back.

1030
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,180
Hey, you know that...

1031
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,420
Bob's doing something spooky again, ain't he?

1032
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,820
That's what you're listening to, right?

1033
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,280
Yeah.

1034
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,680
Yeah.

1035
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,140
That's the kind of Bob that comes up out of the shadows.

1036
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,180
The kind of Bob that follows you home.

1037
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,940
The kind of Bob that calls you home.

1038
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,540
And they look at that and it hangs on the ceiling.

1039
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,340
Hey, let's kill Bob.

1040
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,700
I got...

1041
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:45,000
I saw these hot dogs, Bob,

1042
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,540
and they're like...

1043
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:55,480
When my daddy got killed with a baseball,

1044
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,500
a baseball,

1045
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,000
because those are the kind they sold there.

1046
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,380
Ohio.

1047
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,140
Ohio.

1048
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,660
She's gone to Ohio.

1049
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,720
They've got paddle wheels there.

1050
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,240
Paddle wheels.

1051
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,480
Paddle wheels.

1052
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:31,600
Bigger than a Panzer tank, Bob.

1053
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,800
Bigger than a...

1054
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:35,860
a...

1055
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,700
Panzer...

1056
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:39,900
tank.

1057
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,680
Bob.

1058
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,020
Ohio.

1059
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,400
And...

1060
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,160
Ohio.

1061
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,560
You got Ohio.

1062
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,000
Ohio.

1063
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,620
Ohio.

1064
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:55,580


1065
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:56,060
Ohio.

1066
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,000
Woww.

1067
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,560
Neither one was milked.

1068
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:01,840
Don't think I ever snuck a regular...

1069
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,860
into this place.

1070
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,880
This whole country was...

1071
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:04,880


1072
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:04,880


1073
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,640
to being fucked with all fucking money.

1074
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,760
But he will never give a fuck.

1075
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,160
Balance for me.

1076
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,160


1077
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,160


1078
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,520
The man of the century said everything was exploreable and careful and turned all the

1079
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:17,520


1080
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:17,520


1081
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:17,520


1082
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:26,420
He's a dickey Ange quote. He's a dickey Ange quote and i said that... He was at home guys, don't fuck with me man. I don't think we can get you around if you don't dumb stuff to our host but i dont know how many people keep saying all these shit man unsaid.bruh. supper då boation

1083
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,040
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

1084
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,160
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

1085
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,920
Christianity is stupid.

1086
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,860
Christianity is stupid.

1087
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,040
Christianity is stupid.

1088
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,280
Christianity is stupid.

1089
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,780
Christianity is stupid.

1090
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,880
Christianity is stupid.

1091
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:01,880


1092
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:12,740
Oh dear friends, and now we come down near the end of an hour of slack with this song, this offensive song from negative land.

1093
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,740
I must admit, this is just really disgraceful.

1094
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,260
Friends, that P.O. box, you can write that down.

1095
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,500

1098
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,380
Thank you for listening, dear friends.

1099
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,580
Give up!

1100
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,780
Christianity is stupid.

1101
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,520
Christianity is stupid.

1102
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,480
Christianity is stupid.

1103
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,380
Christianity is stupid.

1104
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,380
Christianity is stupid.

1105
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,580
Give up!

1106
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:56,820
Give up!

1107
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,960
Give up!

1108
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,500
Give up!

1109
00:59:59,780 --> 00:59:59,920
Give up!

1110
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:00,100


1111
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:00,580


1112
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:07,820
But in the meantime, friends, draft registration.

1113
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,260
You do have a choice.

1114
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,340
Do you have alternatives to military service?

1115
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,780
I did, flat feet.

1116
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,180
But you may have others.

1117
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:25,240
Talk to one of the trained draft counselors at the War Resisters League for an evaluation of your particular situation.

1118
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,000
It'll cost you nothing to learn the facts, folks.

1119
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,720
Remember, know the facts before you make your decision.

1120
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,880
For draft counseling, call 214-421-1984.

1121
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,440
That's a good number there for a draft counselor.

1122
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,240
421-1984.

1123
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,800
I was number 30 in the lottery.

1124
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:55,780
And they didn't believe any of the lies I told them until finally they looked at my feet and said,

1125
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:01,180
Son, sorry, just too flat-footed for this man's army.

1126
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:08,680
But friends, this is the subgenius hour of slack on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

1127
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:11,560
And sorry, the phone lines aren't working tonight.

1128
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,100
So we can't take your prayer requests right now.

1129
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,920
I mean, they just, they flat-out aren't working, friends.

1130
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,340
You're gonna have to, they're trying, they're trying.

1131
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:29,520
But you're gonna have to pray, you're gonna have to, you know, put something important in an important place and think about it and pray.

1132
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,120
And, and say things like,

1133
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,820
Scra-ra-ra-ra-ra-apple.

1134
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,880
Scra-ra-ra-ra-ra-apple.

1135
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,180
Scra-ra-ra-ra-ra-apple.

1136
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,380
Scra-ra-ra-ra-ra-apple.

1137
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,360
Scra-ra-ra-ra-ra-apple.

1138
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,480
Scra-ra-ra-ra-ra-apple.
