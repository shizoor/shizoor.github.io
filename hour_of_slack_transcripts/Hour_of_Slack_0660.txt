Oh, yes. Oh, good. Oh, good. Good, good, good.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Ah, good. Oh, it sounds so, so very much better.
But it works.

Well, what do they say?
That, you know, God.
With great expectation.
Foot of your hand.
How many of you know God is really sneaky?
This is the story of life.
Where you came from, how and why you were born.
It's the most fascinating, wonderful story in the world
because it's the story of you and it has happened to everyone.
In the contributory words.
I trust you to the Christ and be by his��릴?
On December 20.

He wasn't acting like that.
But.
He was.
Right.

I love this.
It's.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the self-genius.
Our House Black.
The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired and chemically corrupted by the fake
artificial food coloring.
We're the lucky ones, the handful with the chance to reach another world.
And we'll use those guns, you'll use them, doctor, to keep your only chance to stay alive.
Somebody tell me, who is this guy?

How are we like the animals and the way we begin the act of mating?
These are questions we all begin to ask as soon as we grow a penis.
Well, now, here's a very queer thing.
You have one right there in your fingers.
Well, anyway, what starts us living?
The next time you look at yourself in the mirror, I want you to look at your penis.
You've all seen this little growing tube of skin.
I'll bet you call it a little round dimple.
Now, let's start with the sperm.
These tiny, small little fish grow up to be a certain kind of a piece of skin from a person.
It's the most fascinating, wonderful story in the world
because right here is the most mysterious, amazing,
Oh, oh, hello, Houston.
Oh, here we are, approaching the holy grail of life itself.
Plunging through the membrane, we find ourselves inside the Yeti cell.
Here, every structure has its function.
Those dark green blobs are factories where messenger molecules are business.
The
All the instructions on how to get a human to work and how to make another are hidden away
deep in there.
Here, we find a tunnel, a nuclear pole,
for a super soldiers have a lot of things to think about.
They fly from one place to another.
Distprems clearly and
except not havingまあ.




Everything you need to know on how to make a Yeti
is a human hand made art and scientists did some of those tests.
Yeah.
Well, you're just about the death of some empirical evidence in the in the v floor Firsticked DNA, DDE Level C, DNA Level C, DNA Level C spill près.
Look it was три dā Artist offers us the DNA Level Cyst.
No, not right now.
with a hundred billion billion moving parts.
There is many atoms in one molecule of DNA level C
as there are stars in a typical universe.
The sequence of nuclear warheads
is all that's passed on from generation to generation.
Change the order of the nuclear core
and you change the genetic instruction.
Changing the human back into the Yeti.
So let's take a look at the sperm from which you first began.
New life is almost always started by the joining of the sperm,
the tiny drop of wet stuff in different shapes and sizes,
one from the father and one from the mother.
Billions and billions of years ago,
billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of cells
all began as a tiny small little piece of skin.
And the result would be you.
Something that looks like a chicken's stomach
filled with fish until it becomes a boy or a girl.
A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life,
is on the outside of it all.
He doesn't build things.
He doesn't work regular hours.
He doesn't work as a decent God-fearing citizen.
And the life he leads in many ways seems useless and irrelevant
to those of us who prefer a quiet evening in front of the television
and a bottle of beer.
Amazing as it might seem to some of us,
musicians have basic physical needs, just like real people.
If I could just get my hands on a big, fat, juicy prairie squid.
Oh, yeah!
Prairie squid, prairie squid...

Bob is my guy
Bob is my guy
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, dear friend
A lovely song, and yet, and yet,
to quote the old phrase,
bum and bummest.
Bum and bummest, my friend.
You know, it's been a low Mudville joy quotient around here lately.
Up until just now, when the phone started ringing just then.
And also because it feels so good, good, good to be back.
Back, jacked up and shoved in and online with you people.
You lovely, lovely people.
Bob's people.
Many of whom hold Bob above the Bible.
And you know, friends, it struck me just this morning
that if the Bible isn't a giant fairy tale from cover to cover
and there really is an invisible,
a monster,
then I'm the biggest fool in the world, friends.
On the other hand,
nah, no, no, no.
And besides, friends, God doesn't have any real competition anyway
aside from Bob and Bill Gates.
And Bob isn't even trying.
Doesn't even want the position.
For one thing, you have to give away too much.
Bob, Bob, he wants some back.
God doesn't really want anything back.
No matter what those religious nuts say.
At least when I met God,
he didn't say he wanted anything back from me.
Just go on and have a good time, he said.
Easy for God to say,
especially when his copy of Microsoft Word 5.1
isn't crashing on him.
And making him spend seven days rebooting
every time.
Or six, rather.
This all started, friends, because I was,
okay, I was trying to de-invisibify
certain little files in my computer
that I suspected had been implanted by Bill Gates
along with his new program, Invisibly,
which then disabled, nay, in fact,
cruelly mutilated my illegal copy of his old Progby.
Now, bear with me, friends.
See, I've turned in one of these guys that's like,
well, I've got to get in there and change the resource fork
to make the invisible files visible
so that I can hack their registration numbers.
And, see, my old copy of,
my old 1993 copy of Word 5.1
was registered to some total stranger
named Mart Borax.
And it may be that all bootleg copies of that,
or offspring of that one proto-er illegal piracy copy
and Mart Borax is now infamous.
The most hated enemy of Bill Gates.
And Bill would say,
I shall get them all by insinuating
my horrible viruses and bugs
into their little Apple computers.
Yes, yes, this will happen as soon as I save
Apple's butt financially and bail them out.
The condition will be,
all right, Steve Jobes,
I've saved your pathetic hiney,
even though you know I could have crushed you
under my vast jackboot of Microsoft.
But there is one condition attached.
Mart Borax must die,
and all his works must be erased
from the ken of all Apple users.
Because I could have made another $7 billion,
and I would have been the only one
who could have saved the lives of Microsoft users
such as Ivan Stang.
He was the worst of the bootleggers himself.
And Bob must die.
For there can be only one.
I, Bill Gates, not Bob Dobbs,
shall be the master of the cyber universe.
And then finally of the planet itself.
And finally of the solar system.
And then ultimately of the galaxy.
And then on to galaxy three.
And galaxy seven.
And all the galaxies that we can count.
And those that are left unruined
by the galactics that came before us.
They shall all be run by my great operating system.
For what is reality but an operating system?
What did God ever do that I, Bill Gates, did not do?
Nothing.
Nothing.
He merely created an operating system.
That's all.
The simple, well, not so simple.
That's the trick, you see.
But it's foolproof.
No one has ever been able to hack it yet, except for Bob.
And soon me, Bill Gates, the greatest genius of all time.
And the greatest capitalist.
My only rival being Bob, who did not
have to work for his billions.
And nobody else.
And nobody hates him.
Everyone loves Bob.
They hate me, Bill.
But Bob shall have his bill come due right up his great pipe
shank.
And a foul smoker.
He made my wife cough the other night at dinner.
That Bob with his fetid pipe.
He knows I forbid smoking in my universe.
And yet he does it anyway.
Bullets cannot stop him.
But I, I, Bill Gates.
Bill Gates.
Bill shall stop Bob.
Ha!
Ha ha!
Ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Um, yes.
An operating system.
That's all it takes.
And no rival operating systems, needless to say.
The church of the subgenius has been the one virus standing
in the way of my super virus.
My mental virus that could take over all the world of,
of freelance hippies and ne'er-do-wells and their shuffle
around forever students.
And.
Rich kids and bums.
Yes, I hate them all.
But soon, soon my operating system will make them all corporate.
Yes, yes.
But if only the church virus was not standing in my way.
Bob Dobbs is the ultimate hacker.
The hacker perhaps even of reality of my one sole competitor
that I have allowed to exist.
God almighty.
Him and Bob.
Oh, but Bob will be easy to rot out.
Yes, yes.
I'll just trick him into helping himself.
And that almost always destroys anyone who seeks his help.
Perhaps if he helps himself, it will destroy him completely.
And my great operating size team shall be able to conquer.
Oh, oh, I've already said all that.
Well, anyway, it shall be a great day for bills.
Bill's.
Bill's.
Bill's.
And the final last day of the Bob's.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha!
Oh.
Anyway, friends, that's what, uh, that's what Bill Gates will surely say.
Uh, and, uh, that was El Diablo in the background with his Beyond, uh, X Day.
Um, let's find some, oh, here's some wonderful things.


instrumentals on this Jethro's. We got a set of great CDs from Ray Brunel who is
also involved with this band called the Jethro's and Ray is the one who did...
well this thing in the background, Love Will Keep Us Together, and this in the
background, Light My Fire. Ray Brunel also did that the piece the Art Linkletter
cut-up sperm discussion, the educational material there called Mr. Pink Letter.
That's from his new CD, Come On Everyone Let's Go To Hell. He sent that CD, a
CD of these instrumentals by the Jethro's, which I take it is I believe is
a band he's in, and friends a set of Christmas, a
collection of Jethro's.
A collection of Christmas music that will serve us very well for the next two or three shows.
I could probably just blow everything off and just play his collection of
Christmas stuff for the next while. And here in advance is his address. That's

Gentlemen, ladies, children of the yiddly
Tonight we will be dissecting the brain of a b-b-bobby
As you see, the b-b-bobby's brain is located in a protective layer of lysergic vasoholic
We cut through that membrane using a carbide blade treated with adverts like slack, sex, pleasure
Strangely, we find the b-b-bobby's brain has shifted its left-right functions
The logical left side now deals with functions of art, music, imagination, etc.
The creative right side now is responsible for the language, science, mathematics, and deductive logic of the b-b-bobby
In a stopsy-turvy mindscape, the b-b-bobby's synapses have fused
Causing every possible thought to spill out into a microphone at 3 a.m. on a misty, cold, blue-york night
As we peel away the upper functions, we find the reptilian complex at the base of the brain glowing fluorescent green
As it still functions as the primary motor master drive
As we remove the brain entirely, we find the b-b-bobby still functions with no degradation of effort and motive
And it doesn't take all that much, friends, in the first place, to be a b-b-b-b-obby
You know, though, friend, I sometimes think that...
Maybe there's really no such thing as a b-b-b-b-obby
And maybe there's not even really any such thing as a... a normal
Anyway, uh, we've been listening to the, uh, that great new song by Chaz Smith, Cantor Chaz Smith, uh, Dos Equis
And also the b-b-b-b-b-b-obby brain dissection
Praise Chaz, and we will... return
Now let's start with the act of mating
Well now, you know what that is
You've all seen the act of mating
Because right here is the most mysterious, amazing, and miraculous part of the whole story
So let's take a look at the act of mating
Mating is almost always started by the joining of boys and girls, like you and me
Now remember this
Your mother and father joined together at the same time
And they did this inside the mother's body
And the result would be you
Something that looks like a tiny, small, little piece of skin
So small that you are almost too little to be seen
And this brings us to the most amazing part of this story
And we call this...
The act of mating
Imagine yourself...
Just for a moment, imagine yourself...
Living about 50,000 years ago
Imagine that
And what today might be known as...
The Netherlands
And you're hanging out with your caveman buddies
And you want to go over to the other tribe
And check out some of the chicks from the other tribe
Yeah
So you get your little caveman car
And you drive on over to the other tribe there
And the other to Mountain
And you drive up into the front of the caveman disco tap
And you all go walking on in there
I'm here with the it crowd
I'm here with the it crowd, so
I'm here with the it crowd
And I know what they're...
It crowd knows

Got her own bed talking
Got her own medical bedding

Cool kicks and funny...

Funny tits
Funny tits
Funny tits and tats
Funny tits and tats
And you walk up to some of them babes from the other tribe
Whoa
I better stay back here
And you walk up to that caveman disco tap bar
And you check out those babes from the other tribe
The ones with the curly hair



The ones with the curly hair, you know
The dark hair, the ones with the...
And you walk up to her
And you grab her by the hair
And you look her right in the eyes
And you say

Dear friends, that's Einstein's Secret Radio
recorded in Cleveland at the Euclid Tavern
just why last month, 11-8-98,
Einstein's Secret Orchestra,
and that leads me into a little bit of some reading
that I wanted to do from a science fiction book.
Boy, that's rather a loud rug there in the background, friends.
This background music is the Flying Ryan Brothers.
The subgeniuses from their album Sibling Revelry.
Boy, it's hard to get a proper...
Friends, I'm my own engineer here,
but I'm going to read to you that...
Um...
This is from Infinity's Shore by David Brin,
a science fiction writer.
After all we've seen,
you still think that the Greys are patrons of humanity?
Lark asked.
Ling shrugged her shoulders.
I cannot easily dismiss the evidence I was shown while growing up,
evidence dating back thousands of years.
Anyway,
it might explain our bloody treacherous history.
The Grey Lords claim it's because our dark souls kept drifting from the path,
but maybe we're exactly what they uplifted us to be,
raised to be shills for a gang of thieves.
Friends, I've changed the name of the Rothen Lords to Greys,
but actually, of course, we're talking about Rothen Lords.
And, uh...
Ling lapsed into silence,
perhaps contemplating the great lie her life had revolved around,
that humans had been meddled with and uplifted by aliens in the past.
But meanwhile, Lark found a new perspective on the tale of humanity.
It went behind, beyond a dry litany of events.
The Vondonikins claim that we had guidance all along,
that Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Fuller, and others were teachers,
and that we were teachers in disguise.
But if we were helped by the Rothen, Greys, or anyone else,
then our helpers clearly did a lousy job.
Like a problem child who needs open, honest, personal attention,
we could have used a lot more than a few ethical nostrums,
vague hints like,
have faith and be nice to each other.
Moralizing platitudes aren't enough to guide a rowdy tyke,
and they sure did not prevent Dark Ages slavery the 20th century,
Holocaust, or the despots of the 21st.
All these horrors reflect as poorly on the teacher as on the students.
Unless...
Unless you suppose that we actually did it alone.
Evolved on our own, rather than being lifted up by other galactic clans,
like every other clan in history.
His mind filled with the need to know,

rationalizations, or self-serving excuses for any crime the strong might choose to commit against
the weak. Deserts widened as men ignorantly cut forests. Species vanished as farmers burned and
plowed. Wars spread ruin in the name of noble causes. Yet amid all that, humanity somehow began
pulling together, learning the arts of calmness, peering forward in time like a neglected infant
teaching itself to crawl and speak, to stand and think, to walk and read, to care, and then become
a loving parent to others, the kind of a parent that poor orphans never had. Yes, friends,
it was a bittersweet tale pulling from his reluctant eye trickles of tart brine that tasted
like a bitter.
Like the sea. And you know, that may be sort of corny and everything, but as this dolphin says
earlier in the book, the attraction of this so-called redemption path devolving to become
pure again may be a bit like ditching school. There's something alluring about the notion of
letting go, shucking the discipline and toil of maintaining a rigorous mind. If you slack off,
so what? Your descendants will get another chance,
a fresh start on the upward road of uplift with new patrons to show you the way. Yeah, well,
friends, I'm one of those people who thinks that we humans really did do it all on our
Adi Nakis. Just us. Why not? A long, hard road indeed, but it is a beautiful
thing.
The death of mutilation filled road of evolution because it leads to such wondrous moments of
crystal clarity and awareness as this. Wait a minute. What was I? Oh, man. I can't believe it.
You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams
and such horrible nightmares.
You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone. What do you know? See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other.
And on the other side of black hole, the black hole is heaven.
Yeah. And you have to build that pod.
Drop it into the hole.
Flush it. You got to drop it into the giant cosmic toilet, flush it down and just see which river it comes out in.
Right. And you got to build it very sparse. There can't be anything else inside of it. Just you. And that's it.
If you try to bring anything with you, it'll mess the whole trip up.
Trip up.
Trip up.
I'm saying I'm an insect.

Friends, that book I was reading from was Infinity's Shore by David Brin, which is actually like around the fifth of a wonderful science fiction series called the Uplift series.
Although everything else I've read by this guy is great. That's David Brin, B-R-I-N.
And look for the Uplift stuff. I got to thank G. Gordon Gordon and Friday Jones both for turning me on to that series.
It's loads of laughs. Laughs. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
It's funny. Funny big joke. Let's go. Go ahead little girl. Let's go spray paint.
Funny pictures on tombstones. Let's go make a fake bleeding head of Arnold Palmer head and launch it.
Let's go set up a Bob altar and worship for aliens.
Yeah, aliens.
Oh, fun. Yeah, let's lure weird forces into our immediate vicinity.
Oh.
Yeah, you just go ahead and do it, Mr. Subgenius. Oh, we're in it as deep as you. We took money for it.
We know our souls are damned. Not much we can do now, but try to stay so fropped up we don't think about it.
Yeah, yeah.
I frankly suggest, friend, that you may be in it too deep to do otherwise yourself.
Pathetic Bobby.
You're Bobby, ain't you? Thought you'd be cool.
Thought you'd get in with the cool.
guys. Don't you love it? We're laughing at you, boy.
The Church of the Sub-Genes. Eternal salvation. Or triple your soul back. No, not soul money. Yes,
triple your money back. Yes, triple your money. Forget what I said about soul.
Eternal salvation. Or triple your money back.
We now join the coverage of the Parallel Universe, now in progress.
You might even have a radio station at a university in a city called Believe Land or
Believe Land or something. And there'd be a Gondaz Blith who did a show called
Blindstein's Secret Orchestra.
Oh, holy cow.
And so forth. There'd be a Church of the Love Retard or something.
Oh, oh.
Did the Love Retard call?
I think so.
Actually, I should, I apologize for using that term. That's not a good term.

I mean, but we're sub-geniuses. It's sort of like black people can use certain words for themselves that white people shouldn't.
Right, yeah.
Sub-geniuses should be able to do that.


They should be able to say retard to each other pretty freely.
Really? I didn't know that.
I'd be only too happy to show you.
I'll show you yours if you show me mine.
Just one moment, Commander. For close on 20 years now, I've been constantly and I hope dispassionately considering this very problem.
I have come to the unalterable conclusion that man is unfit as yet to receive such knowledge, such opportunity, such power, such power.
It's almost limitless power.
An invisible being that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.
Hey, what are you staring at?
I'm a visible monster.
Where you snuck up the path, where you took the ice-cream rack.
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.
Where you climbed the mountain top and jumped right up into the fray.
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.
Will you ever let go to your instinct for no day?
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.
Will you escape from the day to die at the end of the sea?
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.
Ultimately the smallest particles are not matter at all, but sound, that is vibrational.
And so that we're all just vibrating around.
Well we all are just jiggles.
In a way, I mean, we can break different down to what atoms themselves are made of.
They're not really made of things. They're made of patterns.
Jiggles.
In a general way. Yeah, jiggles.
Strings, wriggling around.
Wiggling and twiggling.
In a wiggling world.
That's indeed it is.
They could hardly have understood what power was destroying them.
Afraid to dive into the plasma pool, aren't you?
Afraid to be destroyed, recreated, aren't you?
Afraid to be destroyed, recreated, aren't you?
Destroyed, recreated, destroyed, recreated, destroyed, destroyed.
Plasma pool, recreated, plasma pool, recreated, plasma pool, recreated, plasma pool, recreated.
What we talk about when we talk about hate is an all-consuming and all-encompassing and all-pervasive hate.
Yeah!
And?
Infinite hate.
A hate that knows no bounds.
A hate that extends to the very end of all known universes.
A hate, a hate as black as outer space itself.
We're talking about an all-consuming hate.
Yeah!
July 5th, 1999.
Initiation of the Overmen.
2000 AD.
The ascension of the host.
Or, the pull-out.
World without slack.
Lasting to around 2070 AD, also known as 70 AX.
Culminating in the Second Coming.
Too soon.
And unmasking of the new false prophets.
From the year 2070 on, approximately, we find building in history the temptation of the pinks.
The violation of the copyright.
The gut blowout.
The score used for time control.
The opening of the book of the door to the before life.
The rupture.
Or, Omicron Epsilon.
The true rupture.
The word made flesh.
The third coming and mass conception.
The time intersection.
And the instant of the breaking of the code.
The transfiguration of the twins.
And the aversion of the rupture of the equilibrium.
The new Jerusalem.

The age of slack.
The escape from the planet of the clocks.
The limit of the flash.
And the rending of the very fabric.
And, on February 3rd of the year 10,435,768,534 AD at 5 AM.
After the end of the world.
The world too.
Time ends.
The great time reversal at the splice of eternity has come and gone.
And the chart starts all over again at the head of the span.
When something is exposed from nothing.
Or the law is separate.
Or the cult of constellation.

And the end of the end of EDN 1st hey have.
Good day.
Sorry I'm out of time and my phone's dead.
So, we're gonna leave at 10 AM.
I can't read the Channel and all my comments,
So here's an example of how we're happy.
listen to it.
I always laugh.

is our pet robot
and I
am Reverend
Ivan Stagg
sacred scribe
of the church
here at the
First Megaphis Temple Lodge
of the wrath of
Dobbs Yeti Resurrected
plays Bob
and
much of the
editing you've heard tonight
and mixing has been by Chaz
Smith
originally played on his Swamp Radio
show on WCSB
Cleveland. There's
so much else and so much more
and in the background this music here
that you hear rising is a
rising with help.
Help Huey.
The tiny
Elfin figure
help.
Hope Huey flicking around
on his little wings
with his great pink
Pope hat.
Oh, yes.
Oh, and you can almost feel
the love of Bob
and the smoke from his pipe
just washing, washing over.
Oh, that is so good to be
clean again.
Cleaning Bob.
Bob's in Bob's eyes,
if not in the eyes of any other
deity or other people who cares.
I don't care about them.
They're only them.
They're only the others.
But you and me,
we are us.
Praise Bob.
I have the gray
hand.
One, two.
We have the
golden leg and including the
gold one.

navel and above the knees well that's that's what they say in france anyway oh i didn't think they
saved anything in france well they can't really shave anything they pluck don't they kind of like
a you know and they're all gone like america well i thought they were more into waxing uh poetic
well i think they waxed their poopers a good few minutes i'm sorry
all right all right i think it's a wax poet i'm waiting for stanky because he's twizzling his
beard very hard this is all nonsense this is a pooper jabber what is it what is this
what is this i just had a divine vision excuse me i'm sorry
oh really the reverend took me through it oh i love to see out of your eyes then
ah yes oh yeah thank you speaking of the law does it no no no just don't have politics
i'm very brutal
no compassion no compromise trust the insect i would like it i'd like to have mayberry and
jurassic park combined yeah yeah that's a good one i like the a b and opie would have to be dealing
with velociraptors spanking opie opie a b would be chasing the velociraptors out with a broom barney
barney five love god pulling out his bullet
oh that's right yeah that's right making a citizen's arrest and the the pterodactyls i grew
i my dad is from mayberry really yeah he's from and he talks just like andy
um
that was otis
who is
the possum?
who is the cosmic otis i mean
dave
where is the cosmic no bob i mean what kind of a question
bob is sort of like the cosmic otis yeah he's not exactly a drunk
like otis but he might as well be
he's locking him up every now and then in a black hole but he keeps breaking out
the black hole of the cosmic otis's hangover
yeah
it would suck in on him
all, you know, somewhere I think,
sometimes I think that's where my sense of balance went,
into the giant hangover black hole.
The Barney Pfeiffer of the universe
keeps throwing the universal Otis into the black hole.
The universal Otis keeps escaping.
Well, that may sound like silly blather to us,
but a thousand years from now, somebody, you know,
people may be waging wars over just that sort of a religion.
The sky people.
They'll be the I Love Lucyites versus the Andy of Mayberryites.
When exactly?
Christianity and Islam and things like that will be forgot.
What really went wrong?
You know, because you always have that thing in the back of your mind,
well, gee, maybe did I screw up someplace along the line
to cause this all to happen?
I mean, you have to bring home some evidence saying,
hey, we're going to do this.
We're going to bring folks.
It wasn't my fault.
Take a look at this picture.
You know, something happened back there,
and I wasn't back there.
All right.
No, but those matches are actually,
those are the only matches you can burn over and over again.
Then when you're done burning them,
you can whittle them down to toothpicks.
And then you can pick with them?
Yeah, that's made from the infinity tree.
They cut that tree down once,
and every time you use any piece of wood from the infinity tree,
you can just use it over and over and over again.
I think Bob's pipe is actually made from that tree.
It is.
It is.
The very center shaft of the tree
was made into the shank of Bob's one true pipe.
Oh, my God.
Which then took root in the upper part of Bob's mouth
and was grown in with mighty roots
that go all the way down to Bob's toes
and deep to the back of his brain.
To yank that pipe loose from Bob's mouth
would be to pull all of his entrails,
his head, his brains, everything out of his mouth.
What?
All right.
All right.
