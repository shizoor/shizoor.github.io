1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,460
Test, test, test.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,880
Is everyone still alive?

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,860
Has there been a terrible disaster?

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,140
I hope not.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,640
I see some things moving, little VU meters and lights flashing.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,320
It's a disaster area, I tell you.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,080
A disaster area.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,440
Actually, part of Ohio is a disaster area, and we're heading there tomorrow.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,920
Let's see.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,000
Ah, yes.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,580
I hear me and...

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,920
Where did I...

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,000
Is that yours?

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:36,880
Yes, it's mine.

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,540
Oh, okay.

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,340
I wasn't hearing that.

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,300
Friends, that was all.

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,220
We did that on purpose.

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,500
That's what you call radio comedy.

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,040
It's a technical thing.

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:58,160
It's a humorous, satirical, making fun of amateur college radio type yahoos, yahoos, and so forth.

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,820
Let's see.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,400
Let's see how...

24
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,380
Ah, I hear the music.

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,260
In fact, the music from The Abominable Snowman, 1957.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,800
Main titles.

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,920
Dr. Hal is here.

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,300
He agrees that's a good choice.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,020
We've started a lot of shows that way.

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,820
And friends, you're now listening to the hour of slack, number 1,368.

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,220
1,368.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,500
8.

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:29,720
8.

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,980
Yes, I believe it's hour of slack number 1,68.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,380
I'm going to play some media barrage stuff.

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,780
And Dave will be calling in shortly.

37
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,260
Oh.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,660
Dr. Hal will be here with us for...

39
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,560
I am here before you.

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,480
He is before...

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:55,740
And Princess Wee is here so that there's someone nice that's important on a radio show.

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,520
Because otherwise it's all just...

43
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,060
Ah!

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,780
Elvis!

45
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,640
Prism!

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,340
Yeah!

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:26,420
Please Subscribe, blonde.

48
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,840
Bob won't solve your problems, but he will help you to blow them off.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,780
You can't use Bob as a crutch because he's already using you as a crutch, my friend.

50
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,000
Praise Bob!

51
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,180
Praise Bob!

52
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,480
Praise Bob!

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,780
Praise Bob!

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,740
Praise Bob!

55
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,760
Praise Bob!

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,980
Bob!

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,280


58
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:02,600
Bob!

59
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,280
Bob!

60
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,680
Bob!

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,620
It's just Bob!

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,200
It's just Bob!

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,700
It's just Bob!

64
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,060
It's just Bob is what it is!

65
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,860
It's literally Bob!

66
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:11,920
Bob!

67
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,500
Bob!

68
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,280
Bob!

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,760
Hello there!

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,120
Flying saucer.

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,900
Flying saucer.

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,280
Saucers.

73
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,040
Flying saucers.

74
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,560
Now, am I crazy?

75
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,340
Yeah.

76
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,200
Yeah, something like that.

77
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,560
So I'm crazy.

78
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,380
Yes!

79
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,040
Hahaha.

80
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,320
Okay.

81
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,340
I am crazy.

82
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:38,820
Yeah.

83
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,780
The saucer.

84
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,480
Flying saucer.

85
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,040
Flying saucer.

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,740
The saucer.

87
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,560
The saucer.

88
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,220
The saucer.

89
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,160
Flying saucer.

90
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,140
Flying saucer.

91
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,040
Flying saucer.

92
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,840
I thought I was going crazy!

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,340
Yeah, why not?

94
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

95
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,460
Okay.

96
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:50,880
Ha.

97
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,500
Ha.

98
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,420
Within five years, the United States, as we know it, will cease to exist.

99
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,660
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

100
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:10,900
Yes.

101
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,040
Praise the Lord.

102
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,200
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

103
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,380
Amen.

104
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,100
They're going to get worse and worse.

105
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:21,960
What?

106
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,660
Oh, God.

107
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,600
It is real.

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,900
Okay, I know you all think that.

109
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,680
You think you want to know what's going on.

110
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,880
That's okay.

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
So I saw this thing coming.

112
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,240
I saw this thing coming to me.

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,600
I didn't know what it was, but it looked funny.

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:49,880
Hahaha.

115
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,480
There were deceptions which have surrounded our space program.

116
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,880
You're thinking,

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,420
this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants.

118
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,540
It must have been very disconcerting for them to cross millions of miles of space only to

119
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,380
be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

120
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,440
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects as those which were first called flying saucers

121
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,800
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals who let their imaginations run

122
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,920
away with their veracity.

123
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,860
By 1950, some of these characters were beginning to become very popular.

124
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,760
They began to spin their stories of fantastic conversations with alleged space people.

125
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,940
Some of them expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

126
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,580
Suddenly everything went black and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little

127
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,480
tiny room where nobody was listening to me.

128
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,620
And I was talking to this hot little plush felt red rubber tip microphone and not hearing

129
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,600
a thing and seeing only little tiny lights and wondering why I was strapped to this chair

130
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,720
and put into the studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly.

131
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:58,840
I was wondering why I was strapped to this chair and put into the studio that seemed

132
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:58,840


133
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,800
to be rotating very rapidly.

134
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,160
I was wondering why I was strapped to this chair and put into the studio that seemed

135
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,160


136
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,280
And this little thing was moving.

137
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,280


138
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,280


139
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,280


140
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,440
And it was a small man with a swollen head and hideously deformed eyes sitting behind

141
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,280
the console pushing the buttons while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body.

142
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,740
And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me and I couldn't figure out

143
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,900
why I was sitting there.

144
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,280
And they didn't say anything.

145
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,820
They just kept flashing those lights at me and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

146
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,900
And the man with the funny head, the leader, the man with the strange grin and the pipe.

147
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,840
Well, I just had a good time.

148
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:28,840


149
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,860
I just wanted to know, do you want to be in the church or out of the church and where's

150
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,060
your wallet?

151
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,300
Look at that.

152
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,200
The DC9 pushed the button.

153
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,400
Yeah.

154
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,860
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up and it wasn't really a dream until I saw these

155
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,980
sacred nasal positions and suddenly it all came back to me.

156
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,500
And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life when they put

157
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,420
me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me and made me talk and talk and

158
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,420


159
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,140
Well, it's only an hour and a half tonight, mister.

160
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,740
And talk and talk.

161
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,680
Because you only paid for an hour and a half.

162
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,080
And talk.

163
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,080


164
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:08,080
Of all the worlds that the intelligences on Mars could see and study, only our own

165
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,240
warm Earth, where there are titanic drifts of lava and ice with hydrogen flaming at

166
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,720
the tops, where the atmospheric pressure is terrible, it has no air, it's green with the

167
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,020
methane gas and ammonia vapor.

168
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,720
Spacecraft entered the moon's gravitational field in the Cetra.

169
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:27,720


170
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,520
The moon's gravitational field is one sixth segment of the flight.

171
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,700
The gravity of the moon is one sixth of that on Earth.

172
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:42,260
The orbit around the moon was flown 66 miles above the moon's surface at 6,000 miles an

173
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,500
hour.

174
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,620
At 10 after 9, the beeping began.

175
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,840
Went down to the reserve fence, watched through binoculars and we did see this thing.

176
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,700
It's about the size of the moon with a small crescent at the bottom that's about the size

177
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:57,880
of a star.

178
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,120
Well lit like starlight.

179
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,240
The top is a dark gray mass.

180
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
It came down through the trees, whatever it was.

181
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,020
Have you ever heard of one?

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,440
Have you ever been in one?

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,400
Have you ever seen one?

184
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,060
Have you by television ever seen one?

185
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,900
If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this side of heaven.

186
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,800
The people from this Earth have already seen some of their spacecraft, which they call

187
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,900
flying saucers.

188
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,680
And other flying objects which they cannot describe.

189
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,120
These objects are real and are spacecraft.

190
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,360
Total collapse of world civilization.

191
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:48,080
July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m. to be exact, the men from Planet X, as the news media will

192
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,620
call them, will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses, the true believer subgeniuses, up into the

193
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,680
escape vessels of the sex gods.

194
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:14,180
Even to carry a fewolly lo Transit, basicgel BLT.

195

Closed Captioning by 그 hesitateuby

196
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,320
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

197
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,240
And that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

198
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,260
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

199
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,160
In this temple lodge of the Church of the Subgenius of Little Rock,

200
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,000
and before we begin this sacred spouting,

201
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,900
I think that we should all bow our heads and let's all have a minute of noise.

202
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,560
Ah!

203
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:57,680


204
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,200
Playgoers, I bid you welcome.

205
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:14,000
The theater is a temple, and we are here to worship the gods of comedy and tragedy.

206
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,800
Tonight, I am pleased to announce a comedy.

207
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,860
We shall employ every device we know in our desire to divert you.

208
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,720
Something familiar, something peculiar.

209
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,120
Something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

210
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,160
Something appealing, something appalling.

211
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,080
Something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

212
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,360
Nothing with kings, nothing with crowns.

213
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,020
Bring down the lovers, liars and clowns.

214
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,420
Old sit you.

215
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,880
New variations, new complications.

216
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,420
Nothing portentous or polite.

217
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,980
Tragedy tomorrow, comedy tonight.

218
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,880
Something convulsive.

219
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,180
Ah!

220
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,060
Something repulsive.

221
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,620
Yeehaw!

222
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,040
Something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

223
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,720
Yeehaw!

224
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,300
Something aesthetic.

225
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,660
Something frenetic.

226
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,660
Something for everyone.

227
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:27,660


228
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,720
Everyone, a comedy tonight.

229
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,440
Nothing with gods, nothing with fate.

230
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Weighty affairs will just have to wait.

231
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,400
Nothing that's formal.

232
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,640
Nothing that's normal.

233
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,480
No recitations to recite.

234
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,320
Open up the curtains!

235
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,160
Comedy tonight!

236
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,840
Comedy tonight!

237
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,200
Comedy tonight!

238
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,480
Next ringer ateter.

239
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,160
Comedy.

240
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,280
Comedy tonight.

241
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,460
Close the fine.

242
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,180
What's the right time?

243
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,520
And now, the entire company.

244
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,060
This is where Lonesome Cowboy Dave is supposed to call in.

245
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,500
The entire company.

246
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,500
Well, now, give it a chance. Give it a chance.

247
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,240
He'll call. He'll call. I know he'll call.

248
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,440
Something familiar. Something peculiar.

249
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,620
Something for everybody. Comedy tonight.

250
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,520
Something that's gaudy. Something that's moody.

251
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,160
Something for everybody.

252
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,200
Everybody. Comedy tonight.

253
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,880
Nothing that's grim. Nothing that's Greek.

254
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,100
She plays Medea later this week.

255
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,820
Stunning surprises. Coming disguises.

256
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,720
Hundreds of actors out of sight.

257
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Pantaloons and tunics.

258
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,280
Coruscants and eunuchs.

259
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,240
Funerals and chases.

260
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,180
Battles and bases.

261
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,180
Handlers.

262
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,540
Horrors.

263
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,400
Cupidity.

264
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,220
Timidity.

265
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,320
Mistakes.

266
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,120
Reigns.

267
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,600
Rhymes.

268
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,020
Lines.

269
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,240
Tumblers. Grumblers. Bumblers. Fumblers.

270
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,820
The royal curse.

271
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,160
No Trojan horse.

272
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,680
And a happy ending, of course.

273
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,380
Goodness and badness.

274
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,460
And in this madness.

275
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,800
This time it all turns out all right.

276
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,660
And we leave tomorrow.

277
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,080
This story is part of the John Lewis program.

278
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,860
Reicism is pioneered,

279
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:46,880
which means...

280
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:46,880


281
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,060
No.

282
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,560
A future is far away.

283
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:06,640
We ought to say something.

284
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,040
songs on that. That's from

285
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,540
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the

286
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,200
Forum. Yes.

287
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,740
I saw the Richard Lester movie of that

288
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,640
when it came out and thought, I want to

289
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,620
do something like that myself someday.

290
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,560
It's an excellent

291
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,700
movie. As you know, he had

292
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
people living in those sets for weeks

293
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,640
before he started filming to give them

294
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,280
the lived-in look.

295
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,620
And it was based on

296
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,920
Rome of,

297
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,780
you know, fairly into the

298
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,520
imperial age,

299
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,260
not in Republican Rome,

300
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,000
so they had late Roman Empire

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,080
outfits on and everything.

302
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,600
But the tiniest

303
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,100
details were provided with

304
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,980
fastidious historical

305
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,780
accuracy.

306
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,700
They could still stick in

307
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,300
anachronistic jokes like, was one

308
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,380
a good year? And so on.

309
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,460
Did you happen to pick up on

310
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,320
when Zero Mostel does

311
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,460
a perfect imitation of John Barrymore

312
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,620
as Mr. Hyde?

313
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,120
In A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum?

314
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,020
Yes. He's plotting and planning something.

315
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,900
And he turns around.

316
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,220
He does that.

317
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,220
If only the radio audience could see me.

318
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,040
But instead, they'll see Dave.

319
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,280
They will?

320
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,780
They'll see them in their bad dreams.

321
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,780
I see Dave. Well, I hear Dave

322
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,300
and it's almost synesthesia.

323
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,700
I see, but I cannot speak.

324
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,100
Nor can I hear.

325
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,740
My pipes are bent.

326
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,960
I see great

327
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,400
buildings falling.

328
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,780
I see

329
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,640
grapes and arbors all

330
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,080
burning in the night.

331
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,040
Huge flames engulfing the world.

332
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,900
I see

333
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,000
arbors burning.

334
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,660
Look well upon your

335
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,260
city.

336
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,620
Observe its beauty.

337
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,900
For soon it will be

338
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
rubble and ashes.

339
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,040
But until then

340
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,440
it will be a beautiful city.

341
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,820
Actually,

342
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,160
speaking of rubble and ashes.

343
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,420
Yeah, I'm telling it the way it is.

344
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,980
We're going to be heading into

345
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,940
a disaster area tomorrow.

346
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,020
But we're the only area

347
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,000
in that area that doesn't have

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,860
a disaster.

349
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,280
Yes, it's very ironic and yet

350
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,520
perfectly subgenius.

351
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,500
But the

352
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,460
50 next day begins

353
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,580
tomorrow

354
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,600
near Athens, Ohio

355
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,280
at Wisteria Campground.

356
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,640
And it so happens that most of Ohio,

357
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,040
Ohio is a federally

358
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,460
declared disaster area as of yesterday.

359
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,600
In fact, the power,

360
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,240
there was no power at all in Athens

361
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,160
yesterday. They have a

362
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,460
boil alert.

363
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,220
Do you have to boil the water or

364
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,260
you'll get boils all over your body?

365
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,940
Boils and frogs

366
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,600
and the plagues of Egypt.

367
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,100
Boils on your brain of

368
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,340
darkness and the death of the firstborn.

369
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,000
A cloud of

370
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,960
impenetrable darkness

371
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,260
shall descend over all.

372
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,180
And the peaks shall raise

373
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,520
their hands and eyes to heaven and say,

374
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,080
Why us, O Lord?

375
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,920
What have we done

376
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,400
that thou pourest forth the

377
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,420
vessel of thine angers

378
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,400
upon us? And the answer will

379
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,260
come back, you should

380
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,400
have tithed to Bob.

381
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,420
Yay, friend.

382
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,440
What was the old one?

383
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,380
Well, the old one was because you peed

384
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,480
me off. And it was really stupid

385
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,120
in elementary school.

386
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Well, because thou didst eat that

387
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,180
fruit, you know. But aside from that,

388
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,960
I have a few other things against thee,

389
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,920
as it says in the pre-scriptures.

390
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,440
Yes.

391
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,000
Beans or beef? Well, the thing, the

392
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,980
funny thing is, most of the people

393
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,480
in Ohio who are not

394
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,920
dues-paying subgeniuses and are not

395
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,900
attending X-Day festivities

396
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,920
at Wisteria to await the saucers

397
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,960
have no power, have

398
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,760
no internet, no phone,

399
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,580
and there's a terrible heat wave.

400
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,520
So they're dropping like flies.

401
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,620
It's like a preview of X-Day, and

402
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:02,980
yet,

403
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,000
by some strange

404
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,460
chance, the Wisteria

405
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,160
campground still has

406
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,960
power. They never lost power.

407
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,320
They, as far as I know, we were

408
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,080
still getting internet reports from them.

409
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,980
They said the weather was warm,

410
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,400
a little muggy, but cool in the evenings.

411
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,380
So you believe everything you read on the internet,

412
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,660
huh? One of the

413
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,220
chem toilets, or as I

414
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,100
call them, the sweat lodges, or

415
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,180
as Mr. Sister calls them, the

416
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,860
turdus from

417
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,860
Dr. Who.

418
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,740
One of those did blow over.

419
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,240
But that'll all blow over.

420
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,300
Oh, it'll all blow over.

421
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,560
Exploded? A facility

422
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,140
exploded?

423
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,620
It builds

424
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,840
up, you know. It's the X-Day

425
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,620
extra meditation.

426
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,740
Volatile gases.

427
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,500
There's an essay by

428
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,780
Dr. Legume in this year's

429
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,460
program book, which I'm looking at.

430
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,660
Well, Legume, well, that explains

431
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,600
it right there. I think we need go

432
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
no farther to see where

433
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
scatological mysticism,

434
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,820
stiff as a foot, there can be only

435
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,000
one immediate first

436
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
cause. And that

437
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,760
would probably be Dr. Legume's

438
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,600
materials. Correcto.

439
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,000
I would think so. His

440
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,220
materials for incendiary disruption

441
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,100
and agitation. As he

442
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,140
puts it, you've been on the

443
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,800
road for a few days eating a

444
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,240
burger god hunger

445
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,120
or worse, 7-Eleven,

446
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,100
and you've finally made it to

447
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,220
X-Day. You're excited. You're happy

448
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,000
to see old friends and make new ones.

449
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,020
And your natural schedule of

450
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,080
eating, sleeping, drinking, and pretty much

451
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,700
everything else is suddenly altered

452
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,940
significantly. You may not

453
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,100
notice at first, but then suddenly

454
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,960
you'll feel a rumble from deep

455
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,060
in your lower abdomen on the third

456
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,060
day of the event. You'll

457
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,080
grimace and then start counting on your

458
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,040
fingers, trying to remember the

459
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,660
last time you took a

460
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,720
relief. Suddenly,

461
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,040
you will bolt upright and make it

462
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,180
an awkward exit from your circle

463
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
of friends, make a fast beeline,

464
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,920
and you'll be in the nearest excremeditation

465
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,120
chamber. If you're lucky, be

466
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,960
prepared. It may be a long wait

467
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,180
once you get inside. You may

468
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,200
want to bring a book and perhaps that little

469
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,180
cardboard pine tree from your

470
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,420
rearview mirror. But at this

471
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,040
point, the adventure

472
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,120
begins. You are

473
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,780
about to give birth

474
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,580
to the X-Day

475
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,480
object.

476
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
It rhymes with bird. It may

477
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,160
erupt from you with the power of

478
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,200
a thousand exploding suns.

479
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,120
Or more likely, you'll

480
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,260
feel like Auguste Rodin's famous

481
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,920
sculpture, The Thinker,

482
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,900
depicting a man frozen

483
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,180
forever in the act of

484
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,760
dropping a mammoth

485
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,540
deuce.

486
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,180
And don't panic. Embrace the

487
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,140
pain. This is the purest form

488
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,540
of gut blowout.

489
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
Rejoice, pilgrim.

490
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,120
If you get that far, the rest of

491
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,800
the event is all cake.

492
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,900
Well, it's all about evacuation

493
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,820
anyway, isn't it? I mean, getting

494
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,120
the microbes off

495
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,260
the host, so

496
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,720
to speak. Evacuate

497
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,780
or evacuate the evacuation

498
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,120
chamber. As a

499
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,360
former evacuee, I

500
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,180
wonder when it's all going to begin, let

501
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,460
alone when it's all going to end.

502
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
I'm sorry, sir. You're going to have to move

503
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,160
right now.

504
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,400
July 5th, 1998.

505
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
That's when it begins

506
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,740
to end.

507
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,140
And when it starts, that's when we'll know what year

508
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,480
it is. The true 1998.

509
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,700
Is, of course, this year.

510
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,280
The jangling

511
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,120
of the calendar which occurred

512
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,000
in quasi-historic

513
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,440
times.

514
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,560
Was it Justinian or Gregorovitch?

515
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,460
Well, it's neither. It's actually

516
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,120
some jiggery-pokery where they

517
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,360
took out some months, took out some

518
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,260
years, and

519
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,980
then

520
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,560
it was all swept over

521
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,200
by the

522
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,860
whisk broom of history.

523
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,380
And soon,

524
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,960
great forces will awaken

525
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,020
ancient creatures living

526
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,080
deathless lives

527
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,260
in the depths of the ocean

528
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,540
or in the depths of the pond

529
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,460
at Wisteria.

530
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,340
Or in the depths of the earth and waters under the earth.

531
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,060
The great

532
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,660
prehistoric turtle,

533
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,040
old sequoias, the Indians

534
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,500
called him, shall

535
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,220
rise up

536
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,240
and

537
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,160
start his

538
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,520
march towards

539
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,820
Pomeroy and other great

540
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,700
metroplexes.

541
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,720
Yes, he is.

542
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,640
I had a dream, too.

543
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,400
Just as Godzilla attacked Tokyo,

544
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,940
old sequoia

545
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,720
struck the same fear into the denizens

546
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,100
of Pomeroy, Ohio.

547
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,900
Right now, he's lurking and biding

548
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,400
his time.

549
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,560
He created a tortoise

550
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,620
which is no longer a tortoise,

551
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,720
but instead a fighting creature,

552
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,280
an animal with much

553
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,460
rancor and able to kill

554
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,800
a whole small town

555
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,700
with one bite.

556
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,100
If you notice here on the left,

557
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,700
this picture of a sequoia shows

558
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,140
three large fangs

559
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,000
disguised as nuclear weapons.

560
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,160
That can never be.

561
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,320
They have no teeth.

562
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,760
They just have a sharp

563
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,820
shearing edge which can crunch

564
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,320
through flesh and bone.

565
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,400
Look at him go.

566
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,720
With incredible fighting force.

567
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,700
There's a comic book about

568
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,320
old sequoia

569
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,440
in the subject.

570
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,480
A genius X-Day program book

571
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,160
which you cannot see.

572
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,900
Beware old sequoia's jaws.

573
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,640
You know old sequoia, do you?

574
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,780
A being from the center of the earth.

575
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,420
He will rise from the depths

576
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,080
and wreak his vengeance.

577
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,300
Young, young, young.

578
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,980
He never dies.

579
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,840
He is immortal.

580
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,740
Battening on the blood of

581
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,160
thousands of generations,

582
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,420
he has grown swollen

583
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,200
and evil, festering

584
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,240
in the bottom of his prehistoric

585
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,160
sump pit.

586
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,680
And now the brown

587
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,240
exudations that rise to the

588
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,820
surface, thought to be walnut

589
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,540
oil, are actually a distillation

590
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,640
of the pre-digested

591
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,600
blood of thousands

592
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
of hapless human beings.

593
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,300
First the sacrifices thrown by the

594
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,860
Native American shamans

595
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,640
into the

596
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,480
unquiet waters.

597
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,340
And then the

598
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,840
interlopers, the pindalikoi,

599
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,140
the white eyes, who came in

600
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,800
countless numbers. These countless

601
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,920
numbers fattened old

602
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,040
sequoia and made him and

603
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,180
his shell greater.

604
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,020
Down in southern Ohio we called them

605
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,880
the Warholden, the white ones.

606
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,120
You guys

607
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
thought it was impossible, but I

608
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,000
captured old sequoia and brought him here

609
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,360
to Piccadilly Circus. Have a look at this.

610
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,540
My God.

611
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,600
But wait.

612
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,040
Sir, I have some important information for you.

613
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,020
Old sequoia, he's an

614
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,680
infant. He's only tiny.

615
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,020
According to our studies, the mother

616
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,980
of old sequoia, who is now rising

617
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,060
out of the ocean, is over

618
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,940
5,000 billion

619
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,980
feet tall.

620
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,840
Good Lord, look at the size

621
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,980
of that thing. What the

622
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,440
ancients called Fastotocolon.

623
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,920
The turtle

624
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,520
mistaken for an island.

625
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,880
But you

626
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,740
noticed I had the soundtrack from

627
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,900
Gorgo in the background. That was what

628
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,200
was leading me to that.

629
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,820
Remember your...

630
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,340
That giant monster's nothing but a baby!

631
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,920
And now his mother's coming to save him!

632
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,120
Run!

633
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,160
His mother does save him in that monster movie.

634
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,200
The mother and baby

635
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,880
walk off, satisfied after having

636
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,420
destroyed the city of London.

637
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,480
And man, in his infinite

638
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,420
foolishness, once again

639
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,960
learns his lesson.

640
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,660
That nature is not

641
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,520
to be tampered with.

642
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,040
There are suddenly things

643
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,360
man was not meant to

644
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,920
understand.

645
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,460
His pineal gland is too small.

646
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,620
The smile on the face of J.R. Bob Dobbs

647
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,940
is one of those things

648
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,360
that no man can understand.

649
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,400
His eyes behold, his eyelids

650
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,040
try the children of men.

651
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,180
What if you used to, like,

652
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,320
look at old sequoia and he'd show his face

653
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,540
and he'd just look exactly like Bob himself?

654
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,680
That would be a

655
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,700
hallucinatory nightmare

656
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,840
for insane

657
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,160
proportions.

658
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,460
It's a distortion of feelings.

659
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,000


660
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,280
It's a distortion of physical and

661
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,760
psychological and scientific facts.

662
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,560
Well, now there's a painting of old

663
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
sequoia on the subgenius 15

664
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:37,980
Yes, there is.

665
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,900
X-day X-day, uh, Facebook page!

666
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,960
They gave him a nice little bowtie.

667
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,800
Yeah, put him on a yellow bowtie

668
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,200
and he looks like a friendly old pogo character.

669
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,020
That's drawn by Dr. Le Guin.

670
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,060
After he's fed, he's friendly enough.

671
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,620
Yeah.

672
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,580
He only takes one subgenius, or pagan, every year.

673
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,360
We've made sure it's been pagan so far.

674
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,100
But they're easy.

675
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,000
But some of the subgenius are not.

676
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,680
Some of the subgeniuses are so well-fatted

677
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,080
and so ripe for his flensing beak.

678
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,720
Oh, well, the pagans are even fatter.

679
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,280
Oh, they are?

680
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,120
Yes, they are.

681
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,700
I thought they were willowy and nubile.

682
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,960
Yeah, to hear them talk, oh yeah,

683
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,500
because they're all on health food,

684
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,280
except that they're not really.

685
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,040
They're really mostly chain smokers.

686
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,720
They eat six pounds of granola per diem.

687
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:23,960
Yeah.

688
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,560
Terrible obesity problems.

689
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,980
And some of them have that condition that calls them a fag.

690
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:30,980


691
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,540
And that causes hair to grow all over their whole body.

692
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:33,940
Hmm.

693
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:34,820
Hirsutism.

694
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,460
Yeah.

695
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,580
It's not like a business or a leisure suitism.

696
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,240
It's a business.

697
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,540
It's hirsutism.

698
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,640
You know, the...

699
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,020
Her and his suitism.

700
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,740
Yes.

701
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,880
That's the way it should be.

702
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,080
Always, boys and girls.

703
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,940
Remember, it's not just a hirsute.

704
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,100
It's a hirsute, too.

705
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,720
But honestly, I find it really strange and exciting

706
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,200
that we're about to head down to southern Ohio

707
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,980
into an actual disaster area,

708
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,260
but we're prepared to camp out

709
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,180
at a campground that happens to be one of the oases

710
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,040
that still has water and light.

711
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,000
No, it's a primitive campground.

712
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,660
They just got all the generators going.

713
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,940
No, they actually didn't lose power there.

714
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,060
They may also have generators.

715
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,580
Power was granted unto the supporters and children of Bob.

716
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,180
Once we get down there...

717
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,180


718
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,660
The planet was taken.

719
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,160
Just the hot air generated by the subgenius radio preachers

720
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,200
doing live hours of slack will power the recorders

721
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,080
and the amplifiers that we're using.

722
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,900
Enough hot air there.

723
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,140
Repent.

724
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,780
Repent of such notable wonders and undertakings.

725
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,460
Nay.

726
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,220
Well, if you're a little bit ecstatic on the line...

727
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,760
We've been getting reports.

728
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,080
Reverend Susie the Floozy is already there.

729
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,880
Reverend Eggplant told us about a tree

730
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,440
that's down on the route I was about to take.

731
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,540
But, friend, it hasn't been too long.

732
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,380
It wasn't big.

733
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,040
We have...

734
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,300
Let's see.

735
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,300
Baptisms will be happening on Saturday.

736
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,320
Provided there's enough of God's reign.

737
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,620
There's going to be two weddings, two legal weddings,

738
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,540
plus the short-duration marriage ceremony

739
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,740
of everyone there to everyone else.

740
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,100
And everything.

741
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,620
And car keys and wallets and things.

742
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,520
They're dogs.

743
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,740
Um...

744
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,220
Andrew the Impaled will be there.

745
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,080
He does the Human Blockhead Act.

746
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,700
Blows fire on everybody.

747
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,220
He's the Pain Clown, we call him.

748
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,540
Some...

749
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,080
You'll like this one, Dr. Howell.

750
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,560
You know, Andrew used to...

751
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,500
His partner, David Apocalypse, who you know,

752
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,520
would sew Andrew's lips shut on stage

753
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
with surgical equipment.

754
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,380
Yes.

755
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,840
Someone always fainted.

756
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,460
Well, Papa Joe Mama witnessed this once.

757
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,920
At a Pittsburgh revival.

758
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,320
And he walked up to Andrew,

759
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,400
who still had his lips sewn shut, and said,

760
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,040
Oh, you know, it seems like that would really hurt.

761
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,520
And Andrew sort of mumbled,

762
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,500
Not enough to come.

763
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,420
Well, there's a quotation for you.

764
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,680
Through sewn lips, he muttered.

765
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,080
Yes.

766
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,800
It didn't hurt enough for him to arrive at...

767
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,000
at, uh, enlightenment.

768
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,160
Well, they also sewed the lips of Imhotep, the mummy.

769
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,580
Together.

770
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,560
And he also had the little loops already built in,

771
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,320
done years ago as puncture marks.

772
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,320
Who, Andrew the Impaled or Imhotep?

773
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:36,620
Both.

774
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,400
Imhotep.

775
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,340
Oh, well, he, uh...

776
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,300
You did not know?

777
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,960
He stole the scroll of Thoth

778
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,120
and had to be suitably punished.

779
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,800
And then there's Reverend Imho Pep,

780
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,800
also known as Michael Pepe.

781
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,840
Michael J. Pepe.

782
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,360
Who, if only someone could sew his lips shut,

783
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,540
there would be peace on the land.

784
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,320
Oh, no, what a mean thing to say.

785
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:56,700
No, I know.

786
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,060
No one said that about you.

787
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,040
Michael actually is one of the most brilliant improv funny guys ever.

788
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,080
Uh...

789
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,700
It's just that...

790
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,280
Let's not go there.

791
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,220
It's just that he's just always on.

792
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,840
The dude's always performing.

793
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,500
Um...

794
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,920
We can't have that.

795
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Actually, Dave, you and Michael Pepe might have a lot in common to talk about someday.

796
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,780
Because he's a right guy.

797
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,140
Actually, he's...

798
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,940
He's, uh, ship-shaping squared away.

799
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,660
This is...

800
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,360
You're talking about his forehead again?

801
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,960
Well, he sets his foreheads against the ignorant hirelings.

802
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,220
But, well, you...

803
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,260
I thought you were referring to his cranial size.

804
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,200
Oh, yeah.

805
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,360
He doesn't have a geranium growing in his cranium.

806
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,860
Not for a while, anyway.

807
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,660
We have some slightly famous guests at X Day.

808
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,060
Reverend Sam Singleton, the atheist evangelist.

809
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,960
He was not a subgenius prior to this,

810
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,660
but he was an atheist evangelist.

811
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:55,760
Huh.

812
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,000
And, uh...

813
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,640
There is an old god, though.

814
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,560
Susie met him at the Atlanta Disbelievers Church.

815
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,820
Um...

816
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,300
The Evolution Control Committee will be there.

817
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,780
They're pretty well known.

818
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,140
Yeah.

819
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,440
And, uh...

820
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:11,900
They're great.

821
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,960
The amino acids, of course.

822
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,280
Tommy Amoeba, the lowest form of life.

823
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,100
Actually, that's not true.

824
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,500
The amoeba is by no means the lowest form of life.

825
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:22,520
Absolutely.

826
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,900
The amoeba is fairly, uh...

827
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,180
Um...

828
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,980
Advanced, really, in the scheme of things.

829
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,140
Oh, wait until you see the footage I have of a really big one, Dr. Howell.

830
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,240
Stangs being a peeking and appearing at their sex lives.

831
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,140
Yeah, we're gonna...

832
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,720
We're gonna be premiering the micro bug porn at 50 next day.

833
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,160
Do some of them have collectivist tendencies?

834
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,400
Oh, I was just wondering.

835
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,780
Some...

836
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,280
I heard that paramecium were Marxists.

837
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,980
They're commies.

838
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,180
They're all a bunch of commies.

839
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,120
They're like bees.

840
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,500
Everything in common.

841
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:51,940
It might as well be bees in a hive.

842
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,720
They just...

843
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,320
It's just a hive mind.

844
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,440
Not much of one.

845
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,360
They even have a hive eye spot.

846
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,620
A hive vacuole.

847
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,260
But they do have urban...

848
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,480
A hive anal pore.

849
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,180
They don't even...

850
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,480
That's all they have is a pore.

851
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,280
A pore old thing.

852
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
It's got an anal pore.

853
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,620
I've got some pretty hot footage of them pouring stuff out of that pore, too.

854
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,020
No, I'm serious.

855
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,860
I'm not kidding.

856
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,220
People laugh, but it's true.

857
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,280
These creatures eat and...

858
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,640
I'm not laughing.

859
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,200
I'm crying.

860
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:23,840
And so forth.

861
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,240
Like, just...

862
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,300
No.

863
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,880
Just like we do.

864
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,040
Well, a little differently than we do.

865
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,900
But who would want to see sub-microscopic creatures poop and stuff like that?

866
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,280
Everybody will.

867
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,020
Everybody.

868
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,220
After our ad campaign comes out, you'll be a dull stick in the mud if you're not up on

869
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,180
every microbial moment.

870
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,820
What we've got to do...

871
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,240
What we want to do here is reinstill a belief, a feeling, a calm.

872
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,160
We want to create a kind of a warmth.

873
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
We want people to know...

874
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,800
We want to make a buck.

875
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
That's what it's all about.

876
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:04,120
A buck and a doe come together and create a new little deer.

877
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,840
That's right.

878
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:07,840


879
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,720
A wee little deer.

880
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,580
Yes, a wee little doe and a mighty stag bucking away.

881
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,840
Oh, those are the movies that we're showing at After Dark.

882
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,460
Yeah, Bambi versus Godzilla.

883
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,020
Those are the stag films?

884
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,140
Yeah.

885
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


886
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


887
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


888
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


889
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


890
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


891
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


892
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


893
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


894
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


895
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


896
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


897
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


898
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


899
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,680
Those are the stag films that we're ordering?

900
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,280
Who said stag films?

901
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,640
Well, I thought you were going to have them, you know, pornographic films like the joke

902
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,660
with the, you know, kiddie porn and just a bunch of cats doing...

903
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:44,400
We in fact do have all nude protists and flagellated protists, ciliated protists.

904
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,040
Wow, flagellated.

905
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,480
Micro animals with nothing on, not wearing a stitch.

906
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,120
You see phylodina rotifers devouring animals.

907
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,120


908
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:58,420
They're devouring algae cells by the dozens and chewing them with their hideous mastax.

909
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,440
That's the jaw within their throat.

910
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,680
Amazing that they got those micro jaws, isn't it?

911
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,600
And they're all nude, they're all real, they're all live.

912
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,700
It's kind men like.

913
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:17,580
And in fact, I did for some of the footage, I took music and sound effects from a real

914
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,420
porno movie.

915
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,100
So you have this funky, crappy, nasty...

916
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,100


917
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,180
1970s porno music and some guy going, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

918
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:39,260
And what you're looking at is two single celled creatures exchanging genetic material end

919
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:39,620
to end.

920
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,320
It's true.

921
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,320
They're completely naked and they've got their bodies and souls bared for all to gaze upon.

922
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,160
Well, it could have just dressed them up a little bit.

923
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,040
I mean, at least to make it more salacious.

924
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,860
You can't show everything first.

925
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,940
You gotta like let them, you know, drop the G and expose a little bit of the evacuation

926
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,600
pour.

927
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,900
Things like that.

928
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,260
You can't just like come right out and put it on the floor.

929
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,560
You can't not see them.

930
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,820
The way they're lit from underneath, they're trans...

931
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,880
You can see every organelle inside those little boogers.

932
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:16,180
I think he'd like Reverend Stang to superimpose those little decency oblongs, you know, those

933
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,320
black rectangles, you know, over the...

934
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:21,780
I don't...

935
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,260
That's a lot of trouble, boy.

936
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:32,500
Now, as I said, we're going deep into a disaster area where most of the people do not...

937
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,120
They don't actually even have fresh water down there in Athens area.

938
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,340
They've been told to boil their water because it's full of those little creatures just like

939
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,100
we were talking about.

940
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,680
Will bugs turn you on or bugs turn on you?

941
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,960
But I have...

942
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,360
But I?

943
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,040
I will be teaching at X Day.

944
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
A survivalist course.

945
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,000
But will they learn?

946
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,420
I'm going to start right now.

947
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,560
Water from animals, for instance.

948
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,380
This is from...

949
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,860
That sounds like the name of a Spanish movie.

950
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,340
Like terrier water.

951
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,600
This is from the SAS...

952
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,620
Water from the center of a dog.

953
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,380
Survival handbook.

954
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,760
It says here, animal eyes contain water which can be extracted by sucking them.

955
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,360
You can't hide those...

956
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,460
Well, there you go.

957
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,380
If anybody's out of water, they can just wander off in the woods and suck a deer's eyeball.

958
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,100
Well, you...

959
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,660
That's the point of this.

960
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,380
It's to remind you that you...

961
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,660
If you're desperate, you can.

962
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Water is everywhere.

963
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,960
All fish contain a drinkable fluid.

964
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,000
Large fish in particular have a reservoir of fresh water along the spine.

965
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,660
Give me two.

966
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,860
However, if the water is dried up, there are very few fish in there.

967
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,980
Tap it by gutting the fish and keeping the fish flat.

968
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,980
Remove the backbone.

969
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,120
Being careful not to spill the liquid.

970
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:44,960
And then...

971
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,520
Drink it!

972
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,980
Now I'm sure if it comes to that, uh...

973
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,080
I'm sure it's not going to be a good idea to drink it.

974
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,080


975
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,080


976
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,080


977
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,760
We'll have alternate strategies in place.

978
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,360
If you need water...

979
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,980
Like what?

980
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,220
That bad.

981
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,600
Like what?

982
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,200
Like eating...

983
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,880
I mean drinking coconut water.

984
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,520
There are no coconuts in Wisteria?

985
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,760
Well, I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.

986
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,660
No, you can buy that stuff all over the place.

987
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,060
It's the latest fad.

988
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,620
Peaches?

989
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,520
People are coconut crazy.

990
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:16,080
Aborigines dig in dry clay pans for the desert frogs that burrow in the clay to keep cool

991
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,520
and survive.

992
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,980
They store water in their bodies and it can be squeezed.

993
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,220
Eww!

994
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,540
Do not, however...

995
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:31,160
You should always skin frogs and toads before you roast them because their skin is often

996
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,720
poisonous.

997
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,400
That's how they protect themselves with a little bit of toxic material in the epidermis

998
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:44,900
or in the case of larger southwestern varieties as we know, Bufo alvarius, in particular, venom

999
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,960
glands, which when properly prepared are highly psychedelic.

1000
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:49,960


1001
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:49,960


1002
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:49,960


1003
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:49,960


1004
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,240
And the key to Aztec ceremonial magic.

1005
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,600
I didn't know that.

1006
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,080
It's absolutely true.

1007
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,460
I should have asked Dr. Howe.

1008
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:04,980
Well, uh, science may not officially agree with me, but I'll give you the facts if you're

1009
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,360
interested in the rundown.

1010
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:14,200
The Colorado river toad, Bufo alvarius, is a rather ungainly fellow, huge, large, about

1011
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,680
the size of a basketball at times.

1012
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,960
But when he jumps, which is only about four foot, his legs are very long.

1013
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:19,960


1014
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,800
His body spreads out in a flopping splat, which covers far more territory than that.

1015
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,640
These ungainly amphibians estivate more than 60 feet underground in the southwestern Sonora

1016
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,500
Desert region.

1017
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:35,740
Wow.

1018
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:41,560
But when the monsoon rain comes, they climb up and then by the thousands, or at least

1019
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,280
they used to, they cover the roads and they cover the desert, croaking and squawking.

1020
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,300
And if you catch them...

1021
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,180
You can squeeze the buboes on the back, the large venom glands.

1022
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,320
It doesn't hurt the toad.

1023
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,760
You squeeze them and the stuff inside, the serum, squirts out.

1024
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,240
Have it land on a sheet of glass, a sheet of cleaned glass.

1025
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,700
It will dry to the consistency of, well, dried semen or rubber cement.

1026
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,700
Then with a clean razor blade, scrape this mixture off.

1027
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,200
Put it in a pipe.

1028
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,360
In which nothing else had ever been smoked.

1029
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,480
And then get a match and sit back in a chair and make sure nobody's going to mess with

1030
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,880
your body for the next half hour.

1031
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:37,320
And in that half hour, you will experience the most intense psychedelic journey that

1032
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,160
can ever be imagined or encompassed.

1033
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,820
And the nice thing about it is it's over in half an hour.

1034
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,460
But you can't do anything while it's happening.

1035
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,140
And then for the next few days, you feel a feeling of...

1036
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,000
Elan, well-being, elation and so forth.

1037
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,980
But this is actually a form of...

1038
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,540
Punishment.

1039
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,720
Of MDMA synthesized by a vertebrated animal, the only one known in existence.

1040
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:12,660
Now, Western money, monetary systems were traditionally based on how much cattle a man owned.

1041
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:17,800
And stamped on gold bars in the ancient world and even in the medieval period,

1042
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,120
was the image of a beast.

1043
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,740
A beef critter.

1044
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,160
A cattle.

1045
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,960
And remember Pecos Bill, the guy who was a famous cowboy?

1046
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,040
Well, our word...

1047
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,800
Pecuniary.

1048
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,000
You see the word, the cattle, Pecos, in there, right?

1049
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,820
So that was our standard of wealth.

1050
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:43,000
But why was it that on the Aztec bars of gold, there was stamped the image of a toad?

1051
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,700
Why would a toad be as valuable to them as cattle are to us?

1052
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,580
They were toad lickers, that's what it is.

1053
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,380
No, stop.

1054
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,060
Stop.

1055
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,720
Do not disseminate that information.

1056
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,380
Licking these toads is fatal.

1057
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,100
That's how they protect themselves.

1058
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,100
The venom can only be smoked.

1059
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,000
Lick...

1060
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,760
If a dog picks up one of these toads in his mouth, which would have to be a pretty big mouth,

1061
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,240
and punctures the venom gland, that dog will die.

1062
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,280
Licking them stops your heart.

1063
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,280
Never lick a toad.

1064
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,400
This misinformation came about because of an Australian movie called Caine Toads.

1065
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,360
In Australian, they do lick...

1066
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,700
It's an excellent movie.

1067
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:27,200
They lick the invasive Caine Toad because its venom is so many hundreds of times lighter

1068
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,820
and less powerful than Bufo Alvarez that you can lick it and get away with it.

1069
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,180
But do not lick a southwestern Colorado River Toad.

1070
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,360
If you're in Oz, you can lick a toad.

1071
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,700
But if you're in Colorado, you're going to have to just rub it and smoke it.

1072
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,420
This is not a call to action, by the way.

1073
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,880
No, I'm simply talking about this in a theoretical fashion.

1074
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,480
Of course, I wouldn't recommend any illegal activity.

1075
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,000
Now, here's something that might be interesting to subgeniuses.

1076
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,180
Sometime, I think it was more than ten years ago,

1077
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:07,300
in Southern California, a science teacher and his wife were arrested, busted,

1078
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,180
for having some of these toads in their possession.

1079
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,140
It is illegal to own them.

1080
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,040
By who?

1081
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,300
I don't know, but they were arrested.

1082
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:22,400
Actually, in Arizona, you can own them if you purchase a fishing license, which costs $18.

1083
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,520
I don't know why that is either, because why would you need...

1084
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,740
What could you possibly expect to catch if you baited your line with one of these immense toads?

1085
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,600
Something on the nature of old sequoia, perhaps.

1086
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,680
But these young...

1087
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,420
Or hippies.

1088
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,040
This young couple, very idealistic, of course lost their teaching job,

1089
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,080
but they said, if only you could understand, if you could smoke this, you could understand,

1090
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,900
it puts you in affinity with all nature.

1091
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,940
It's as if when you breathe, you can feel the land around you breathing in and out,

1092
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,120
the desert and so forth.

1093
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,580
And the authorities said, ah, yeah.

1094
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,920
And this couple's name, their names were Bob and Connie.

1095
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:04,660
Yes.

1096
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,000
Praise Bob.

1097
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,360
I have saved the newspaper article.

1098
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,520
It's in my archives.

1099
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,200
I don't have them with me, of course.

1100
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:12,880
Of course.

1101
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,580
But a Samizdat newspaper.

1102
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:23,940
A Samizdat newspaper was circulated with the private instructions on how to profit from the toad.

1103
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:33,000
And I myself, while in the southern Arizona desert, have gone to great lengths to capture these animals and to perform the experiment.

1104
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,680
Oh, I wonder, you sounded like you were talking from experience.

1105
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:45,400
Well, I'm talking from almost experience, because although I did walk for miles through the desert carrying a cooler,

1106
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:52,500
to contain toads, though I did harvest toads, and I did go to the secret mating grounds of the toads,

1107
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:56,080
which was an incredible experience, hard to believe.

1108
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:56,580
That's hard.

1109
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:03,340
You walk and walk through the desert and you hear them singing, but it doesn't seem to, you don't seem to get any closer.

1110
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,920
You know, I had to do it through the moon, I mean under the moon, but without any light,

1111
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,840
because you're going across private land and somebody might shoot you, and go down through arroyos and up again,

1112
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,380
and not get to the top.

1113
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,020
And you get stuck on the cactus, and all the time you hear this toad noise, and it gets louder and louder,

1114
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:27,540
and when you get there, where the toads by the thousands are mating, the noise is like the roar of a jet engine.

1115
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,160
You wouldn't be able to talk to somebody if that person were near you.

1116
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,820
The sound that these toads make, how to catch them, it's easy.

1117
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:41,380
The moment you turn your light on, they all come hopping toward you, wave after wave of toads.

1118
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,020
Very easy to get them.

1119
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,300
I didn't even have to touch them to get them.

1120
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,140
I just put them into my cooler.

1121
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:56,560
And then the journey in reverse, over the same tough terrain with a cooler full of toads and toad sperm flopping and slopping, you know.

1122
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,680
Stengor must return toad to base camp.

1123
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,480
But here's the bad aspect of the story.

1124
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,920
Wait a minute, how did the toad sperm get involved here?

1125
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,180
You mentioned only the glander scene.

1126
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,220
They were mating.

1127
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:13,700
They are in the mating process, and the entire area, the toad sperm, you just have to see it.

1128
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,900
It's incredible.

1129
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,180
They gather.

1130
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:16,660
The smell is...

1131
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,060
That only happens once.

1132
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,000
The monsoons come in Arizona.

1133
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,380
They rain, the rain comes down so fiercely that it carves new channels.

1134
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:27,240
Flash floods create new arroyos.

1135
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,780
Sometimes they open old graveyards and bring things to light.

1136
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:42,960
But all I can say is I did this, and when I got back and examined the toads, I was not 100% sure that what I had collected was Bufo alvarez.

1137
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,840
They were large, but were they that large?

1138
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,120
They had the venom glands, but were they the right venom glands?

1139
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:55,880
And I'm afraid I decided, well, I ain't gonna smoke no venom from no toad that ain't Bufo alvarez.

1140
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,500
It's like kids that go out and pick any kind of mushroom they find growing on cow flop and then die.

1141
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:06,680
So I did not even collect the venom, and I brought the toads back the next night.

1142
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,040
But I'm still hoping.

1143
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,800
Andrew Weil, M.D., or Weil, how do you pronounce his name?

1144
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,180
Weil.

1145
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,780
Weil suggests smoking this stuff.

1146
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:20,460
And one of these days before I kick the bucket, I'm gonna smoke me some toad juice.

1147
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,700
And I bet there'll be many out there waiting on you.

1148
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,500
This I vow before God.

1149
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,380
Yeah, you heard it right here, folks.

1150
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,680
I'm gonna get me a t-shirt that says I'm gonna smoke me some toad.

1151
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:40,740
Speaking of God, as Takeshi Mishima said, if God didn't want you to join us, he'd have existed.

1152
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:50,380
And as Pantiera Ivakovich said, when life gives you dead horses, beat the hell out of them.

1153
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,720
With a stick.

1154
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,100
When life gives you dead horses, make glue.

1155
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,640
And then sniff it.

1156
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:02,700
You know, I told you about that book by Tatiana Betsucheli.

1157
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:09,640
One thing that one person she talked about in it was, you'll never believe this, tentatively a convenience.

1158
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,160
I'm not surprised.

1159
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:11,680
Really?

1160
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,620
He gets around.

1161
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,880
Oh, really? Okay.

1162
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:19,800
Apparently he's done enough for the European intellectuals to be interested in him, too.

1163
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,540
He was big in Iceland.

1164
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,080
Romania as well.

1165
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:23,960
The 90s, yeah.

1166
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:31,900
Before the fondling the children thing went on, and before they tried to export him, but he was too small then.

1167
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:39,260
Saint tentatively a convenience was an artist who got the Church of the Subgenius in international news for the very first time.

1168
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,520
Yeah, he got us in the papers.

1169
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:41,140
Buy beaters.

1170
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,180
He was beating a dead dog in a sewer culvert.

1171
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,380
Well, it was already dead.

1172
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,060
Sure.

1173
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,620
It was art.

1174
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,460
It was an art project.

1175
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,360
It was the worst smelling art project ever conceived.

1176
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:49,820
Just like that.

1177
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,980
Before they started putting their own feces in art galleries, that is.

1178
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,940
I arrived there as people were pouring out going, don't go in there.

1179
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,920
The cops arrived, and man, it smells bad.

1180
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,880
Those fascist pigs were hassling that righteous dude.

1181
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:11,140
Tentatively, by the way, was tripping walls at the time that he performed this opera.

1182
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:17,860
And then ended up in the Baltimore jail wearing nothing but white grease paint.

1183
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,580
A real trooper.

1184
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,820
All over his whole body.

1185
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,760
That's the name of a novel right there.

1186
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:22,900
Smell the grease paint.

1187
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,960
It's the roar of the crowd.

1188
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:30,100
Now, we're going to be passing through Zanesville on our way into the disaster area.

1189
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,280
That's where the white gray Zanesville.

1190
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,660
And I picked up my first Zane Gray western novel.

1191
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,080
There?

1192
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,120
No.

1193
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:39,620
I...

1194
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,440
Knowing that we were...

1195
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,180
That that was the hometown, or near the hometown, actually, of the famous western author Zane Gray,

1196
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,480
I thought, when I saw one for $4.95 at the supermarket, I thought, I ought to read one of these.

1197
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,340
I'm between books.

1198
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,600
They're pretty competent.

1199
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,480
I'm going to...

1200
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,820
I was really surprised.

1201
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:03,940
It was very dark and noir, and almost Lovecraftian.

1202
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,400
Which I was not expecting from a western.

1203
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,660
But get this.

1204
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,580
Okay, I'm going to read one.

1205
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,540
I'm going to read one paragraph here.

1206
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,660
But it's a hell of a paragraph.

1207
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:20,880
And the game went on with violent slap of card or pound of fist on table, with the slide

1208
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,980
of a bag of gold or the rock-sodden thump of its weight, with savage curses at loss

1209
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:34,300
and strange raw exultation at gain, with hurry and violence, more than all, with the

1210
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,600
wildness of the hour and the wildness of these men drawing close to the end of the game.

1211
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:46,120
Closer and closer to the dread climax that from the beginning had been foreshadowed.

1212
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,120
That's Zane Gray for you.

1213
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:56,380
And it ends with a guy getting a knife stuck into the back of his neck in such a way that

1214
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:01,560
he stays alive just barely until somebody pulls the knife out.

1215
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,780
Yeah, pulling it out.

1216
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,500
Not a good idea.

1217
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,600
That allows his carotid artery to start spewing.

1218
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:08,820
Yep.

1219
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,540
Pulling it out.

1220
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,300
Not a good idea.

1221
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,780
We used to have a PSA at the station.

1222
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:12,740
Huh?

1223
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,440
We used to have a PSA that was in regular rotation at the station about what to do if

1224
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,400
you find a stabbing victim.

1225
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,120
And it said, yeah, do not remove the knife.

1226
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,540
Right.

1227
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,840
Do not pull out the arrow.

1228
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,840
Pull out the knife.

1229
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:26,540
Whatever impales you, it'll do worse to pull it out.

1230
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,940
I know a really grisly story I could tell you, but is this the place?

1231
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,940
Is this the time to tell a hideously grotesque, gory, grisly story?

1232
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,940
If it's under five minutes, this is perfect.

1233
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:38,400
Oh, it's under five minutes.

1234
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,280
Perfect point.

1235
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:44,560
You know how railroad cars couple with the two couplers that come together?

1236
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,180
Yeah.

1237
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,500
I had a Lionel train set.

1238
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:46,960
Yeah.

1239
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,480
Well, the Lionel train set does have that type of couplers.

1240
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,360
Other types, including HO sets, usually have couplers based on European couplers, unless

1241
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,420
you switch them for what they call KT couplers.

1242
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:06,240
But the large couplers on the railroad train are like the end of two pairs of pliers that

1243
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,360
come together and close.

1244
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:15,400
Well, just imagine some old geezer, some old railroad man, who's standing by the boxcar

1245
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:21,600
when suddenly the train moves at the other end and it couples through his body.

1246
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,800
And he's impaled by train couplers through his midsection.

1247
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,720
Yes.

1248
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,380
It's an old story around here.

1249
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:29,960
There's nothing they can do with that guy.

1250
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,600
There are train yards everywhere.

1251
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,220
And when it uncouples, he's going to be dead.

1252
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,340
But he's sort of alive while the couples are coupling.

1253
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:37,340


1254
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:37,340


1255
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:37,340


1256
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:44,320
So he was able to convey his wishes for how he wanted to be treated and so on.

1257
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,100
And then when they uncoupled him, they picked up both halves of him and went home.

1258
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,120
I just love hearing about nice couples like that.

1259
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,380
Yes, this is a story about couples and couplings.

1260
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,060
I've got a couple of stories like that.

1261
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,220
I've got a couple of stories like that.

1262
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,980
... bad too, as people are severed in half by trains toppling from their sides.

1263
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,180
There's a large train yard here and everybody had a relative who they could really not name.

1264
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,080
But it was anecdotal, who was coupled.

1265
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,300
And one was under a lift bridge, an old alcoholic person.

1266
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:20,080
And as the drawbridge came down over the river, it severed his legs right off and they plopped into the water.

1267
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,800
Dr. Howell, I was going to say I was a little disappointed by your story.

1268
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,400
It wasn't anywhere near as stomach-turning as I was hoping.

1269
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,480
Oh, really?

1270
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,740
Oh, a couple of years.

1271
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,100
It's grand fun.

1272
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,220
I thought it was pretty stomach-turning.

1273
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,800
Stomach-piercing.

1274
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,160
You're making me laugh.

1275
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,980
I'm just saying, I was just imagining a whole little tiny bit.

1276
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,000
See the blood and so forth.

1277
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:46,400
But, you know, there's this mortal injury, the spine is swept away, the whole middle of the body is crushed.

1278
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:59,260
But he's kept standing upright and as long as it's coupled inside there, the top part of the body can survive long enough for him to give the instructions to those who must survive him.

1279
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,580
Tell Nellie I loved her.

1280
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,780
Tell her.

1281
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,360
I loved her.

1282
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,820
And she owes me well.

1283
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,940
Nellie is your, isn't that your cow?

1284
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,980
The name of, the name of your old cow?

1285
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,040
I loved her.

1286
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,520
I confess it.

1287
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,780
The one that camped on the golden ingot.

1288
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,760
Oh, Nellie Bell.

1289
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,380
Well, wasn't it Andy Devine's Jeep?

1290
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,180
Anyway, you know, there are many who love too well but not too wisely.

1291
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:34,900
Like the strange accounts of farmers who have relationships with their tractors or other pieces of farm.

1292
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,840
Now we're talking about some disgusting stuff.

1293
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:58,500
Oh yes, this is in the psychosexual area and many are the shocked and traumatized loved ones who have discovered their beloved father or whoever in flagrante delicto with the tractor still running and they have to take his body and cover up what really happened.

1294
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,280
And for these hearty pioneers in the sexual arena.

1295
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,980
One could never tell whether it was the grim reaper or the international harvester.

1296
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:18,680
But there was one case where a farmer actually carried around the picture of his tractor in his wallet and he called it Lucille or something like that.

1297
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,080
Well, this sod buster came to a rather bad end, I'll tell you.

1298
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,520
You see that barn over there?

1299
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,200
I built that barn myself.

1300
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,540
Do they call me Joe the barn builder?

1301
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,580
No, no, no.

1302
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,640
You see that fence over there?

1303
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,840
I built that fence myself.

1304
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,260
But do they call me Joe the fence builder?

1305
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,260


1306
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,480
No, no, no.

1307
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,940
You made us build it and you claimed it.

1308
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,980
But just screw one lousy tractor and...

1309
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,360
Right.

1310
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:44,320
Well, speaking of bad ends, friends, this is the bad end of this show.

1311
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:44,740
It is?

1312
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,180
But it's not...

1313
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,360
It's the end of the hour of slack.

1314
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:47,900
Already?

1315
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,280
But it's not the end of...

1316
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,520
Why, we just got started.

1317
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:51,560
Of evil.

1318
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,760
There was so much to be...

1319
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,800
So much to say.

1320
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,540
We have...

1321
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,420
So much to bring.

1322
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,100
And now our voices must be still.

1323
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:03,240
No, only for a short time while Dr. Sinister takes over the seat.

1324
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:03,260


1325
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:03,260


1326
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:03,960
Oh, very well then.

1327
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,820
We'll be right back after these messages.

1328
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:06,580
Yes.

1329
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,320
Subgenius.com.

1330
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:13,900
Yes, if you're wondering what the hell this is all about, you can look at subgenius.com.

1331
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,900
And if you're wondering about the disaster area and X Day, click on the events button.

1332
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:26,020
And you will find your way to a picture of old C-Quar with a big yellow bow tie and a

1333
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,700
funny little comic book about old C-Quar sitting in a cave.

1334
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,080
Yeah, you'll think it's funny until it happens to you.

1335
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,620
Yes.

1336
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,300
Yeah.

1337
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,740
And so, Dave, I don't know what to tell you.

1338
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,040
What should I tell Dave?

1339
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,140
Call back in five minutes.

1340
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,720
Tell Dave to call back in a little bit.

1341
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,520
Okay.

1342
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,940
What's a little bit?

1343
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,180
Three, four, five, three minutes?

1344
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,140
Five minutes?

1345
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,500
Wait.

1346
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,660
We're going to jibber-jabber a little earlier than normal on synesthesia tonight.

1347
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,540
And...

1348
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,300
About ten minutes?

1349
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,260
Yeah, ten minutes.

1350
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,180
Ten minutes.

1351
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:00,840
About ten minutes, okay.

1352
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,060
Ten minutes.

1353
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:02,060


1354
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:02,060


1355
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,960
Ten minutes.

1356
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,400
Ten minutes.

1357
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,580
I'm going to fade you out, Dave.

1358
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,480
There we go.

1359
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:07,840
Don't fade away, Dave!

1360
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,240
I'm going to start this meaty barrage.

1361
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,580
Two months ago, the observatory issued a press statement that the world was coming to an

1362
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:14,940
end.

1363
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,100
Now, that's the same story the cult of the book of Revelations had been preaching.

1364
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,360
Now, when a scientist backs that up, it's news.

1365
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,280
Our conclusions have nothing to do with the cult.

1366
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,140
Well, today we deal with Bible prophecy.

1367
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,060
But the word of God tells us we can expect nothing but trouble in the world.

1368
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,060


1369
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,060


1370
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,060


1371
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,060


1372
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,060


1373
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,060


1374
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,800
We can expect nothing but trouble and turmoil in the Middle East until our Lord returns

1375
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,860
to be the Prince of Peace.

1376
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:39,980
Bob?

1377
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,740
It's been known for some time that the fossil record contains several very pronounced mass

1378
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:51,560
extinctions, when large numbers of quite unrelated species from all kinds of habitats appear

1379
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,000
to die out during a relatively short period.

1380
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:00,520
You have, say, an asteroid about ten kilometers across impacting on the Earth at a speed of

1381
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,040
about 40 kilometers per second.

1382
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,400
Did you hear what he was saying?

1383
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,120
Did you hear what he was saying?
