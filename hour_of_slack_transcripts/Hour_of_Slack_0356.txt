And last, I have control of your radio tubes.
Uh, and I do too.
Good. This is Ram the Hawk.
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNOM.
Happy, happy, joy, joy.
Happy, happy, joy, joy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.
Keep listening, you idiots.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Else I shall kill you.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Tonight we add another name to the long list of those we have honored.
This truth that I'm about to give you has exploded in power.
Woo!
Woo!
Thank you. Oh, I'm enjoying this.
Buried within the uncharted depths of waters surrounding a group of islands off the 50th parallel
lies man's most formidable challenge.
The awesome awakening of prehistoric monsters longed for extinction.
Ah!
Ah!
Savage and deadly, their one hope is to rule our planet as they once had thousands of years back.
And that ain't all.
Science was baffled and powerless.
This is confusing.
A terror stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.
Well, things are looking up.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
A once proud civilization.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
A nation now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla and his powerful allies.
Bob.
Titan against Titan.
Giant against giant in the most spectacular battle yet.
But things weren't normal.
There were changes.
Ah!
Ah!
Your mother bit me.
I never saw him by like that.
It's a beautiful sight.
Strange.
Fright mode changes.
That night it all started.
Stop doing that.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!


This was the night of the crawling terror.

There's a crack.
It's Candy Frappy.
It's Frappy Candy.
Stop.
Huh?
You're both right.
Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.
Stripes and stripes and stripes of colors, colors, colors, colors, and colors.
Colors that go below infrared and way above ultraviolet.
And the taste?
Candy Frappy Candy.
Candy Frappy.
No, no.









Well, I can see these two won't need any words or worms.
For several days now, I should say, I think.
So don't forget, that's new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

The preceding tape will cause brain damage.
Nothing to fear.
Buy something and inhale its fumes.
Position yourself between a chair and the wall.
And exhale rapidly, causing barking noises throughout the day.
Wiping the area with a lint-free cloth can cause extreme visions.
Such as these.
Lord God, help us obey authority.
Bless our leaders for making us what we are.
This is your word, O Lord of heaven above.
Bless our overlords for protecting us from our wretched selves.
May we be blessed with a lust for submission and guidance.
May we think of the Lord and not of pain.
Authority is great.
Ignorance is bliss.
Peace is war with the devil.
This is the word of God.


This is the word.
Amen.
Welcome to yet another Bulldada Audio Barrage tape.
Volume 1 couldn't possibly hold all the eclectic propaganda needed
to become a complete raving lunatic for Bob.
The audience is now listening to the music of the music of Bob's life.
On this tape, you'll hear rantings from every two-bit B-movie actor ever born.
Cold, precision auto monster boys.
And from hundreds of dysfunctional appointments across our globe.
Music.

Hi there.
How do you do?
I'm your new neighbor, Herman Munster.
Thank you.
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.
Ah!
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.
What the hell are you doing, Lee?
I'm watching Bob.
You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Curry.
What do you think you used to do? You backstabber, you traitor, you...
Snap out of it, bud.
Um, I lost my job. I had a job. Now I don't live on the lawn.
Ah!
I want you to be like me. I want you to worship me. I want you to be like I am.
I want you to enjoy the fearlessness that I have, the courage that I have, the compassion that I have, the love that I have, the all-encompassing mercy that I have.
I want you to be what I am and something greater.
I want you to give you more than I have. I want you to be greater than I am.
And if you don't want to go this route, then go to hell where you want to, but don't bother me.
I want to heal the other mind. Heal my toe, honey. Heal my back. Heal my bottom.
But don't you heal my mind, because my mind is too sick.
Christianity was never based on the idea of an unknown God.
I'm going to cause you to know that you are what Jesus was.
Jesus said that every human being was a God.
It is written that you are God.
I'm a God.
You're a God.
You're a God.
And I'm a God, and I'm going to stay a God until you recognize that you're a God.
And when you recognize you're a God, I shall go back into principle and will not appear as a personality.
You are a God.
But until I see all of you knowing who you are, I'm going to be very much what I am.
God Almighty God.
Call the next defendant.

C. James Allison to the standing.
Silence, Kay.
Yes, your hands are covered with the blood of the thousands of souls that you have murdered.
Murdered?
But I never murdered anyone.
Nod with a sword.
1957, Cynthia anticlimactic date member Professor Warren Roberts Jacobswin casual service He is free.
that you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell
with your malicious tongue.
It would have been a thousand times better
had you murdered them with a sword.
Oh, no.
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.
I only spoke the truth.
No, Kay, you spoke that which you wanted to be true.
But granting that you did only speak the truth,
who gave you license to defame
and destroy the character of others?
The serpent with his venom and his ire,
with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,
with his deadly call and fatal fangs,
is the only fit emblem of the man or woman
who stabs and kills the character of another.
Let your own words condemn you.
May 10th, 1973.
Linda's been saved.
Such a good friend and spiritual help.
Well, when you've known her as long as I have,
you'll really get to know her.
What do you mean?
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life
as you think.
But I'm not one to say anything.
You just call me when you need advice.
Well, I've got a lot to do.
I have to go.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Oh, no.
Well.
I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that.
I don't believe I want any part of it.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
My God, have mercy on me.
I never realized.
Have mercy on me.
You, Kay, with your gossipy tongue,
have driven the babes away from my church.
You who have in your lifetime destroyed the weak,
among my flock.
You never knew what it meant to show mercy.
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?
There is no mercy for you.
You are sentenced to hell where you will be haunted
forever by the souls you sent there.
Oh, no.
I don't want to go to hell.
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I only repeated what I heard.
You didn't know that the most spiritual of all crimes
is the crime of gossip.
Oh, no. I didn't know. You didn't know that the most spiritual of all crimes is the crime of gossip.
Your record will speak for itself.
Oh, no.
But yes, friends, send in that love offering, that check,
addressed to Tammy Faye Dobbs,
daughter of Connie.
Oh, that felt so good.
I forgot.
Wow, look out!
Donuts.
Call her!
Well, call her right outside the building. Come on.
Call her right outside the building. Come on.
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence you had there.
It was almost a half second.
That'll last forever in my memory. First time ever.
Fuck it.
Oh, we got some more!
Why do I feel that they're...
Bergman knew how to use silence.
The silence of the soul.
Sure is nice out here. I hope the boat comes, though.
Fellini knew how to use silence.
Gary said he was here.
Horrible boatman with his grisly hands.
Yeah, I know. Don't touch him.
A giant flaming oar.
Mr. Boatman.
Please, Mr. Boatman.
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue and it's all black and icky.
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.
No, no.
And be prepared to go past my dog, my three-headed dog's cerebrus.
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.
The triple-brained.
Monster which guards the gates, the gateway.
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
What's he reading from?
Yes, I am a way.
It's a B-movie script.
Into eternal sorrow.
I am the way to forsaken people.
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.
It is getting hot in here.
Yeah, I've seen that movie, the Virgil movie.
Made beyond me and beyond time, my son.
Bob and Virgil went several levels.
It's nice out here.
Oh, look out.


Further down into Hell.
Makes you forget all about this shit.

Suddenly, Bob, shifting his pike from one hand to the other,
pulled out from his voluminous ditty-bag a sop of cakes with wine and honey,
fermented, which he threw dexterously into the slavering three mouths of the three-headed monster,
which guarded the cavernous entrance to Fun World.
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet by Satan.
And a mighty belt shook the canine's, uh...
Uh...
Energy.
bulging stomach.
This three-headed
thing
wafted in the air.
That's enough of horrible
horticultural facts from the world of mythology.
His gigantic
postulus scabrous
hide quivered
unspeakably as with canine lust
he scraped his hindquarters across
the floor, howling and dribbling
from all three heads simultaneously.
Huge ticks the size
of small land crabs leap from
his fur-sparced
epidermis.
Suddenly the dog leaped across
the vast expanse of hell
and saddled up to Ivan's leg.
He was forced to be in the show hour after hour.
P-Dog, why did you make me do
that horrible thing?
Yes, the bells of hell
go ting-a-ling-a-ling for you and not
for me.
Take my glands away, King P-Dog.
Bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling
and ring eternally.
Yes, from Cerebus the P-Dog
they all go for Ivan's leg.
Ow! Get that damn little, get those
horrible little poodles off of me!
I hate poodles!
That was Madame Wazonga
and her dancing chihuahuas performing
once again on the subgenius
Hour of Mystery and Darkness.
That was really a beautiful little dance
number, Dr. Howell.
Yeah, you wouldn't think they were
capable of that.
And when's Michael Jackson gonna be on?
You know that there's
a certain song that we have to play
between every other song that we play.
It's called the Tune-Up Song, you know.
Boop!
Yeah.
All that kind of mess.
Elvis Presley and stuff.
Yeah, there we go.
Big ol' rocker there, yeah.
Thank you very much,
thank you very much, yeah.
We sold a million records on that one right there.
And all that bull-mess.
Besides, Frank killed the original album
with a。。 to get fine viewership power!
You made the whole album!
Now all you're listening to
is a cool original album

Just remember,
nothing worse than putting somebody in the corner
when they've tried over and over and over
to do righteousness
and no one received it.
You get them in a corner, they're extremely dangerous.
I want my Slack!
I want my Slack!
Who slacks with Slack definitions
is different.
We're extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous, aren't they?
I think you can sense the hands of these people
that we are a nonviolent people,
but we are extremely dangerous.

If you have the cash,

Slack is not for everyone.
You cannot take my Slack away.
Slack can be taken by prescription.
I want to be free.
You don't have anything on me that I care about.
Everything you have on me, I've let it all hang right out for everybody to see.
You're getting worried about yourself.
I don't mind losing my life. What about you?
I don't mind losing my reputation. What about you?
I don't mind being tortured.
What about you?
I'm just no longer afraid and I've lost interest in this old world of capitalist sin.
Racism, I've lost interest in it.
So if somebody wants to make me stay in it by compromising with filthy-minded people
that cannot even have respect for somebody that would die for even his enemies,
and they want to cause anarchy in our midst,
I would just as soon bring it all to a gallant,
a glorious,
and a glorious screaming in.
Your ultimate goal on this adventure through inner space
will be the very hub of this microcosmic solar system,
the atomic nucleus.
Its capabilities are almost unimaginable.
It is a million times smaller than the atom,
and yet it contains 99% of the atom's weight.
The density of the nucleus is such that if we had one cubic centimeter,
half a teaspoon,
it would weigh 100 million tons.
And at the same time, with 250 units of tetanus-immune globulin human,

Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.
Uh-huh.
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye.
Attaboy, Looper!
Woo-hoo!
Uh, when I was asked to be guest speaker at this luncheon,
I asked myself this.
Who are you, Luther Hage, to be the guest speaker at this luncheon?
I thought about my answer about being the guest speaker for a long time.
What is a guest speaker?
Let me clarify this.
I have been called Brave.
What is Brave?
Let me clarify this.
Of course we all know that it is short for Brave-ery.
That goes without even being said.
But it is also a symbol of another thing.
Uh, well, I don't know if you know, but I just think that it's a symbol of something.

Thank you for having me.
It's real quiet, Dad.
I'll let you... I'll leave it.
I won't say anything unless you listen to it now.
Ah!
Ah!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
What's he doing? Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
For your own listening pleasure,
please be sure that your balance control

Thank you.
I am in aluminum foil now.
I think it's got to be done. I don't think it can be helped.
Oh, oh, oh, ride!
Oh, oh, oh, ride!
Oh, oh, oh, ride!
Well, they thought he was rolling.
Your heart will bump, your nerves will paralyze
as you shall hear the strangest things
that you've ever heard.
That never met your eyes.
They're not that strange, Al.
Yes, you will travel into the chilling,
thrilling, slimy, haunted
radio station.
Just sign on the dotted line,
little boys and girls.
And now you've bought an interest in the
Captain Beefheart Beefsteak Mine.
There's a beautiful vein of pure linguine
running through these rocks, and I want you boys
to have every opportunity to become shareholders
in this money-making project.
Now don't bother to read it, just sign your name
on the dotted line, and why, soon you'll be
a beefsteak tycoon.
I promise you that.

No grain in it.
Oh, oh, oh, ride!
Still there.
Dora.
What, Dora?
Is he laughing at us?
Hey, that's my job!
That's my job.
I just try to help folks.
That's all I do, is try to
come on and help.
Not that the job pays well.
Never has on this planet.
Did you ever notice anybody ever tries to help, we shoot them?
Did you ever notice that?
Ah!
If the risk is little,
the reward is little.
Who the hell are you?
You're welcome.
Tweet.
Where's the tweet?
That ain't no tweet.
Oh, here it comes!
Here it comes!
Look out!
Look out!
Look out!
Look out!
Cleve told me of an incident that happened to him the other day.
He was standing in a nearly deserted Boston subway station.
Tell it, brother.
Tell it.
There was a drunk standing on the other side across from him.
And he said,
What's your name?
And Cleve, not wanting to tell his real name, said,
Bob.
That's right.
He said, Bob.
And the drunk said,
All the best drunks are named Bob.
Bob.






In fact, the greatest drunk on earth is named Bob.
And then that man got down on his hands and knees,
and he licked that third rail.
How many of you listening by radio can lick that third rail?
How many of you have been sitting the way Bob wanted you to?
Huh?
You've just been sitting on your little fannies, your tokuses.
Yes.
Sitting there praising Bob.
Singing hymns to Bob.
But you're afraid to get out there.
What?
P-dog for Bob, huh?
Aren't you being a little harsh with these people?
Oh, you Californians are so laid back.
We're into violence and hate in Texas!
I mean, we thought Bob was a nice guru.
We thought he was a good guy.
We thought he was like, on our side.
Look, we didn't give you all that ammo just to praise him.
Just to praise his sweet name.
I didn't get any ammo.
I got some PCP.
Well,
Well, you'd best be lying.
But I didn't get no ammo.
Well, at least that.
There's little kids in China who don't even get any PCP.
None of the sacred PCP of the church.
Ah, yes.
Many people meet here on the beach to call Sterno.
There's the little Sterno at the bottom of the hall.
Oh, look, I see him now.
He's been poked and prodded awake now by the bad show.
Let's hurt him now.
Subgenius corrupt.
Uh, Energon crystals.
Our muscle's flexing.
Stop snorting those Energon crystals.
Okay, here it comes.
Look out, look out.
Sterno's love muscle is flexing.
Watch out, everybody.
Stand back.
Stand back.
Oh, no!
Excuse me, it bumped into me.
Hey, you thought P-Dawg was ugly.
Don't get any on you.
You hadn't seen nothing until Sterno whipped out of bed.
Whoa, he knocked a hole in the wall.
That damn thing's got three heads, Ivan.
Whoa!
Beat that!
They grow big in Arkansas, don't they?
Only one foreskin's infected, though.
Something unwholesome about that critter.
Don't look at it too close up, little show.
There's kind of a capacity there for, uh, isolation.
Yeah, we thought we'd get as far away as we could
and then give you a call so it's the bad show again.
Well, good.
We're gonna take those chromosomes and DNA fragments
from Subgenius Rue
and somehow mediate a recombination
between those two types of, uh,
just plop them into the protocluster
and let them realign on the wall.
Why not?
Why not?
So we're gonna, we're gonna take the resultant strain
and inject it right into that golfer head.
That's the way it goes.
No!
No!
Don't inject the head!
You'll bring it back to unholy life!
It started to float, nimbus-like, over the golf course,
leaving a trail of sizzling blood.
It's like a little snail trail.
Decomposing tissues to interact with the microorganisms of the soil.
As the head...
floated and levitated along,
it kept uttering the word,
Why?
And it realized its tragic loss
and the tragedy that it had invented for itself
and sunk into a depression.
Oh, mumbling and muttering,
mindlessly champing with its jaws in a...
But listen!
Please listen!
Once upon a time, long, long ago,
a lovely queen sat by her window sewing.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

Dreaming, she pricked her finger with her needle.
Ah!
Some time later, a little daughter was born to the queen.
And she was just as beautiful as the queen had hoped she might be.
Is that a boy or a girl?
Is it a spaghet?
It's a dyke!
No, it's a hippie!
A communist?
Rascals!
A drag queen!
Or a washrag queen!
Probably a speed freak!
Or a pothead!
Or a mutton queen!
Look at her! It's just a whore!
Or maybe a gold digger!
Or she's a hustler!
Or some sort of intellectual!
The happy mother decided to call her baby Snow White.
It could be a bag hag.
Or maybe it's a bee girl.
Snow White dreamed beautiful daydreams about a handsome prince.
Yeah!

I mean, for a little girl, now her happy year!
She could have rushed to her official engagement!
Oh, that game would make usutter children.
Oh yeah?
Uh, I can be sure!
She'd be a nearby model.
And I'd be God's image of the queen,
Bertie Lee will come and steal your dream!

The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.
Interesting. Thanks, Dad.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
What are they doing, Texas?
This is the weekend old drink, the blood of Christian babies.
For more information, you may write Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.
So call now for your free no-obligation information.
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.
Like a lot of women, I've discovered.
Recently, one of my breasts is larger than the other.
And by saying that phrase to you, it will now go out and be stuck in your heads,
thousands of other people's heads, and I'll be free of the curse.
I hope.
It all comes at me. There's too much of it. I can't take it.
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't do one thing at a time.
You just have time to wash.
Mirror, mirror.
On the wall, who is the fairest of us all?
You sure as hell.
Take the princess into the forest and bring me back her heart in this jewel box.
Alone in the forest, Snow White wept with fright.
But she was not really alone, she found.
All the little woodland animals were her friends.
You're all right.
And chirping and chattering happily, they led her to a new home.
Hey, what kind of a place is this?
It was a sweet little, tiny little house in the woods the animals showed Snow White.
Looks like a rogues gallery.
The sink was piled with unwashed dishes, and everything was thickly blanketed with dust.
Shut up, shut up!
You're doping?
They had almost forgotten what the word meant.
She took one bite and sank lifeless to the floor.
And that ain't all.
Now you drop dead, you nitwit.
God bless you.
It's a beautiful thing.
Praise Bob.
Why not?
The man with the plan.
Open the scene up now.
The master of natural world domination.
The most superior mutant.
Marching across history or the face of it.
Well, if you go here on page 45 of the Bay Guardian, you do find there is a whole section of WAD ads,
mutants seeking other mutants and stuff like that.
It's a wonderful, theatrical world.
It used to be cool and lonely to be a mutant, but now everybody's doing it.
Well, I mean, there used to be a time when it was sort of like, you know, a mule.
You cross a mule.
You're a mutant with the normal and you get some sort of mutation.
But now that mutants are doing it with other mutants, it's almost become, I don't know, mainstream.
I know.
It's really sad to see the best minds of our generation doing all that 50 stuff over again the same way they did it back then.
And now, you know, now it's almost like uncool to be anything but mutant, you know.
I mean, it's sort of like...
Well, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, you're saying it, it, it, it, it.
Yeah, exactly.
And on top of that, if you're mutant...
It is.
It's like, be different for the sake of being the same.
Yes, that's right.
We're all different here for the sake of being the same on the air.
And that's really no better than the normal.
I mean, when you get right down to it.
Here on show.
Yeah.
Well, that's why the Church of the...
The Church of the Sogenius is no longer a viable instrument in any of our lives.
Then we may have to just revert to normality as an alternative to mutations.
Well, I think the ultimate thing to be is just to be me.
I just want to be thee.
Not thee, me.
Well, me for ye is thee.
Yeah, but that's the wrong me for you.
You gotta be the you me.
I gotta be the I me.
Well, this is no longer the me generation.
That was last generation.
So perhaps it's the...
Yeah, but I'm sterile.
So, you know, I'm kind of stuck with it.
Well...
If I could reproduce, then I might have a ye generation.
Ye?
Ye, that's true.
No, no, ye.
Ye, that's true.
Right.
These get confusing after a while.
Why not?
Remember Sam, let me ask you.
Bob's number is 999.
Whose number is 911?
So I know who you are.
God bless you.
Hello?
Yeah, how would you like to be mutilated, you mother...
Come on, that's a pretty unprofessional obsession right there.
Well, it's true, but it's all we got.
Well, we'll just have to be cartographers of the head.
And it's our duty to explore the wilderness.
Artillery-like art.
New gray matter preserve.
Just don't look up its neck stump.
You might see something you wish you'd never seen.
It was an ugly sight.
That's pretty romantic, Reverend Stang.
Yeah, I know what you do with that neck stump, Pope Sternodoc's kick-haver.
Well, I've...
I know exactly what you've been doing with that neck stump.
I've detected the potential many times in the past and have been dazzled by the ill-matched,
intimidating circumstances.
But this relationship has provided for me.
It's a breath of abnormalcy amidst a normal atmosphere of, you know, inhaling deeply of the church air.
On the air.
Reverend Sternodoc, would you hang on just a second?
We're going to go to the caller.
Hold on.
Okay.
Sir, I know who you are.
God bless you.
Okay.
We had that nasty caller diverted before we could even get our hooks in.
Well, he's probably trapped in a gas-filled tunnel when he's lifting his head at the
scent of that golfer head.
And we're more and more interested to learn how far this mighty affair might have progressed
tonight.
Might have.
That's the key, I think, for you listeners who are collecting clues, as I'm often doing
the show.
Yes, all you gas-fans trapped out there.
Might have is the grass-fanned caller that would have found the other side to be a possibility.
The clues are buried in the show.
But that board's lit up like a Christmas tree, Commander.
Well, the character and climate of the show, no doubt, have exerted a slight influence on
his actions.
A tidal influence, we would say.
Yeah.
That's true.
At the moment, they've dragged him right out of the room.
That's right.
They're taking him off to the land of the sky-blue waters.
Well, we'll...
The water's best for brewing.
We'll delve deeper and deeper into the more compelling mysteries, which lay beyond those.
Okay.
Okay.





Good night.
Good night.
Take a bad, heavy discussing impression of all the information.
I'm sorry, that was very obvious, but no offense.


I'mões using
Carlischenesehen.
But that many use it with no staffs to stem the outburst.
That, un�이sober from Jan消kaise.
And the Fail processes.

I ask you one question.

with the rest of van Klơöf or refrigerated with you in your next convent to say I was cursed?

by being fitted with the hair of a monkey.
The big question in all this, of course, is are these animals real?
Why don't we catch them?
You must decide, for you are the jury.
It's not my intention to delay this court.
God bless you.
Wouldn't that be weird?
Of course, a lot of folks say, well, what do you believe in, Brother Dave?
I say, I believe in everything.
You don't mean that, yes.
Even that, yes.
Yes, I, yes, yes, I do.
I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth.
I believe in every philosophy, every religion, every ideology, everything that exists.
And that don't give me no room for no arguments.
If the world is wrong, then right your own self.
That's something to think about, sure.
Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness.
And I believe if a man's down, kick him.
That's right.
If he survives it, he has an opportunity to rise above it.
God bless you.
We were afraid there would be too many people on Main Street,
so we walked on down and stood in the grassy slope just this side of the triple underpass.
The president's car turned the corner and started toward us on Elm Street.
There were a lot of motorcycle police in front of the president's car.
My friend was afraid I didn't see the president, so she said,
look, there's the president's car.
Get a picture of him.
He turned to us and waved.
He faced forward again.
I lifted my Polaroid.
Just as I snapped the picture, I heard a shot.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!

That's a pile of horse manure, son.
God bless you.
I don't know.
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humor.
Ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha!
Just because you're not the same
Doesn't mean you're weird or strange
You're just different
Being different
Is being great
You too, isn't that a risk?
Just because you're a different one
There's no telling what you might become
Thinking different
Being different
Is being great
God bless you!
It's not who you aren't.
It's who you are.
And being yourself
Is being great

The show rolls forward!
And the point ises go a-
The Mobiuses go nuts!
ليOD
A hurtling juggernaut that can't be stopped
Why did your stand a unconditional surrender?
But Mike, let's be serious.
And squabble.
Well, all right.
What's a four-letter word for...
Oh, wait.
Hold on.
What's a four-letter word for pronate?
Food.
How about prolapse?
Just prolapsed on me.
Aliment.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Bear with me a moment.
There's a fond analog that...
I'm gazing into the mirror now.
Those simple, bare necessities.
Okay, I'll eat it.
I'll eat it.
Okay, we're going to go with the menu.
It's a punch-up 3-D food.
Okay, well, how about the spooky strips of light
and I'll take the dead moth shining pie.
At Dead Moth Drive-Thru Plaza,
the pie is our profession.
I'll take the fluttered wall soup.
Now available at Waldrug.
And the dipping French woman.
Okay, thanks.
From local slave way.
I'll take a real loony Cajun prune whip, too.
Wait a minute.
Ivan's about to squeeze again.
A memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III
about a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline.
Yeah, it makes me think of Meese, too.
I don't know if it's visual or maybe it's a sense of smell.
You know, basically, ancient sense of smell
just kind of makes you think of Meese when,
well, when the whole building...
It's a little bit of a mess.
...squeezes like that together.
And suddenly it dawned on a crooker friend that...
Wait, is it six o'clock?
Things have changed a bit.
Rappaport hired a long-time Meese friend E. Robert Wallach
to get a...
Oh, yeah.
Well, I just got...
I just went to the bathroom there
and almost finished the stark fifth.
But then I forgot, I turned around,
I flushed it before I even thought about it.
And so more shows are probably going to be backing up the pipes
and coming out of these little microphones.
I need a gift.
Oh, sure.
And I really, I just have no idea what to get him.
I know just what you mean,
and I have just the gift you need,
but I can't sell it.
No cameras of any kind will be allowed.
I will not tolerate any outbursts,
donations,
any talking among yourselves,
any laughter,
nor anything that would interfere
with the nature of the show.


I'm going to have to get a normal,
orderly presentation of testimony.
Oh, a radio!
With your mid-afternoon news.
Well, all of Southern California seems to have sighted another UFO
in today's sunny, smogless skies.
The official response...
...one every three and a third day.
Oh, they put a mic in the station.
Here we go.
Oh, it's coming alive.
Oh, no, it's crawling out of the toilet.
That's Mobius.
Mobius.
Hey, hey, hey, let go of my...
Let go, let go, don't pull me in there!
Oh, God!
Ow!
Oh, fuck!
And children, this is what you get when you eat at Cafe Neutron.
It's immune.
Irradiated food.
Is the new Stark Fist out yet?
Yeah, it's out.
A little listener asking a real question.
Quick, get out of here! Stop it!
Yeah, it's out.
It's worth $40.
But let's go over that again.
Dear friends, the Stark Fist,
the long, long, long awaited Stark Fist of Removal
is indeed almost ready.
It's almost finished, just as we've been saying
for the last two years.
And this time, we really do mean it.
And, uh...
Whoop, there went that...
Shoot, we flushed it away again.
Now I've got to start all over again.
See, you backflush these things,
and there's the little collar.
He's floating up.
He'll be floating face up there, he is.
It'll be out soon, but we can tell you
what the theme of the next issue is.
Get the plunger.
Get the show plunger.
Get that little collar up out of there.
The theme of the new Stark Fist is not you, Gary.
Oh, I'm afraid he's drowned.
Yeah, well...
Put it down as slowly as you can.
Oh, it's only an overshot.
Like Paddy said.
On the floor.
Put it on the floor.
Gently.
Now, just what could have happened
to get such a piece of tripe?
You have no idea what I've gone through
in the last three months.
Sometimes I'm perfect in all, mentally.
I sit for hours and hours,
looking in the mirror,
hoping and praying for the slightest sign
of my physical change.
And then come.
And I feel myself going back
to the animal instinct.
I try to fight it.
I try to fight it with all my willpower.
And I feel.
William.
William, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
Fight.
That's all you can do.
Oh, no.
Look.
Ha!
Oh!

Ha!
Ha!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Yeah!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

Oh!
What is it?
We better get back
cause it will be dark soon
and they mostly come at night.
Mostly.
God ali'l2007 !
Translate.
Sure is preferred, isn't it?
Mmm, I like that.
What is the truth about rock music?
I think it's an octopus.
Plato said,
when the music of a society changes,
the whole society will change.
Certainly, I got married so I could retire.
Lennon said,
the best and the quickest way to undermine any society
is through its music.
Can you think of anything else?
No, you've covered it all.
Satan has taken music and he has counterfeited it.
See that?
Convoluted it.
Twisted it.
Exploited it.
And now he's using it to hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer.
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer.
A message into the minds and the lifestyles of...
of this generation.
And that ain't all...
...suit!
What kind of ungodly being was that?
Don't you believe in reincarnation?
A wise guy, huh?
Quick, kill him!
Subdini's in space.
They took me up to the top of that space needle.
They showered me with beautiful gifts.
And beautiful girls. Moon maids.
Wow. What moon maids?

Yeah, look at those satellites.
Look at them spiked heels.
Oh, that one's looning me now.
I can't tell whether those are convexities or concavities, but that looning...
Hey, they some kind of moon maids.
I say, do that again.
Boy, can you dig those potatoes out of the craters.
Hey.
Oh, I love it.
Tiny flagellants move through this microscopic stool as if they owned the planet.
What happened? What, did something die in here?
Or is there just more shit?
It's that dinosaur egg that Hal's been sitting on for the last...
...twenty days.
Look, it's cracking!
I hear a screeching, a scratching noise.
He's not even aware that his own child is being born now!
It's got the head of a boy!
And the body of a Tyrannosaurus!
Yes, but it smokes Shermans. Do you think that it could be?
And it's still talking!
I just don't know about this guy.
Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev bought covert aid for erosion.
Yes, Hal had his own dinosaur baby child on the show and didn't even notice.
And so we're going to cook this little rare creature up for breakfast.
Yes, this single living example of a cross.
The dinosaur baby child's making his first phone call.
A homosaurus sapiens.
It's Jack the Show, and it is no longer available in your area.
The show fought its way to the front of the castle.
The show thought to itself, should I swim across the moat or should I crawl through the mud?
Or should you crawl six miles over broken glass and radioactive mine tables just to hear our program?
How many callers, how many records, how many eardrums?
We're going to talk about some of the subtle racism and sexism in the Bibles.
The sexism's pretty well accepted, but we will talk about the racism because it's so much more hidden and it's so much more dangerous what genocide the wretched can justify with the racism in it.
Through devious ways Satan has tainted the Bible and they justify their racism on the fact that Cain, the son of Adam and Eve, went off to a great city.
How is there a city if Cain was the only first son of man?
Well, this city was not occupied by man, but the beast of the field.
And Mormons and many other religions still teach that blacks are the descendants of Cain and the beast of the field.
We single out these painted Bibles, even St. John and St. Luke versions, so you will know that ours is the only Bible that should be read.
Versions of the Bible which have racism in them is going to be exposed and then we will announce how we will edit the Bible.
How does thatGenesis of Rebellion
No! Yes! Yes! Finally only one microphone is on, and Dr. Howell and Gary Gabrog, friend, and puzzling evidence all went to rock it away.
And that's what I am going to do in a minute!
And while we certaintly haven't been on the phone to our friends lately, and strained for time,


We've been, well, the quick cut barrage that you've been listening to, the edits of wonderful little sound bits, holy messages from the collection of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.
That was all edited by St. Joe Riley.
Oh, praise St. Joe Riley.
Saves us so much work and lets us get away with murder.
Oh, other little bits and pieces that were done by others.
There's a song called Used Slack buried in there.
That was by Out of Band Experience, OBE.
You heard some Church of the New Faith there down at the end.
They'll, of course, finish their explanations next week.
On the commercial for our new product, Candy Frappy Frappy Candy,
was produced by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.
Oh, yes, up there in New York land.
The background music that's on right now is, of course, J. Condom from his album, Zombo Fropland.
And now, this.
Well, no, how about this?
How about the post office box of the church?
The subgenius.
I know that so many of you have been sitting there with your pens in your hands,
just aching to write down that address where you can write for free information
about all the other services of our beloved church.
Ah, yes.
And that post office box number, we'll just write to Bob.
That's all you need to do.
Write to Bob at postofficebox.
Postofficebox 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.
That zip is 75214.
Once again, that's box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.
And now, this.

The dead hours...
The dead hours of the morning between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.
This is the time when women who have been many hours in labor finally deliver.
And then the idea of the supernatural seems the least implausible.
Mobius Rex is clambering around on top of the...


their, say, say, reckless
in theory are.
Amazing camera.
For those of you interested,
monitor number four will show Mobius.
At this time,
ancient superstitions and night fears
have the greatest hold on human thoughts.
The time when those who sleep
are deep in the dreams.
And this is the hour when the callers call.
The Church of the Subgenius Radio Show.
Hello?
Hello, you're on the air.
Cookie, this is the show trying to bother Philo.
Uh...
State short question, please.
What's for breakfast, Cookie?
Cookie, this is Ivan.
You have to wake up Dr. Drumwatt.
Hey, hey, hey, I got it.
So we can hurt him.
How many presidents does it take
to screw in a light bulb?
No, no, wait, wait.
What's the most beautiful sight in the world?
A busload of presidents going off a cliff.
Get it?
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Spooky bad show.
Cookie?
Oh, no.
Can we talk to little dude?
Don't listen to these men.
Not unless you have a connection to dog heaven.
Oh, no.
Friends, this is dog heaven.
And this is Philo Drumhead.
Hey, dog heaven.
Philo Drumhead.
We've woken up just to be here entertaining you
in all of Northern and Central California.
No, I'm still asleep.
You are going to save the universe this time.
Yeah, that's right, Philo.
You have a link up to the sleep.
Be of good cheer.
Well, just tell us what you're dreaming about
and we'll see you next time.



And we'll let you go eventually.
I'm dreaming about little dude.
Your dog?
Your dog that you had five years ago?
Yes.
I've never forgotten the little chap
who was so dear to us.
Still running out there.
He weighed up 500 pounds.
Fields of toxic substance.
That's what it is.
He's prancing and dancing through
fields of clover and dioxin.
In that land where no cars are.
And the smell of good Cleveland.
Under a country's nails.
The only cars that are there
are those that are run over by dogs.
Yeah.
Little dogs.
Well, we're all going to meet at the Jefferson Memorial
for something later,
so we just wanted to call you up.
Yeah, I'll be down there.
Don't order anything before I get there, okay?
