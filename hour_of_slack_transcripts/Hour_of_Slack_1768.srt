1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,820
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius hour of SWAT.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,160
Yes, and let's just go directly to the new Negative Land CD.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,600
This is Negative Land, Time Zone's exchange project.

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,160
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,080
Executive Window will bring you information more quickly and concisely in a form suited to your leadership role.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,920
Using symbols and color codes augmented with sound and motion,

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,080
your Executive Window will communicate the status of projects and corporate measurements of interest to you.

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,000
Radio Moscow World Service presents Sidewalk Survey.

9
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,860
Your hosts, Paula.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,380
Laura Garb and George Morzin.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,020
Hello, everybody.

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,720
Hello.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,500
Lately, we've received letters asking about what people in this country know and think about the various riddles scientists are working on.

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:21,900
Well, for instance, the Bermuda Triangle, unidentified flying objects, various lake monsters, and last but not least, the so-called Abominable Snowman.

15
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,020
The Abominable Snowman.

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,420
Just by way of explanation, this so-called snowman is called Sasquatch in Canada.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,940
Since that's what the local Indians first named the beings they claim to have come across for centuries.

18
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,720
Oh, yes, dear friends.

19
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,160
This is Hour of Slack number 1768.

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,280
But it's really a rerun.

21
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,260
Trying to save time.

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,000
And crank shows up faster, which means more reruns.

23
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:57,380
Luckily, I have all the old Hour of Slack cassette type masters from the old days.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,980
All at Stang Ranch here in Texas.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,220
And I asked listeners for suggestions of favorite reruns.

26
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,940
And somebody, I can't remember who, suggested number 468.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,560
Which would be from, I guess, the late 80s, early 90s.

28
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:27,060
I fetched that tape and the label, hand label on it said that it has a Negative Land CD that was brand new at that time called Time Zones Project.

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,980
And I guess it probably has a label on it.

30
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,040
It's a whole lot of that CD.

31
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,540
But it also says here,

32
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:53,620
Rant on Internet, comma, alt.slack, Starwood, miscellaneous rant, diet, good and evil, the soul, Nissan Bob, normal bobs, the Canadian false bob, and then more Time Zone from Negative Land.

33
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,440
So, I haven't heard this myself.

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,160
We'll be listening to it for the first time together.

35
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,100
And I hope that I don't sound too embarrassingly young and earnest.

36
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,960
But if I recall correctly, it's me trying to explain to people what the Internet is all about.

37
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,760
This would have to be, I guess, in the middle 90s now that I think about it.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,680
I think I started cluing in and using America Online or something around 1994.

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,880
So, praise Bob.

40
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,580
Praise Negative Land.

41
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,860
Praise reruns.

42
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,280
Huh.

43
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,180
I know that you won't hear this until you return to Howland.

44
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,780
And by that time, your negotiations should be complete and successful.

45
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:19,100
I want to congratulate you and all the people on the team there on the island for a job grandly done.

46
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:29,440
As I listen to these tapes of your departure to the Soviet Union, I am filled with pride and admiration.

47
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,860
Idish submission.

48
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:30,860


49
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:38,340
And also recognize your enthusiasm for the US, the whole America, the pier.

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,840
It was a prior to that, I hope the next financial crisis doesn't get any worse.

51
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,400
Thank you for being with you tonight.

52
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,420
That was wonderful.

53
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:44,420


54
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:44,480
You were here to talk about

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,480


56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,520
peace, wandering through

57
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,240
the time with me tonight.

58
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,400
So, thank you.

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,500
And thanks again to

60
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,500


61
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,500


62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,500


63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,460
The second gonna be at the end of the show two at a time, after which we're going on늘 haven at the same time, et cetera.

64
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm fucking here and haven't heard from you.

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,160
Ugh.

66
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,800
I'm just kidding.

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:58,800


68
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,960
Thank you, thanks.

69
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:07,620
Lucy did, but I believe especially in documentary areas to begin with, we will

70
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,640
gain a great deal of needed respect. I don't mean to say that...

71
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,080
Note to my secretary, the memo began to go a bit astray from my original plans

72
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:33,260
there and some negativity began to creep in. Please delete those implications.

73
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:43,020
As I listen to you climb into your P-38 and take off from that beautiful island,

74
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,240
I can only hope that...

75
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:03,780
Note to my secretary, I have the tapes from Howland on freeze frame at the moment at a very interesting section.

76
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,960
It appears to me that Mr. Howard Hughes was on the island at the time of Mr. Friday's departure.

77
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,340
Would you please look into this? I understood that Mr. Hughes was dead.

78
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:24,060
You'll find him appearing in a white shirt to the left of the P-38 at frame 608.

79
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,440
6014. 6014. I believe that's the first image of him.

80
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,540
Hmm. Oh. Hmm. Where's that unlock code?

81
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,200
Oh yeah, there it is. Okay, let's see what this says.

82
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,060
Good morning, Mr. Edge. This is Bud Winkle out on Howland.

83
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,060
We have...

84
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:05,320
I'm Mr. Friday's chief of temporal insertion, and I'm presently handling the late 20th century media insertions for the historical trans-infiltration task force here at NetWeb headquarters.

85
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,780
Now, I'm not permitted to reveal what year it is here now, of course, but let me assure you, a lot has happened since you died.

86
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:22,220
Mr. Friday is presently vacationing out on the crystal wheel, but his 2020 hindsight seems to only improve when he's off planet.

87
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,940
I have just as...

88
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,520
Well, we could use that as an excuse.

89
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,860
I would say some preçofupe.

90
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:41,940


91
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,240
Forgive my tampering.

92
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,240


93
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,140
I really hope the addresses in the deal will be any less of a hassle, and make the audacity better this evening.

94
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,800
With quickly from the beginning of these auditions for today, through anyเพ deine

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:53,320
mathematics , I hope the hard work we had slowly towards

96
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,940
designed for the Soviet population.

97
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,580
It has perhaps already occurred to you

98
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,720
that while the old order of Soviet society has been dumped,

99
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,860
there has been virtually no practical preparation

100
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,280
in Soviet culture to replace it with what they said they wanted.

101
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,780
From our vantage point here in the future, Mr. Edge,

102
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,680
we need to quickly insert the functional aspects

103
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,740
of a free market economy into the collective Soviet mentality

104
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,100
to avoid the approaching chaotic derailment

105
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,660
of their economy in your time.

106
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,460
You know, learning to buy is easy.

107
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,960
They must learn how to sell.

108
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,780
If this works, and Mr. Friday is confident it will,

109
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,180
it will immediately open all of the Soviet republics

110
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,860
to the unhindered distribution and sale of Mertz,

111
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,580
which in turn will change their decision

112
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,660
to prevent Pride All Labs from mining

113
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,980
the Mertz enhancer chemical, Cephysate,

114
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,360
which will soon be discovered in that big crater in Siberia.

115
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,820
And with the exclusive rights to Soviet Cephysate

116
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,080
from the Soviet government,

117
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,360
Pride All Labs swamped the future synthetic competition

118
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,180
in metal supplements, providing the funds now necessary

119
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,820
to finally corner the ice mining market

120
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,700
by buying the Braided Ring of Saturn.

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,620
And then, well, oh, forgive me, Mr. Edge,

122
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,580
I'm telling you more than you need to know.

123
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,080
Sometimes I'm like a kid in a history store.

124
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,080
Oh, in your time frame, Mr. Friday is now at Radio Moscow

125
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,580
in his capacity as director of the Time Zones Exchange Project

126
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,280
for UMN.

127
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,860
Let's see, oh, one more thing.

128
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,460
Mr. Dickie Diamond was originally informed

129
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,920
that he would host this test wave broadcast,

130
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,560
but Mr. Friday now tells me he has canceled Diamond as host,

131
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,880
so don't let him in the studio.

132
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,560
No matter how popular he is with the public,

133
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,540
we can't risk the future of Pride All

134
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,980
on a space-brained loose cat like Dickie.

135
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,380
Okay, good luck, Mr. Edge.

136
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,980
I'll talk to you again soon,

137
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,480
and say, if you play the stock market,

138
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,540
perhaps I can give you a few tips.

139
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,860
We have very accurate stock listings

140
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,400
covering your next few years.

141
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,300
Oh, but I guess if this test wave succeeds,

142
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,920
that'll probably all change, huh?

143
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,360
Well, closing transmission now.

144
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,700
Please lock and recode.

145
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,160
Well, who am I to say?

146
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,640
I hope they know what they're doing.

147
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,680
Who's this?

148
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,060
UMN 1 to studio.

149
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,560
UMN 1 to studio.

150
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,240
Hello?

151
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,220
I'm next.

152
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,300
This is Dickie Diamond,

153
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,840
star of stage, screen, and satellite.

154
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,700
Dickie.

155
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,360
Ha ha ha!

156
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,140
And I've got your damn whirlicopter,

157
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,220
and I'm not coming down!

158
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:36,860
Never!

159
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,620
Dickie!

160
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

161
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,440
Dickie!

162
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,460
This is Mr. Edge.

163
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,420
What happened?

164
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,760
Bring that whirlicopter back.

165
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,760
We've got a herd traffic at six.

166
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,900
Shut up, Edge!

167
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,640
Chief of Auto Schematics.

168
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,680
Dickie, Dickie.

169
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,600
Will somebody explain why you're making all those premium credits?

170
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,900
What the hell is Auto Schematics, Edge?

171
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,920
I don't even answer.

172
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,180
The whole thing is a pathetic hoax designed to keep the duds and ditch the diamond.

173
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,620
Don't you think I know what you know that I know what you and Pliny are up to?

174
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,620
Dickie.

175
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,180
Dickie.

176
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,580
Dickie.

177
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,440
Dickie, calm down.

178
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,080
Calm down.

179
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,200
You're still the biggest draw we've got, Dickie.

180
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,740
The Dutch web is not going to cut me out of their medium pie.

181
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,240
Dickie.

182
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,900
Dickie, we had no intention of-

183
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,900
Oh, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be doing this shit ever since my Dancing on the Moon special was rated lowest in the sphere, you menacing me out.

184
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,560
How was I to know that gravity and rhythm are linked?

185
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,080
And now?

186
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,680
Now it's anything for diamond, anything for diamond, nothing for diamond!

187
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,560
Well, my career is not ending here, not at all.

188
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,340
Of course not.

189
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,860
I'm not over the edge yet.

190
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,980
Listen to me.

191
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
Slap yourself to death.

192
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,760
What are you doing?

193
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:10,220
I've had it with bony net web types leading me on with dramatic promises and then delivering what?

194
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,160
What?

195
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,080
Improvisation!

196
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,100
Bah!

197
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,880
I hate improvisation!

198
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,280
And now...

199
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm going to do the worst thing anyone could do to you!

200
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,380
Don't do it Dicky, don't do it!

201
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm going to use this script and I'm going to take your listeners away!

202
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,240
He's got a script!

203
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,220
You have no defense against a script, do you?

204
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,020
Ha! A real plan!

205
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,340
Dicky listen...

206
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,400
Remember the media shifter, Edge?

207
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,720
The media shifter?

208
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,500
It's right in front of me, quite the gimmick, very expensive!

209
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,180
Listen Diamond...

210
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,500
The blind pulls...

211
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,360
Dicky! Dicky!

212
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,020
Dicky, come on!

213
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,100
Ease on down!

214
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,080
I'm going to use this media shifter to remove your listeners!

215
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,080
Wait a minute Dicky!

216
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,500
Remove them to your biggest competitor!

217
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,980
Wait a minute Dicky!

218
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,800
And they'll stay there, Edge!

219
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,700
They'll have to stay there!

220
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:17,860
Dicky!

221
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,820
Listen Dicky, I don't know what you're up to but...

222
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,580
Power is red, I'm going to do it!

223
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,940
I'm going to do it, Edge!

224
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,120
Don't do it! Don't do it!

225
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,100
Electron factor, ten to the seventh power!

226
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,100
Dicky! Dicky!

227
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,660
Don't touch that button!

228
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,560
Counting down now Mr. Edge!

229
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:35,980
Ready?

230
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,320
Five... Four...

231
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,480
You can't do this!

232
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:40,880
Three...

233
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,660
Dicky, we've got a pilot for you!

234
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,740
I can fly this myself!

235
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,380
So long, NetWeb!

236
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,720
Try to find yourself in the ratings now!

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,780
Ha ha ha!

238
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,560
Two...

239
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,140
Three...

240
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,140


241
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,140


242
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,140


243
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,140


244
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,500
Don't do it!

245
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,760
Don't do it!

246
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:02,340


247
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,180
I'm going to do it!

248
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,700
Don't do it!

249
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,360


250
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,360


251
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,740
You're dead!

252
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,180
You're dead!

253
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,020
Back to Friday, I must not be so easily diverted.

254
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,720
Oh, no kidding, man.

255
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:43,580
And yes, dear friends, that last 11 minutes and 38 seconds was from the new Negative Land CD,

256
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:52,640
which is Time Zone's Exchange Project, a beautiful double CD.

257
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:59,840
And who knows, we may be running tons and tons of that material for your pleasure.

258
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,700
Your pleasure.

259
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,740
Pleasure here on the Hour of Slack from our good friends at Negative Land.

260
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,660
Yes, after having their very lives almost destroyed by Island Records, U2, and SST Records,

261
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,660
these valiant audio slack masters and creators of their own medium have not only tenaciously

262
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,980
pumped out astounding new album after album, much of the material, like in this case,

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,860
taken from their radio shows, Over the Edge, there on KPFA in Berkeley,

264
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,460
but have formed their own record company co-op to help themselves and other artistes get distribution

265
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,280
without a single record company vampire involved.

266
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:52,140
And believe you me, the Church of the Subgenius is going to benefit from that very thing.

267
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,380
It's over the...

268
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,040
As soon as I get any kind of a break, I need to sit down and start compiling.

269
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:07,520
The Hour of Slack CD series to be done in conjunction with Negative Land.

270
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,900
Yes, dear friends.

271
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:17,240
Oh, by the way, in the background, we're hearing music by an obscure band.

272
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,780
Well, maybe they're not obscure to you.

273
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,460
I just hadn't heard of them until recently.

274
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,560
Called Osric Tentacles.

275
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
There they go.

276
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,260
Osric Tentacles.

277
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,420
Osric Tentacles.

278
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,040
It's so...

279
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,880
Psyche.

280
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,500
Psychedelic.

281
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,880
Anyway, I...

282
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,300
You know, I bet...

283
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,560
I bet you can't tell from where you're sitting, my friend.

284
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,440
But from where I am, this particular show is late, late, late.

285
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,760
I should already have duplicated the 14 copies and be sending this show out right now

286
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,700
instead of just now starting to produce it.

287
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,340
Oh, now, why is that preacher, Reverend Stang, always making excuses, you ask?

288
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,600
Well, now, because of being ensconced here at the apex.

289
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,160
Of the very church.

290
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,540
Just a few notches below Dobbs himself.

291
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,620
My excuses are actually pretty exciting.

292
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,760
And this time, it's not our new book, Revelation X.

293
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,580
That's all done and we're just doing PR stuff now.

294
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:20,140
In fact, by the time you hear this, you may very well already have your copy in your hot little hands.

295
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:20,940
Or claws.

296
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,660
Or pinchers.

297
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,960
They print that mighty book on November 18th.

298
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,820
And the official release date...

299
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:36,920
Okay, the date they pick to indicate when they think it'll start hitting stores is, get this, November 22nd.

300
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,980
You can't say Dobbs doesn't love you now, Jack.

301
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,840
Yes, Revelation X, the third New Testament.

302
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,380
The new third Last Testament, one might say.

303
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,520
The Bob Apocryphon.

304
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:58,520
A Simon & Schuster publication will be out there for all to see and bask.

305
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,860
In, for better or for worse.

306
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,780
And my excuse is not, this time, that I've been running around preaching on car hoods and sleeping in flea-bitten motel rooms.

307
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,300
That'll be my excuse next month.

308
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,520
Dues-paying ordained members will be getting postcards about these shows.

309
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:22,180
Now, my excuse, friends, my excuse of this week partakes of none of those, nay.

310
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,240
But in the fact that I've been surfing the internet.

311
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,300
Yes, the subgenius foundation.

312
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,380
Can now take on the role of global village idiot on the information superhighway.

313
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,620
I've finally hooked up the modem that Dr. Drummond gave me and got an America Online account.

314
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:49,980
And I'm just waiting for my free internet access special account to come through so it won't be costing.

315
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:56,900
So now, friends, when I give the sacred P.O. box number at the end of the broadcast for information about this church.

316
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,800
I'll also be giving the church...

317
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,760
Headquarters email number.

318
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:10,440
And you ordained members will be glad to know that now that we've managed to get a handle on the technology and learn the geeky jargon.

319
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:16,820
What we're mainly working on is the stark fist of removal church magazine online.

320
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,680
Yes, I mean, we gotta work on it anyway.

321
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,560
And I'll be dumping the magazine in progress onto alt.slack on the internet.

322
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,740
And tweaking it.

323
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,800
And adding to it.

324
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,180
And adding to it interactively with everybody else there.

325
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,580
And when it's all done, we'll publish it on paper for everybody else.

326
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,520
Who doesn't have their very brain linked to a computer and modem yet.

327
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:47,860
Now, my friend, let me backtrack and explain to ye who have not yet tried to cross that information superhighway.

328
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,600
For many indeed are the virtual dead dog corpses dotting the sides of that highway.

329
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,640
Now, one week ago, before my crash.

330
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,140
Course in nerd speak.

331
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,840
I was barely aware of all this.

332
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:08,060
So I can sympathize if this already sounds like a bunch of hugger mugger gobbledy gook to you.

333
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:23,060
As you probably know, the internet is this invisible place like heaven or hell where people can leave electronic junk lying around for each other to fish out.

334
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,740
And mostly it's text messages and programs.

335
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,400
Although with enough know how.

336
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,640
And.

337
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,040
Here.

338
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,760
You can send and receive art and sound, etc.

339
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,320
And I mean, eventually we'll all have have them in our shirt pockets or embedded in our heads.

340
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,800
But there's already millions of humans plugged into the internet all over the world.

341
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,800
And it and it breaks down into thousands of categories.

342
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,860
Now, in the category called alternative, which is where most of the weird stuff happens.

343
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,340
There's a special mini network among all the others called alt.

344
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:07,380
Dot slack or alt period slack, depending, which is where the subgeniuses have been leaving messages to each other for several years now.

345
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,380
And there's several thousand messages sitting in it right now.

346
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,700
And then now there are also other subgenius electronic meeting places on other networks besides the Internet.

347
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:27,900
Like, for instance, America Online has a Church of the Subgenius board located under their philosophical matters heading in their hobbies department called the.

348
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,320
Exchange.

349
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,900
But alt.

350
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:37,440
Dot slack on the Internet is for now probably the most used subgenius dump.

351
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,400
Now, I don't know who started all slack and nobody's moderating it.

352
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,500
In other words, it's an endless series of unrelated topics being discussed.

353
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:57,200
And it's also cluttered with topics that have been automatically and senselessly dumped in there from other nerd networks.

354
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,880
And.

355
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:15,360
So when you first start looking for the interesting slack imbued material on there, you're met with total chaos and the equivalent of thousands and thousands of pages of garbage that has nothing to do with the church or the war against the conspiracy, for that matter.

356
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,540
You're also met with some of the lamest subgenius wannabe geekliness imaginable.

357
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,800
It's kind of like wandering around a comic book convention.

358
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:42,580
And since I'm, you know, Mr. Famous Guy Subgenius, when I made my presence known there, I was additionally greeted by the expected combination of groveling butt kissing and overly defensive rebelliousness and insults.

359
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,600
But that'll die down, I figure.

360
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,320
Now, despite all that, this is all tremendously exciting to me, my friend.

361
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,780
Because amidst all this false slack, there are also lurking some keen individuals in doubt.

362
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,400
And the potential for the whole thing is practically infinite.

363
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,320
Now, Dr. Drummond and I have been developing a plan.

364
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:17,620
Now, we have no intention of hobbling the chaotic, what most of us would call lame, idiotic, childish blabbering by those so-called subgenii who have no lives.

365
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:25,760
We do, however, plan to give the newcomer an alternative to all that by creating new, clearly marked chaos.

366
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:40,080
We will create new categories which, taken all together, will comprise and represent introductions to the church and, in fact, the stark fist of removal church magazine in progress.

367
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:49,900
In other words, if you enter alt.slack on the internet, you can go straight to where the most recent few hundred messages are.

368
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,580
And you'll find categories that were started by us here at the Subgenius Foundation.

369
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,400
But which are also being constantly updated and added to by others.

370
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,080
We can only hope that this works. We're just now starting.

371
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:14,620
For instance, here's some of the organizational categories that would comprise the online stark fist, or I guess you could actually call it the online hour of slack.

372
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,520
There'd be an intro to Bob for newcomers.

373
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,820
An intro guide to alt.slack.

374
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,420
Official church news.

375
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,580
Reviews of other mutants.

376
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,400
And high weirdness updates.

377
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,500
You know, wonderful magazines, books, CDs, tapes you can get, and so forth.

378
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,200
Videos.

379
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,620
Upcoming devivals.

380
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,900
Current hour of slack stations and times.

381
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,600
Practical anti-conspiracy weaponry.

382
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,440
Classic subgenius rants.

383
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,980
New subgenius rants.

384
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,100
Letters, prayers, and confessions.

385
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,460
Suggestions and requests.

386
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,920
Classic tales of Bob.

387
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,340
New tales of Bob.

388
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,260
A dissent.

389
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,960
Evil gossip and flaming.

390
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,540
Bummers.

391
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,660
Etc.

392
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,260
And it would all be free.

393
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,260
Of course, this would be kind of like the naked stark fist because there's no art.

394
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:15,240
And we can't do italics or boldface, you know, so the accents don't come across quite the same.

395
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,180
But it would be free.

396
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,060
And again, we have no intention of corralling alt.slack or cleaning up the chaos, so to speak.

397
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,900
We wouldn't dream of it even if we could.

398
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:35,420
We merely want to put little islands of useful organization into it for those of us who don't really have the time or money to wade through the randomness.

399
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:48,060
And you may be saying now, Reverend Stang, even if I had a computer and a modem, I wouldn't be interested in messing with all this computerese jargon and Bobby Blather.

400
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,480
I'm a subgenius, man.

401
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,040
And I'm just a genius.

402
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,420
I'm just not going to do it.

403
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:02,940
But, um, so why don't you shut up and all that stuff and just play some damn tapes.

404
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,160
Okay.

405
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,640
Okay, we're going to do that.

406
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,220
Okay.

407
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,140
Okay.

408
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,940
Slack.

409
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,460
Slack.

410
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:17,660
Just wanted to let you know what else is out there in the realm of the church, which is actually a pretty big realm.

411
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:23,040
I mean, this is a religion, so it touches on every possible area of life.

412
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,480
Death and a lot of the mess in between.

413
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:36,660
What else is out there, you know, besides this show and the books and the comic books and the tapes and so forth?

414
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,600
Only one.

415
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,260
Back to Friday.

416
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,180
I must not be so easily diverted.

417
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
Oh, what was that again?

418
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,720
The Friday family belonged to an uncommon theological order.

419
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,080
The Sandemanians, they were called.

420
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,420
Oh, I...

421
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:12,240
In his later years, and indeed throughout his life, Friday thought that men of science were given to higher moral feelings than other men.

422
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:18,560
Well, Mr. Thomas, how does that statement jive with page 13 of your biography here, where...

423
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:29,500
Where you state that the Sandemanians were a lusty sect of sun-worshippers and that young Friday would spend hours hanging upside down and naked in his backyard reading pornographic Sandemanian texts,

424
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,220
purportedly found in a crashed alien pod by Dr. Sandemanian himself.

425
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,040
And what did he say of his reading?

426
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,420
He said this.

427
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,580
It made me think.

428
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,240
It made me think.

429
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,540
The connection with a good book has no equal in how it is written.

430
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,080
It is the connection with how it can turn a mind.

431
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,700
Well, let's hope that's not always true.

432
00:27:52,920 --> 00:28:04,820
But beyond his massive sexual appetite for misshapen physique, so what can you tell us about these supposedly alien electrical experiments which were illustrated in these Sandemanian books?

433
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,380
Friday was already engaged in doing some experiments he had read about in the books.

434
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,740
And he said,

435
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,440
I made such experiments

436
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,120
as could be defrayed in their expense

437
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,840
by a few pence a week.

438
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,660
But what was the nature of these...

439
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,400
Isn't that just wonderful to hear?

440
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,140
Yes.

441
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,460
Well, now that he owns half the world, it's hard to believe he started out on such a shoestring.

442
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,000
Friday wrote,

443
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:42,120
I am now constantly employed in observing the works of nature

444
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,200
and tracing the manner

445
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,000
in which she directs the order and arrangement of the world.

446
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,620
Now, what do you suppose he meant by that?

447
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,680
Order and arrangement of the world.

448
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,500
I see. Sort of a vast world vision that would probably...

449
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,440
And this phrase, order and arrangement...

450
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:03,780
Yes.

451
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,540
By that he meant the great scheme of things in nature.

452
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,340
Order and arrangement.

453
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,260
Well, with just a few minutes left, I'd like to get back to...

454
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,260
Now, Friday heard of this event,

455
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,960
that electricity makes magnetism.

456
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,860
And in his notebook he wrote,

457
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,360
Make magnetism produce electricity.

458
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,320
Make magnetism produce electricity.

459
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,860
The year was 1820.

460
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,760
Uh, wait a minute.

461
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,760
I don't even have to take off my shoes to figure that would make him,

462
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,940
let's see, 1820 to 1900, that's 60 plus, I don't know, what is it now,

463
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,320
For 11 years he labored on the idea,

464
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,920
make magnetism produce electricity.

465
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,380
So, let's see, 1820 plus 11, that's...

466
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,420
In 1831, the discovery was unfolded.

467
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,000
Ah, yes, yes, and that of course must have been that famous first probe

468
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,340
into the mysteries of trans-infiltration, which killed all those assistants.

469
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,040
But, uh, Mr. Thomas, in the short time left, can we move on to the...

470
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,180
I am busy, John.

471
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,360
I am just now on electromagnetism.

472
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,760
I think I have hold of a good thing, but cannot say for sure.

473
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,100
Well, all right, but then, uh, how did this electrical work prepare him

474
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,740
for his many political and diplomatic accomplishments?

475
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,960
Uh, you know, he's running again in 92.

476
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,200
Soon after the discovery,

477
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,240
Mr. Friday demonstrated it to the Prime Minister.

478
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,180
Of what use is it, Mr. Friday, said the Prime Minister,

479
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,740
to which Friday replied,

480
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,780
Mr. Minister, one day you may be able to tax it.

481
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,980
Huh, tax it.

482
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,480
One day you may be able to tax it.

483
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:55,940
Tax it.

484
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,280
Isn't that a wonderful reply?

485
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,320
Super reply.

486
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,700
But, uh, now, was this prior to the patent laws

487
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,840
that now give him exclusive usage rights over that technology?

488
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,240
Uh, and at that point in time, how could he have foreseen...

489
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,840
And on another occasion, a lady put the same question.

490
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,100
Of what use is it, Mr. Friday?

491
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,920
And he replied,

492
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,620
Of what use is a newborn baby, madam?

493
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,560
Indeed, sometimes I still ask myself that one.

494
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,800
And I also wonder how Friday, at such a young age,

495
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,000
was creating all these things so long ago,

496
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,260
as if he could understand what the future would... would... would...

497
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,080
So now, when you see the huge transmission lines

498
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,300
stretched across the land,

499
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,840
and when you visit the huge generating plants

500
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,880
where falling water gives birth to the electric fluid

501
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,020
which lights your home and toasts your bread,

502
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,940
and when the day turns dark,

503
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,820
and the darkness is turned to light

504
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,500
by a million neon flames,

505
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,780
think of Friday, that little boy born to a blacksmith,

506
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,900
who gave to the world

507
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,620
this enormous gift of his genius.

508
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,580
Super genius, super genius.

509
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,520
But tell us about all that wealth.

510
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,820
I think most people want to hear about all that money.

511
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,400
And so he had to decide.

512
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,740
Make money, gather wealth, or serve science and mankind.

513
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,600
His decision, we can already guess.

514
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,340
I guess so.

515
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,820
And he spoke ever constantly in this refrain.

516
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,520
The sweetest reward of my work

517
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,840
is the sympathy and goodwill

518
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,580
which flows to me from all quarters of the earth.

519
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,460
Of all his great and wonderful characteristics,

520
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,340
the most prominent, I would say,

521
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,760
must be his sense of order and his humble heart.

522
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,300
Of his many utterances, this stands nobly among them.

523
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,920
For the philosopher, truth adds industry

524
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,440
within the veil of science, he said.

525
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,620
It is a glorious school for the mind.

526
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,460
And this phrase.

527
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,200
There is nothing too wonderful to be true.

528
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,640
Is that true?

529
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,400
Nothing too wonderful to be true.

530
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,400
Just kidding.

531
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,300
Well, we are right out of time, Dr. Thomas.

532
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,900
So I say, it would be good for boys to get jobs like this today.

533
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,960
Well, I'm sure they'll try, Mr. Thomas.

534
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,360
You mean like...

535
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,920
Remember, too.

536
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,500
Ben Franklin was an errand boy.

537
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,040
And an apprentice to a printer.

538
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,260
You will remember. I told about that.

539
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
Yes, I do remember, Dr. Thomas.

540
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,660
And thank you, thank you very much.

541
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,380
Thanks for that insight into the early years of C. Eliot Friday.

542
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,440
We've been talking with Delmar Detmer Thomas,

543
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,900
the one and only authorized biographer of C. Eliot Friday.

544
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,680
As we continue here on the Piddlediddle Report

545
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,160
with our topic for tonight,

546
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,340
C. Eliot Friday and the Soviet connection.

547
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,840
I must say,

548
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,120
Mr. Thomas must be quite a draw

549
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,760
because our ABS audience meter,

550
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,080
indicating how many of you are tuned in to us,

551
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,780
took a giant flying leap into the really big numbers

552
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,400
right in the middle of that interview.

553
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,640
Well, glad to have you aboard.

554
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,060
And I know you'll want to stay with us

555
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,720
as these historical events in the Soviet Union continue to develop

556
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,080
and we explore the mysterious role of C. Eliot Friday,

557
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,820
the world's most mysterious tycoon in these events.

558
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,820
We'll be back with more of that.

559
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,420
More right after these messages.

560
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,820
This is the American Broadcasting System.

561
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:53,140
Diet recommendation for subgeniuses?

562
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,160
Well, now, actually,

563
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,080
in the book of the subgenius it says,

564
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,980
oh, some granola in the morning,

565
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,720
and then three martinis,

566
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,500
and then some nice,

567
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,900
you make a sandwich,

568
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,980
you take some of your,

569
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,740
you take some sprouts,

570
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,560
you know, some organically grown sprouts

571
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,260
and some of that peanut butter

572
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,620
that you get in the health food stores,

573
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,300
the kind with the oil on top,

574
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,360
yeah, and your grandma's face,

575
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,500
and make your sandwich.

576
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,480
And now that's for lunch.

577
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,440
Then for dinner you would maybe eat some rusty nails

578
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,200
and stuff some froth up your exit wound.

579
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,380
That quote, in that sort of thing,

580
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,900
when we give directives and admonitions,

581
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,380
admonitions of Bob in our books,

582
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,960
those are really, oftentimes, believe it or not,

583
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,560
those are meant humorously.

584
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,260
Because Bob would never,

585
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,900
no subgenius is going to give you orders.

586
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,400
Well, actually, I shouldn't say that.

587
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,340
A subgenius may give you orders,

588
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,480
but no subgenius ever takes orders

589
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,740
from any other subgenius.

590
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,960
We would give, for instance,

591
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,860
the conspiracy would tell you what's healthy to eat,

592
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,760
what you should eat,

593
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,800
what you should watch on TV,

594
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
and who you should vote for.

595
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,660
We're not going to tell you any of that stuff,

596
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,140
aside from the obvious,

597
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,840
J.R. Bob Dobbs for World Overlord.

598
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,860
But for all we know,

599
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,380
as powerful as he is,

600
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,380
he may already be World Overlord.

601
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,880
Praise that man, Bob.

602
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,060
I hate Bob.

603
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,320
You can't imagine that Bob can,

604
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,880
Bob hates you so much.

605
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,900
He doesn't even know you,

606
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,220
but he hates you.

607
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,600
He hates you.

608
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,860
You can go to bed at night

609
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,240
all alone and think,

610
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,320
well, I'm not completely alone.

611
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,820
Bob's thinking of me.

612
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,820
He hates me.

613
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,300
But only if you send him that $20, friends,

614
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,840
which goes up to $30, by the way,

615
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,400
when the new book comes out in,

616
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,660
well, it's supposed to be in November.

617
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,680
What?

618
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,360
Right, Bob doesn't care.

619
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,600
He hates you anyway,

620
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,760
but he also loves you.

621
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,740
You know, Bob is,

622
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,440
it's like good and evil

623
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,900
are one thing when you're on that level.

624
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,460
It's all, I mean, Bob,

625
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,680
one minute he might walk a little old lady

626
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
across the street,

627
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,480
and the next minute,

628
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,940
beat her to death,

629
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,740
club her to death,

630
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,480
and take her money.

631
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,320
It's whatever gives him the most slack.

632
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,280
For all we know,

633
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,840
now this is not likely,

634
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,960
it's possible,

635
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,120
it's not likely,

636
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,820
but it's possible that Bob is,

637
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:28,960
where is he?

638
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,720
He's not here right now.

639
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,140
He could be meeting with Dan Quayle

640
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,380
to prepare a new retrovirus,

641
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,100
a new, quote,

642
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,660
accidental release of another warfare,

643
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,160
biological warfare germ.

644
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,400
He could be doing that.

645
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,660
That doesn't seem like something

646
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,160
we would want Bob to do.

647
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,860
It's not something the average subgenius

648
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,060
could even imagine Bob doing.

649
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,140
But here's the point.

650
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,440
If he does, so be it.

651
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,060
It is not up to us to question Bob.

652
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,100
You do not question,

653
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,400
you don't use your mind

654
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,740
to think about your religion.

655
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,380
It's as simple as that.

656
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,880
I mean, the minute you drag logic

657
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,420
and reason into your mind,

658
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,040
into any religious sort of thing,

659
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,260
that's the end of it.

660
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,640
You might as well just go join the Moonies,

661
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,000
the Scientology, Catholics, you know,

662
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,720
or one of those other subgenius spin-offs.

663
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,400
Oh, yes, the young little boy over there with the...

664
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Bob said it.

665
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,880
No, actually, the correct line is,

666
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,820
Bob sold it, I smoked it.

667
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,800
That settles it.

668
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,660
Oh, well...

669
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,920
You think about Bob with your head,

670
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,980
you think about Bob with your gonads.

671
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,880
Well, now, that depends.

672
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,500
Actually, the soul...

673
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,760
Many people think that the soul

674
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,600
is located in the gonads.

675
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,880
Actually, it is in the...

676
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,740
Now, this sounds like a play on words,

677
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,900
but the human soul, S-O-U-L,

678
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,960
is in the foot,

679
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,600
along with the S-O-L-E type soul.

680
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,520
And like that other soul,

681
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,340
it's a rectangular, greenish, flat thing.

682
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,000
However, what most people don't know

683
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,260
is, like the rhinoceros horn,

684
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,600
it is actually made of hair.

685
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,800
It's like the fingernails or something.

686
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,040
That's right.

687
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,380
The soul is down there.

688
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,400
It's all proof, man.

689
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,660
It's like they look for scientific proof.

690
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,040
Well, we'll offer $50,000 to anybody

691
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,660
who can prove that J.R. Bob Dobbs does not exist.

692
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,740
That offer has been standing for 10 years now,

693
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,340
and nobody's taken us up on it.

694
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,900
Now, this is...

695
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,940
We're getting into the angels on the head of a pen type question.

696
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,920
What is Bob's shoe size?

697
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,080
Actually, Bob wears size 12 Brogans.

698
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,220
That is a question that is addressed doctrinally.

699
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,500
Bob has eaten a great deal of spam.

700
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,640
Bob was in World War II.

701
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,440
Bob...

702
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,220
No, let's not do Monty Python stuff.

703
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,200
Oh, wait.

704
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,880
Next, it's going to be Rocky Horror Picture Show face.

705
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,040
It's going to be Doctor Who fans.

706
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,060
It's going to be Doctor Who fans.

707
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,280
It's going to be Doctor Who fans.

708
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,280


709
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,280


710
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,920
Or Mystery Science Theater 3000.

711
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:10,600
Or Mystery Science Theater 3000.

712
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,120
That was the Nissan Bob.

713
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,560
That was a rip-off.

714
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,700
Yeah, he's referring to the spate of commercials

715
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,540
in conspiracy media that feature cute, Bob-like characters,

716
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,700
often called Bob.

717
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,640
The best one is the Nissan spot,

718
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,680
where you just...

719
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,580
It's point of view shots out of a windshield of a Nissan,

720
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,460
and the signs all say,

721
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,480
Yield to Bob.

722
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,280
You know, this lane is Bob's.

723
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,540
He starts to get a ticket from a cop,

724
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,180
and the cop says,

725
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,040
Oh, it's you, Bob.

726
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,440
And at the end of the spot,

727
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,760
they show the car and a little slogan that says,

728
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,720
Why should rich guys have all the luck?

729
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,020
That is an example of the conspiracy...

730
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,560
You can watch for this kind of thing.

731
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,860
The conspiracy has a special...

732
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,540
You know how they have a UFO study group?

733
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,400
And so forth.

734
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,240
They have a subgenius study group,

735
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,080
that for all we know,

736
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,440
may be more important to Bob's plan than any of us.

737
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,080
But they...

738
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,540
The conspiracy does try to cutesy Bob up,

739
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,340
deliver a...

740
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,140
This sort of a understandable Bob,

741
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,180
a silly Bob,

742
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,380
that's only a take-off on silly televangelists.

743
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,820
And they're trying to serve you, Bob,

744
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,780
on a silver platter.

745
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,320
And the day that Bob Dobbs becomes popular,

746
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,720
that is the day to start worrying about this shit.

747
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,060
Because I guarantee you,

748
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,640
those of us who were in there at the beginning will have gone.

749
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,700
We will be gone.

750
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,900
We may have taken the money and run,

751
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,380
but someone else will be running it.

752
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,140
And on that day, my friend,

753
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,700
that is the day to fear.

754
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,920
When they start selling you church air

755
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,240
for one soul per breath.

756
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,420
And you laugh.

757
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,280
You think that's funny.

758
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,020
I've seen these things.

759
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,540
You can read on the internet all kinds of stuff

760
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,800
about the church and the subgenius.

761
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,940
I heard the other...

762
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,140
Oh, there's all these geeks on the internet.

763
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,340
They know all about Church of the Subgenius.

764
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,100
The Reverend Ivan Stang is just a fake name

765
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,340
for a consortium of 50 writers in Texas or...

766
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,000
No, in Canada.

767
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,160
That was the latest one.

768
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,980
Yeah, the Canadian false Bob.

769
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,120
Oh, there's a smiley face Bob.

770
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,760
You can actually buy CDs by Bob Dobbs.

771
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,280
He's afraid to call himself J.R. Bob Dobbs

772
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,220
or put it in quotes or anything like that.

773
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,660
No, it's in Canada.

774
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,040
And it's like, called...

775
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,800
It's like, lost more than they'll ever make.

776
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,400
Yes?

777
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,300
Bob Dean has sent this to my radio station.

778
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,840
Not one penny or more and he went to his conference

779
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,760
going to give this...

780
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,800
Oh, Pastor Craig.

781
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,260
No!

782
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,720
Friends, here it is.

783
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,520
Pastor Craig.

784
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,840
Pastor Craig here

785
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,880
from the Philadelphia Subgenius radio show.

786
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,840
This is the CD.

787
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,620
The CD,

788
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,240
which is Yabab's Media Ecology.

789
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,040
It's the funny...

790
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,020
It's the intellectual Bob.

791
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,900
He's a little more serious and he uses much more trendy McLuhan-esque words

792
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,520
so that you can really know that it's like,

793
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,540
not that silly Texas stuff.

794
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,060
God damn it.

795
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,740
I can't wait for the fight.

796
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:17,840
Oh!

797
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,820
Yeah!

798
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:19,960
Yeah!

799
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,020
Yeah!

800
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:21,940
Yeah!

801
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,520
Yeah!

802
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,000
Yeah!

803
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,500
Yeah!

804
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:27,100


805
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,040
Yeah!

806
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,220
Yeah!

807
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,440
Let's just spike the pathetic,

808
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,600
the wannabe,

809
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,020
the gimme Bob,

810
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,360
the one of the Ivan Bob psychotic.

811
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,660
It feels too bad now because I love Bob.

812
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:39,680
Oh.

813
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,800
Thank you, Pastor Craig,

814
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,440
for that amazing contribution there.

815
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,800
I've always wanted to do that.

816
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,380
WFMU did that to that guy's album,

817
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,360
sent it back to him.

818
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,280
That's what we should do.

819
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,860
We'll mail it back to Bob Dean,

820
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,920
the false Bob.

821
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,520
We're not even at the next one.

822
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,320
You know,

823
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,180
I just noticed among the shards there

824
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,660
two pills on the ground.

825
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,540
Now,

826
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,780
I'm not going to take these pills

827
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,360
because I know what's in them.

828
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,560
Those are health food store

829
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,780
or convenience store speed.

830
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,660
You know those,

831
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,120
those zippy pills and so forth

832
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,820
that you see at the convenience stores?

833
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,260
I don't know about you,

834
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,020
but ephedra.

835
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,620
just doesn't cut it for me.

836
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,660
And caffeine in the form of GoToCola just ain't...

837
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,040
It just ain't there, you know?

838
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,600
It doesn't do the trick.

839
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,840
We like to still...

840
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,120
We're the only way!

841
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,040
Well, I'm getting...

842
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,920
Frankly, I believe in Slack for myself and Yoko.

843
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,480
And we would like to...

844
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,940
I would actually just as soon listen to this amazing rendition of

845
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,560
Sunshine of Your Love by Jimi Hendrix.

846
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,980
On the radio for the rest of the afternoon.

847
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,020
This is the American Broadcasting System.

848
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,720
I'm so depressed, Andrew.

849
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,500
You can't be depressed. This is the holiday season.

850
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,940
But America's losing its values, Andrew.

851
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,320
I just read it in the paper.

852
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,920
Nonsense. I spent my lunch hour at Hastings,

853
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,240
and believe me, there are plenty of values there.

854
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,280
Andrew, I'm talking about something much more far-reaching.

855
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,680
I doubt it. The values I saw at Hastings

856
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,120
reach to just about every gift item you can imagine.

857
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,360
Sweaters, dress shirts, neckwear, sports shirts,

858
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,440
outerwear jackets, camel hair, sport coats, suits, casual slacks.

859
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,740
Andrew, this is deeper.

860
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,460
Deeper? I don't think you'll find a much deeper value

861
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,100
than $32.90 for a soft lambswool sweater

862
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,460
or $12.90 for a beautiful silk tie.

863
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,460
Andrew, I'm talking...

864
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm talking about human values.

865
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,480
Well, then you're talking service.

866
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,320
And there's not another clothing store

867
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,260
with a more helpful staff than Hastings.

868
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,040
Real professionals.

869
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,740
But, Andrew...

870
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,240
Friendly, unhurried atmosphere.

871
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,720
Real holiday spirit.

872
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,800
Andrew, we're just on different wavelengths.

873
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,060
That's because you haven't been to Hastings yet.

874
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,420
One store where you can find great holiday gifts

875
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,620
at great holiday prices.

876
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,980
Well, I guess that is value.

877
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,560
Kind of restores your faith, doesn't it?

878
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,340
Only in America.

879
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,740
Only at Hastings.

880
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,380
This is the Piddle Diddle Report.

881
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,800
A five-hour in-depth report

882
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,820
on current issues of substance.

883
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,520
All right.

884
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,760
We're back.

885
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,140
And with more on tonight's

886
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,960
C. Eliot Friday and the Soviet Connection.

887
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,100
Tonight's report on the Piddle Diddle Report.

888
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,900
I'm Doug Piddle.

889
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,440
My colleague Peter Diddle is away on assignment

890
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,520
to Howland Island in the Mid-Pacific.

891
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,160
And we hope to have a direct phone link

892
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,000
to him shortly.

893
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,340
Of course, Mr. Friday reclusively resides

894
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,520
on Howland Island,

895
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,040
where he maintains headquarters

896
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,620
for his many enterprises,

897
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,640
most notably the Universal Media NetWeb,

898
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,700
now the largest international multimedia

899
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,560
glomerate in the world.

900
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,680
And Fridol, his pharmaceutical lab,

901
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,760
which has been distributing free Mertz tablets

902
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,620
in the Soviet Union for months.

903
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,660
And I can't be the first one to wonder

904
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,160
if they had some effect on current events there.

905
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,900
And we've all heard the various rumors

906
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,140
regarding Mr. Friday's role in beginning

907
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,660
and then ending the recent Soviet coup attempt.

908
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,200
It has been alleged that it was a walnut-sized prototype

909
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,600
Fridotronics micro mini video cam,

910
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,500
which Gorbachev used to record his denials

911
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,960
while a captive in the Crimea.

912
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,980
We all saw what he held up at his press conference,

913
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,920
wrapped in a hanky to cover the brand name.

914
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,860
What's more, there appears to be a great deal

915
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,000
of security surrounding some kind of scientific testing

916
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,940
going on at Howland Island right now.

917
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,620
And we also have reports that many Soviet media officials

918
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,020
are now on the island.

919
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,640
Could this involve the mysterious trans-infiltration device

920
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,920
we've heard so much about now being developed

921
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,880
by Fridotronics?

922
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,020
Is Friday on the island at all?

923
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,140
We heard his flying wing left Howland several days ago,

924
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,060
taking the polar route towards Russia.

925
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,600
Is he dead?

926
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,400
No one's heard or seen the man in over six years.

927
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,200
Well, we're going to try and find out these

928
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:24,860
and other things.

929
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,240
We're going to try and find out the things occurring

930
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,160
before and after you hear this.

931
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,760
Peter Dill should be calling us soon

932
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,960
with his report on the spot from that tiny dot,

933
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,080
so isolated that it isn't even in any time zone.

934
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,060
And in fact, I think this is his call coming in now.

935
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,680
Let's check that right here.

936
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,580
Peter, are you there?

937
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,260
Peter, are you there?

938
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,160
What time is it?

939
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,020
Hey! Where did he land at?

940
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,920
Just a second here.

941
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,800
It's fabulous.

942
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,480
It's fabulous.

943
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,300
It's all green.

944
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,080
It's beautiful.

945
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,040
It looks...

946
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,800
It's gorgeous.

947
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,740
What are you going to do next, Peter?

948
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,920
I don't know, but with these new pills,

949
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,680
it'll be easy to make up my mind.

950
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,560
Okay.

951
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,780
Well, listen, we...

952
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,400
I'm going to look for some of those Soviet officials, I guess.

953
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,920
Oh, hey, hang on, Peter.

954
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,340
Okay.

955
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:12,740
Hang on.

956
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,520
Don't go away.

957
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,720
Listen, the console is indicating

958
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,640
we have a very special phone call here.

959
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,040
Could you hang on a minute?

960
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,260
No, no trouble.

961
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,520
We have a...

962
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,400
We have a...

963
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:23,400


964
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,100
Someone's on call.

965
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:24,460
Someone's on call.

966
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:24,460


967
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:24,840
Someone's on call.

968
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,660
Someone's on call.

969
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,220
Just a moment, Peter.

970
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,540
Let me adjust the scale.

971
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,820
All right.

972
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,880
Go ahead with that call.

973
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,480
Coming into the space network from the White House.

974
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,740
Oh, my God, Peter.

975
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,640
This is very special.

976
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,280
Listen to this.

977
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,620
We would like to patch them through.

978
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:41,680
All right.

979
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,300
Go ahead.

980
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,600
If you would, please, Mr. President, go ahead.

981
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:51,180
I think your trip is just going to ignite the excitement

982
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,640
and the forward thinking for this country,

983
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,640
so I really...

984
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,160
I really just wanted to call up and wish you the very best.

985
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,520
It's God-forsaken lush green foliage out here.

986
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,100
It's...

987
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:01,420
It's...

988
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:01,620
It's...

989
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:01,800
It's...

990
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,220
It's...

991
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:02,400
It's...

992
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,420
It's...

993
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:02,900
It's...

994
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:04,880
It's...

995
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,380
It's...

996
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:05,680
Oh, really?

997
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,160
Can you hear Mr. Bush all right?

998
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:08,740
I'm...

999
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,580
I'm...

1000
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,440
Wait, he's still on.

1001
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,160
He's still on.

1002
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,300
Mr. Bush, are you still there?

1003
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,680
I couldn't understand that.

1004
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,180
Yes, just a moment.

1005
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:16,760
No.

1006
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,200
I just thought he was a calm guy out there, you know,

1007
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
and now look at him.

1008
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,680
How are you going to do that?

1009
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,480
It's great talking to you,

1010
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,620
and I'll let you go back to work.

1011
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,400
What's the next thing you've got to do?

1012
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,720
That's what I was wondering.

1013
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,900
Move forward, I guess.

1014
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,580
I voted Democratic, you know.

1015
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,720
Oh, that's great.

1016
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,700
I'm sure it'll go well.

1017
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,040
Sitting right behind my desk is that model you gave me down there

1018
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,700
and also the picture of you two guys,

1019
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,200
and it was there before this phone call, too.

1020
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,940
Oh, how about that, Peter?

1021
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:42,720
Great deal.

1022
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,240
May I address the vice president?

1023
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,420
He cut out.

1024
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,500
I think it's probably an attribute to the fabulous and magnetic qualities

1025
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,240
of your personality supported extensively

1026
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,460
as I can attest to.

1027
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,740
My personality.

1028
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,020
My personality.

1029
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,600
What do you think?

1030
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,660
Oh, Peter, your signal's all jamming up now.

1031
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,720
It's on this end.

1032
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,840
Everything looks very great.

1033
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:12,680
Peter.

1034
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:16,320
Peter.

1035
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,420
Well, Peter has faded out.

1036
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:24,600
Thank you.

1037
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:24,840
Thank you.

1038
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1039
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1040
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1041
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1042
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1043
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1044
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1045
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1046
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1047
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,180
That happens occasionally on these shortwave cellular phone transmissions.

1048
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,400
I'm sure he'll be back later.

1049
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,320
He's got our number.

1050
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,780
And my God, things are a little strange tonight, folks.

1051
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,700
Kill the ocean, that's one thing I'm still in command of.

1052
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,820
You're listening to the Piddle Diddle Report.

1053
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,020
Peter Diddle, of course, you just heard out on Howland Island

1054
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,680
doing a grand job making his way up towards those lights, hopefully.

1055
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,320
If he can hear me, towards the lights, Peter.

1056
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,600
Let's go to a...

1057
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,120
message right now and come back and continue as usual.

1058
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,620
This is the American Broadcasting System.

1059
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,040
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1060
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:14,780
And that was Negative Land, their new CD.

1061
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,000
Actually, it's a double CD set.

1062
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,600
It's Negative Land presents some best of from their over the edge,

1063
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:29,800
radio show, the Time Zones Exchange Project.

1064
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,760
Well, we're just swimming in code tonight, aren't we?

1065
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,860
Yes, the Church of the Subgenius has gone online

1066
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,020
and off the wall and over the edge.

1067
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,040
And why not?

1068
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,820
While I'm at it, I suppose I should give

1069
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,600
the sacred post office box number of the Church of the Subgenius.

1070
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,580
Yes, this is the place to write.

1071
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,600
Drop us a postcard or a self-addressed stamped envelope

1072
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,060
for information on other subgenius information.

1073
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,320
And that number is, you know, that's not the kind of music

1074
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,600
that you want to put in the background when you're given the sacred post office box.

1075
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,340
That number is, dear friends.

1076
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,000
Hey, that music's even worse.

1077
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,540
There we go.

1078
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:23,560
Okay, the post office box is, well, just right there, Bob.

1079
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,180
He ain't going to read your letter, but I will.

1080
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,340
Maybe.

1081
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:43,500
Just address that to Bob at post office box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1082
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,820
And now, as promised.

1083
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:50,320
Oh, by the way, that zip code once again was 76043.

1084
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,880
Because they know.

1085
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,480
Yes, over there.

1086
00:53:54,620 --> 00:54:00,440
At the mighty P, those P.O. buckers at the P.O. know.

1087
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,960
They see all and they know all.

1088
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,080
But they don't tell all.

1089
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,900
But I'm going to tell you the email address.

1090
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,720
As promised, you can email the church now.

1091
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,900
And it's one word, one nice long string of words.

1092
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,940
Subgestang1 at AOL.com.

1093
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,500
I'm going to go through that.

1094
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,740
This one time.

1095
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:31,040
It's S-U-B-G-S-T-A-N-G.

1096
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,960
Numeral 1.

1097
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,680
That's Subgestang1.

1098
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,260
That's all you need if you're on America Online.

1099
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:45,620
But for everybody else, it's Subgestang1 at, you know, the little A with a circle around it.

1100
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,520
A-O-L dot C-O-M.

1101
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,840
It's America Online Communications.

1102
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,120
Me, me, me.

1103
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,340
And you'd be surprised.

1104
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,580
I sit up every night and go through the mail.

1105
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:05,780
As one subgenius out there said, or on there said,

1106
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,960
it's like a P.O. box that never closes.

1107
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,120
And your wife and kids, or husband and kids,

1108
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,620
sit and wonder why you sit and peck away at that little box,

1109
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:29,700
that evil box that the conspiracy can, you know, they can monitor everything we say and do.

1110
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,340
But you know, friends, I mean, I'm so used to it.

1111
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,620
All these poor folks on the internet are complaining about censorship,

1112
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,780
and they can't advertise or cuss.

1113
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:43,940
I've been under those limitations doing this show for all these many years.

1114
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:50,420
And it's just, it's something, in a way, of course, we intend to dismantle their evil system.

1115
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,060
But for now, you have to look at it.

1116
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,580
It is sort of a challenge, you know.

1117
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:59,760
You have to invent your own new cuss words and evile code words and so forth.

1118
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,460
Well, anyway, enough of that.

1119
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,880
Let's let the show go out.

1120
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,500
This is Osric Tentaclesmore in the background.

1121
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:15,520
Let's listen to Dr. Howell on the Puzzling Evidence show.

1122
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,320
That's what he calls it now.

1123
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,300
This particular tape, I'm not sure what it's going to be,

1124
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,260
but I know what it's from.

1125
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:28,820
It's from Phineas Narco's compilations of that show.

1126
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:36,500
You can get information about a catalog of the KPFA subgenius show from Phineas Narco.

1127
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,500
Okay.

1128
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,340
What, what, what, what, what?

1129
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,920
And is it consistent with the Small Minded Law?

1130
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,120
Yes, and with the Small Mind Administration,

1131
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,420
which has officially certified it with the house-shrinking seal of approval.

1132
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,280
And here on the side, right under there,

1133
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,880
that are the, well, this is interesting.

1134
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,720
It's the ingredients.

1135
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:55,800
It says,

1136
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,340
U.S. certified sludge, water, sucrose, muscimol extract,

1137
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,160
ibuprofenic acid, muscazone, dimethyltryptamine, serotonin,

1138
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,800
natural sludge flavorings,

1139
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,120
contains one fortieth of one percent gabofrop,

1140
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,380
an artificial mood enhancer,

1141
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,040
which should be used only by those who must restrict their intake of ordinary humor.

1142
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,260
Caution, product may be habit-forming.

1143
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,440
Do not operate radio while taking this medication.

1144
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,460
Do not operate heavy farm machinery.

1145
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,580
Do not use any medication that is in excess of 70 miles per hour.

1146
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,680
Do not attempt to explain yourself to others.

1147
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,580
Maintain an aspect of normal human.

1148
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:30,460
Consult your sub-physician or any doctor the errors condition persists.

1149
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,320
Okay, well, this looks like the stuff.

1150
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,480
So I'm going to take some right here on the show.

1151
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,380
Oh, oh no.

1152
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,920
Yep, here goes.

1153
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:37,800
Okay.

1154
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:39,880
Oh my God.

1155
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,720
Ugh, boy, it's...

1156
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,320
That's better.

1157
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,720
My God, it's incredible.

1158
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,700
Well, take them on a finite break.

1159
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,960
I've started a Boeing cycle, caller.

1160
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:52,900
Stop it.

1161
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,860
This has never happened before.

1162
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,660
Stop it.

1163
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:54,980
Stop it.

1164
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,180
I think I'm going to be sucked into the world of Boeings.

1165
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,240
The world of nothing but Boeings.

1166
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:01,900
The Boeing dimension.

1167
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,280
It's right behind you, Mobius.

1168
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,880
The world of Boeings that we could be internally trapped in.

1169
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,700
If we don't watch out, there'll be nothing on the show but Boeings.

1170
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,940
How do you get some of this stuff?

1171
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,540
Well, I told you what was in it.

1172
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,800
You can rip up a batch yourself.

1173
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,220
But I don't know half of that stuff.

1174
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,780
It's a free sample in each package.

1175
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,020
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1176
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,800
Wait, wait, wait.

1177
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,720
Oh, no.

1178
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:25,920
Get those.

1179
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,720
Oh, the Boeings.

1180
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,400
They're too much.

1181
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,780
Too much Boeings.

1182
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,180
Too much Boeings.

1183
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,120
Oh, my.

1184
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,260
Oh, that one was wonderful.

1185
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,300
Need a towel?

1186
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,280
Oh, no.

1187
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,900
I threw a towel over it the moment it happened.

1188
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,020
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for, the penultimate

1189
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,260
comedian of all time.

1190
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:52,280
Oh, my God.

1191
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1192
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1193
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1194
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1195
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1196
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1197
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1198
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1199
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1200
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1201
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,280


1202
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,680
I'm E. Transon Steinman.

1203
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,360
You can't get no...

1204
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,040
He's a hilarious, hell-raising hypocrite of hallelujah.

1205
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:59,980
It's the Jainer Diva.

1206
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,000
Who's that?

1207
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,660
You, man.

1208
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:03,980
You.

1209
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,120
You're on the air.

1210
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,000
You're a big shot.

1211
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,120
Make them laugh.

1212
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:15,640
However, off the public support at Airwise, I can tell you to send $35 or you will die

1213
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,560
on X day or something much, much worse.

1214
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,260
And if you already have become a subgenius minister, God bless you.

1215
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:27,760
You've gotten that huge 25-piece membership kit with button and bumper stickers and minister's

1216
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,140
card and many frameable certificates and lots of dog's heads.

1217
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:37,380
You might not have the book of the subgenius or Neighbor World or even our world-famous

1218
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,420
pamphlets over 100,000 sold.

1219
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,140
Well, not Neighbor World, about 80 of those maybe.

1220
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,640
But come on, man.

1221
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,180
A thing?

1222
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:52,240
For that matter, there's fast clothing designs and drinkware with subgenius.

1223
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,900
There's subgenius graphics on them and all manner of fine Dobbs wear and Dobbs gimmickry

1224
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:04,480
and Bob gadgets and DVDs of movies, good and bad ones, mostly pretty good and very weird.

1225
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,920
And CDs of what we did before the radio shows and after, like stage shows and such.

1226
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:18,240
Boy, it's just an immense mess of keen and yet sacred collectibles, enjoyables and guilty

1227
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:18,900
pleasures.

1228
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,220
And the book of the subgenius is awesome.

1229
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:22,220


1230
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,600
It's autographed when you get it from us.

1231
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,600
Not by Bob, no, sorry, just me.

1232
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,400
