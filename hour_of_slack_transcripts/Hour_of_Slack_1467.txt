How'd it go?
Did I get it?
I've been practicing all the ways I can die.
This reeks of bob.
This has nothing to do with my talent
and everything to do with his broken dreams in his head.
That's classy, Bob.

written in Bob's book of holy recipes you are what you meet so let's have a
look at the subgenius menu shall we first and foremost what does a subgenius
drink why alcohol of course because it kills germs now that's assuming that
you're 21 and in the custody of a parent legal guardian second what does the
subgenius eat well a real subgenius eats meat red meat dripping with blood fresh
off the farm and still steaming with body heat the subgenius carved his own
flushing meat and bone so he will be prepared to hack the flushing meat and
bones of his opponents come next day the best meat my friends is pork sausage
stuffed in pigs bladders it symbolizes the pigs were gonna come eat on BD day
and of course the ham represents audacity and the natural subgenius
tendency to act up in front of an audience pickled pig's feet is a
delicacy that we eat in remembrance of the fat ones who jog in front of our
house on a daily basis big brains help us learn
through the subgenius menu that we eat and remember it's a delicacy that we eat
through osmosis how the cops think so we can outsmart them in the meantime but
there is one pig part that a subgenius must never touch though many
attempters may try to entice you to eat of it with promises of sex or increased
sex drive or what have you not the subgenius must never eat the genitalia
of a pig even if it's pickled to put it frankly to eat it of another one's
pleasure parts is a punch below the belt so don't do it
real subgenius don't need aphrodisiacs anyway it's in our genes or brain
emas as well asbility and forecast in general to improve our health and
Queensland eat without the meat for a complete or baby so you need to be
altruistic for our breasts as it's all seen as a thing without gender não
aimed at
you know the meat acá é a parte delries
inside this menu for you men right there pie
or 8
I said you're thinking that bunch distributing less pain in the animal
is I said me cute that people sometimes of which Isabel Eddie you it only�
experiencing more. At least the meat eaters had the decency to kill what they eat before they eat
it. But with the carrot or celery or lettuce or turnips, they not only rip it from Mother Earth's
open wound, they then scalp it and chill it and scrape it and serve it alive for you to chew into
little bits, dicing all those poor little mini plants into sections, separating neighborhoods
and entire families from one another. Then they begin a long and grotesque trek into the dreck of
the human body, down the tunnel of damnation into the bottomless pit of acids and amino acids,
there and only there, to a lucky few in their pitiful little lives, eaten alive by the acidic
acid of chemicals that would be declared hazardous if they existed anywhere but in the stomach.
Yes, dear friends, it's a holocaust of horrors down there in the gut. Those few chunks, unfortunately,
enough to survive the acid ordeal, start a never-ending rollercoaster ride down the eternal
intestines, where they are slowly robbed not only of their nutrition, but of their dignity as well.
Whole potatoes turn into mash before their very eyes. It's too revolting to reflect upon why
scientists have even conducted experiments using electroencephalograms and found that the poor
little plants have survived hours of torture only to be digested alive and then flushed down the
drain like some huge tampon.
Suffice to say, dear friends, in comparison, we meat-eaters are indeed merciful, since we kill first and eat later and not the other way around.
At least we're noble enough to put our food out of its misery.
But let's face it, there's so little justice in the world. However, you may comfort yourself in the small consolation that the vegetarian will get his just desserts in the end,
because a vegetarian, dear friends, he that uproots from the earth that which she meant to grow, will one day be buried in the earth also, and there, there, dear friends,
Mother Earth,
will reap her revenge.
The little worms and maggots will crawl forth from the soil, wiggling and nibbling on the dastardly body of the delicious deceased.
They shall demonstrate firsthand, and secondhand also, just what it means to eat meat, just how good it really is, just how much it makes you grow, just how fast it makes you reproduce.
All the formaldehyde in the world can't stop the determination of those digging demons from the Underworld. Just you wait and see.
Alas, dear friends, there is only one power strong enough to dissuade, and that is the power of the mother earth, the mother earth.
our little parasitical friends.
And that, my friends, is the force
of Bob with the Big Worm Dobbs.
For it is written, and it shall come to pass,
that on X-Day the good subgenius
shall rise up from the grave.
These armies will be whole but hungry.
They shall join up with the legions of X-Men
and eat the panicking pinks alive.
Yes, dear friends, having a normal for dinner
may not seem very pleasant now.
But what about Judgment Day?
All the supermarkets will be closed.
And so will the restaurants, too.
And remember, you need plenty of manpower
to sustain that galactic journey to the promised land.
So don't just stay in there.
Roll up your sleeves and get digging.
We've got trenches to fill and hatchets to bury.
So be a good citizen and recycle.
It's our turn to show the sophisticates
just how poor our tastes really are.
Roll up the barrel, party, and praise Bob.
Amen.
From God.

I don't like the pink. It's a little creepy.
Yeah, it's a little creepy, but so is what we do to the self-genius world.
Invoking a religious experience. It's quite a big job.
Can I ask you a, uh, I, can I ask you a, uh, I, I, I know you, I, I know you, I, I, I know you've answered a million beetle questions.
all the time, but I have to ask you,
there's one story that I've never thought,
I've always wondered, is this true,
or is this just one of those things that was made up?
But there's a famous story that Bob introduced you guys
to pot for the first time.
You had never tried it before, and that's the story,
and I thought, is that true?
No, it is true.
It is true.
But he didn't actually give us it.
He was in the room.
So he was not the supplier?
No.
Yeah, Bob, your dealer.
Now, Bob was in the room in the hotel
when it was arranged that someone else
would bring some stuff.
There's a church for licking toads.
It's the Church of the...
So genius.
It's a little bit funny, Bob.
I'm former Senator Bob.
In reality, he's off to a church.
In reality, he's off to a church.

So, how do you know everyone?
Oh, I'm a friend of Bob's.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No offense, but I just ain't comfortable

whatchamacallit, Bob's.

You know?
Please?
I'm talking about some slack.
Every time this dude enters,
he really ends up a goddamn bop.
Taking up some of the slack
might help to release the dummy.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Bobby.
All right, well, look at all this stuff.
What are we getting?
Bob.
That's their specialty.
Love that bop.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll have the bop.
That's the last bop.
They got the last bop.
I know.
They're going in first with the last bop.
That was our bop?
You can't beat a bop.
We had that bop.
They're gonna be heroes.
Well, what are we gonna do now?
If we can't get the bop,
the whole thing is useless.
That was our bop.
We had that bop.
What's this one?
That bop.
Another bop?
We'll be going in with lesser bop.
I beg your pardon?
Lesser bop?
I think not.
We'll have a bop.
Whatever happened to bop?
Yeah, bop spelled backwards.
It's still bop.
Hey, for every stank,
I got a new joke for you.
It's just bop is what it is.
It's just...
It's literally bop.
Yes, sir, re-bop.
Yes, sir, ma'am, Elvira.
Well, that was Elvira at the very end there.
Um...
Little clip.
I know...
That arrangement of clips
was done by the great and large...
The large of Finland,
who I think we're going to meet in Germany
in August.
And when that happens,
we'll get to the bottom of this.
Yeah, the large sent in about 20 minutes
of new collage and...
Collarge.
And that was part of it.
We also heard a great sermon
from Father Joe Mama,
Bob's Kosher Kitchen.
And Fernanda Nandy-Lemur
is responsible for PR News.
Oh, and that was the large singing,
I believe, in those...
There were two or three new
Bob hymns...
Yes.
...worked into all of that.
And I believe that was...
I'm guessing that was
the largest singing voice.
Wow.
Right here.
Uh-huh.
And who else...
Who else can we gossip about?
Oh, oh, oh, shh.
Dave's here.
Be quiet.
Don't...
Dave's here.
That sounds good.
What's so funny?
What is so funny?
What's funny anymore?
What is funny?
Really, what is funny?
It's reference dank.
He makes me laugh.
He also makes you sweat
and smell funny, too.
Well, yeah.
You know...
We don't talk about that so much.
You have to buy the entire package.
That's not my fault.
But...
Oddball.
Weirdo.
Cult leader.
Are you making fun of me?
Oddball.
What?
Lunatic.
Local monster
monster
disguised as a local monster.
Oh, that's...
I like that one.
Just because my name is
We Are Dough,
he calls me weirdo.
How about that?
You know, a lot of people
have never made that connection.
They see your name
written out in print.
Princess We
quote
R unquote
Dough
as in toys are us.
The R is always backwards.
Thanks.
Thanks, Palmer.
And, uh...
But they never...
But it's like...
And once every five years,
somebody goes,
oh, we are...
That's like weirdo.
Even better is the 13013,
which people go,
oh, it's a subgenius
sacred number for some reason,
but I never have gotten that.
All I can say is
write those numbers
real close together.
13013.
Overlap the one and the three
if you want to.
One, one, three.
Oh, one, three.
Yeah.
And it's...
Oh, wow.
That is...
Wow.
See, now Dave
has joined the club
of densities.
That is more than dense.
Hypercritical sensitivity
and exorcism.
That is a revelation of...
That's the hand of Dobbs
in everything we do.
Yeah, us forgetting...
Us not noticing.
Every 13013,
that's for sure.
Hiding in plain sight.
Oh, there are other ones?
There are other numbers
you can write?
Well, I've been
dense that same way.
Reverend Fight C. Taj
had to tell me
four or five times
what his name stood for.
And I can't say it
on the radio.
At least I can't do
the first letter of his name.
I can't say what that stands for.
But you can say the letter.
If they can't...
Um, if they can't take it.
If they can't take a joke.
Yeah, it's the rest of his name,
which comes out as
Fight C. Taj.
Yeah.
I can't say it.
That's how much
they can't take a joke?
The first time he showed me that
or told me that,
he started barking and panting
real loud right after he said it.
He explained it.
He said,
like that.
Well, at least you remembered it, C,
because it didn't work for me.
But I don't remember anything
that happens at X Day Drill.
It's a convenience relief,
isn't it, Stang?
It is.
Step into the little quiet room
where there's no room anymore.
Suddenly your feet disappear.
You're like a Japanese ghost
floating around the atmosphere.
That's my favorite part of X Day.
Well, at least, you know,
you don't get your doodle wet.
Oh, I do.
Eventually I get my noodle wet,
but then it usually, like,
soaks for way too long
and it's all wrinkly
and pink
when I take it out.
And not only that,
but it smells funny
and there's bugs and things on it.
But that's the way
baptisms are
at Wisteria Campground.
Stinky,
full of dysentery
and diphtheria.
Imagine yourself
on a coach ride to Baltimore
and it's like 1794 and stuff
and you've got dysentery
or the colic
or you're misplaced
or something like that
and your parents,
your parents have to get you there
and they got enough money together
to go on a coach
so you could be there in a week, you know?
And you go ahead and die anyway
because you're only 54 years old.
That's what my X Day drills are like.
I mean, I assume they are.
I can't really remember most of them.
I end up listening to tapes
for hours afterwards going,
huh, so that's what we did.
And nursing your fever blisters.
That ain't all I'm nursing.
Yep, I guess you got little puppies.
A few puppies you're taking care of right now.
Nodge, nodge, fink, fink.
You have to grow, what,
eight breasts to pull off a job like that?
I mean, not literally,
but metaphorically eight breasts.
Meaning you have to be the swine of all dogs
of the Babylonian calendar or something.
Are you making fun of me
because I only have seven breasts?
Yes.
No.
Well, you could be.
You're laughing at me.
She's laughing at me.
That's not politically correct.
Well, that just means you are not the whore of Babylon
when Easter parades.
That's assault.
I was told that once by a panhandler.
This panhandler came up
and gave me the same old tired routine.
I don't have enough money
to take my bus home to my sick kid.
I started going,
I started critiquing his thing.
Dude, I've heard that one a million times.
If you came up with something new,
even though I know it's fake,
I might give you some money.
And he goes, that's assault.
You're assaulting me.
I said, well, why don't you call that cop
over there on the other corner and report me?
And then they looked at me like,
how dare you?
That's even worse assault.
Just got all slustered up.
Yeah.
When I was in New York,
there was a lady with a very bad,
very damaged,
which she parlayed into plenty of spare change
at various subway stations.
And where I worked,
I had to go to the same subway stations every day.
And so I was quite familiar with the lady
and her routine.
And man, she was rich.
She was rich.
And I was surrounded by other people
who were like younger people,
you know, with college attire and stuff
and who were real idealistic and everything.
And I blurted out how many times she goes,
not eat for food.
Not eat for food.
Not eat for food.
Not eat for food.
Like that.
And I went,
hey lady,
how many times are you going to eat today?
I'm hungry right now.
So they got mad at me.
Yeah.
Yeah,
because you're not supposed to critique their begging.
They're supposed to give them money, basically.
Anything you do but give them money is bad form.
You know what I do a lot of times in that situation
since I'm a stingy old bastard?
All I have to do is,
is go look at my shoes.
And then,
they get a sad, downtrodden look on their face.
They turn and shuffle away.
I have actually seen you do that.
I've witnessed this.
Right.
Well, they usually have much better shoes than I'm wearing.
Yeah, sometimes you just say,
oh, hang in there, bro.
Hang in there.
I'll give you the thumbs up and walk away
looking kind of determined and sad at the same time.
Like some people got it worse than me.
I mean,
sometimes it's,
like,
blue is the face on your,
you know,
the pain.
Well, I mean,
there are times when
they've had them come up to me and go,
oh,
I'm an alcoholic
and I'm just hurting real bad.
You know,
it's Sunday morning.
I'll give them a couple of bucks.
Because they're,
at least they're honest
and they're going to be dead pretty soon.
I might as well make their last few
hours,
whatever it is,
you know.
I mean,
on the other hand,
it's been a long time since I've done that.
Because it's like,
no, man,
I need that $2 for beer myself.
I'm dying.
I'm hurting too,
dude.
Oh, well.
Have you ever panhandled
the wrong panhandler?
No.
No, I've never.
I've been
a lucky guy
and I've never had to
bum anything but a cigarette.
I saw an angry one yesterday.
He was like,
hey, man,
you got any spare change?
Like that.
And so,
and I didn't.
Because he was acting
extremely like violently drunk,
you know.
Yeah.
And publicly intoxicated
so lots of people could see.
And I just said,
no, I don't have any.
I didn't have any anyway.
And he started swearing at me
in a loud voice.
Right.
Yeah.
How dare you?
Man, I got to get away
from this guy.
I think that's what they call
entitlement,
you know.
That guy was entitled
to your money.
And how dare you
not just do what the,
you know,
what the rules say.
Well,
when you first said that,
all I could think of was
he was entitled
to urinate freely
to urinate freely
wherever he chose.
And that,
that wasn't part of it.
When they handed down
the dictum,
you know,
the dogma
to us young students,
you couldn't just like
wet your pants
and argue with people
in the street.
You had to,
there was some degree
of decorum.
Right.
Back then you couldn't.
Now you have to.
Yeah.
Like you can't,
they don't even hear you talking
unless you're visibly
wetting your pants.
All you're yelling at them.
It's just the way
things are today.
The world's gone to hell.
I tell you,
this country,
this country,
oh my God,
what's happening
to this country?
If only it could be wonderful
like it was back in,
oh,
I don't know,
1929,
back in the good old days.
Yeah,
back in the good old
Dust Bowl days.
Oh,
Bill Hicks had a good,
Bill Hicks had a really
good comeback for
when somebody would go,
spare change.
Bill Hicks would say,
no thanks.
I'll pay you back.
I've got some.
I tried that on a guy
not being very original.
I mean,
but the guy left himself open.
He goes,
spare change.
I go,
no thanks.
I walked into the store
and when I came back
out of the store,
the guy goes,
oh,
well,
hey buddy,
I didn't mean I wanted
to give you spare change.
I wanted you to give me
spare change.
He wanted to make sure
I understood,
you know.
He thought it was funny
that I had missed
understood what he was saying,
you know.
I guess I wasn't,
he thought I wasn't
sophisticated enough
to understand that was
a request,
not an offer.
Did you ever make
the mistake of having
somebody say,
I'm a war vet
and I can't walk very well,
can you give me a ride home?
Oh boy.
I can,
you can burn a lot of gas
and sometimes you want
to go to beer joints
along the way
and they want you to buy
them beers and stuff like that.
Well, see,
they never got that far
with me, Dave,
because as,
as Princess Wee
will attest,
I'm mean.
Yes,
he's mean.
I'm good, though.
I'm not,
I'm not bad.
I'm mean,
but I'm not bad.
I'm actually good.
I'm like Batman.
Batman's mean, too,
but he ultimately,
you'd rather have him
on your side.
Right.
Well, I was thinking that,
yeah,
there's the perfect
panhandling rules
is to shred up
a Batman suit,
you know,
make it look like
he's been sleeping in
for a couple weeks
and stuff.
I'm following
it hard,
but there are times,
Robin.
Oh, you're not Robin.
You need help
finding the Batmobile
to get back
to New Jersey somehow.
The Batmobile's all...
Actually, you know,
the sad thing was
I kind of knew
a Batman
in that situation
back in Dallas.
I mean,
I know a guy
who dressed as Robin
and he had a Batmobile.
It was Reverend Bucknaked,
former Pastor Bucknaked,
I should say.
He wanted to make sure
everyone knows
that he invented
the Church of the Subgenius,
but he didn't want to have
anything to do with it anymore.
There's dozens of people
who invented
the Church of the Subgenius,
but they don't want to have
anything to do with it anymore
because of all those
other people.
Yeah.
How could anybody
be so insipid
as to think
they invented something
that was already invented
by the U.S. government
72 years ago?
Yes.
Dave!
Oh, I've got
delay dump.
I'll just dump that.
No, I'm just...
I'm just...







There!
No one heard it.
Well, I mean, look
what it did for L. Ron Hubbard.
It made him rich and famous
and it hasn't been
a damn thing for years.
J.R. Bob Dobbs
invented the Church
of the Subgenius
upon his immaculation
at the hand of
Jehovah One,
alien space god
from a corporate
sin galaxy.
Okay.
Yes, we know this.
It says that
right there in Arise,
the Subgenius video.
I'm a believer, man.
I believe you.
Yeah, we're all believers here.
We're believing
Justin Bieber.
We're believers.
Actually, I didn't even know
what that Justin Bieber guy
looked like.
And then I realized,
oh, that cute girl
that keeps showing
on those magazine covers,
that's Justin Bieber?
Oh, I thought she was
kind of cute.
Kind of a mannish,
a little bit mannish looking.
I mean...
Yeah, right.
He is.
A primate looked at you.
Do you hear what he's saying?
He said he looked like a mandrill.
And you meant it, too.
No, that's when I saw
him from behind.
How could you miss that?
That bright purple.
Yeah, you want to make sure
it misses you.
I've always wanted
a purple stranger.
I always thought
that would be the...
You know, that would be
a real manhood thing
if we were a culture
that understood our roots.
You know, that humanity
was really not space aliens,
but a bunch of monkeys
that drank radioactive water
sometime around the same era.
Oh, Dave.
Era.
Epic is Gojira.
You think that we should...
I hate to ask this,
but have you checked
your sphincter lately?
Because...
Are you sure it's not purple?
I do check my sphincter regularly
and I'm proud to admit
that I've had it
scooting around a lot.


It's nice.
By public officials
and various members
of the Department of Inclusion.
And then it passed mustard,
you say?
I hate it when a minute
passes mustard.
It probably burns.
Of course it does.
That's why they cut it
to the pan.
Oh, my God.
How stupid.
And I was the one
who had to say it.
And I would cry.
I learned a new term
the other day.
What was it?
Benign prostate hyperphagia.
Did I already say that
on the radio
or was that just a phone call
earlier today?
No.
You said it for the first time
just the other day, though.
I heard it.
Philo told me about it.
Yes.
My doctor,
Dr. Philo Drummond.
He gave me an exam
and charged me a lot of money.
And then he told me that word
and he said,
but there's nothing
you can do about it.
So, you know,
simply,
I mean,
he goes,
leaning to one side helps me.
Well, I thought
you could use needles
to decompress
some of the,
you know,
some of the more vapid rumors
going around there.
They did that to Pappy
back in the day.
They did use a needle.
And, you know,
then there's the glass rod
ramming routine
that Papa Joe Mama
referred to
a couple of rants back.
They used the needle
on his hyperphagia?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No.
But it was related.
Oh.
Hyperphagia means,
I think,
swollen,
growing,
lumpy.
Not shrinking.
It means not shrinking.
Ah.
Extended.
But you could do
the same thing,
I suppose,
riding on a horse
without a saddle
and a meat cleaver
hooked up to
the right area.
But only a few of,
well, the original
Siberians,
you know,
the examiner,
the examiner,
the examiner,









the original,
you know,
the original Siberian.
A snail
crawling along
the edge
of a straight razor.
He used to ride their back
and never,
never had an example
of the same type
of hyperphagia.
A snail
crawling along
the edge
of a straight razor.
Now, you're making
little reptile jokes
about my family
and stuff.
Or about my genetic,
my,
my spirit.
No, I'm being a poet.
No.
I'm being a poet.
I'm quoting the great poet
Colonel Kurtz.
A snail crawling
along the edge
of a straight razor.
Oh, yeah, man.
And I couldn't come back,
like, what's his name?
All I could think of
was, like,
mango pudding
or something
and tigers and stuff.
That's okay.
Stay on the boat.
Don't get off the boat.
That's the lesson
of the tiger.
Right.
That was the button
I was going to push.
I wasn't even
in the right terminal.
You know,
we're quoting
from Apocalypse Now
for the youngsters.
You know,
my buddies
who served
in Vietnam
or were served,
as the case might be,
all told me
that movies
like Apocalypse Now
and Full Metal Jacket
are full of it.
Full of Metal Jacket.
And I,
I didn't want to hear that
because, you know,
those,
those movies
make the war
look kind of cool
and stylish in a way
because they have
rock music in them.
Yes.
And my,
my friends said,
well,
even though there was
the rock music,
sometimes it wasn't like that.
And,
and they were disgusted.
Like,
how dare these filmmakers
not get it right?
And I'm thinking,
well,
how right can you get
a movie?
And how can that
in any way
compare to the reality
of sweating
in that foxhole?
You know,
of course
they can't get it right.
No,
just can't.
That would hurt too much.
No movie star
or director
is going to do that
if they don't get it right.
They can help it.
Although I do,
I got offered a job
by one of those guys
who does like to go
get shot at.
It deliberately
goes into war zones
to get shot at.
Mickey Grant,
the movie director,
called me up
just last week
and said he wanted me
to go to Crimea
for only a week,
for just a week
to edit this stuff.
And I said,
man,
I don't do that.
I wouldn't,
I don't even know
how to edit anymore.
Hardly.
Not pro stuff.
You'd hire my son.
I wouldn't want to be
holed up in a,
in a French,
uh,
in a French hotel
somewhere while the
bottom of the two floors
are burning from,
uh,
Well,
what Mickey said to me
is,
but Doug,
you're the only person
who's crazy enough
to work with me.
He thinks my name
is Doug.
He does a great
imitation of Mickey.
Well,
Mickey actually
has done some really,
really good films.
I was proud to be
the editor and writer
of the Coochie Tunnels.
And,
uh,
even,
uh,
uh,
a,
a movie called
China Run.
These are both documentaries.
One was filmed in China.
One was filmed in Vietnam.
And I didn't go to Vietnam,
but I did get to go to China.
And three years
after the day
I left a copy of
Book of the Subgenius
in Tiananmen Square,
thousands of students
were massacred
in that very spot.
Three years to the day.
And it's about 25,
we're about to come
to the 25th anniversary
of the Tiananmen Square
street party.
Right,
right on the mittens,
George.
You got it.
Yep.
And I read today
there were students
in China saying,
we are protest
for democracy.
But,
don't they know
what happens?
Well,
they don't quite
understand.
I guess a lot of those
people wearing
the Statue of Liberty
costumes
had failed
to produce
a popular ID
when they were
renting them.
And they didn't pay
for the,
um,
the suitcase
or any other
accoutrements
they had to wear
and stuff like that.
And they were told
that they would
probably be shot
if they were walking
around like that.
Oh, God,
the footage of all
those people
dressed in
Statue of Liberty
costumes with blood
running out of them
strewn across
Tiananmen Square
and Kent State
campus.
That was just
horrible.
That simultaneous
massacres
last week
at Kent State
and Tiananmen Square
of everyone
trying to sell
you their,
uh,
tax and accounting
skills
dressed in a
Statue of Liberty
outfit.
All those corpses
laying there
moaning and bleeding
in China
and Ohio.
Now,
there was only
four dead in Ohio,
but it was
4,000 dead
in China.
Well,
this is a real story
I'm going to tell you
right now.
A friend of mine
who also worked
in China
like you did
many times,
he said the number
could have been
as high as
800,000,
maybe even a million.
I guess towards the end.
What?
Are you talking about
the Cultural Revolution
or Tiananmen Square?
I'm talking about
Tiananmen Square.
He claimed that
they didn't let the word
get out too much
and you know how
they got all the
National Guards
and they were all
hopped up saying
that, you know,
nobody was going to
get free education
and that the
capitalists were
coming back
and all this stuff
like that.
And if you didn't,
anyway,
so they got those
people all riled up
and then they told
them a bunch of
other junk
and I guess
towards the last,
the end of it,
they went nuts.
Are you talking about
the soldiers that
were sent in there?
The soldiers.
The soldiers.
The Chinese,
actually,
what I understood
was that
the government
first told
local
cop soldiers
to go in
and kill these
students
and they balked.
They wouldn't do it.
Yeah,
they had to

So they brought in
soldiers from
the rural areas
who automatically
hated these
effete intellectual
capitalist college
students who wanted
democracy.
Yeah,
they got them out
from out in the sticks
and they told them
all kinds of crazy stuff.
And they shot them up
with speed.
They gave them
a whole ton of speed
and said,
go in there
and mow them down,
boys.
Get them Yankees.
Get them smart-alecky
effete New York Yankees
from Beijing.
Beijingies.
Well,
I mean,
there is,
there is a difference
between that
and the National Guardsmen
in the United States
at Kent State.
They're 20 years apart.
No,
10 years.
Seems
so long ago.
Oh, well.
44 years ago
was when Kent State
was like
at the beginning of May
and some kind of
I guess
in some
bizarre
sub-browser
relations
in the beginning
of May
is when you also
dance between
dancing around
the Maypole
and then you
dance around
and sacrifice
some young studs,
you know,
or young women's,
young virgins,
you know,
and that's how
you do it.
Are you talking
about Starwood
or Kent State?
Because there is
a slight difference
between those two things.
No,
I was talking
about Kent State
originally,
but I don't really
see the,
how it relates
to Starwood.
Well,
the virgins
and the states
and the burnings
and the birds.
There's nothing
like that
at Starwood
Reverend's.
Right,
I know,
there's no virgins.
There's no virgins?
Yeah,
there are.
There are.
Well,
there are,
but they don't
want to be
much in the same
way you and I
wanted to be
for so long.
I've wanted
to be a virgin
so bad.
Oh,
how I wanted
to be a virgin.
I wanted
to be a protozoid.
First of all,
I wanted
to just be
a protein
type of,
an enzyme
or something
like that,
you know?
That's a good start.
You know,
maybe agitate
the enzyme
a little,
and put some
nice
sedoxidide
in it,
and the next thing
you know,
you've got
fertilizer,
and that's how
methane is created
when people
were born.
And yeah,
right,
and the next
thing you know,
Babby is formed,
and then Babby
wants to reproduce,
and you've got
a whole life
of,
a whole planet
full of life.
And villages.
A whole planet
full of villages.
Of umbilicus
diseases?
And villages
full of umbilical
cords being
bitten by their
mothers.
I know,
I just
like thinking
and placentas
being devoured,
and that's why
it takes a whole
village to eat
a child.
A really fat
child.
I mean,
a skinny child
probably just
feed a family.
Radio for
the future
times.
No,
there won't
be any future
times.
There won't
be any radio
in the future,
and there won't
be any future.
There'll just
be people
with implants,
and their brain's
walking around
talking to themselves
and thinking that
they're talking
to other people.
And just as we
were talking about
a little bit before
about people
talking with their
thumbs,
don't you think
that's a rather
primitive-looking
Neanderthal-ish
type of way
of expressing
yourself?
Thumbs.
I mean,
they are
prehensile stuff.
Well,
not if you have
an iPhone
or something
like that.
One of those
machines,
those iPads
or whatever
that you can
use.
I don't want
to be a machine
anymore.
I don't want
to be a machine.
But I do get
the impression
they think
they're talking
to other people
or, you know,
they're sending
these little messages
and texts
and making
little videos
and selfies
and pushing
the send button,
and I think
they actually think
that it's going
to other people
and that there
are other people
and that the world
outside of that machine
is real,
sort of.
Not that they're
very interested in it.
They're more
interested in the world
inside the machine.
So what's the difference,
you ask?
So since they don't know
they're in the matrix,
why wake them up?
Why wreck it for them?
If the placebo
is working,
why did the church
of the subgenius
come along
and wreck it?
Yeah.
Yes, this is the moral,
like, this is the moral
crisis that we
all face,
especially those
of us who
have no faith.
Ha ha ha ha.
Just a little
joke there,
but for those of us
who cannot,
you know,




be seen,
so to speak,
this is the crisis
we face.
Yeah.
Wake up,
sleeple,
says each
of the robots
laying side by side
inside their
canisters,
all the copper tops
saying in unison,
a million copper tops
at once in unison
saying,
wake up,
sleeple.
Only they say
sheeple
because
sheeple
because they've been
because they're not
as funny as we are,
as we is.
That was we,
that was a we line,
wake up, sleeple.
Where was that one
all their lives?
It was still
in the design room,
you know,
where everything goes
to wait
to be
messed with
and refurbished
and reproduced
a thousand times
and decloned.
That's where it went.
Right.
It's stuck there.
You mean,
right, yeah,
it goes right into
the hour of slack.
Yeah.
Where we just keep
saying the same thing
over and over and over.
Goes into the
hyper-facet cloud.
Wake up, sleeple.
Wake up, sleeple.
Like that whole crowd
of people going,
we are abnormals.
We are abnormals.
Sad.
And the leader is,
the leader is standing
there on a screen
going,
I can't believe
I can't believe
you're still doing this.
And the people down below
go in unison,
neither can we.
What a nightmare.
And all the while
the monsters are drooling
down their necks
behind them.
They can't see them.
Not the ones dancing
in front can't see them.
No, not the maypole goddesses.
Can't see them either.
Everything is occluded.
Occluded.
Occult.
Hidden.
Occult.
Occult.
Yeah.
It is occulted
by the cult of
of secrecy.
Yeah, that's it.
Secrecy.
The cult of secrecy.
Which is the ultimate secret.
And that's what's
protected here.
And that's why
Bob Dobbs
will never say
an honest word
in his damn life.
Cannot.
Well, he always lies
and
and so forth.
I mean,
he always lies
and he's always right.
Isn't that the old
line of Bob's?
There was George
Tirebiter
never lied
and was always right.
But Bob Dobbs
always lied
and still was
always right.
Well, George Tirebiter
was running for
dog
sniffer
or dog
He was running
for Schickelgruber
at one point.
Well, yeah,
he had a lot
of different
noms to plume.
He'd been a movie actor,
you know,
a child actor
and then a has-been
and then he was
a president
and then he was
in a box.
A little dog.
Yeah.



And his wife
was running things.
Mrs. Tirebiter.
She was pretty good
in Donovan's
frame.
I'm sorry.
So what do you think
about Edward the Snowman?
Do you think he's
a traitor
or a hero?
I think he's
an occidental
platooner.
I think he's a
I think he's
a crypto
Pomeranian,
you say.
He suffocates
the innocence
out of us
small child
out of us
innocent youthful
people.
No, I think
he's a good man
because everybody
has to know
about how screwed
up everything is
to the point of
wanting to jump
out the window.
Well, now see,
I think he took
matters into
his own hands
in a perhaps
unwise
and untoward
fashion.
But then
I'm not there
and I don't
I'm not sure
that I know
everything.
Well, it's a
corporate world
and he's a
corporate spy.
I don't know
how much patriotism
or nationalism
or any of that stuff
or national interest
really figure into it
in the twisted
convoluted
areas up there
where big decisions
are made.
Right.
Everybody's a spy
on some level anyway
and that's what
governments are.
They're spies
on each other.
I mean, that's the job
of a government
of government
is to take over
other government
is to be bigger
or more powerful
than other governments.
Right.
I mean, it doesn't
have anything to do
with the people
that are being governed.
It has more to do
with the other governments.
You mean the accrual
of power?
That's just the impression
I got.
Well, you and
Lenny Reifenshaw
got a lot in common.
You watch those
propaganda films
and
Watch them?
Hell, we make them.
Yep.
Damn proud of it, too.
We don't write the news.
We don't know
how we make it.
I even make my own
homemade mayonnaise sometimes.
Wait a minute.
What are we talking about?
You're the one who works
as a reporter
for a great metropolitan newspaper,
not me.
Well, I'm a fanzine editor.
I'm a hack and a slouch,
so it doesn't matter.
And I'm also
a full-grown woman by...
I'm just so tired...
No, I thought you were
a cub reporter.
A cub rape porter.
I'm having my own...
Cub rape reporter.
Ha, ha, ha.
That's an inside joke.
I accept genius jokes
because subgeniuses
are part of rape culture.
Ha, ha, ha.
I better not even go there, man.
I'm better...
Forget I said that.
Erase that whole last part.
Okay, thanks.
I'll say hello.
I'll see you over there.
No, I thought you were
mentioning the fact
that you saw my picture
in the paper
because it's my
Kenian dose.
My 15th birthday
is my kind of like
coming out
and my TPR Zoom
and my...
And a couple
of the other family members
are going to give me presents.
No, I didn't see that.

because I don't get
the Pomeranian papers.
Well, I didn't see it either.
We don't even get
the Cleveland papers.
I was wearing
a plunging gown
and a big
bouffant...
bouff...
bouff...
haircut
and lots and lots
of shaggy jewelry
and I looked pretty good
for my ages.
Okay, okay.
Granted.
I believe that.
I do believe that.
I very much believe that.
Now that we're all
sweating along together,
let's see if we can
raise the spirits
of the evil ones.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was going to say,
didn't we do that last week?
Oh, no.
No, we try to do it
every week and fail
miserably.
Then why don't we try
raising some mayonnaise?
Some what?
Mayonnaise.
Didn't Mr. White
teach us in chemistry class
last night
how to make mayonnaise?
Yes.
Dave sometimes
makes his own mayonnaise
using the emulsifier
of the egg
along with the vinegar
and the oil
that cannot ever merge
without the emulsifier.
Mr. White knows everything
but he talks so fast.
That's the way to do it.
If you're going to make
real potato salad,
why mess around?
I mean, I know
going to the store
is easy.
Why not really do it
the way they had to do it
when you had to go
all the way to Baltimore
for 10 weeks
to get the very end stuff?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What if you got against
Baltimore?
You want to be a
elliptical thinker?
Go ahead and see
if it works for you.
Die in a gutter somewhere
bleeding and smelling bad?
Yeah.
I said that was
some degree of conviction.
I mean, a little bit.
A little bit?
I guess.
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry, Dave.
I was distracted.
I was looking at the machines
instead of you
because it's getting
near the end
and I thought I'd push
some background music.
I pushed the wrong one
but that's okay.
I don't care.
But there's no wrong
and right in this show.
There's no rhyme or reason.
Thank goodness.
That is the one saving grace
of the hour of slack
from the church
of the subgenius.
There is no wrong
and no right
and no left.
And in Bob's left brain,
nothing is right
and in his right brain,
there is nothing left.
And there's definitely
nothing wrong.
In the words of Onan.
No, that was Mr. Wong
who was an enemy
of Mr. White,
our chemistry teacher.
Mr. Wong,
the English teacher,
really didn't like
that hard science stuff
and the math and science guys
all looked down
on the,
you know,
the math and science guys

and the fuzzy subjects
like English and history.
Those were the ones
I was good at.
The ones you could lie in.
You could roll around in them.
You could make your English class
and lie in it
and roll around in it
like a dog in a dead thing
and still come out with an A
if you could lie slickly enough.
I should have been a lawyer
like my dad wanted me to.
Oh, somebody just called
the show and said,
oh, yeah, there are slags.
He's like Howard Stern
for eunuchs.
I didn't think it was funny,
but I laughed.
Where did you hear that?
That's pretty good.
Howard Stern for eunuchs?
Yeah.
You know, that's ironic
because I consider
the Howard Stern fans
to be eunuchs
who have let Stern
wear their testicles for them.
I thought you meant
the operating system.
Oh, no.
Dave would,
no, this is Dave talking.
He would be using classical.
I'm not confusing both of them
as I should be.
The operating system
is the area down there,
at least as far as
many arguments are concerned.
That's true.
I guess so.
I guess so.
Well, it's coming to show
end time.
I think all that,
that clock over there is wrong.
That clock that the listener
is looking at, that's wrong.
Is it wrong or Wong?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I haven't given the addresses
of the Church of the Subgenius
likely, and I should do that.
Bob can be reached by mail
at post office box
181417
Cleveland Heights, Ohio
44118.
And by the way,
obviously Bob himself
probably won't be going
to that post office box
and opening that mail.
My personal sense...
Well, Secretary might do that.
And if she decides
it's worth passing on to me
and I pass out,
Bob may find it on the floor
next to my desk.
And that's the way
it's done around here.
Most people do it by internet,
which is subgenius.com.
And if you don't know
how to spell subgenius,
just Google it, okay?
It will say,
do you mean subgenius?
Because it,
unlike us and you,
Google is not a subgenius.
Nor is it an artificial intelligence
or world brain,
as the ignoramuses like to think.
Yep, they think it's a drop
of water in the great
cyber ocean.
They do.
Yeah.
So anyway, friends,
praise Bob.
That's what this is all about.
And by Bob,
we mean J.R. Bob Dobbs,
the saint of sales,
from Dallas, Texas,
or somewhere in the Midwest,
like that.
The jack-o'-lantern,
the jack-o'-lady,
and the squidly man.
Oh, our music in the background earlier
was from the Rudy,
the Rusty Schwartz program,
winter sperm harvest
of the hot koalas
or something like that.
And also,
we heard a little bit
of the Psychoskeleton's
latest instrumental,
but I'll play that in full next time.
She couldn't really hear it
in the background.
And some guy that sounds
kind of like Jimi Hendrix,
but it couldn't really be him
because these weren't released
by Warner Brothers or anyone
or Reprise or anything.
So anyway,
I'm going to cut to
the Rudy Schwartz project for real,
doing a song called
Quiet Evenings with Gimpy.
Thanks for calling in, Gimpy.
Thanks.
I'm glad to have contributed
to the wonderful release
for this last few weeks.
We're gonna give it a take there









the dying moment
