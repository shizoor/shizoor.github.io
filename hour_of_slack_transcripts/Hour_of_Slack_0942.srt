1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,960
Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,020
Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,720
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,800
It's a form of sacrilege.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,640
It's a form of disconsecration of the vowel sounds made by your very existence

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,860
as you twizzle and twazzle DNA,

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,680
as you weasel and wazzle your slimy way,

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,560
up and down and out of life.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,540
Hong Kong, the hub of the Orient.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,040
And now it is time for us to conclude our visit

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,560
and reluctantly say,

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,500
Hong Kong, the hub of the Orient.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,680
Thank you for joining us tonight.

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,200
Now, I just heard in the report that

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,980
the subgenius powerhouse

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,720
That is correct.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,220
to engage in this attack.

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,340
That's correct.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,400
We have a number of individuals that have had girls from 15 to 25.

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,420
Jeez.

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,640
Why, what, why, what, why?

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,120
I have a list of about 20 of them.

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,180
They're like 14, 15, 16.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,500
Any photos?

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,340
That's correct.

27
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,920
You've changed since you've come to Hollywood.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,120
I started to work.

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,460
I'm a little bit more experienced.

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:33,460


31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm a little bit more experienced.

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:33,640
I'm a little bit more experienced.

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:33,640


34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:33,640


35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,100
And I don't mind telling you,

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,840
it's no change for the better.

37
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,540
What?

38
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,280
You're wearing a mask.

39
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,040
I'll explain the mask later, Mr. Jackson.

40
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,100
Now.

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,220
It's fun time.

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,620
I just can't understand it.

43
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,200
Oh, yeah?

44
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,840
Maybe it's just because you're stupid.

45
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,420
Well, yes, Wally.

46
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,060
Sure.

47
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,100
Punch yourself in the nose.

48
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,540
No.

49
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,340
Now do you see why I was amused?

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,980
Maybe it's just because you're stupid.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,400
Really?

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,680
Oh, of course.

53
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,260
Right.

54
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,600
Yeah, you're right.

55
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,400
There was another normal night

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
And I got done fighting with my wife

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,360
So I went down to the bar

58
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,480
And just conveyed all the androids

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,980
Since I was elitist

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,940
They've been the two best friends that a man could ever hope for in this world

61
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,600
Now I'm a normal guy and I work all day for my money

62
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,260
And I fear the good Lord like I know I should

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,980
I ain't no new age coot but I gotta get this off my chest

64
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,660
And put this tragedy behind me now for good

65
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,360
I remember getting drunk and I remember falling down

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,120
And someone laid me on a pool table and I'd have been too soon

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,900
Then through the blinding lights two creatures stared into my eyes

68
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,400
As if a jukebox or a flying saucer spread around the room

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,780
And I'd tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race

70
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,100
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space

71
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,880
Well it hit me like trouble in the back of my head

72
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,560
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

73
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,060
And when I woke up Lord I wished that I was dead

74
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,580
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

75
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,100
And I'd tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race

76
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:42,120
And I'd tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,700
This must have been an abduction, Lord, cause I don't know what happened

78
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,280
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue

79
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,760
Now I think I'm really crazy but I know that it wasn't them

80
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,460
Say the things that they can't do and never do

81
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,700
Well when at last I woke both my legs they had been broke

82
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,420
Both my eyes were black and my ears were springing bad

83
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,180
I'd seen enough of nasty things but this was the worst case

84
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,060
Of intergalactic relations I've ever had

85
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,080
And I'd tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race

86
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,440
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space

87
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,100
Cause it hit me like trouble in the back of my head

88
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,940
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

89
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,560
And when I woke up Lord I wished that I was dead

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,160
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

91
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,900
This must have been an abduction, Lord, cause I don't know what happened

92
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,620
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue

93
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,020
Now I think I'm really crazy but I know that it wasn't them

94
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,140
Say the things that they can't do and never do

95
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,920
Never do

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,440
Never do

97
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,520
Never do

98
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,620
Never do

99
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,080
Never do

100
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


101
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


102
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


103
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


105
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


106
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


107
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


110
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:28,100


111
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,280
Never lie

112
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,900
Never look at me try you're not managed

113
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,140
Gnaw on SecretSearch they say

114
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,500
Never forget

115
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:57,700
The smell of gin

116
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,360
lizard skin.

117
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,560
I mean, a lot of people talk about the

118
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,000
lizard people.

119
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,860
That's a conspiracy

120
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,920
theory that

121
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,160
a lot of people are

122
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,020
real excited about. It's kind of old hat

123
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,260
for subgenius, diehard

124
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,020
old conspiracy theorists.

125
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,200
Those guys wear old hats. That's part of the whole conspiracy

126
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,820
of it. The DNA thing is

127
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,900
in front of it. Is that what the old hat thing is about?

128
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,480
Yeah.

129
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,300
Oh, man.

130
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,360
Spooky.

131
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,880
Spooky. Yeah.

132
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,560
Call something old hat, that means the DNA goes right

133
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,920
in your brain and changes you.

134
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,440
I think

135
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,420
that's what it means. Change.

136
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,280
Spare change, my friend.

137
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Can you change your

138
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,660
ways? Can you quit telling

139
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,760
yourself you're awake

140
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,720
and enlightened long enough to

141
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,840
realize you're still asleep?

142
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,700
See, I'm the automatic robot that

143
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,700
goes around telling the other automatic robots

144
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,720
to wake up.

145
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,440
That's just what I do automatically.

146
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,280
You show them the pictures, don't you,

147
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,180
Stang? Yeah.

148
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,920
The pictures of the kneeling bodies, the scarce and

149
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,140
astounding naked bodies, of the

150
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,440
people with, oh yes, the old lady

151
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
that was brought in a late night drag

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,340
net, whose face was rubber hosed with a

153
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,620
with... More precisely,

154
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,380
I sell them the pictures.

155
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Yes, you

156
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,240
sell them the pictures on the corner side.

157
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,300
Underneath the street lamp.

158
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,300
I have a pair of these pictures.

159
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,100
A pair of stiletto heels and fish head

160
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,220
stockings on your head.

161
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
I got an interesting letter from

162
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
a listener,

163
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,900
Reverend Fenian, who had just

164
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,920
started listening to the Hour of Slack fairly

165
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,520
recently.

166
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,880
About a year ago, actually. About a year ago, he started

167
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,800
listening to it on the internet. And what

168
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
attracted him about it was the

169
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,480
Oye guy.

170
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,480
He first started

171
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,160
tuning in about a year ago when we

172
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,720
were getting calls from the Oye

173
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,780
guy. You know what that is?

174
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,740
The sound of a poodle being sodomized.

175
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,980
Well, that was the thing. We later

176
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,240
found out from other DJs at the

177
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,160
station that indeed the Oye

178
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,780
guy was known

179
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,160
as famous as Masturbating

180
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,260
Sean was the name that he's known

181
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,160
by at the station and that

182
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,320
Princess, we and I were right.

183
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,080
It is a mantra.

184
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,120
Well, he brought great

185
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,460
disgrace on his name.

186
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,420
Well, it depends on how you look at it. It's a life-saving

187
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,140
mantra. His name should be shame.

188
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,320
Well, now

189
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,200
in some denominations, he gets

190
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,260
a special award pinned to his chest.

191
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,380
Well, sometimes it's in the form of

192
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,580
one of those

193
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,280
IEDs, really. Improvised

194
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,420
Exploding Devices. Friends, are you

195
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,300
wondering what the hell this is all about?

196
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,500
Are you wondering? Well, give up.

197
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,700
Stop! Stop it!

198
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,620
The subgenius

199
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,240
is probably the single

200
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,440
most important organization in the 20th

201
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,160
century. Our function is

202
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,440
quite literally to save the world.

203
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,400
At least make the end of the world

204
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,060
happen right.

205
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:04,900
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

206
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,340
Oh, yeah!

207
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,800
Your father lets you find Bob,

208
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,780
and you better find Bob right now!

209
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,440
The people really need

210
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,560
to be able to understand

211
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,600
things very quickly, and the church

212
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,920
of the subgenius, I think,

213
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,620
confuses him.

214
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,820
Confusing, isn't it?

215
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,820
I want to remind you of the great words of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

216
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,980
I don't practice what I preach

217
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,420
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

218
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,620
Thank you, children, thank you.

219
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,800
Is there a typical subgenius?

220
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,000
Of course not.

221
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,240
The very thought is a blasphemy.

222
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,780
The only thing that most subgeniuses have in common

223
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,300
is that they're all different,

224
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,200
and they have nothing in common

225
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,980
with the conspiracy of the normals.

226
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,020
By definition, the Church of the Subgenius

227
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,060
can't really exist

228
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,500
because it's an organization for people

229
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,220
who are not joiners.

230
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,700
Eccentrics, unpredictables, true visionaries.

231
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,780
Let us observe a few examples

232
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,320
using the hidden camera.

233
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,940
It was in the first 30 issues of 9-inch worm comics

234
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,840
and I think in 14 issues of 4 1⁄2-inch worm comics.

235
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,160
Is this man a subgenius?

236
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,880
15 7-Eleven comics.

237
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,820
Those aren't the comics about 7-Eleven.

238
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,960
It's the adventures of a subgenius.

239
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,420
They have a person that works at 7-Eleven

240
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,240
that just writes down everything that happens.

241
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,040
They draw him up,

242
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,080
and the whole comic is shaped like a big 7-Eleven.

243
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,920
It's three-dimensional.

244
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,160
And they've got the idea from a flying saucer

245
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,700
that was shaped like a 7-Eleven

246
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,340
that flew over one night.

247
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,580
It was a UFO believed to be...

248
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,020
A subgenius, obviously.

249
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,480
The speech patterns are unmistakable.

250
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,180
They share only the quest for slack

251
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,460
and the love of their beloved spiritual teacher,

252
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,840
the living avatar of slack, J.R. Bob Dogg.

253
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,720
I was getting messages in the back of my brain

254
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,080
as long ago as about twelve or thirteen months,

255
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,720
and I just kept hearing the word, Bob.

256
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,000
Bob, Bob.

257
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,000
Bob is everywhere.

258
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,100
Bob is bursting out all over the place.

259
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,860
Bob!

260
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,080
If you look through any phone book in any city, you get the same thing.

261
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,720
Bob's Construction Company.

262
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,440
Bob's Pornhouse.

263
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,960
Bob's Factory.

264
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,540
Bob's Auto Parts.

265
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,860
Bob's Automotive Service.

266
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,260
Bob's Learning Locals.

267
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,780
Bob's Dentistry.

268
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,160
And then down here we've got Bob's Used Furniture Store.

269
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,240
I mean, he's like everybody's dad should be.

270
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,800
Bob's is about as American as you can get.

271
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,800
Bob's TV.

272
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,180
Bob's Online.

273
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:46,960
Bob's Online.

274
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,340
Bob's Online.

275
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,400


276
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,100
Bob's Online.

277
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,900
Bob's Online.

278
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,380
Bob's Online.

279
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,740
Bob's Online.

280
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,480
There's no laughing matter.

281
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,500
And a plane is determined to take us with it.

282
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,880
Even if it means force.

283
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,680
I'll handle this.

284
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,420
Hey, wait a minute, you guys.

285
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,180
Put your guns away.

286
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,240
You know, Wally, that's just what I'm going to do.

287
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:07,780
Hello.

288
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,160
Hello.

289
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,620
We're glad you called us about masturbation.

290
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,840
You'll probably hear a lot of dumb and scary things about masturbation from your family doctor.

291
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,660
Masturbation is touching and handling your school nurse in a way that creates pleasurable sexual feelings.

292
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,700
For most people, masturbating is physically harmful.

293
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,080
Now, we like masturbation.

294
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,520
But if you masturbate, it can be psychologically harmful.

295
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,240
It could mess up your head.

296
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,960
In fact, masturbation makes you go crazy or blind.

297
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,040
If this happens, it may indicate a serious problem.

298
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,920
The problem, however, is lack of masturbation.

299
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,580
Spin punishing shots and it's over.

300
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,440
Woo!

301
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,080
Ow!

302
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,320
Ow!

303
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,560
A wet, wet kiss, baby.

304
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:51,640
Oh, my God.

305
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:51,640


306
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:51,640


307
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:51,940
Man!

308
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,520
Well, young, old!

309
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,060
Splashing our way on in!

310
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,660
Yep.

311
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,140
In towards X-Day.

312
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,240
It has all been encapsulated and brought into one mighty compaction unit.

313
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,680
It is ready for the force field to be enacted.

314
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,140
It is ready for decompartmentalization and transport across the universe.

315
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,940
Sorry.

316
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,080
That's what they're doing with those people in Iraq, right?

317
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,880
Those prisoners of war?

318
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,180
Yeah.

319
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:21,620


320
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:21,620


321
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:21,620


322
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,580
Well, I think it's a new, like, club or something like that.

323
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,420
And have you noticed everybody's giving the thumbs up sign?

324
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,960
It's an S&M type, an S&M club.

325
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,180
Yeah, and everybody gives, like, the kind of wink and the thumbs up sign, like, hey, man, I humiliated some person.

326
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:40,040
I've noticed that according to the media, the only torturers and abusers are really hot-looking girls.

327
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,120
Young, attractive, especially red-headed girls.

328
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:53,140
Well, the one girl that they showed who was giving the thumbs up, I suppose her excretory function was not correct.

329
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,620
Or else she wouldn't have always wanted to do the old proctology boogie with all those people.

330
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,380
I think that, you know, they're just following orders.

331
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:09,420
And they're being given orders by people who want those soldiers to be able to do it to them when they get back to D.C.

332
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,640
Until they use their safe word.

333
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,540
Or say maybe if the Fedayeen get them.

334
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,100
And so they want to know that they're going to get them.

335
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,880
The same kind of friendly treatment.

336
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,640
Say, for instance, it might have a slight Muslim or Arabic slant to it.

337
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,980
Like maybe, you know, there might be little cuts and so forth.

338
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:33,200
But it'll still be the same hot action you get everywhere across the world with the new G.W. Bush world engram under which we're stamped.

339
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,060
Say hi, baby!

340
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,120
I can't.

341
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,980
I can't.

342
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,780
Now, Dave, let's not be extremists and go to prison.

343
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's not be extreme unctionists.

344
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,540
Because we're all headed towards the same purple necktie, baby.

345
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,420
You know what I'm saying?

346
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,920
It's like you're in jail.

347
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,180
Whether you're, even if you're out on the street, you're still in jail.

348
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,280
You're such a man, you still gotcha.

349
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,960
As long as you're wearing a wristwatch, you're in prison.

350
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,640
It's a slave planet.

351
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,200
The world as you know it is nothing but a cell block.

352
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,140
And you're on the violent world.

353
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,140
You wonder what you're eating.

354
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,980
Do you think it is pork and beans?

355
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

356
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,620
Yes, there's pork and beans in it, all right, my friend.

357
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,800
But it is mostly a substance of your own brain matter.

358
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,700
Yeah, it's organ slush.

359
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,160
The tiny piece of metabolic fluids.

360
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,860
The apocytic fluids.

361
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:31,900
Yeah.

362
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,720
Oh, excuse me.

363
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
We have recreated you.

364
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,360
Never mind.

365
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,980
Dave, do your neighbors consider you to be different, outstrained?

366
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,900
Do they give you funny?

367
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,260
Funny looks.

368
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,700
Well, they are incapable of giving looks, my friend.

369
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,640
With the eyes ripped out of their sockets and only the little oblong pills exposed,

370
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,220
what can they really see?

371
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,720
Not the oblong pins.

372
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,880
Little tiny things for their own gratification.

373
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,100
They push back the balls away in their head.

374
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,600
You take the red pill and you stay asleep.

375
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,240
Take the blue pill and you'll run around telling everybody that you're more awake than the next guy.

376
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,420


377
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,500
What?

378
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,620
Which?

379
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,980
Which one did you take?

380
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,860
I took the round pill.

381
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,140
I took the square.

382
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,620
Well, it's kind of octagonal.

383
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,420
Uh-huh.

384
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:21,640
Yeah.

385
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,220
But it didn't matter.

386
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,340
I heard about people that took the oblong pill.

387
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,700
And either one is red or blue.

388
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,440
Not a good story.

389
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,840
It looks like there's a force field around each and every one of them.

390
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,940
They made me take the pill that makes you tell everybody about pills.

391
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:43,380
They made me take the pill that causes you to go on and on and on about how you're more awake.

392
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,680
Than somebody else if you take this other pill.

393
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:52,060
But that's really just because you took the pill that makes you say that you're awake and alert and noticing the real world.

394
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,260
And, you know, it's like...

395
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,000
It's the same thing over and over and over again.

396
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,220
One layer of the onion peeled away and it's still a damn onion.

397
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,520
There's nothing to do but fry it in the pan and hope you get a whooping in your titty-totty can.

398
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,980
Sit down, little man.

399
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,180
We have a message here.

400
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,220
It's encrypted.

401
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,520
But you may be able to make out some of it.

402
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,380
You're slated for some sort of...

403
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,240
What do we call it?

404
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,960
That's the...

405
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
No, that's the more erotic, neo-neurotic way.

406
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:24,940
Torture?

407
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:25,920
Torture.

408
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,040
Or as John Stewart...

409
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,720
I heard John Stewart called it freedom tickling.

410
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,160
One room at a time, buddy.

411
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,040
Freedom tickling?

412
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,400
Yeah.

413
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,880
Well, speaking of normals and everybody we hate, here's a song from the old Bonzo Dog Band about your neighbors.

414
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,280
Mm-hmm.

415
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,260
Ha, ha.

416
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,980
Yo, what do you call me?

417
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,000
A cross of sense.

418
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,520
A common sense.

419
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,920
My God, a mouth of blood.

420
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,880
Will win a prize.

421
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,740
Won't that be nice?

422
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,440
And by the way, how's your wife?

423
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,080
Your holidays were spent in space.

424
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,800
You went by train.

425
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,560
You'll go again.

426
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,780
Have you seen me bullfight poster on the wall?

427
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,480
Do you know?

428
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,600
Do you know?

429
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,160
the happy memory it recalls.

430
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,560
Here's a photograph of me and my son Ted.

431
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,800
That's me cousin with his achy on his head.

432
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,760
We booked in at our hotel

433
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,700
just after two and met a family

434
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,140
from Bradford that we knew.

435
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,120
What a melody!

436
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:30,820
Yeah!

437
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,660
Mama belongs to me!

438
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,360
Todd has made saxophones solo as promised.

439
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,040
Wiping half of the terrain pipe

440
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,580
Semi-detached ship

441
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:13,740
Tedder

442
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,960
Wiping half of the terrain pipe

443
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,260
Oh Mama

444
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,700
belongs to one!

445
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,860
I've a sister in Toronto who's a nurse

446
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,220
and I've had a bit of bother laying turf.

447
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,280
It's life, not books that taught me all I've learnt.

448
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,760
Burp in the above and my rice pudding's getting burnt.

449
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,000
Here, have you seen the new attachment on me drill?

450
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,380
I must have a cat put down cos he's ill.

451
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:43,580
Oh!

452
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,240
Hey, neighbour!

453
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,500
Wiping half of the terrain pipe

454
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,080
Wiping half of the terrain pipe

455
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,600
I may change his cool.

456
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,280
Wiping half of the terrain pipe

457
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,860
I may change his cool.

458
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:58,860


459
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,400
It's missing from you.

460
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,480


461
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,400
I'm a lovely jelly, you're a paint revange.

462
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,680
I'm a cheery trifle, you're a chocolate sponge.

463
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,080
You're a glass of paper, mine are freaks balloons.

464
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:11,840
Whoops!

465
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,580
Here comes the sponge.

466
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:13,580


467
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,780
Wiping half of the terrain pipe

468
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,080
Separates me from the incredibly fascinating story of your life.

469
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,780
And every day today you vent in all its minute and tedious attention to detail.

470
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,980
And was it a Thursday or a Wednesday or...

471
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,740
Oh no, it wasn't so. Who cares anyway?

472
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,020
Cos I do not sew normal.

473
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,680
If you're normal, I intend to be a freak for the rest of my life.

474
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,100
And I shall baffle you with cabbages and rhinoceroses in the kitchen

475
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,100
in sets and quotations from now we are six through the mouthpiece of Lord Snoop.

476
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,040
And c*** isn't electric.

477
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,740
F***in'ished.

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,640
SOLDӖ poles

479
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,220
according to this

480
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,220


481
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,220


482
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,260
fin

483
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,760
My poverty but not my will consent.

484
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,540
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

485
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,300
Put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off.

486
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,800
And if you had the strength of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

487
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,900
Here is thy gold.

488
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,420
Worst poison to men's souls.

489
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,620
Doing more murder in this loathsome world than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.

490
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,060
What is the taste of crunchy clusters?

491
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,420
Perfect forever.

492
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,480
And it got in the spokes of the wheel and it choked her to death.

493
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,820
Uh, uh, well I'll...

494
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,120
No, no, no.

495
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,180
It's the Senate vote.

496
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,180
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

497
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,980
Back to the very beginning of the first part.

498
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:24,520
Underneath annoyances starting with a petty, bastardly, tiny, minuscule, overbearing, all-encompassing...

499
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:24,640
No!

500
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,380
You can remove the sinus here.

501
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,740
Just pull that very, very gently.

502
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,720
Just take out my left sinus passage here.

503
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,580
Get the whole thing right out.

504
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,780
Ready to have the third nostril put right in.

505
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,220
You kids quit playing with your little third nostril toys there.

506
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,700
Are you kids?

507
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,040
Third nostril opener toys.

508
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,800
Yeah, get away from this little machine.

509
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,920
And put the hands off the third nostril straffinator.

510
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,400
All you peep-ups, get off of the lawn.

511
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:08,160
Bonzo Dog Band did my pink half, my pink half of the drainpipe.

512
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,100
Separates me from the tedious, endless email from bobbies and numbskulls,

513
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,660
idiots and well-wishers, do-gooders and nimrods.

514
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,680
Mad well, that's what you're famous, my brother.

515
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,100
Now do well, those who have nothing not more in mind than to do you ill, yes?

516
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,380
The destruction of the Reverend Ivan Stank.

517
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,540
I have seen their writs.

518
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,920
I have seen their manifesto.

519
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,660
Hey, speaking of weirdos and stuff.

520
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,560
I've seen their...

521
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,040
Hey, hey, hey.

522
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,420
We've got a show coming up.

523
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,160
We can't...

524
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:52,080
I wouldn't exactly recommend this to anybody, but there is a subgenius devival.

525
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,220
They should be made aware.

526
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,020
They should be made somewhere.

527
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,080
On May 22nd, Saturday night at the Beachland Ballroom.

528
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,080
It's a touch of the old sarcophagus.

529
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,460
You know, it makes you feel like you've gone and gone on,

530
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,800
and you can't get back out in here.

531
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,060
Well, the girls are going to be there.

532
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,420
Reverend Nikki Deathchick will be...

533
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,140
Snaking?

534
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:22,680
And her nun snakes will be applying the bondage spankings of guilt relief or guilt or something.

535
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,720
I always get...

536
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,560
I will be applying my own special brand of nasal pressure to the third nostril cruise.

537
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm sorry.

538
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm sorry.

539
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,180
I'm sorry.

540
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,140
And those beautiful girls in the amino acids, they're a masked surf music band,

541
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,520
surf punk instrumental masked alien band who are actually beautiful girls underneath those masks.

542
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,240
You wouldn't think...

543
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,320
Or beautiful goats, depending on which transvibrational level you come from.

544
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,980
They never take the masks off, and they look like men.

545
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,840
Or something like men.

546
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,140
Yeah, but they are goats.

547
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,260
Beyond human semblance.

548
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,700
I've seen their molecules evaporate.

549
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,160
Beyond mere humans.

550
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,480
I've seen the petri dish with the goat horn and the piece of magic eye.

551
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,840
I know what...

552
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,080
Oh, here they are playing in the background.

553
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,240
Oh, Lord.

554
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,580
I can hear them.

555
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,220
Oh, Lord.

556
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,280
Well, that's not the amino acids, but it's close enough.

557
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,600
I think it's Robert Johnson about to sing.

558
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,680
Can you call me Bucka?

559
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,720
Bucka.

560
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,040
That's a bad dream.

561
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,960
Bucka.

562
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:22,960


563
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,600
The amino acid.

564
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,820
This is the Pobucker theme.

565
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,020
This is the Pobucker theme?

566
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,900
I didn't know they had theme music.

567
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,420
Just a Pobucker.

568
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,700
I'm just an old Pobucker to you.

569
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,340
They call me Bucka.

570
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,020
Silence is a bug.

571
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,280
Just a Pobucker.

572
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,000
Be quiet now.

573
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,960
Put your hand on the thermometer.

574
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Oh, and that other...

575
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,820
That Pobucker named Man Incorporated.

576
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,800
The one man band will also...

577
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,880
And that actually is a pretty...

578
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,620
The impressive one fellow.

579
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,660
How about the dopamine tyrants?

580
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,420
The beaters of serotonin, which will come in a flood.

581
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,640
Oh, the Minoan brain eaters.

582
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,860
Yeah, they'll probably be there.

583
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,440
They'll flood into your brains.

584
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,360
And Reverend Carter LeBlanc, who is the good subgenius preacher,

585
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,160
as opposed to the rest of us.

586
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:10,940
And...

587
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,720
Man.

588
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,180
And the movie show.

589
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,840
Oh, and the movie show.

590
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,640
Yeah, the movie show.

591
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,860
And the nostril...

592
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,040
The nostril, third nostril openings.

593
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,660
The mind-melting movie show.

594
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,340
Yeah.

595
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,860
The people in their shells and their concomitant gestures.

596
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,600
Believe it or not, Scene Magazine called me up about that.

597
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,080
About the gestures?

598
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,900
And quizzed me about this.

599
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,180
Yeah, gestures.

600
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,800
What just...

601
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,820
What this lonesome cowboy Dave brain cell was going to do...

602
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,220
Oh.

603
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,740
In this big circus.

604
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,420
Oh, boy.

605
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Whether he was going to be jumping through hoops or throwing himself into Bob's pipe or...

606
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,020
Oh, boy.

607
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,540
Any, you know...

608
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,480
I told her that we were basically going to nail you up on a cross and tote you around.

609
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:52,860
Oh, boy.

610
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,040
Oh, boy.

611
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,620
Do a takeoff on that famous religion.

612
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,220
I am from the Carolingian Brotherhood.

613
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:07,400
I am a member of the Zool Organization and I do not believe in your bastard Nazarene, pale Nazarene Jesus.

614
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,640
Oh, I do sometimes.

615
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,280
You know when it serves...

616
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,320
That's the scary part.

617
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,260
When it serves my purple, if you know what I'm saying.

618
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,780
Is that where we bring offerings of whipped cream, bowls of whipped cream down to your toes?

619
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,200
Little cherries, too.

620
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,620
Yeah.

621
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,560
That's what I thought.

622
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:23,920
Yeah.

623
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,940
Listen, little pink, little normal worm.

624
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,580
You didn't hire me last time I blessed you with a resume.

625
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,720
Now I'm back to buy your company and close it down.

626
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,800
Demolish it.

627
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,600
Pave over the ruins and forbid anyone to approach the site for 10,000 years.

628
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,640
Puzzle of Rail Change.

629
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,060
We're happy to take your call.

630
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,820
Please leave a message at the sound of the beep.

631
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:58,460
J.R. Bob's Arms Realty will not be in the office for the next 45 to 72 days.

632
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,760
If you would like to leave an email, please inquire at...

633
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,360
Look at all the bodies we've got today.

634
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:21,320
Thousands and thousands of people we can make bare naked and have them jump on a stick.

635
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,840
Oh, my God.

636
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,060
Oh, boy.

637
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,520
It's...

638
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,820
I can't believe we have so much meat to work with here.

639
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,180
I bring that old lady on over here.

640
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,580
I want to...

641
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,360
I want to teach her something about the cattle prod she never learned before.

642
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,180
She never heard.

643
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,740
I don't know.

644
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,660
It's, uh, you know, it's still just an unknown.

645
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,580
Subgeniuses.

646
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,520
Must be chameleons ready to don at a moment's notice the disguise of the normal.

647
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,320
They will endure the polyester of the pink if that's what is required in order to earn their daily bread

648
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,100
and grab a little slack for whatever awful things they do at night.

649
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,780
If Dr. Jekyll is not allowed to surface on some rare occasions,

650
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,860
Mr. Hyde will be captured.

651
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,460
Ha, ha, ha.

652
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

653
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,380
Okay, here's what you want.

654
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,400
If you want to increase your value on your property,

655
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,660
if you want to increase the value of your holdings or stock holdings,

656
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,660
if you'd like to increase anything at all, perhaps your IQ,

657
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,820
if you'd like to increase the actual size of your brain,

658
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,480
you know, a lot of times the brain will start weapon down,

659
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,340
you know, much, pretty much like one of those ancient birds.

660
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,140
You know, it's got the same kind of profile.

661
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,100
It just, uh...

662
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,280
But if you can, uh, say, for instance, get your hand on the right kind of material,

663
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,820
like a quartz crystal or something like that,

664
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,460
uh, just...

665
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,500
Oh, yeah, it works just like a baby dog.

666
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,540
Yeah, it's a charm.

667
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,240
And I mean...

668
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,460
Some subgeniuses never for an instant cease to project a contrived hate

669
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,400
indiscriminately despising everything normal.

670
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,280
But that's just another way of ignoring the vagaries of life

671
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,580
in favor of some escapist formula, some rule book.

672
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,980
It only proves they are normals because they haven't caught on yet

673
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,680
that by definition, half of what they call normal

674
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,440
is actually stranger than normal.

675
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,900
And them, they just don't get its strangeness

676
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,640
because they can't tell the difference

677
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,380
between bulldonner, stupid, and camp.

678
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,060
And here in our camp is lonesome cowboy Dave.

679
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,540
I am not in your camp,

680
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,520
nor have I ever been a member of your...

681
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,360
You can't hide from normality!

682
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,580
You cannot hide from the all-seeing eye that peers everywhere.

683
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm a puppy!

684
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,900
Campers around here, but no...

685
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,940
It's in the lavatories.

686
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,660
It's in the basement.

687
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,940
It's in the foot lockers.

688
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,240
It's over in the closet space there.

689
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,140
It's in the broom closet.

690
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,380
It's where they put the cats and hoes.

691
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,020
It's over where they have...

692
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,000
War, friends.

693
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
War, war, war.

694
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,500
Huh!

695
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,520
What is it good for?

696
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,960
What's the use of dying if we're already going to live anyway?

697
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:19,800
What the...

698
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,600
Yes, sir.

699
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,320
The books are just like...

700
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,680
Go ahead.

701
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,800
Do you ever...

702
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:36,900
Uh...

703
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,620
No.

704
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,560
I did.

705
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:38,840
But...

706
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,080
Middle...

707
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,060
Which is...

708
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,620
Always...

709
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,000
An...

710
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,760
Piece of...

711
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:41,960
Maybe...

712
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,700
That he might say...

713
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,240
What is...

714
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,700
Bring...

715
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,240
On...

716
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,780
The...

717
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,320
Map...

718
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:47,900
No.

719
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,160
Poo-poo.

720
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,760
Of it.

721
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:50,900
It's...

722
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:50,940
It's...

723
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:50,940


724
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:50,960
It's...

725
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


726
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


727
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


728
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


729
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


730
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


731
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


732
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


733
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


734
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


735
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,260
It's...

736
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:51,680
It's...

737
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:51,720
It's...

738
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:51,720


739
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,580
All over me, man.

740
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,120
Might as well.

741
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,520
Never on it all.

742
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,400
Did you ever think this guy was a great blue blueberry pie?

743
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,300
Yeah.

744
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,240
It makes me hungry when I think about that.

745
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,240
Did you ever think...

746
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,460
Did you ever think this guy was a great big blueberry pie?

747
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,520
Yeah, and I wanted to stick it in my thumb and pull out a plum.

748
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,340
Well, you're right.

749
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:14,820
It is.

750
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,620
Bad.

751
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:15,960
Yeah.

752
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,720
Um.

753
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,160
Crazy, man.

754
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,860
Oh, that music in the background there was by Norrell Preff.

755
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,880
That killer guitar music.

756
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,200
That was Norrell Preff Instrumental.

757
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,940
Norrell FF is Rachel.

758
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,060
W.

759
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,380
E.

760
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,480
K.

761
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:33,800
K.

762
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,820
K.

763
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,160
K.

764
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,360
K.

765
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,440
We heard music earlier in the show.

766
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,080
A hip-sodic.

767
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,920
And this in the background is Ed Fred.

768
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,600
Ed Fred music, I think.

769
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,760
And they leave the earth, their troubles melting like lemmings.

770
00:32:51,440 --> 00:33:01,880
I mean, Brian dropped that awning to town.

771
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:07,400
I didn't notice that a большой?

772
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,960
I understood that.

773
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,660
They were staring long ago at one of the

774
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:14,660


775
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,080
And they were getting laid off obviously first.

776
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,620
They know either someone's gonna take that guy for a ride or they won't.

777
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:16,620


778
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,480
The country 가장...

779
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
We're really, really surprisingly hireless.

780
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,660
witnessing this it's a war between the dopamine and the serotonin each man have their own troops

781
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:34,540
their little vehicles their fighting tanks their mighty mighty military robots each and every one

782
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,920
of them is a vessel designed by satan but don't worry

783
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,900
oh i just remembered something i've got

784
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,780
scary scary thing

785
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:07,300
a scary thing oh no no no well uh what it is is uh you know over the years those uh those

786
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,760
altbein

787
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,660
Binary Slack creatures.

788
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,900
Where I scrape a lot of the sound for the hour of Slack off of.

789
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,840
Nice, you scrape.

790
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,480
Binary Slack where you download the weird audio and the weird pictures from subgenius land.

791
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:33,020
Those guys have been cutting up little pictures of sounds for millions of years and have made tiny, funny, goofy one-liners.

792
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,920
Little fissures on the side of the statues.

793
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,260
One, two, ready, go.

794
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,740
And that's on the one side of the head.

795
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,080
And the other side of the head is much more.

796
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,040
Subgenius gravy where you scrape up the bits.

797
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,160
Well, you know, these types do rip your brain in half.

798
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,880
They take the left ear and the right ear and yank them apart.

799
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,060
And so just pay attention.

800
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,780
How awesome is thisty containopel?

801
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,540
Whoa, it's so—

802
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:23,580
Hello?

803
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:23,680
Hey, look at this нее.

804
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,480
She's literally saying,

805
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,680
This cake is so shiny.

806
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,000


807
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,460
Wow, what the, no-no, no no no

808
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:29,980
Can she make that?

809
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:29,980


810
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:47,360
New Boulder first grade. Genuinely beautiful. Giant. Perfect. Cool. Special. Cheered. Labyrinth. Easy. Ultimate. Best. Natural. Growing. Special. Nice. Proud. Quicker. And much more.

811
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,440
It's a jolly, jolly Bob show.

812
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,640
It's jolly.

813
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,160
It's so jolly.

814
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,680
Funny Bob show.

815
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,140
It's jollier than jolly.

816
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,180
It'll mess you up.

817
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,340
It's so jolly it makes me laugh.

818
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,360
It'll steal your soul if you let it.

819
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,540
It'll mess with your soul.

820
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,100
Tasty prairie squid spread.

821
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,600
Salted and unsalted variety.

822
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,700
Available on the East Coast only.

823
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,640
The radioactive cloud is now over Little Rock.

824
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,500
Crager shat piercingly.

825
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,940
This is really amazing.

826
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:01,360
Ergo, those that refuse the program while a minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.

827
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:02,920
Bob!

828
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,080
Bob!

829
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

830
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,260
The following order is to be carried out immediately.

831
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,000
It's not a crutch, Dad.

832
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,320
It's something I've come to rely on to help me through life.

833
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,540
Praise the Lord.

834
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,240
I think this is about the sixt.

835
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,540
Sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ, and since I've been listening to it.

836
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,360
I gotta have some slack.

837
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,320
Slack.

838
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,800
It's pretty faster than any other leading cleanser.

839
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,340
Our advanced analyzer software helps you quickly sort through expensive diapers.

840
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,780
And our streaming data page enables you to size up body parts.

841
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,660
I'm going to bypass your forebrain and appeal directly to your amygdala.

842
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,640
Oh, don't grin!

843
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,080
Okay, grin!

844
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,120
Don't grin!

845
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:17,420
Ah!

846
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:27,720
This is civilization's jungle, after the jackals of society have ruthlessly ravaged it, ending the world of decency.

847
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,340
Haven't had time for your kind of woman.

848
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,280
Don't touch me, I can't stand you!

849
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:42,060
But all you're remembering is merely a series of sensory impulses which you now realize have no real definite connection with outside reality.

850
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,680
True. But since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.

851
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:54,140
I have no time to make a show of loving kindness before my fellow men. Not in this life. I've too much laughing to do.

852
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,020
Hurrah!

853
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,500
Unfair to kick a man when he's down.

854
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,140
Let's get him up on his feet.

855
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,860
We're gonna have to get him up on his feet.

856
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,680
We're gonna have to get him up on his feet.

857
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,960
We're gonna have to get him up on his feet.

858
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,760
We're gonna have to get him up on his feet.

859
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,840
Excellent!

860
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:11,120
He will not reveal his identity, so for today, we're calling him Bob.

861
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,280
Men and women of all races and breeds pause to destroy the Earth.

862
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:27,140
I sometimes feel that I am impersonating the dark subconscious of the whole human race.

863
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,760
It's what's left of the blood.

864
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,080
There's a strongforce.

865
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,080


866
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,700
Bob.

867
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,860
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

868
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,960
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

869
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,120
Bob.

870
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,180
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

871
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,460
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

872
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:44,960
Bob.

873
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:44,960


874
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,280
What's that? What's that?

875
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,280
Fantastic things have already happened, and more are getting ready to happen.

876
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,220
This is because the planet on which you're residing has entered the space age.

877
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,000
You are a most unusual individual

878
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,140
And decidedly in the minority

879
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,200
Oh, another victim of confusion?

880
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,080
Decidedly

881
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,060
Oh, that's crazy talk

882
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,460
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe

883
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,080
Well, we're all pretty much, aren't we?

884
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,660
I'm sorry

885
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,720
Do you think Bob is just a guy with a pipe?

886
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,420
Are you just a guy with a pipe?

887
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,780
Well, it's like a form of dialectic

888
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,120
You could divide the world into different cramps

889
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,740
That you were talking about cramps before

890
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,680
You could have some who believe that

891
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,240
It's just a guy with a pipe

892
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,540
And others who dynamically believe

893
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,540
It's just a guy with a pipe

894
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,500
You know what I'm saying?

895
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,280
Like when they say it

896
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,960
They look at each other and they're like

897
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,160
Yeah, man, it's just a guy with a pipe

898
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,560
You know what I mean?

899
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,240
A special glimmer in each other's eyes

900
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,160
And they can give each other

901
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,380
The high sign or different signs

902
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,260
To truly believe

903
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,480
To truly let all brain cells die

904
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,760
That must be good

905
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,280
Well, that's our goal

906
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,280
That's the goal of each and every individual aspirer

907
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,980
Or perspirer

908
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,620
Anybody who wants to attain that certain secondary

909
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,300
I don't know what it is

910
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,500
I guess you can read things

911
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,740
But you know what I'm saying?

912
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,780
We all need this

913
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,340
I know what you're saying

914
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,340
We all need slack

915
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,820
It's in a manufactured need

916
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,240
Must have slack

917
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,020
Must have slack

918
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,380
Must have

919
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,980
Must have

920
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,240
Must have

921
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,460
Must have

922
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:24,460


923
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,400
And slag

924
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,440
Must have slag

925
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:27,760
Must have

926
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,220
Must have

927
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,160
Yeah, when they buried the poor little guy

928
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,880
He was as bloated as a grape

929
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,660
He had to use a rake to pull him out of the pond

930
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,580
He'd been swearing up and down

931
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,060
He was gonna do it all week

932
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,040
He said if Bob didn't give him a call

933
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,300
Or he didn't get some word

934
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,240
About that 30 bucks he sent that damn

935
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,960
What's his name?

936
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,740
Oh, that 30 bucks

937
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,660
Well, now, now, you know.

938
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:12,680
Yeah, baby!

939
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,300
It's all coming down.

940
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,840
Civilization, that is.

941
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,280
Falling apart.

942
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,280
Falling to pieces.

943
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,460
You're part of it.

944
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,200
You're part of the problem, not the solution.

945
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,520
You're one of the tiny cracks, man.

946
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,700
You're one of the little fissures pulling the thing down.

947
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,880
You're one of the things, you know, reducing it to a common, a common, common.

948
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,560
So do the right thing, man.

949
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,260
Go ahead and jump.

950
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,300
Just get it over with.

951
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,300
Yeah, get it over with, man.

952
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,640
Go on and get it over with, then.

953
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,280
It's so easy.

954
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:52,920
And your troubles will melt like lemming drops as you fall off the edge of a cliff.

955
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,500
So, so high up over there.

956
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:55,800
You'll see.

957
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,960
It's a beautiful, breathtaking dive.

958
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:04,100
A hundred feet down to the new beach and rocks below.

959
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:05,820
Lombada.

960
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,560
Ah, the Lombada, the dance of love.

961
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:18,180
Practiced by Bob and Connie in the heat and feverish passion of their desire.

962
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:24,380
Oh, and you, too, can glean some of the sweaty, sheeny, shiny,

963
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,440
sweet,

964
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,840
wet off of their skin.

965
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,660
If you will just do as your master Bob says and fetch the paper every morning,

966
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:39,800
bring him his slippers and his little pipe loaded for bear and join us, humans,

967
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,700
in our subterranean tunnels of love.

968
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,620
You're going to have to ripen first.

969
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,980
You're going to have to be a little more, a little more less.

970
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:04,280
Yes, you just have to lose a little bit of those excess brain cells you've been tripping over.

971
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,160
Really, that's it.

972
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:05,820
They're not much.

973
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,400
Lombada.

974
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,740
Lombada.

975
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,160
Lombada.

976
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,360
Lombada.

977
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,120
Lombada.

978
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,260
Lombada.

979
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:17,800
What we're trying to say is dance the Lombada.

980
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,520
The Lombada.

981
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:23,720
Lombada.

982
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,160
Lombada.

983
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:24,420
Lombada.

984
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:24,760
Lombada.

985
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,140
Lombada.

986
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,500
Lombada.

987
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:25,500


988
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:25,500


989
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:25,500


990
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:25,500


991
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:25,500


992
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:25,800
Lombada.

993
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,520
Easy, easy program thing.

994
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,620
People could get involved with almost like a form of aerobics.

995
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,520
People want to lose weight.

996
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,320
They want to shed those unnecessary LBs.

997
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,920
They want to bring the kilos down, and yet at the same time,

998
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,680
they want to bring their own architecture up.

999
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,600
So what do they do?

1000
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,200
They run around little circles.

1001
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,020
They get on those bikes and things like that.

1002
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,860
Well, how can they reduce their brain cells?

1003
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,960
How can we...

1004
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,100
How should we say it?

1005
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,800
How can we...

1006
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,260
Lighten the load.

1007
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,060
Lighten the load.

1008
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:54,980
Up there.

1009
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,020
where it's real heavy.

1010
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,800
You know, a lot of people got fat butts.

1011
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,080
A lot of people got a midriff.

1012
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,080
A lot of people maybe got a saggy neck

1013
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,840
or something like that.

1014
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,480
But how many of us,

1015
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,620
and I'm saying pretty much 90% to 100,000% of all of us,

1016
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,600
have too much going on upstairs?

1017
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,000
We've eaten too many psychic donuts

1018
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,420
and there's psychobalk.

1019
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,200
That's an old world.

1020
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,280
I didn't make that up.

1021
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,680
Well, Dave, there's an answer.

1022
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,020
There is an answer.

1023
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,520
That's where break thinking comes in.

1024
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,860
Bob teaches a technique called break thinking

1025
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,200
by which you completely disconnect the mind.

1026
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,760
This is also called a path to higher consciousness-lessness.

1027
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,100
Can that help the bulges in my brain?

1028
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,920
It's to create smooth noodle maps,

1029
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,360
as depicted by Devo.

1030
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,340
I love smooth.

1031
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,180
Yes, to smooth the maps on your noodle,

1032
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,060
to smooth down the corrugations,

1033
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,000
which contain so many excess thoughts,

1034
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,980
thoughts of unfairness and sadness

1035
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,840
that you don't want to think about.

1036
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,640
Smooth it down and have only simple,

1037
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,520
simple thoughts of happiness.

1038
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,220
You're a pro-phylactic,

1039
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,200
Mobius-stripped thoughts running through and without.

1040
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,580
Lisa, smooth.

1041
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,320
One, two, cha-cha-bob.

1042
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,440
Cha-cha-bob.

1043
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,000
One, two, cha-cha-bob.

1044
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,360
Blow the road up top.

1045
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,600
Blow the road up top.

1046
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,100
Cha-cha-bob.

1047
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,580
Blow the road up top.

1048
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:23,140
Cha-cha-bob.

1049
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,500
Blow the road up top.

1050
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,080
Cha-cha-bob.

1051
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,080
Oh, hang on a minute.

1052
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,420
No.

1053
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,800
No, let's get away from that,

1054
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,480
because nihilism is not where the...

1055
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,120
This is not even really a church,

1056
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,400
but nihilism is not where this organization

1057
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,620
is going from head to fore.

1058
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,700
Who cares about Neil?

1059
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,280
We're into Bob.

1060
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,980
Who cares about Neil?

1061
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,420
Neil Innes, perhaps, if we could hear his song.

1062
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,940
Yeah, Neil Innes with the great Bonzo Dog Man, sure.

1063
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,120
Bonzoing again, but...

1064
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,540
I'm not being nihilist.

1065
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,940
We don't need that kind of...

1066
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,160
We don't need that kind of destructive...

1067
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,140
You can't stop me.

1068
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,160
This is slathery.

1069
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,840
You know, some people are afraid of slathering.

1070
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:52,840


1071
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,080
We're afraid of slavery.

1072
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,180
We're afraid of slathering.

1073
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,740
Like that one cosmic-minded guy

1074
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,740
was saying on the internet,

1075
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,700
negativity is bad, and positivity is...

1076
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,240
I don't know.

1077
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,900
...basically good.

1078
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,300
I don't know about that.

1079
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,040
Actually, positive thinking is what got us where we are now.

1080
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:05,860
Positively.

1081
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,820
...the bizarro world.

1082
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,800
Mm-mm-mm.

1083
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,520
No, I like square edges.

1084
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,300
I like things that aren't too round and fuzzy.

1085
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:11,940
I like, you know...

1086
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,200
That's right, Virgil.

1087
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,120
That's right, 90-degree head.

1088
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,600
It's time for you to wear off the top of those spongy boxes

1089
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,600
and return your brain to its original condition.

1090
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,820
It's all in the bag.

1091
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,500
It's a balance, you know.

1092
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,240
Smooth as a noodle and paste.

1093
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,000
Ignore or deny every reality.

1094
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,500
Please.

1095
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,760
Get the bigger picture.

1096
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,840
As big as you fit some screen...

1097
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,140
Big, big, big.

1098
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:34,640
...in your head.

1099
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,620
It's too big for my head.

1100
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,480
Señor.

1101
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,420
God made me do it.

1102
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,280
How often do you say that, friend?

1103
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,620
Is it too big for your head?

1104
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,440
It's way too big for my head.

1105
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,760
We have plenty more you can use for us.

1106
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,460
Oh, okay.

1107
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,800
Let me see some of those other ones over there.

1108
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,340
And here they are.

1109
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,320
We can see the plane.

1110
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:52,920
Oh, okay.

1111
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,380
I'm bringing in the shipments of giant heads

1112
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,420
for these poor bereft people, these humans down here

1113
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,480
with their small heads, their empty heads,

1114
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:09,420
their sad, troubled heads seen so far down below us.

1115
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,420
They look up at we who fly above,

1116
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,740
us birdmen, junior and senior birdmen,

1117
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,020
soaring so high above them in our slack

1118
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,840
and our soft,

1119
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,820
self-professed superiority, yes?

1120
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,240
For we have the megaphone and are able to profess our superiority

1121
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,340
so much louder than all of the others.

1122
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,160
So much louder than ever before.

1123
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,360
That's what we mean by the conspiracy.

1124
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,400
The bully.

1125
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,100
That's right.

1126
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,860
The jerk.

1127
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,920
The ass that pushes you around and never shuts up.

1128
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,880
Say hi, Daddy.

1129
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,120
Oh, oh, yeah.

1130
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,900
Well, that part's over.

1131
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,800
The party didn't have to end that way.

1132
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,840
No, it didn't.

1133
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,620
So many resculpted bodies, so much unused barbed wire.

1134
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,900
So, so very many.

1135
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,860
So many belts and gas bottoms and batteries

1136
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,400
that didn't fit in the wrong confusion holes.

1137
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,760
But that's their way of thinking, those silly musclemen.

1138
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,120
How did they not?

1139
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,920
Why didn't they?

1140
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,620
They'll never, never know.

1141
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,140
It's very simple.

1142
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,100
Hi, embarrassing people stare at you.

1143
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,320
Without a face.

1144
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,140
The face terrified me.

1145
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,560
You just want to be normal.

1146
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,980
It's not the black head.

1147
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,980
No, no, no, no, no.

1148
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,380
Praise Bob.

1149
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,140
You have consumed enough alcohol for one evening.

1150
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,740
It is wasteful and pointless.

1151
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,940
Obey and live or disobey and die.

1152
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,200
I see no reason for violence.

1153
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,180
You did take us to sleep.

1154
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,280
If however you are confronted, you may resort to the use of hypnosis.

1155
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1156
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,700
You know, God hates you.

1157
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,840
Stay away from him.

1158
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,640
Licentiousness, just unbridled, uncontrolled excesses.

1159
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,960
That was something he invented.

1160
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,880
And I say, as long as you're alive, shout, make noise.

1161
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,580
Oh, whatever.

1162
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,660
Because we.

1163
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,500
Praise Bob.

1164
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,540
You shut up like hell.

1165
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,080
The future is always a lie.

1166
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,080


1167
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,080


1168
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,620
nonsense until it becomes the past.

1169
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:29,640
The American people have now spoken, but it's going to take a little while to determine

1170
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,620
exactly what they said.

1171
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:32,840
I'm afraid.

1172
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,700
I'm afraid, Dan.

1173
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,120
What's his name?

1174
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,100
Wow.

1175
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,520
Wow.

1176
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,640
Ain't that a bitch?

1177
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,920
Don't you worry about us, Lord.

1178
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,320
We may blow a few holes in your ceiling from time to time, but we give you fair warning

1179
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,160
before we blow up the whole house.

1180
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:57,200
Yes, fair warning before X-Day.

1181
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,580
We told you, July 5th, this year.

1182
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,520
This year might be 1998.

1183
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,680
It could be 2012.

1184
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,100
We have no idea.

1185
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:07,440
It could be.

1186
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,500
The records are all skewed in a scramble.

1187
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:09,960
It could be.

1188
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,400
But it seems like this is the year, is it not?

1189
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:13,760
Yes.

1190
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,060
This is the year in which the raptured or ruptured ones, excuse me, I'm so sorry, I'm

1191
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,640
confused with the other.

1192
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,240
But the ruptured ones.

1193
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,720
The ruptured ones are lifted up into space and whisked off somewhere.

1194
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,300
That's what the fairy tale says.

1195
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,380
That's what the fairy tale says.

1196
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,340
It's a mythos.

1197
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,180
That's what Bob said.

1198
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,640
The actual mythos of the, well, I guess it goes back to Philo Drummond and Reverend Ivory

1199
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,220
Stagg.

1200
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:36,980
Ivory Stinks.

1201
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,820
Ivory Stinks.

1202
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:38,660
Ivory Stinks.

1203
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,680
Quite an apt description of his olfactory, what he gives off, anyway.

1204
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,580
But in the first place, what we find amongst many of these culties, these barbies, these

1205
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,300
followers, is an extreme.

1206
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:50,820
Extremely.

1207
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,640
Detachment.

1208
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,180
A disassociation.

1209
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,240
An extreme.

1210
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,360
A flat A smack.

1211
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,280
A flat A smack.

1212
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:57,660
Yes.

1213
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,560
A null A sign on each one's forehead.

1214
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,580
And each one waiting the ride to Venus and it never happens.

1215
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,080
Yes.

1216
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,380
But some, some return every year.

1217
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,260
Then I thought, I could die doing this.

1218
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,940
I guess this is going to prove myself once and for all that I'm down for Bob.

1219
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,800
I'll help him do anything.

1220
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,240
Bob.

1221
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:19,620
Bob.

1222
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:19,940
Bob.

1223
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,140
Bob.

1224
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,580
Bob.

1225
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:20,940
Bob.

1226
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,420
Bob.

1227
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1228
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1229
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1230
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1231
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1232
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1233
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1234
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1235
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1236
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,420


1237
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,380
Maybe that's all Bob is.

1238
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,140
I'll say hello later.

1239
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,760
Shut up about Bob, will you?

1240
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,020
Go holly.

1241
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:28,600
Go holly.

1242
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,740
Just before Christmas, Bob followed through.

1243
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:37,880
He walked into this bank north of Seattle and left with nearly $26,000, which he stashed

1244
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,740
in a child's trick-or-treat bag.

1245
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,360
Bob had good reason to smile again.

1246
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,160
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

1247
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,100
Give me slack, you frickin' lunacy.

1248
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,560
I'm out of frickin' slack.

1249
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,900
The lawless are on the loose, making it necessary for law-abiding citizens to make their own law.

1250
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:03,940
Yes.

1251
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,940
See you in the new TV.

1252
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,460
Don't sass me.

1253
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,500
Not only the marginally weird, but the entirely weird.

1254
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:15,520
Oh, yeah.

1255
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,040
We're clever to the scope of the church of the earth.

1256
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,600
Right, right, right.

1257
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,640
Not the, um...

1258
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,000
Right, right.

1259
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:25,120
So, yeah, we work up into the scope.

1260
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:32,500
And some are made to wear the bellboy attendant hats and suits that look quite strange to some of the young members.

1261
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,700
It's a treat for some of the ones who've gone on, so to speak.

1262
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,900
Some have the bonsai.

1263
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,120
Some have shrunk quite, quite, quite far down.

1264
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:42,680
Yes, yes.

1265
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,360
You can hardly make them out without...

1266
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,400
And then some have the elephant titus.

1267
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,040
Yeah, well, those are the ones that are quite introspective.

1268
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:49,840
Introspective.

1269
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,340
You see what happens?

1270
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:50,600
Yes.

1271
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,340
The more they think, the bigger their heads get.

1272
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,840
And pretty soon, the calcium in the brain, they're not the brain.

1273
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,200
The new...

1274
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,480
The new...

1275
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,760
Hey, I have a question.

1276
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,640
I have a question.

1277
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,420
Is this show for, like, people who are on drugs?

1278
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,580
I hope not.

1279
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,980
That is a hot-button subject.

1280
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:17,080
I would hope that it would be the kind of thing that would replace the drugs, don't you see?

1281
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:17,700
Exactly.

1282
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,680
It's the repugnancy factor.

1283
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,920
Dr. Stang is what we've been talking to.

1284
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,520
Rather than merely an enhancement.

1285
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,400
Rubber is leather.

1286
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,100
Listen to this.

1287
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,400
Who needs drugs?

1288
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,740
Well, you might need them as an enhancement for this show.

1289
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,460
I don't know.

1290
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,600
In order to make it more palatable.

1291
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,240
You may need a...

1292
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:33,680
Oh, poppycock.

1293
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,180
Or a doggy bag.

1294
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,760
Or a pair of hairy, hairy socks.

1295
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,420
That's a bunch of bushwhacky.

1296
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:42,820
To give it the semblance of social value or...

1297
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,000
Friends, if you want to know more...

1298
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,940
Definitely a feeling that your mind is being monitored.

1299
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,220
Bye, baby.

1300
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:58,900
Your mind can be further monitored if you will simply write for free information if you're interested in more about the Church of the Sep Genius.

1301
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,840
You can get some by mail from Bob at...

1302
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,260
Well, actually, it's not Bob.

1303
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,760
That would be ridiculous.

1304
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,300
It's Jesus.

1305
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:14,200
At Post Office Box 204206, Austin, Texas 78720.

1306
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,820
That's the business headquarters, you might say, of the church.

1307
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,180
The...

1308
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,080
The...

1309
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,840
The second...

1310
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,360
Or what is it now?

1311
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:29,360
The fourth megafist temple lodge, the spiritual headquarters is, of course, here in beautiful Cleveland, Ohio.

1312
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:48,180
And you can send tapes and CDs and such like to me, Reverend Stang, at subgenius.com, Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1313
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,540
What's our zip code?

1314
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,120
One, four, one, one, eight.

1315
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,080
Eight?

1316
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,860
Yeah.

1317
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,540
Eight.

1318
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:09,960
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry, Hour of Slack, number 942.

1319
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:13,920
There actually have been that many of them, although a few of those, I guess, were reruns.

1320
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:18,160
The music in the background is the swinging love corpses, the collage of the

1321
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,160


1322
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,160


1323
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,160


1324
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,160


1325
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,800
of noises that we heard were sourced from,

1326
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,280
I got that stuff from all of the subgeniuses.

1327
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,060
A special thanks to New Monet,

1328
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,860
Fernand and Andy Lemur,

1329
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,600
and Artemia Salina, I think,

1330
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,860
for a whole lot of that.

1331
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,240
I organized them myself

1332
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,220
using the rules of chance.

1333
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,720
Praise Bob and stay out of sleep.

1334
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,080
Bob?

1335
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,260
Bob?

1336
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,140
Bob?

1337
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,220
The professional pessimist.

1338
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,800
In the past, he's been called

1339
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,460
the prophet of gloom and doom,

1340
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,980
the troubadour of trouble,

1341
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,000
the disciple of despair.

1342
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,500
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1343
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,220
Bob.

1344
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,220
The unbalancing that happens

1345
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,680
when you work with these people

1346
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,680
makes you really question

1347
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,300
what you know reality is.

1348
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,620
Bob, Bob.

1349
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,020
Everyone likes Bob.

1350
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,380
Give me slack, you freaking lunatic.

1351
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,500
Stop, fucker.

1352
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,940
I'm out of freaking slack.

1353
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,320
That's not how you get the bad news.

1354
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,420
Oh, my God.

1355
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,600
Oh, my God.

1356
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:46,800
Oh, my God.

1357
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,700
Oh, my God.

1358
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,000
Slug, slug.

1359
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,800
Now you see that evil will always triumph

1360
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,820
because good is dumb.

1361
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,080
I know nothing, nothing.

1362
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,140
Doug's right, Virgil.

1363
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,960
We are different.

1364
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,520
Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies.

1365
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,200
Even Doug Smith.

1366
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,600
It's the good news, son.

1367
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:16,820
Cry havoc!

1368
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,580
And let's slit the dogs of war.

1369
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:20,640


1370
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:21,840
And let's slit the dogs of war.

1371
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,140
My boy, we're pilgrims in an unholy land.

1372
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:26,340
My boy, we're pilgrims in an unholy land.

1373
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,680
My boy, we're pilgrims in an unholy land.

1374
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:34,100
Sex, sex, sex, 30, 30, sex, sex, sex, pay $30 and get six sex free.

1375
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:39,920
Pills, pills, pills, Bob, Bob, feel me, Bob, feel me, Bob, do slack.

1376
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,680
Pop, pop, zippy, frop, frop.

1377
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,280
Hey, you smoking?

1378
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,660
No, but the pipe is.

1379
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:46,660
Good.

1380
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:47,960
Good.

1381
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:48,140


1382
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:48,560
That's a gag.

1383
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,660
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha.

1384
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,200
Seb , Robert Zink, Sterling Wallace and Bruce Akins

1385
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,440
Bob said to the fam they don't need благода.

1386
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:11,180
Me, Bob said, He could have said it blackout 2014.

1387
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,180
I threw this says fucking cunt on fire.

1388
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,080
That's true.

1389
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,780
My mind is going.

1390
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:21,620
Stop.

1391
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,380
My mind is going.

1392
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,760
My mind is not my mind.

1393
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:41,400
One look at them will tell you more than a thousand words of mine.

1394
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,220
Mom?
