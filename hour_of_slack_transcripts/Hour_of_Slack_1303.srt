We just developed the film and he's the processor tattoo.

190
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,580
And then they do some with it after that.

191
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,760
I got nothing to do with the bug porn or anything.

192
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:06,980
.

193
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,020
Ow.

194
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,600
Hey.

195
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,780
Hey.

196
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,020
Hey.

197
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,340


198
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,880
Hey.

199
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,880
Hey.

200
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,720
Hey.

201
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:17,800


202
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,360
Hey.

203
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,640
Hey.

204
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,260
Hey.

205
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,480


206
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,760
Hey.

207
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,180
Hey.

208
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,700
Hey.

209
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:24,720
Hey.

210
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


211
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


212
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


213
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


214
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


215
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


216
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


217
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


218
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


219
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


220
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


221
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


222
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,780


223
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
Hey.

224
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,080
Hey.

225
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,340
Hey.

226
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,320
Hey.

227
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,300
.

228
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,840
Hey.

229
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,120
Hey.

230
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,760
I had a cellular phone, and the woman, what's the woman's name?

231
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,300
Princess Weardo.

232
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,140
Princess Weardo was screaming something about bug pornography.

233
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,480
Death of a fly.

234
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,640
So we'll have an officer come out and talk to you.

235
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,640
Death of a fly.

236
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,360
Can an officer come and visit you perhaps tomorrow around 2 o'clock?

237
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,360
Well, look, Your Honor, we really, I mean, look, yes,

238
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,780
we publish the bug erotic photography shots,

239
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,240
but we have a constitutional right.

240
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,380
This is an artistic study of the lovely structure of the insect body.

241
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:46,420
Some, I admit that there may be some trade in this sort of thing illegally on the Internet

242
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,620
or something like that, but we have nothing to do with that.

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,620
These are expensive art books.

244
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,060
We're not interested in investigating the investigation entirely.

245
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,180
We're only concerned.

246
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,440
Dobbs approved art books.

247
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,200
Well, we're only concerned with the disappearance of these two people,

248
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,200
and we're not interested in investigating the pornography ring right now on any level that I know of.

249
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,720
Anyway, I just want to know if an officer can come around your house around 2 o'clock tomorrow.

250
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:15,460
Well, those people didn't, those people probably got whatever they, I mean, we didn't have anything to do with that.

251
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,740
You can't pin that on us.

252
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,760
Show me a witness.

253
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,320
What was the question?

254
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,540
Something about, no, no, they can't come around.

255
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm going to be gone.

256
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,820
I'm out of town.

257
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,980
Got to preach a show in Columbus.

258
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,700
Yeah, that's it.

259
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,540
Columbus, Saturday night, Sunday night.

260
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,600
Ike.

261
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,880
Ike.

262
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,720
Is that you, man?

263
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,340
Ike Sting.

264
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,820
That's Ivan.

265
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,720
Hey, man, I knew you when you were Ike.

266
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:42,960
Yeah.

267
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,280
You do all that Bob stuff, man.

268
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,880
Look, hey, man.

269
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,480
Dead of a fly.

270
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
You're doing pretty good with that stuff, you know, all that Bob stuff.

271
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,860
Dead of a fly.

272
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,260
You got any money?

273
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,680
You can do anything.

274
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,640
Dead of a fly.

275
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,880
My baby.

276
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,220
I went to school today, you know.

277
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,540
Um, sorry, I don't carry cash anymore.

278
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,080
I do everything with this chip in my forehead and my hand.

279
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,960
Well, could you, like, you know, take it over to some place and get me a hamburger or something?

280
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,000
Uh, yeah, I'll tell you what.

281
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,560
I'll be back in about ten minutes.

282
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,360
Hey, look, no, Ike, man.

283
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,320
I'll see you later.

284
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,780
Hey, man, I remember when...

285
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,160
Hey, Sting, you suck, man.

286
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,020
Hey.

287
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,260
I remember the little people.

288
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,620
I detest them.

289
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,660
Sting.

290
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,400
I ignore them.

291
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,000
Sting, you've forgotten the little people.

292
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,580
I don't notice them.

293
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,660
Even you have an inner voice, Sting.

294
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,000
Even Sting has an inner voice.

295
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,520
I wish that inner voice would leave me alone and leave me in peace.

296
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,120
Drive back.

297
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,100
Drive back, Ivan.

298
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,860
Jeez, that guy probably dead.

299
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,800
There's pizza huts all over that neighborhood with help wanted signs out that...

300
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,480
He's hungry.

301
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:50,920
Bum.

302
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,300
He can get a job just like I had to do back that one time a long time ago.

303
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,980
I hate those bums.

304
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,880
I feel kind of bad for him, though.

305
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,800
I mean, it would be so easy for me.

306
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,220
It wouldn't...

307
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,340
I mean, what's five bucks?

308
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,760
That's like nothing for me.

309
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,820
I could hand him a fiver, but that would just be encouraging.

310
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,320
Your heart is shrinking, man.

311
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,940
I'd just be encouraging.

312
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,040
You like those pinks and all those unpassionate, though.

313
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,280
It's people you despise.

314
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,100
I guess it does.

315
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,240
It does.

316
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,780
It's kind of pink of me not to give those lazy bums a buck.

317
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,700
Stop making it up, man.

318
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,220
Lazy bums.

319
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,440
It's not like you to do something like that.

320
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,940
Just go ahead, man, on a whim, on a lark.

321
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
That's the point.

322
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Wait a minute.

323
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,720
Now I'm getting an idea.

324
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:47,020
I could go back there and promise him five bucks, lure him into the car, gas him...

325
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,820
See now you're thinking right, man.

326
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,300
...and put him in the vats.

327
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,440
Yeah.

328
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,880
Yeah.

329
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,320
Yeah.

330
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,380
See, your inner voice will direct you.

331
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,280
Yeah, we can turn him into dirt for a special vat.

332
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,040
Yeah, man.

333
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,040


334
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,360
You're all right.

335
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,080
Yeah, I guess I'll do a...

336
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,620
You haven't lost it.

337
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,060
Here.

338
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,680
You haven't.

339
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,540
I'll just...

340
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,380
I feel good now.

341
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,880
I think I feel like I've listened to my inner spoiled brat.

342
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,540
It's always...

343
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,980
Just, you know, doing whatever the hell I feel like doing.

344
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,520
It seems like such a rewarding way to...

345
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,000
Speed up, man.

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah, I'll just...

347
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,920
I'm gonna head out...

348
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,200
Drive faster, Ivan.

349
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,940
Man, I'm cool.

350
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,380
I can drive fast like a he-man.

351
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,700
I think I'm gonna have a swig of this here...

352
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,140
Yeah.

353
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,100
...cord of beer here.

354
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,100
Oh, damn, it's empty.

355
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,840
Keep drinking.

356
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,020
Keep drinking.

357
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,220
I'll just throw it out the window here into this yard.

358
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:43,800
Hey, hey.

359
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,040
Oh, I hit a little kid.

360
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,120
Let's go, man.

361
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,660
There's a drive-thru beverage store.

362
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,760
Knock it over, man.

363
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,780
Steal some beer.

364
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,100
Beer.

365
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,140
Oh, let's...

366
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,120
Impulse, man.

367
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,740
You're a subgenius.

368
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,620
Yeah, natural-born killers.

369
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,180
All right, everybody in here.

370
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,900
This is a stick-up.

371
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,000
Give me all your beer.

372
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,660
Wait a minute.

373
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,860
Wait a minute.

374
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,640
What am I doing?

375
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,860
This is wrong, but I've already started into it.

376
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,200
Now I'm gonna be in trouble if I don't kill these bastards.

377
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:09,940
Hey, man.

378
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,620
Blam!

379
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,180
Blam!

380
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:11,780
Blam!

381
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,260
Hey, man.

382
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,720
What are you...

383
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:12,980
Don't...

384
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,380
Stop pointing your finger at me.

385
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,020
Do you want something?

386
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,600
Now that I've started this...

387
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,820
Now that I've started this...

388
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,540
Into this criminal act,

389
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,760
I guess I better find...

390
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,720
Holla through all the way.

391
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,680
See, I've killed three convenience store clerks.

392
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,160
Who's that guy?

393
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:24,840
And...

394
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,480
And...

395
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,380
I...

396
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,560
What else?

397
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,500
I guess I could rob a bank,

398
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,040
and then I'd be rich.

399
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,180
Then I could run for president.

400
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,800
Yeah.

401
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,920
Yeah, I'll be the ultimate arch-criminal.

402
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,540
I'll run for president.

403
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,480
I'll become friends with the CIA.

404
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,540
I know everything they're up to anyway,

405
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,420
and I'll just let them know,

406
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,940
hey, look, you guys do your business.

407
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,940
I'll do my business.

408
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,300
Let me get re-elected fair and square,

409
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,320
and I'll keep my mouth shut.

410
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,440
I'm sure you guys have stuff on me.

411
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,000
You keep your mouth shut,

412
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,340
everything'll be fine.

413
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,840
I got those ne'er-do-wells

414
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,860
and have-nots to vote for me,

415
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,400
because they thought I cared.

416
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,920
But I'm with you guys.

417
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,340
I know the way the world really works.

418
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,680
I know how it makes the world turn.

419
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,480
You understand.

420
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,000
I am so glad that you masons

421
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,980
and Disney CEOs and people

422
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,420
let me into the circle of ten.

423
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,620
Yes, and we're proud.

424
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,560
I'm glad to have you, too.

425
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,020
I'm also, well, I'm glad that Mr. Rockefeller died

426
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,300
and left, made a place for me, but...

427
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,520
Oh, that's a nice chair you're occupying, too.

428
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,500
Don't remember, there's a lot of tradition

429
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,600
in that chair, Mr. Stagg.

430
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,620
Oh, believe me, I know it.

431
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,800
I've done my homework, and you can bet

432
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,200
that the Church of the Subgenius

433
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,300
will happily work with the conspiracy from now on.

434
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,660
Of course, we're gonna make a lot more money

435
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,420
if we can maintain our anti-conspiracy,

436
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,500
conspiracy image.

437
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,620
You know, I mean, I assume that's why you brought us in.

438
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,280
Just a minute, Mr. Stagg.

439
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,060
Could you please just sit down?

440
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,100
You're making some of the members of the table

441
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,880
a little uncomfortable.

442
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,580
We certainly appreciate your attitude.

443
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,140
We're not much of a sort of behavior around here, boys.

444
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,680
We certainly...

445
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Sorry, Colonel North.

446
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,920
Just relax.

447
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,840
We'd like to talk to you about some of your other activities.

448
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,320
You see, Mr. Pipe Mill and Mr. Crack Tuber,

449
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,960
they feel that some of your activities

450
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,500
are encroaching on...

451
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,060
Well, how would a gangster say it?

452
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,720
Encroaching on their...

453
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:19,760
Encroaching on their...

454
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:19,760


455
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,640
turf, so to speak.

456
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,100
Uh, could you clarify that?

457
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,400
I, uh, don't...

458
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,280
Wally, just sit down.

459
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,720
Now, please put it away.

460
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,300
I'm sure we can work things out.

461
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,840
Well, we're definitely going to work things out now,

462
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,700
Reverend Stagg.

463
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,540
You see, uh, according to our figures,

464
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,220
you owe the conspiracy a lot of money.

465
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,500
What?

466
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,240
But I owe the conspiracy...

467
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
I would think that...

468
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,960
I thought you guys were gonna be paying me.

469
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,460
For a lot of airports, yes.

470
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,500
I gave you our mailing list.

471
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,700
Ha, mailing list.

472
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,240
The mailing list doesn't pay our bills, Mr. Stagg.

473
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,180
You know what kind of company you're sitting with.

474
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,680
Look at the men next to you.

475
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,440
These are men of power and wealth.

476
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,820
Now, you've dared to join our fraternity.

477
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,640
We've learned the idea,

478
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,780
and we've accepted you in our midst.

479
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,620
You're going to have to make amends.

480
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,640
You're going to have to do something

481
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,040
about all this money you owe us.

482
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:09,820
What?

483
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,980
Now, wait a minute.

484
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,940
What kind of...

485
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,500
You've got three weeks, Mr. Stagg.

486
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,060
How have I encroached on the turf

487
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,280
of any large conspiracy conglomerate?

488
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,600
Wally, stop that.

489
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,680
The church is...

490
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,580
The church had its own market.

491
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,940
It was completely different.

492
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,780
I'm sorry, Mr. Stagg.

493
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,160
You're going to have to come up with the money.

494
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,120
We paid our taxes.

495
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,960
Wally, please just...

496
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,600
The same way you guys do.

497
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,260
Now, come on.

498
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Hey, we're in the circle again.

499
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,280
You can't kick us.

500
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,540
Come on.

501
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,100
You can't...

502
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,340
Come along.

503
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,900
Come along, Reverend Stagg.

504
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,940
Looking for fun and feeling groovy.

505
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,800
Hey, hey, Rev.

506
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,500
Hey, Rev.

507
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,420
Hey, Rev.

508
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,880
How come you look so forlorn, man?

509
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,940
Hey, what you doing walking out of that alley anyway?

510
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,620
Oh, I'm feeling real groovy there, Dave.

511
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,760
Yeah, you don't look so good, buddy.

512
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,020
Oh, everything's okay, I guess.

513
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,620
You look like the world's on your shoulders, man.

514
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,020
Like a whole mess of trouble or something.

515
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,260
You look like the weight of the world on your shoulders.

516
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,340
Yeah, well, you know when they talk about the man?

517
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,280
Yeah.

518
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,040
Well, I met the man just now.

519
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:15,740
What?

520
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,600
You know.

521
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,480
The man?

522
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,480
Yeah, the man.

523
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,640
And he's...

524
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,460
He said we, uh, owed him a whole lot of money, Dave.

525
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,120
What do you mean, we, Kim Sabe?

526
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,080
Well, the church.

527
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,940
The church?

528
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,360
Yeah.

529
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,400
Owes the man?

530
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,060
Yeah.

531
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:31,860
Jeez.

532
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
Everything we've got.

533
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,740
So, uh, let me see your wallet, Dave.

534
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,580
I was just going to try and hit you up for a cup of soup, buddy.

535
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,400
Well, we don't...

536
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,800
Come on, we're walking right by some cadets.

537
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,700
I gave him the office.

538
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,480
Come on, you...

539
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,380
Now, fork it over.

540
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,360
Hey, look, if you're in Dutch with a man, you know my 25 cents ain't gonna help you out none, pal.

541
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,900
Well, you've probably got a point.

542
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,520
But I'll tell you what.

543
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,040
Do some more panhandling and whatever you come up with about tonight, we'll...

544
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,920
We'll let you live if you give it all to us.

545
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,200
Yeah.

546
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,420
It should be five or six bucks.

547
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,940
That'll be a start.

548
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,860
Damn.

549
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,340
Yeah, sure.

550
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,080
That sounds great.

551
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,000
Let me live.

552
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,380
He's got to give me this broken down...

553
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,780
This bill is broken down, let's see, for mind control.

554
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:18,240
Seven and a half billion dollars for sabotage of computers worldwide.

555
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,060
Let's see.

556
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,940
Eight and a half billion dollars.

557
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,280
How are we gonna...

558
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:31,480
All the lonesome cowboy days in the world wouldn't be able to pay off this debt.

559
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,760
Wonder if they'll take it in souls.

560
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,680
But even then, we probably don't have more than about seven or eight bills.

561
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:45,620
Maybe it's time to use one of those four little Ukrainian nuclear weapons.

562
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,220
One of the federal bills.

563
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,000
No, that...

564
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,180
But they did that already.

565
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,760
Damn.

566
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,960
This is your stop, sir.

567
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,620
Jim.

568
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,900
Sir, everyone is off the bus, please.

569
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,760
Get up, Jim.

570
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,660
I don't have anywhere to go.

571
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,660
I used to be world overlord.

572
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,780
I was president for five minutes.

573
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,040
I was in the circle of tens of air vaults.

574
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,180
I knowed the seven demons for what they was.

575
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,920
And I knowed J.R. Bobbitts.

576
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,840
I'll tell your story for 50 cents.

577
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,640
No, please.

578
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,100
Listen to him.

579
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,380
He's crazy.

580
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,720
I'll hold this sign for liquor.

581
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,080
Come on.

582
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,460
I think he's been hiding out from the conspiracy for the last 40 years.

583
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,000
I remember.

584
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,400
I remember.

585
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,620
I was on the escape vessels for the crash.

586
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,840
You gotta listen to him.

587
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,040
I was on...

588
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,840
I was given a special...

589
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,540
I wrote Zodinimus Pamphlet number one in 1979.

590
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,320
Yeah, you did.

591
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,600
Yeah, you did.

592
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,040
Old time.

593
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,700
I seen it.

594
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,620
I was there when J.R. Bobbitts was shot.

595
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,260
Shot in the San Francisco Theater.

596
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,560
That is a weird thing, though.

597
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,520
I have seen them pamphlets.

598
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,240
Just listen to them go on.

599
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,840
I was there when J.R. Hypercleats first launched the bleep.

600
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,660
I thought he was a world overlord or Bob or something.

601
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,140
I was elected president in 1996.

602
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,460
Been lost at all.

603
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,540
Been gambling on drugs.

604
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,980
I was...

605
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,860
I was...

606
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,580
I was...

607
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:15,800
I was...

608
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:15,860
I was...

609
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:15,880
I was...

610
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,340
I was...

611
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,740
I was...

612
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:16,960
I was...

613
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,000
I was...

614
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,040
I was...

615
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,280
I was...

616
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,640
I was...

617
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,820
I was...

618
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:19,820


619
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:19,820


620
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:19,820


621
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,880
Never did make it to television.

622
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,780
But now it's cover the conspiracy.

623
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,000
He's on the line taking a nap.

624
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,740
He starts a wave in his mind.

625
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,280
Believe me, son.

626
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,700
I fought the conspiracy just like you.

627
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,000
I fought harder than anybody.

628
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,140
I want to show you this withered up old card.

629
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Of course, first chance...

630
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,800
See, 30 bucks is, and 30 bucks is.

631
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,540
First chance I got, I joined them, of course.

632
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,960
Thought I didn't feel treated.

633
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,440
Make Bob world overlord.

634
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,500
Just a bit off more than I can chew.

635
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,160
That'd be a lesson to you.

636
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,680
Now, can you...

637
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,420
Hey, can you loan me?

638
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,820
I just got to get to the bus, get the bus back to my house.

639
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,500
I just loaned some old bum the last 50 cents.

640
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,480
You can loan me like 50, maybe a dollar or something.

641
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,420
You don't have to have five, do you?

642
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,420
Because I'll pay you back.

643
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,860
Sit down, old son.

644
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,640
Let me stroke your gray head.

645
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,400
You haven't washed your hair in a long time.

646
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,140
And my hands are up.

647
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,480
I will give you your money.

648
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,560
And I will drive you down to the edge of the old graveyard and leave you off.

649
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,360
And whatever sort of way you can make on your own, then you can do.

650
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,460
You ain't going to cart me off to the glue factory yet?

651
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,400
No, no, not the glue factory, just the cemetery.

652
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,660
It's a fine deal.

653
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,320
Take it, son.

654
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,000
You know, this ain't fair.

655
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:40,940
Nothing's fair.

656
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,080
You trudged through life doing the best you can.

657
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,340
What's it all for?

658
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,680
You're getting the car.

659
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,440
Yeah.

660
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,880
Stars up there twinkling, shining away in the void.

661
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:52,820
Oh.

662
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,820
So this is what happened.

663
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,460
I should have believed in Jesus when I had the chance.

664
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,260
I asked him into my heart once.

665
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,380
He never showed up.

666
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,740
I broke the date.

667
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,160
Just shut up, old man.

668
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,860
We got four more hours to drive before we get to Philly.

669
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,440
I don't want to hear nothing more about the church of the subgenius.

670
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,160
I need to use the bathroom.

671
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,600
Pull over next stop.

672
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,080
Yeah.

673
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,380
That's the last time we're going to pull over for you.

674
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,320
The next time I'm going to pistol whip your head.

675
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,200
Now shut up, old timer.

676
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,420
Oh, my God.

677
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,980
There's no respect for a holy man no more.

678
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,120
You actually believe all that stuff about Bob he's talking?

679
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
Well, don't you talk bad on Bob.

680
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,200
Hey, listen.

681
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,860
I told you to pipe down that thing.

682
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,640
What he was.

683
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,120
Oh.

684
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
There's my teeth.

685
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,480
Where's my teeth?

686
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,960
He knows my teeth.

687
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,380
I can't see nothing.

688
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,600
What are we going to do with him?

689
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,760
Man, I can't stand all this blitting all the way to Kansas City.

690
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,400
We're going backwards.

691
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,300
Now let him off at a rest stop or something.

692
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,200
Buy him a hamburger.

693
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,560
Do anything.

694
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,180
Get rid of him.

695
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,680
It's no kind of a world for an old man no more.

696
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,600
Yeah, old man.

697
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,120
Men flying around the moon.

698
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,240
Yeah.

699
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,840
Paying no attention to the troubles down here on Earth.

700
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,180
You'll find it one day, old guy.

701
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,620
Just keep going.

702
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,080
Don't come out there.

703
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,980
Thinks people are flying around the moon.

704
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,620
Shut up, will you?

705
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,220
You've only been on 14 planets.

706
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,560
I'm just an old.

707
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,000
I once owned 14 planets.

708
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,380
Then I lost them.

709
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,660
Then I lost it all.

710
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,880
Lost my faith in Bob.

711
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,380
You lost your teeth.

712
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,280
You lost your watch.

713
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:22,700
Let me tell you about the time.

714
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,220
You don't shut up.

715
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,320
You're going to lose a lot more than that.

716
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,380
You're standing down at 44.

717
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,920
Now shut up.

718
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,720
There's probably more planets than there are atoms in the universe.

719
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,400
You've only been on one.

720
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,140
I met Colin Powell and shook his hand.

721
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,180
I knowed all the world leaders briefly back then.

722
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,520
Give him a colon warmer.

723
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,560
He used to live at the mall.

724
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,800
Pass him the colon warmer, will you, please, before he expires in the backseat.

725
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,240
I used to live at the mall, too.

726
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,500
Oh, man.

727
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,440
Life 101.

728
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,780
You flunk.

729
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,820
Can't you do anything better on the radio than that weird buzzing sound?

730
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,580
Yes, these inspirational parables have been brought to you by ESO Radio and the Church of the Subgenius

731
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,400
and the endless...

732
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,700
Tribes of all the UFOs and the conspiracy.

733
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,940
In hopes that you will learn a lesson.

734
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:35,240
Young man or young woman out there driving down Euclid, lost, hopeless, looking for something,

735
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,380
seeking something.

736
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,080
Tried Scientology.

737
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,420
It was too stupid.

738
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,380
I want fun.

739
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,300
I want fun.

740
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:42,720
Tried TV.

741
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,040
It was too stupid.

742
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,000
Tried real life.

743
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,960
It was too hard.

744
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:54,360
Well, you can escape from all of those things into your own fantasy world, your own delusions.

745
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,580
You don't need a life.

746
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,140
Join the Church of the Subgenius.

747
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,240
Thank you.

748
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,020
Thank you.

749
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,800
Thank you, Reverend.

750
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,800
I've been staying for those wonderful, inspirational messages.

751
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,620
Now, during the cocktail here, cocktail hour here aboard the Exeter,

752
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,220
the vessels of the space...

753
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm sorry, this is my first night here.

754
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,400
Tonight, performing, we're going to be having the...

755
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,620
Oh, jeez, I can't read these cards.

756
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,960
The hairy women are going to be crucified.

757
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,580
Was that your request, Reverend Stang?

758
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,520
Oh, no, no, no.

759
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,140
Not crucified.

760
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,840
I just want to see a live sex show.

761
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,520
I don't want to...

762
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,320
No, I don't enjoy the violence.

763
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,220
I thought you wanted to see a hairy monkey woman crucified.

764
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,820
I've been watching that stuff all day on the view screens.

765
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,200
Okay.

766
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,500
It is not her suit to be crucified.

767
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,840
No, no.

768
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,840
I hate the hairy...

769
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,460
She's a yeti.

770
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,480
Would you like to pretend like there are more people in the audience

771
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,320
so we can have more interactive

772
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,140
and you can think of maybe something else you might want to do?

773
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,060
No, I'm tired.

774
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,040
I think I'll just sit here and listen to Elvis and drink.

775
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,280
Would you like to drink real booze

776
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,420
or would you like to drink some of the exacerbated boozy?

777
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,360
Or would you like to perhaps drop again?

778
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,020
No, no, I'll just have this off and statters.

779
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,300
Double-edged rope?

780
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,360
House standard.

781
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,900
Primo triples, Rob.

782
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,440
No, no, no.

783
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,420
Just sit here.

784
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,640
Would you like your toes shined?

785
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,500
This isn't all I expected it to be.

786
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,680
I'm tired.

787
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,820
My first day on the escape vessels, I'm already...

788
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,020
Bored.

789
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,500
Bored with pleasure and...

790
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,320
Is this what it's going to be like?

791
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,600
One day of having everything you want

792
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,540
and by the end of the day, you've had enough.

793
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,040
You're bored.

794
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,340
You're ready for...

795
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,700
You're ready for bed.

796
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,260
You don't know what you're going to do the next day.

797
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,200
You've had everything.

798
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,200
Reverend, excuse me.

799
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,660
The queen of the Nubians would like to do you again.

800
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,020
I'm just...

801
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,640
I don't care.

802
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,440
I don't really go on hearing your lies.

803
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,860
Let me just listen.

804
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,760
Leave me alone.

805
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,920
Go away.

806
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,320
Drone.

807
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,440
Clone.

808
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,400
The stage is bare.

809
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,440
Not Sergio?

810
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,780
No, just go away.

811
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,060
Shut the planet down.

812
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,300
Shut off the sun.

813
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,360
That's your pleasure, Reverend.

814
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,820
I'm going to go.

815
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,320
Close down all the malls.

816
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,260
Tell the hookers to go home.

817
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,320
Or we're back to the factory, wherever they're made.

818
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,640
If only Elvis would come back.

819
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,680
Hey, Reverend, baby.

820
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,380
Hey, I have a head of this.

821
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,520
You'll love it, man.

822
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,000
Oh.

823
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,020
Oh, thanks, Elvis.

824
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,500
Maybe that'll make me feel better.

825
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,260
Go.

826
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,280
Oh, my God.

827
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,740
Oh.

828
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,900
Oh.

829
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:54,800


830
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,440
Oh.

831
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,300
We'll see you next time.

832
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,200
Bye.

833
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,680
Bye.

834
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,640
Bye.

835
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,680
Bye.

836
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,180
Bye.

837
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,220
Bye.

838
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,800
Bye.

839
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,080
Bye.

840
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,380
Bye.

841
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,640
Bye.

842
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,240
Bye.

843
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,060
Bye.

844
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,560
Bye.

845
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,480
Bye.

846
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,760
Bye.

847
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,700
Bye.

848
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,020
Bye.

849
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,240
Bye.

850
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,260


851
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,420
Bye.

852
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:49,900
violence to run rampant in our streets. What are we going to do about it?

853
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,060
I don't go looking in a garbage can for fresh food.

854
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,060
All right? And when you're looking in something that's essentially a garbage can and you're

855
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:09,780
trying to pick out the applicable positive morsels, it's futile. Futile.

856
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,100
I will be there. You be there and expect the unexpected. This is Bob.

857
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,920
I believe we should pray that any vehicles transporting illegal drugs and attempting

858
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:36,060
to enter our neighborhoods shall simply quit running or that they shall be detoured in some

859
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,860
way so that they cannot enter our neighborhoods.

860
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,060
or that they shall meet with some accident along the way,

861
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,240
and that the drugs shall be completely destroyed in this accident.

862
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:54,740
At the same time, we should pray that no innocent person shall be hurt in these accidents.

863
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,740
God is able to protect the lives of people,

864
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:05,360
while at the same time allowing the drugs and the vehicles transporting them to be totally destroyed.

865
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:14,120
One way or another, let's agree that all such vehicles shall be prevented from entering our neighborhoods.

866
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,840
After we have prayed for our own neighborhood, where we have the greatest authority,

867
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,020
then pray similarly concerning any vehicle entering the city,

868
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,840
or any vessel entering the port of Philadelphia, or Camden, or Wilmington,

869
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,620
or any planes heading toward our airports.

870
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,980
Then let us pray for our country, that the same thing may happen to any vessel or vehicle

871
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,340
that is entering our neighborhoods.

872
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,360
This is why I don't understand why the Christians hate us so much.

873
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,820
I believe the great Dr. Legume once said,

874
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,760
there's not that much difference between the Christians and the subgenius.

875
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,980
They have a savior that they nail to a stick, and we have a savior we beat with a stick.

876
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,340
It's all the same, and I think I could bring up now short-duration personal saviors.

877
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,340
Once you have a savior, you have a savior that you beat with a stick.

878
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,800
Once you make Bob your personal savior, you realize that you don't need Bob as your personal savior.

879
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,580
What you really need is a short-duration personal savior.

880
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,960
We push this in the Church of the Subgenius.

881
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,840
Really, anything can be your savior.

882
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,040
Any of your favorite bands, or rock stars, or Blade of Grass.

883
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,020
Your cat could be your personal savior.

884
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,220
Because really, in this fast-paced, hectic world, that's what we really need, isn't it?

885
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,340
A short-duration personal savior.

886
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,820
It could be Zeus. It could be Jesus.

887
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,440
It could be Buddha.

888
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,340
Whatever you want.

889
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,020
For this week.

890
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,820
Next week, pick another one.

891
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,300
But really, in your heart, you know that you love Bob.

892
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,940
S. Send your $30 to Bob.

893
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,780
L. Launch the head.

894
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,920
A. Acknowledge your superiority.

895
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,560
C. The conspiracy.

896
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,280
K. Kill Bob.

897
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,700
S-L-A-C-K.

898
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,180
Slack.

899
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,560
And this is what you need in your life.

900
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,000
Point number three.

901
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:16,260
Call down blindness and confusion on the smugglers and pushers,

902
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,760
so that they will not be able to find the drugs to sell.

903
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,120
In Acts we read,

904
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,980
Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit,

905
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,620
looked straight at Elimas the sorcerer and said,

906
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,800
You are a child of the devil, and an enemy of God.

907
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:34,800


908
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:42,580
You know, the faith of God is

909
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,340
If Jesus Christ

910
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,680
was a man

911
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,360
as he put the son of case

912
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:58,360
Hey of God in the oil

913
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,440
And he sent the plan

914
00:42:59,440 --> 00:42:59,440


915
00:42:59,540 --> 00:42:59,880
he had not told you

916
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,060
how come he doesn't know

917
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,740
all the truths

918
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,040
All the subject

919
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,780
And all this

920
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:11,280
their heads instead. God sent confusion into the camps of Israel's enemies and caused them to kill

921
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,820
each other. Let's pray that the smugglers may become so confused that they will not remember

922
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,920
where they hid the drugs which they are attempting to smuggle into our neighborhoods, our city, and

923
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,060
our country. Most Christians should be able to agree with us on that. Do not attempt to pray for

924
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:33,840
anything with which you cannot agree. Some Christians would rather pray for the salvation

925
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:42,160
of the smugglers and pushers. Fine. By all means, pray that God will send laborers across their path,

926
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:48,640
someone to whom they will listen, and pray that the Holy Spirit will move upon their hearts.

927
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:33,820
The main thing we are trying to achieve here is to prevent the smugglers and pushers from finding the drugs to sell. We want to put them out of business, and in the name of Jesus, we can do it.

928
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:33,820


929
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,240
Amen.

930
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,960
Point number four, which the Lord gave us.

931
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:51,080
Ask the angels to hide the drugs that are already in your neighborhood, your city, and your country, so that the dealers and pushers cannot locate them.

932
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,680
What would the angels do without us?

933
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,200
Ask the angels to hide their drugs.

934
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,060
Ask the angels to hide their drugs.

935
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,800
Pray that God will drag this down.

936
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:30,800


937
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,720
Pray that the G Color would bring about a new generation of have woken up today.

938
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:33,720


939
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:33,720


940
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:33,720


941
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,340
Thanks.

942
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:02,740
Thank you very much children, and now, my compatriot, my companion, traveling partner,

943
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:09,180
and colleague, Reverend Steve Slack would like to express himself to you.

944
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,820
What happened to me?

945
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,240
I think the Holy Spirit just spoke to me.

946
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,680
What do you mean by that?

947
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,720
The Holy Spirit...

948
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:52,720
I haven't had this happen in many, many years, ever since I was suckered by a Christian cult.

949
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,580
And this time the Holy Spirit had a different thing to say to me.

950
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,640
He said that the money changers are...

951
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,460
They're back in the temple.

952
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,840
We must chase them out.

953
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,900
These people who call themselves Christians, who praise the name of the Lord and supplicate for him,

954
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:18,720
like Tony, useless little fanboys, they tag along behind the Lord like a pesky kid brother who he can't shake off,

955
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:24,040
trying to impress the Lord, they commit acts of cruelty in his name and call it piousness.

956
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,480
They make him look pretty damn lame and silly.

957
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,420
They don't even know his name, the Lord.

958
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,280
Don't even know what it is.

959
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:32,720
Don't even know what it is.

960
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,560
Don't even know what to call him.

961
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,820
Jehovah One is what we call him, but that's just one...

962
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,960
That's just the god of the local galaxy parish.

963
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,380
They use his name to scour the planet of passion and imagination,

964
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,500
and in its stead they place conformity and sterility and an unferal and diminished cloning of ideas.

965
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,020
And these behaviors are increasing exponentially,

966
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,760
and the planet will consume itself and mankind will cease to be anything but a mass of robots,

967
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,780
and all timid and in one accord, and punishing those who break from their herd.

968
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,400
And these Christians, or so they call themselves, these zombies, these sons of snakes,

969
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,540
these plastic little robots are ruining everything!

970
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:27,100
They're claiming the creators of ideas, real ideas, they're claiming them as their pasties and their fall guys.

971
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,740
Now, when Jesus Shanghai Shuka Gruber got him nailed to that rock,

972
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,980
he didn't know how much of a big deal those funny guys meant, or what Mark would have meant of it.

973
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,920
You know, Christ was so tired of those twelve toadies that the, you know,

974
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,820
they couldn't even tell a joke right, let alone get a story straight!

975
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,600
I don't even know how to tell a joke!

976
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,800
You know, Christ just wanted to, you know, pull some kind of stunt so he could grab Mary Magdalene

977
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,780
and get away to a little love nest in Galilee.

978
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:58,940
Whoo!

979
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,300
Oh yeah!

980
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,720
Oh, the Christians are great!

981
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,440
They're gonna bring a whole new world of love and peace and universal oneness and harmony

982
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,220
that is after we kill off the weirdos with their weirdo ideas!

983
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:18,560
Like, maybe one weirdo idea providing a release valve for repressed glands, drives, and emotions

984
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:24,600
to prevent them from driving its possessor over the brink into some hideously destructive action!

985
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,880
Like, when people come and go and say,

986
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,000
What's wrong with you?

987
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,800
You're weird!

988
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,160
And, and...

989
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,060
You...

990
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,720
You're kind of young and sensitive and...

991
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:45,060
You cry a little bit about it, but after a while, after you get run through the gauntlet of hate,

992
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,480
and all the hate that I have witnessed, the hate that I have experienced, the hate that I have seen,

993
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,580
nowadays when they come up to you,

994
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,600
up to you,

995
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,680
and you're aware in this life,

996
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,460
Thank you!

997
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,280
Whoo!

998
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,700
Thank you for calling me weird!

999
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,560
That is a compliment!

1000
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,580
Whoo! All right? Now,

1001
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:01,720


1002
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:02,760
I take it.

1003
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,400
Aww...

1004
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,480
Normality is everything it's cracked up to be!

1005
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,400
Yeah!

1006
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,480
I... Now,

1007
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,660
my acquaintances,

1008
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,200
several partying buddies, say that's a face of

1009
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,720
Dots!

1010
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,800
Just Dots!

1011
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,240
He's not real.

1012
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,600
They believe what they see on X-Files.

1013
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,440
They... They...

1014
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:39,200
sit over beers and discuss the truly tangible and possible elements of warp travel and matter-energy conversion, but...

1015
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:39,320
Oh!

1016
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,620
Dogs can't possibly be a corporeal being!

1017
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,880
And, you know,

1018
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
so, we really don't ask for much now, in trade for, um,

1019
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,440
what some people might call entertainment.

1020
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,280
Thirty dollars?

1021
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,020
Well,

1022
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,300
I mean, thirty dollars, you can blow thirty dollars on a... on a date!

1023
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,260
Some horrible...

1024
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,220
mismatch that might end in disaster!

1025
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:09,660
Well,

1026
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,420
thirty dollars wasted down the tube.

1027
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,200
Why not spend that on something that's going to last...

1028
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,200
far longer?

1029
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,500
Maybe to the end of your life!

1030
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,860
Well, I mean, if you pay your thirty bucks, you might... life might not end.

1031
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,260
We might keep and continue you all... all your life.

1032
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,700
All the way into some far-off planet, or... or...

1033
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,180
or... or...

1034
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,540
or maybe the end of your life will just be...

1035
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,360
skinning everything from your body except your brain,

1036
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,780
which they'll hook up to a machine and...

1037
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,320
and... and keep you alive so you can...

1038
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,240
feel nothing but pain!

1039
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,320
You think that Bob Dobbs cares about money?

1040
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,220
When he sleeps on a mattress stuffed with dollar bills?

1041
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:58,020
He's more interested in the psychic stench from the butt sweat...

1042
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,640
that seeps into your thirty dollars!

1043
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,080
That scent is important!

1044
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,220
That scent is important because...

1045
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,360
they can... they can snuff you out...

1046
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,780
in a room full of people...

1047
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,240
and if they can snuff you out...

1048
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,800
in a room full of people...

1049
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,040
then the Exosaucers can snuff your house out...

1050
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,600
among the whole neighborhood...

1051
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,120
so that your house is still standing when the other ones get torched!

1052
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:26,420
And you'd better be ready to take up the slack that Bob left off in that...

1053
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,000
that secret little mail drawer!

1054
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,900
You'd better be ready, you know why?

1055
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,420
Because he's dead, that's why!

1056
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,300
So we keep bringing him back...

1057
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,420
to kill him again!

1058
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,740
Because that's the whole point, you know?

1059
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,740
If... if... if Bob were around...

1060
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,080
I mean, if Bob were around...

1061
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,960
you'd just take him for granted...

1062
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,840
and when you leave here tonight...

1063
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,020
and you might go tomorrow morning...

1064
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,700
you'll go back to your job and you'll... you'll...

1065
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,020
sit there at your desk looking at the clock...

1066
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,980
and you'll think about...

1067
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,340
what you saw here tonight...

1068
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,380
and you'll think, well, that was nice entertainment...

1069
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,520
and then you'll go on and continue with your job...

1070
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,160
and things will go pretty much back to normal...

1071
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,720
and soon you'll forget about Bob...

1072
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,620
soon you'll forget about what you saw...

1073
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,320
and soon everything you heard here tonight...

1074
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,440
will go out of your mind...

1075
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,900
and you'll come back home...

1076
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,580
and you'll watch your TV...

1077
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:33,920
and you'll get your silly drugs or whatever...

1078
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,240
and you'll forget about Bob...

1079
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,180
and you'll just quietly go back...

1080
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,460
to the life you once knew...

1081
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,200
before you came here tonight.

1082
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,560
Get locked into some empty career...

1083
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,940
for 50 years until you're dead...

1084
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,020
or...

1085
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,340
what's the use of struggling all your life...

1086
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,800
to build something when down there...

1087
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,780
anything can come and take it away...

1088
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,360
like that.

1089
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,320
Nah, you want something more...

1090
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,800
you demand something more...

1091
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,780
but you really don't know what that more is...

1092
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,140
and yet you don't care...

1093
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,580
you still want more...

1094
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,280
and you'd really rather not have to...

1095
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,360
work too hard to get it.

1096
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,200
The only thing you want to be is you...

1097
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,400
and you have no idea who the hell you even is...

1098
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,360
but that's not gonna stop you from at least trying...

1099
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,560
to make something out of your life.

1100
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,720
Gotta be more than just working and saving and slaving away

1101
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,640
like every other frustrated idiot

1102
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,900
hovering over his possessions

1103
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,760
and moaning proudly about his bills.

1104
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,000
And, dear friends, there is indeed more.

1105
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,160
And the answer to your questions is so simple.

1106
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:48,180
If you'll just take up that pen, that pencil,

1107
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,900
and that piece of paper

1108
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,800
and write down the sacred post office box number

1109
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,940
I'm about to give you.

1110
00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:00,240
Because, friends, you can just throw all that baggage away

1111
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,820
and write to Bob.

1112
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,800
And just send Bob a self-addressed stamped envelope if you want.

1113
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,760
Just send that request, that humble request.

1114
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,540
It doesn't even have to be very humble.

1115
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,760
A lot of them aren't.

1116
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,700
Send that to Bob at post office box.

1117
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,220
1-8-1-4-1-7

1118
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,460
Cleveland Heights, Ohio

1119
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,520
4-4-1-1-8

1120
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,160
www.subgenius.com

1121
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,620
So, we're waiting to hear from you.

1122
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,980
Oh, and what we've been listening to,

1123
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,140
well, a little bit of thought alchemy there at the very end.

1124
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,780
Before that, the long rant was, of course,

1125
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,640
by Reverend Steve Slack,

1126
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,040
recorded at the Columbus, the Bible,

1127
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,020
a couple of weeks ago

1128
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,700
at Stash's Club.

1129
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,380
And Dr. Dinosaur with Steve Slack and Princess Wiardo

1130
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,120
doing a version of For What It's Worth.

1131
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:05,120
The war on drugs tape was sent by Dr. Katadn Leyoum.

1132
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,140
And we heard a little clip of music

1133
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,540
from a band called Ewing Oil.

1134
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,980
Used to be called Chewing Foil.

1135
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,900
Earlier on in there,

1136
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,800
yes, yes, yes, friends.

1137
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:23,220
So, and so we leave you, sort of,

1138
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,940
for in a few minutes here.

1139
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,340
We'll see what comes up next.

1140
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,960
Apprise that man, Bob.

1141
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,720
Or, or kill me.

1142
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,560
Or kill me.

1143
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,040
Believers, let us all agree

1144
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,640
and ask our angels to frustrate the dealers and pushers

1145
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,940
by hiding the drugs which are already in our neighborhood,

1146
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:47,960
our city,

1147
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,660
and our country.

1148
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,700
They can hide them so well

1149
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,040
that the dealers and pushers

1150
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,980
will never be able to find them again.

1151
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,120
You may either pray to our Heavenly Father,

1152
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,540
asking Him to send the angels on this assignment,

1153
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,100
or you may command them directly,

1154
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,680
speaking the faith command in the name of Jesus.

1155
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:07,580
Hmm?

1156
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,740
Yeah, it's evil to have glands,

1157
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,880
drives, emotions,

1158
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,220
say the Christians.

1159
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,140
You want to corral them in a pen?

1160
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:17,940
No.

1161
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,100
Until they boil over into doing something stupid,

1162
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,280
like driving your car into a tree.

1163
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,260
Whoo!

1164
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,300
You think that life or a church is a spectator sport?

1165
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,760
You think this is TV?

1166
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,380
You think that you can just sit back here and watch this,

1167
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,380
like, you know, for some TV?

1168
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,440
You're just going to sit there?

1169
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,100
Stare at us like this?

1170
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,960
Friend, if you want that kind of church,

1171
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,360
the kind where you can sit on your butt

1172
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,820
and do nothing but listen to some preacher drone,

1173
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,740
and smile and shake hands,

1174
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,120
and...

1175
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,720
Well, you know, next Sunday,

1176
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,340
you know, any old church around here

1177
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,240
will serve your purposes.

1178
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,980
And, uh, you got faith?

1179
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,820
You got faith?

1180
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,440
Mm-hmm.

1181
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,480
They talk about faith,

1182
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,380
like you've got faith that your college degree

1183
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,660
will get you some kind of job that's lucrative enough

1184
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,660
to pay off your loans,

1185
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,580
or you've got faith that some significant other

1186
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,580
will be around forever.

1187
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,800
You've got faith that Social Security will be there

1188
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,480
and you won't run out by the time you retire,

1189
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,840
if you even have faith that your job will last that long.

1190
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,020
So, really, is it such a stretch

1191
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,180
to have some kind of faith

1192
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,120
in a duck-faced, pipe-smoking dumbass

1193
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,540
that just might be the thing

1194
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,500
that will save you?

1195
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,820
Think about it.

1196
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,760
Think about it.

1197
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,400
And help out the mission,

1198
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,740
the continuing, nameless mission,

1199
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,760
that we have here tonight.

1200
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,620
And we hope that you will

1201
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,180
give something of yourself to us

1202
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,520
and take something back with you.

1203
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,080
And tell all your friends

1204
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,720
that there's just a little bit,

1205
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,400
something more,

1206
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,960
than the narcosis

1207
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,540
that the conspiracy is compelling you to accept.

1208
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,660
Thank you.

1209
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,180
Whoo!

1210
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,180
Whoo!

1211
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,420
Whoo!

1212
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,320
Whoo!

1213
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,260
Whoo!

1214
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,680
Whoo!

1215
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,060
They play around with words.

1216
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,020
Don't you see how the cults just play around with words?

1217
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,780
It sounds good, warm, fuzzy, forgiveness, love, acceptance...

1218
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,900
But it's all lies.

1219
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,840
Hey, when you're getting a book dictated by demons,

1220
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,440
what do you expect?
