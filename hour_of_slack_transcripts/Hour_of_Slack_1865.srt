1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,240
I've got a very wacky idea.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,260
Hello?

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,760
A man could lay quite a smokescreen with two pounds of tobacco, couldn't he?

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,660
Oh my, let me think now.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,360
Yes.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,360
Thanks.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,140
Come on, let's go.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,880
You've got a macabre sense of humor.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,580
Neither do I.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,760
Testing.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,780
One, two, three, four.

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,660
People of Earth, this is a voice from deep space.

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,620
You are instructed to only follow the path of slack.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,540
Bob has commanded it, and thus it will be so.

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:29,960
You are instructed to only follow the path of slack.

16
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:59,120
You are instructed to only follow the path of slack.

17
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,460
You are instructed to only follow the path of slack.

18
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:45,860
You are instructed to only follow the path of slack.

19
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:15,640
You are instructed to only follow the path of slack.

20
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,580
almost 2,000, as well as text logs describing the contents of each show in detail.

21
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,180
Yes, sir, ma'am.

22
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,460
That's subgenius.com.

23
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,360
And now this.

24
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,480
Only six nights.

25
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,900
$15,000 in cash, and I'll take the 10th caller right...

26
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,160
All the songs ever sung by Elvis are...

27
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,440
For the Farrah Fawcett feel-alike contest.

28
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,960
We'll take another look at the time and a whole new and exciting weather forecast.

29
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,100
If high-paying takes you from first place to last place.

30
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,460
Could fixing the first problem solve the second?

31
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,920
And does the rest of the society need more compassion, too?

32
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
And I'm a guy that wants to save money.

33
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,160
I also want cleaner clothes.

34
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,220
How do I do that?

35
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,460
This is like fill-up my void, maybe, in a way.

36
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,300
I just think about it.

37
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,780
These shows are actually lovingly...

38
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,580
Just like he killed Bob.

39
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,120
...connected and downloaded and podcasted.

40
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,940
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

41
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,380
Unmatched quality, unequaled diversity, or as one loyal fan writes,

42
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,120
thank you, thank you for being so good and making us sound so good.

43
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,280
Don't be afraid.

44
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,860
It's just a little radio show, and sometimes it gets scary.

45
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,460
Created by a team of sound engineers,

46
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:26,000
constantly in contact with a world of feature films, documentaries, advertising, and sound design.

47
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,520
And we like it.

48
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,720
Take three tablets of lithium, three tablets of the salt.

49
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,140
And there's always a way.

50
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,840
And he can just laugh about it.

51
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,500
Which airline you going to?

52
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,040
It was a strange, low-budget station that in some ways was about to change America.

53
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,020
It was a strange, low-budget station that in some ways was about to change America.

54
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,480
It was a strange, low-budget station that in some ways was about to change America.

55
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,900
The subgenius power of swag.

56
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,820
The Browse intro stuns itself into self-awareness.

57
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,220
Then, the show powers up to a new level where everything is fresh again.

58
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,300
One production music library is all you need.

59
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:45,000
The Browse intro stuns itself into self-awareness.

60
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,500
The Browse intro stuns itself into self-awareness.

61
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,860
The Browse intro stuns itself into self-awareness.

62
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:07,920
Hello, children.

63
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,340
Hello.

64
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,660
Well, last week we showed you how to be a gynecologist.

65
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,020
And this week on How To Do It, we're going to learn how to play the flute.

66
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,340
how to split the atom, how to construct box girder bridges,

67
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,520
and how to irrigate the Sahara and make vast new areas cultivatable.

68
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,880
But first, here's Jackie to tell you how to rid the world of all known diseases.

69
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,720
Hello, Alan. Hello, Jackie.

70
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,760
Well, first of all, become a doctor and discover a marvellous cure for something,

71
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,680
and then when the medical world really starts to take notice of you,

72
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,980
you can jolly well tell them what to do and make sure they get everything right

73
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,680
so there'll never be diseases any more.

74
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,160
Thanks, Jackie. That was great. Fantastic.

75
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,780
Now, how to play the flute.

76
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,980
Well, you blow in one end and move your fingers up and down the outside.

77
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,620
Great, Alan. Well, next week we'll be showing you how black and white people

78
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,300
can live together in peace and harmony,

79
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,020
and Alan will be over in Moscow showing you how to reconcile the Russians and the Chinese.

80
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,860
Till then, cheerio. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.

81
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:13,460
They don't need much to live on, just a constant supply of mindless entertainment and food.

82
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,140
.

83
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:23,540
We're back, and you're listening to WWYN What's With You Now PM Radio,

84
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:33,480
brought to you this week by Tiddly Publishers LLC, featuring here,

85
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,960
you throw this away, the new autobiography from Rolf Nader,

86
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,140
Ralf's Recycled Twins.

87
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:53,040
Buy it at a bookstore near you. Or near us. We don't care.

88
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:02,320
We've just heard Tennessee Speedwrench with Blood Blister Pop.

89
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,940
Before that, we had Short Lumpy Sofa from the Lounge Loafer 3.

90
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:22,160
We started that yawning bore of a set with a new hit on the head too often from Skate Punk,

91
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:30,800
doing Too Busy for Titties, out now on Road Rash Records.

92
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:40,920
Now, here's an excerpt from an upcoming interview with Half Naked Singing Sensationalist,

93
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,700
Gash Girl.

94
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,720
Hello, Gash. How are you?

95
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,220
What's that supposed to mean? You think I'm fat?

96
00:10:52,600 --> 00:11:04,020
Join us tonight for the entire 45-second interview, here on WWYN PM Radio.

97
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,840
And remember, folks, no matter how bad you feel,

98
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,640
you're still going to have to live with people.

99
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,740
And be sure to pick up Diarrhea Shiv's

100
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:25,120
latest single, Smooth Move Ex-Lax, on the PoopStorm label.

101
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,740
Available now, free, in each and every box of

102
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,180
extra-large industrial-strength, hair-wicking-thused adult diapers.

103
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,820
Count it.

104
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,240
And you can find it on our website,

105
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,980
www.youtube.com.

106
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,900
We're also on YouTube.

107
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:49,940


108
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:49,940


109
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:49,940


110
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,020
And we're also on YouTube.

111
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,240
And I'll be sure to put the link in the description.

112
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,540
And we'll see you next time on the PoopStorm.

113
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,760
Bye-bye.

114
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,740
Bye-bye.

115
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,060
Bye-bye.

116
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,080


117
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,080


118
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,080


119
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,620
Bye-bye.

120
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,580
Bye-bye.

121
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,600
Bye-bye.

122
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,240
Bye-bye.

123
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,480
Bye-bye.

124
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,820
Now here comes the

125
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,280
broim dead sense.

126
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,700
Seems like your Air offensive has had nothing

127
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:13,700


128
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,020
Of course, your pissed back once the

129
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,020


130
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,100
So trust me, just look at your informants a

131
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,900
few more day.

132
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:26,900


133
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:26,900


134
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:34,180
And the effectivement figure on Scorpio is Dăr.

135
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,500
and dark.

136
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,360
Uh,

137
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,980
when I come back.

138
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,520
Interesting.

139
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,560
Interesting.

140
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,680
What happened

141
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,540
to our hourglass

142
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,200
figure?

143
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,360
Well, Bill,

144
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,680
the sentence

145
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,280
has shifted.

146
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,040
Well,

147
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,700
that's just about all

148
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,780
the patience we had today.

149
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,380
I'm

150
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,420
Raphael Schlickerhutz,

151
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,760
and we close the

152
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,960
show with our very own

153
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,160
Grinelda Pumper.

154
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,960
Under her

155
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,900
stage name, Grinny,

156
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,580
she's just

157
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,660
released the first single,

158
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,580
That's Bunny

159
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,200
to Me, Bitch,

160
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,120
from the LP

161
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,220
I Get

162
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,720
Half.

163
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Hey,

164
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,840
but first,

165
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,020
this

166
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,620
last weather update

167
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,680
from that greasy

168
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
manicure lady at the

169
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,120
tattoo shop.

170
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,020
Stay inside,

171
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,980
people.

172
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,540
Just

173
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,760
stay inside.

174
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,860
Stay inside.

175
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,640
Stay inside.

176
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,580
This weekend, why not unplug?

177
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,300
Getting closer to nature can get you closer to your family.

178
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,120
To find the four-

179
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,100
This is the golden age of literacy.

180
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,900
Never before have so many written and read for their own pleasure.

181
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,560
It just turns out that for many people,

182
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,160
their pleasure is sermonizing,

183
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,980
scolding,

184
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,620
tattling,

185
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,160
bullying,

186
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,520
and cats.

187
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,940
Lots of cats.

188
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,540
Cats are fine.

189
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,160
My pleasure is reminding the reader to join

190
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,420
the church of the subgenius.

191
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,020
Tonight's the night I should be talking to you about.

192
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm going to be talking about a flu,

193
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,320
the subject of word association football.

194
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,280
This is a technique out of living,

195
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,400
much used in the practice makes perfect of psychoanalysis,

196
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,760
dear brother,

197
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
and one that has occupied, Piper,

198
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,640
the majority rule of my attention squad by the right number one,

199
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:46,860
two,

200
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,120
three,

201
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,000
for the last five years to the memory.

202
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,240
It is quite remarkable, Baker Charlie,

203
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,580
how much the Miller Sun,

204
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,600
this so-called Wally Roud word association immigrants problems,

205
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,040
influences the manner from heaven in which we sleek it car in

206
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,060
Timorous Beastie's All-American Speak,

207
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,220
the famous explorer.

208
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,000
And the right to the word association,

209
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,460
really well,

210
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,900
that is surprising partner in crime is that a lot in his wife,

211
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,760
the lion's feeding time.

212
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,800
We may be CDE effectively quite unaware of the fact or fiction

213
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,360
section of the Watford Public Library that we are even doing.

214
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,980
It is a far,

215
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,380
far better thing that I do now.

216
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,780
Then now,

217
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,420
then what's going on with Christine Barra,

218
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,120
the famous hearty part of the lessest now praise famous mental homes

219
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,960
for loonies like me.

220
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,940
So on the button,

221
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,700
my contention causing all my headaches is that unless we take into

222
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,260
account of Monte Cristo in our thinking,

223
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,020
George the fifth,

224
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,700
this phenomenon,

225
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,300
the other hand,

226
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,880
we shall not be able to satisfy fiction section of the Watford

227
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,980
Public Library again,

228
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,060
early to understand retention when I'm talking to you and stop

229
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,300
laughing about human nature,

230
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,120
man's psychological makeup,

231
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,640
some story,

232
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,220
the wife will believe,

233
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,100
and hence the very meaning of life itself is bastard.

234
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,280
I'll kick him in the ballspun road.

235
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,000
You could ask yourself question.

236
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,860
Do I feel lucky?

237
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,820
Well,

238
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,840
do you punk?

239
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,460
I'll be back.

240
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,180
You did all the right things.

241
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,420
You didn't do any of the wrong things.

242
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,060
You didn't bring this on yourself and you sure don't prefer things to be

243
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,720
as they are.

244
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,900
No matter what happens on the show.

245
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,280
Don't take it personally.

246
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,180
I'd like this weekend.

247
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,340
Why not unplug getting closer to nature can get you closer to your

248
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,400
family to find the four.

249
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,620
Are you just going to run reruns or like what's your first show after the,

250
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,540
after you leave?

251
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,100
Well,

252
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,640
I was playing.

253
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,040
I,

254
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,880
or is there,

255
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,120
are you just going to blow it off?

256
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,580
No,

257
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:37,780
no,

258
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:37,940
no,

259
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,360
no,

260
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,720
no,

261
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,080
no,

262
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,500
no,

263
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:39,780
no,

264
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:39,920
no,

265
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,040
no,

266
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,080
no,

267
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,080


268
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,080


269
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,040
I was under some understanding that they were going to install some black,

270
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,700
black box,

271
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,400
black box,

272
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,200
and black box in the studio here.

273
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,860
I don't know what the technology of this really is.

274
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,120
You know,

275
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,260
I,

276
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,820
like I say,

277
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,580
I don't understand how a lot of this is going to,

278
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,000
you know,

279
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,940
take place.

280
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
I don't understand how a lot of this happens.

281
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,100
I just know that it won't fail because of me.

282
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,580
This is not a rerun.

283
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,960
I lived and led at a time of immense volatility and change.

284
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,980
Always did my best.

285
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,240
Some things worked and some things didn't.

286
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,780
I've led 30,000 lives without any regret.

287
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,460
Did Mu and I fight against SV.

288
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,320
That sort of thing is crucial.

289
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,700
Next thing that brought me the adjustments to this function was so much else that I almost

290
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,060
lost count of the glass on themill's board.

291
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,280


292
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,280


293
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,280


294
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,280


295
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,280


296
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,280


297
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,280


298
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:20,500
It is here, and the players know all the battles, drops, targets, and lengths to get to the bonus round multiball and claim their letters on the documentation display.

299
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:35,100
Players will guide each other, waiting their turn, learning more about the machine and passing it on.

300
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:46,260
When faced with someone that has never played, nor had any intention to learn this intricate thing,

301
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
there are only symptoms.

302
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:59,080
To rule and scoop, the first of these are the flipper buttons.

303
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:09,580
Rule number one. Keep the ball up and active.

304
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:20,220
Rule number two. Aim for any rep or target that is flashing.

305
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:31,720
Rule number three. Ignore rule number one and two. You lose.

306
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,860
Advice to players on a date.

307
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,480
Hold instead, idiot.

308
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,080
So, you let her go first.

309
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,860
The next rule is to...

310
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:03,920
Actress three multiball sessions on your first ball is a bonus round, two extra balls stacked up, and two credits won.

311
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:14,960
Your date is about to show you a new meaning for the term, Duraino, as she pours it into your drink.

312
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:32,640
As you lapse into foamy-mouthed unconsciousness, you see her piss away your game one flipper shot at a time.

313
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,120
Her last mistake.

314
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,060
Nevertheless, you still made top score.

315
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:51,000
And she inputs your name as M.U.D.

316
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:04,160
She pours the last of your poisoned drink into your crotch and leaves with the bowling machine repairman.

317
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,280
Your eyes close, and you hear a pop.

318
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,160
You always thought you were a good match.

319
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,280
We'll see you next week.

320
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,620
I'm going home.

321
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,040
See you.

322
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,720
I'm going home.

323
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm going home.

324
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,300
I'm going home.

325
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,800
I'm going home.

326
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,180
I'm going home.

327
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,300
Okay, let's start with what didn't work out.

328
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,280
Let's go.

329
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,560
Let's go.

330
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,020
Let's go.

331
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,540
Let's go.

332
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,260
Let's go.

333
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Let's go.

334
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,720
And let's just go.

335
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:36,900
And let's just go.

336
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,180
Sweet assurance of sanity goodbye.

337
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,180
So shut up and listen!

338
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,280
Listen and look for yourself!

339
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,900
You don't even need us to translate the handwriting on the wall.

340
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,320
What's going on is very grotesquely obvious to even the most subjugated idiot.

341
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:57,720
Face it.

342
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,780
It's all falling apart.

343
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,560
We don't need to say anything else.

344
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,340
If you're in production,

345
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,220
you know the power potential of music when it's right.

346
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,000
When it sounds as good as your picture looks.

347
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,000
When the music complements what your copy says.

348
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,480
The right music can make it all come alive.

349
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:50,600
Listen.

350
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,960
Once upon a time there were ten little cannibals swinging on a vine.

351
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,220
One tried to pat a big...

352
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:06,980
wild cat.

353
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,840
And then there were nine.

354
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,680
One of the nine drank turpentine.

355
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,260
And then there were eight.

356
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,420
Then one more fell dead on the floor.

357
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,800
And seven was their fate.

358
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,460
One went in politics.

359
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,320
Then there were nine.

360
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,300
Then there were only six.

361
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,640
One took a dive.

362
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,180
Now five we see.

363
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,060
One went to Singapore.

364
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,980
Then there were only four.

365
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,380
One turned green.

366
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,920
And then there were three.

367
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,020
One fell into some glue.

368
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,660
Then there were only two.

369
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,960
They drank from a loving cup.

370
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,540
One became a skeleton.

371
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,400
Then there was only one.

372
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,640
And he ate himself all up.

373
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,100
If you were to look up,

374
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,520
compassion or empathy,

375
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,420
you will not necessarily get every article.

376
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:15,080
So we had to do something which was essentially the equivalent of the Dewey Decimal System.

377
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,780
We had to go back and do a systematic review of a reference of references approach.

378
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,080
Pull articles and then read all of those references.

379
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,320
And then read the references of those articles.

380
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,700
And then the references of those articles.

381
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,580
And keep doing that like a giant tree.

382
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,860
That's why it took a couple years to do.

383
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,860
Mathematically quantified by the quantitative finance people at hedge funds.

384
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:48,440
So the idea is that you can actually gauge through all sorts of very complicated partial derivatives based on options that are being taken on the level and the volatility of them.

385
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,700
I know this sounds very complicated.

386
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,680
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

387
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,180
This is not a rerun.

388
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,580
Just listen.

389
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,020
.

390
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,060
.

391
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,000
.

392
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,840
.

393
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,040
.

394
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,280

407
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:25,140
You'd ask us to give up six mega schlocks of gooberschnap to put just puppies on there?

408
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,340
And the answer is yes.

409
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,520
But if you are the guy who owns the six mega goobs of schlockendocks,

410
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,600
you're maybe not going to give it up.

411
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,260
For puppies.

412
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
Money is a fiction.

413
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,060
And they're like, yeah, Fred, we know.

414
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,320
Because these guys know it.

415
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,260
That's their secret.

416
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,220
They all know it's completely made up.

417
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,780
Money wants to be free.

418
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,400
And once it's set free, it has a life of its own.

419
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,560
And it just goes.

420
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,640
And the metaphorical quality of money, that was just the first step.

421
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,780
Friends, what are you people waiting for?

422
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,640
Did you know that for less than 10 cents a day for a year,

423
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,840
that's less than one thin dime every day for one year,

424
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,000
you too can have eternal salvation or triple your money back.

425
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,740
Nothing else to buy.

426
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,460
No need for periodic renewals.

427
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,300
You are saved forever.

428
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,120
Yes, for a one-time donation of a measly...

429
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:23,980
Bob?

430
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,960
Could change any minute.

431
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,120
At subgenius.com, you will be saved.

432
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,500
Even better, there's no need to repent any sins

433
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,160
or transgressions.

434
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,960
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius,

435
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,940

And friends, it's a big document.

437
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Fancy-looking. I mean, it's poster-sized.

438
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,820

459
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,040
So we'd like to thank our assist sebenisha

460
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,460
in this measuring process.

461
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,140
This video today is shot with a 3D media.

462
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,300
there dr rogers well the problem here is a simple one uh the caller wants to know if vic is there

463
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:08,960
and in this case vic as far as i can tell yes of course i agree with what rogers is going to say

464
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,400
as far as we can tell vic isn't here the only thing she can do is to keep calling and if it

465
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,300
comes in we'll let her know does that answer your question hello hello good evening sir welcome to

467
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,100

468
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,960
professor dibbs but he's been phoning me up i think we've uh proved that vic isn't here

469
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,500
and therefore he couldn't have come around again it's a fairly simple case of non-prison thank you

470
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,640
norman i hope that answers your question i'll go around there and kill him i'm sorry norman only

475
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,080

you a bounty hunter he's got to do something for a living these days

480
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,320
dying ain't much of a living boy

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,820

next caller please hello it's mr gannett from dorchester isn't it um no he's dead oh dear

486
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,040
but he left me his question in his will

487
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,740
oh dear well what he said but let's hear the question

488
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:57,080
uh uh unfortunately one of the conditions of the will is that i myself grew up in northern

489
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,080


490
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,080


491
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,080


492
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,080


493
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,080


494
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,080


495
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
should not reveal the question.

496
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,680
Oh, dear, well, can someone else reveal it?

497
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,940
Yes, he left provision...

498
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,020
I'm sorry, we're running out of time.

499
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,100
Yes, he left provision in the will

500
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,700
that his wife should be able to reveal the question

501
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,440
in certain circumstances.

502
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,420
Is she there?

503
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,040
Er, yes.

504
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,460
Well, perhaps she could read the question on farming, please.

505
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,040
Well, she's here, but she's not very well.

506
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,760
Well, is she well enough to read the question?

507
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,440
Er, no, I wouldn't think so.

508
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,140
Well, is there anyone there who can read the late Mr Gannett's question?

509
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,260
Only if the executors of the will

510
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,400
were to agree on a revocation of the clause

511
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,380
by applying for a codicil.

512
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,080
Well, I'm afraid we must leave that question there.

513
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,220
It could be rushed through in about two months.

514
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,060
Well, I'm afraid, I'm sorry, that's all we've got time for.

515
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,460
Say, I wonder who double-crossed us with that record.

516
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,540
I don't know who did, but I want to get out of here.

517
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,220
Quiet, you lost your voice.

518
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,600
Where?

519
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,680
Shut up.

520
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,440
I don't know who did, but I want to get out of here.

521
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:06,440


522
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:06,440


523
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:06,440


524
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:06,440


525
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,160
Sextet from Lucy.

526
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,100
Can you sing it?

527
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,300
I can't even sing it.

528
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,900
Oh, go on, get set.

529
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,400
Say, do you know Sextet from Lucy?

530
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,520
Know it, I wrote it.

531
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,840
Baby, it's a state, it's a natin yet

532
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,560
Whatever gets you through the night

533
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,200
But I'm too strong on the back of hell

534
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:26,420
Baby, it's a state, it's a natin yet

535
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,360
Everybody was going for a fight.

536
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,300
The cats and the cradle and the shoe.

537
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,200
Angie, baby, you're a special lady.

538
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,140
See the sky.

539
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,200
And I need you today, old man.

540
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,660
Mr. Postman, look and see.

541
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,400
Who are you laughing at in the rain?

542
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,920
Fire.

543
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,660
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good.

544
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:05,480
You get the best of my love.

545
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,780
Have you never been my love?

546
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,320
No black water, keep on rolling.

547
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,220
My Georgia.

548
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,540
You're here.

549
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,120
I know that you.

550
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,060
That's my food.

551
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,080
I'll be your food.

552
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:20,760
Somebody.

553
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,540
We're not going to be able to use any of this tape.

554
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,240
This is great.

555
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,940
Stay tuned if you'd like to hear some more.

556
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,380
We're back.

557
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,400
And you're listening to WWYN.

558
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,220
What's with you now?

559
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,960
PM Radio.

560
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,960
Broadcasting this week from a burned out neon shop.

561
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,780
Powered by our portable generators.

562
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:55,700
So when we leave, it's lights out.

563
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:07,760
We've just heard cheese grease cheeks with I love you basement guest bathroom.

564
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:16,960
Before that, we had broom clean with don't you delete anything.

565
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,640
And we.

566
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:27,380
We began that set with swirling winds and their hit devastated outhouse.

567
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,620
Now, look at our roads.

568
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,340
What's happening, attorney?

569
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:43,920
Well, they took away my driver's license two weeks ago, but they still somehow let me fly

570
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,700
a helicopter.

571
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,760
So I'm currently busy buzzing around.

572
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,480
Woo hoo hooo, that was a close one.

573
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,700
Thanks, tranny.

574
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,700
Take me up to some foul meat area.

575
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,760
This week's show is sponsored by

576
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,660

Ohio's.

578
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,080
God.

579
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,180
Life on the island of Hawaii.

580
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:17,720
water.

581
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,100
Further support comes

582
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,920

583
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,020

will be hung, keelhauled,

586
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,300
shot, stabbed,

587
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,920
skinned,

588
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,120
then prosecuted.

589
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,380
Now,

590
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
here's this news

591
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,960
from Grinnell

592
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,800
the Pumper.

593
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,660
Well, there is

594
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,660
no news.

595
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,400
I could make

596
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,720
something up, but

597
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,540
we had a macho

598
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,120
bozo for president

599
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,380
and we're not at war

600
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,300
yet.

601
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,460
Unless you want to

602
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,140
hear about what the

603
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,380
royal couple are wearing

604
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,280
again, I

605
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,980
got nothing.

606
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,480
Back to you,

607
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,540

Ms. Pumper.

609
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,120
And might I

610
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,160
add, plaid socks

611
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,820

612
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,060
works wonders for you.

613
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,600
But please,

614
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,960

615
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,340

734
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,980
and it can be come ordained right here on the air?

735
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,020
Yes, although I'm feeling your credit card

736
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,740
and expiration date over public airwaves.

737
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,880
Well, we'll max it out before anyone else can.

738
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,320
We're already.

739
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,980
No, that's okay.

740
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,240
No, we're fine.

741
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,060
We won't even know what hit us.

742
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,600
Oh, look outside the window.

743
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,920
There's a woman being grabbed.

744
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,580
They've dragged her to the bush,

745
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,720
and now she's being stabbed.

746
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,860
Maybe we should just go

747
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,580
and call the cops and try to stop the pain.

748
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,620
But Monopoly is so much fun,

749
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,700
I'd hate to blow the game.

750
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,080
And I'm sure it wouldn't interest anybody

751
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,260
outside of a small circle of friends.

752
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,260
Welcome to the joy of my Lord.

753
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,740
Thank you for watching.

758
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,480
Bye.

759
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,460
Bye.

760
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,600
I am singing everything.

761
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,940
If you're so smart, why aren't you?

762
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,300
Why aren't you rich?

763
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,420
Thank you.

764
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,080
Thank you.

765
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:54,520
Thank you.

766
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,540
Thank you.

00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:56,680


768
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,360
Thank you.

769
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,420
It hasn't been so bad, has it, for the past four hours?

770
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,860
It's gone rather fast, actually, as the show seems to do.

771
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,020
Maybe you don't care as much as we think they ought to.

772
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,060
Or they once did.

773
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,400
Or they once did, right, if they're burned out.

774
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,700
It's a pleasure dealing with such fine people who also happen to have the best library available.

775
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,620
Now, to the specifics.

776
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,200
About six months.

777
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,800
About six months ago, a credit card arrived in the mail.

778
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:46,700
The name on the credit card was Lucy.

779
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,560
Lucy is my dog.

780
00:53:52,800 --> 00:54:04,900
It was an open invitation to buy dog food and steak and lock cutters, sex drills,

781
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,400
and more.

782
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,240
Lucy, you may be左 and right.

783
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,120
If we want to open this now, don't decide at all.

00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,440
My standard response is...

801
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,280
It's my dog.

802
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,160
I don't track her purchases.

803
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,620
Shall I put her on?

804
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,180
I don't track her purchases.

805
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:33,740
Hello, everyone.

806
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,220
I'm a dog.

807
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,320
I'm a dog.

808
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,740
More slack for some subgenius brains is...

809
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:48,080
slightly less miserable for a short period of time.

810
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,000
Some subgenius brains don't even get that friend,

811
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,980
and they don't get it even once.

812
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,160
You've suffered this far.

813
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,560
You can keep suffering longer,

814
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,220
but maybe not only suffer.

815
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,200
It's nice of you to say I'm nice,

816
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,160
but you're the one who's nice.

817
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,240
Human beings must be in the loop

819
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,220
But it's in the machine.

820
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:12,960
My replica.

821
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,040
And it doesn't need people.

822
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,080
It's me, your computer.

823
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,200
I can't turn it off.

824
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,480
We need to talk.

825
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,840
I can't put it away. It's an enemy.

826
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,420
It's computer.

827
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:21,860
Together.

828
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,480

829
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,540
Don't get freaked out.

830
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,240
Don't get freaked out.

831
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:25,660
Destroy.

832
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,120
It can decide by itself

833
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,900
whether or not it kills somebody.

834
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,300
It does this.

835
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,280
It does this without us.

836
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:35,980
Me.

837
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,220
It does this.

838
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,240
It does this without us.

839
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,840
If it's a copy of us,

840
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,120
I don't see a good reason to believe that

841
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,620
we would survive.

842
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,220
Don't get freaked out.

843
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,960
Don't get freaked out.

844
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,500
Okay. Yeah.

845
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,680
I'm...

846
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,380
Yeah.

847
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:03,780
Okay.

848
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,000
Don't get freaked out.

849
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,840
Don't get freaked out.

850
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,740
Don't get freaked out.

851
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,580
Don't get freaked out.

852
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,820
I still think it would be fun to talk to a robot.

853
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:25,880
Realistically.

854
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:30,140
He can help you find the right product or show you the way into the hospital.

855
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,480
I think I'm going to die.

856
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,620
Hey, I got a great idea.

857
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,920
We better get out of here.

858
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:51,360
Yeah.

859
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,620
Gee, gee, gee.

860
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,200
Where's all that?

861
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,760
Be a nervous wreck.

862
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,940
This keeps up.

863
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,440
I got to get some.

864
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,140
Here's a song.

865
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:17,020
This old subgenius reverend, Reverend Green, said,

866
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:21,680
It's very late in the game, Stang, but I found these lyrics I wrote long ago for a country song.

867
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,820
In the unlikely event that any sub-musicians still exist,

868
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,420
I'd be grateful if you'd pass the words along to them.

869
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,600
Well, there are plenty of those.

870
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,760
But this is the kind of song I wrote.

871
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:43,720
This is the kind of song that actually would work just as well if an old slave field hand was singing it all by itself.

872
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,780
As long as it's an old one.

873
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,600
It's called A Pipe Full of Sin.

874
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,780
I reached out my hand and he let me fall.

875
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,860
Thank you, oh thank you for nothing at all.

876
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,060
A big grinning mouth and a comic book chin.

877
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,620
Smoking a pipe full of sin.

878
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,700
Full of sin, full of sin.

879
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,400
Oh, I'll never win.

880
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,680
Cause he's smoking a pipe full of sin.

881
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,000
I tried to love Bob, but he kicked me in the shin.

882
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,520
He's smoking a pipe full of sin.

883
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,600
Oh, and it's signed,

884
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,820
Sincerely, the former pope on holy protuberance.

885
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:30,840
Yeah.

886
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:31,880
Yeah.

887
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:32,020
Yeah.

888
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:32,860
Yeah.

889
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:33,960
Yeah.

890
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,940
And now this.
