1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
Uh, yes.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,560
So nice to sit in front of this one lonely microphone all by myself.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,320
I wonder what happened to, uh, the good pastor naked.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,480
Let's see, friends.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:23,180
This is not going to be the, uh, tightest hour of slack in the world by subgenius standards,

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,720
which means that you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,700
Uh, we, we have the, the difficulty here with this radio ministry of trying to minister

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,200
both to, uh, old, the old timer subgeniuses here in Dallas as well as try to explain what

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,520
in the name of it, the church of the subgenius really is.

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,220
And, and, uh, I'll actually try to do that a little bit, but like I say, at the same

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,700
time, we have to keep confusing you in order to, uh, to, uh, to, uh, to, uh, to, uh, to,

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,040
to, uh, deliver the, the goods that the old timers really want.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,780
So let's see what happens if I push this button here and I hope it doesn't.

15
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,920
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

16
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese.

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:25,900
I'm sure.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,780
I have brought the message.

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,240
No trouble.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,440
He's recording.

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,280
Everything's going through.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,280
No trouble.

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:46,120
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

24
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,500
Stop right there.

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,540
Intensifying our prospects' desires.

26
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,820
That's when the wheels of action begin to move.

27
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,580
Sorry for jumping in.

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,680
You're welcome,Transport Three center at 10.

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,620
You've going into the 수-

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,800
I-

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,480
ve—

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,120
Those of us understand that the sun's going up toward the North Pole Complex may

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,320
have some issues, but that isn't a formula for measurements glance.

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,400
Thanks for understanding Oscars today.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,700
I'm going to.

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,520
Well, that's it for this edition of The Sixth Bitch in the South Pole.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm 사용 s-

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,680
L plata rinconcs are super pounds, yes or no?

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:25,680


40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:25,680


41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,880
helping to create a nice round world of confusion and misunderstanding.

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,380
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels

43
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,760
and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,540
Then we dip them in the sacred waters of the sludge.

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,700
And what exactly does this do for them?

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned

47
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,120
and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,080
the imprinting of the true subgenius.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,760
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of sludge.

50
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:22,060
The message is now part of the

51
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,960
even registered in your subconscious mind

52
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,920
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,960
That's your key phrase.

54
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,520
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

55
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,520
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

56
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,060
Driven to the brink of fall,

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,180
false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality

58
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,800
and the pressure of a crumbling world,

59
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,200
then this may be for you.

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,280
Eternal salvation

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,020
or triple your money back.

The Church of the Subgenius

63
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,180
bring you another 33 minutes

64
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,940
of condensed,

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,460
uraglic function

66
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,780
over the quality audio-visual techniques

67
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,160

Oh, Dr. Spitz.

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,080
She said,

72
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,540
cutting her own legs off

73
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,780
in what was to be the foment

74
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,720
of a startlingly trend among the so-called

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,980
punk-de-tele-hensia,

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,360
where they became

77
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,160
not only skinheads,

78
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,220
but took it to the next level

79
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,460
and became boneheads, actually shaving off

80
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,700
their hair scalp,

81
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,540
cranial viscera,

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,920
and the top three molecular layers of their

83
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
brain itself.

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
And not only this,

85
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,160
but there are in downtown Los Angeles

86
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,360
and the confestrian punk boroughs,

87
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,160
there's even been reports of neckheads,

88
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,880
these progressive brainheads

89
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,200
have actually shaved their head

90
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,960
all the way to their neck,

91
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,420
and even taken it beyond that

92
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,900
in some clubs and clubs,

93
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,700
and it's been reported that subgenius bands

94
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,460
have led to what are referred to as kneeheads,

95
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,700
where the person's body actually ends

96
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,640
a scant two inches above the knee.

97
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,580
You might see a punk button,

98
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,180
a Sid Lives or a Dr. Spabob button

99
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,900
on the lower half of the pants,

100
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,740
and it hides the top of the spiked boots

101
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,420
which protrude below all that's left,

102
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,840
of what was once a normal middle-aged boy,

103
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,340
until Doctors for Bob

104
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,040
and the Church of the Subgenius

105
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,380
got ahold of his brain via

106
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:35,280
post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

107
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,280
Praise Bob!

113
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:06,140
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slang,

114
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,000
sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,960
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

116
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,380
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Church,

117
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
and the Archbishop of the Church of the Subgenius.

118
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,120
We're here today to talk about

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,820
the Church of the Subgenius,

120
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,540
and the Church of the Subgenius.

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,420
The opinions expressed are not necessarily

122
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,780
those of this radio station.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,380
Before the sermon,

124
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,700
a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

125
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,520
living avatar of Slack,

126
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,060
and saint of sales.

127
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,300
What is the law?

128
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,380
Not to name any.

129
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,380


130
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,380


131
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,860
Not to endlessly interning the law.

132
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,040
That is the law.

133
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,980
Are we not men?

134
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,160
What is the law?

135
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,220
Not to endlessly interning the law.

136
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,140
That is the law.

137
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,100
Are we not men?

138
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,420
What is the law?

139
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,920
But we're also going to see what's inside the earth.

140
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,320
And that's why I'm excited about this whole adventure.

141
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,360
Oh, and guess what?

142
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,160
We can go on this trip together.

143
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,840
Mm-hmm.

144
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,120
And we won't even have to leave your room.

145
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,240
That's right.

146
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,360
Just by using your imagination.

147
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,660
We enter the law.

148
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,600
That is the law.

149
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,540
Are we not men?

150
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,980
You must draw your own conclusions.

151
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,420
You've got to believe me.

152
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,240
I'm not a saint.

153
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,160
You've got to believe me.

154
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,640
I'm not a saint.

155
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,060
You've got to believe me.

156
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,540
I'm not a saint.

157
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm not a saint.

158
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,380
You've got to believe me.

159
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,020
I'm not a saint.

160
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,020


161
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,400
Hey, hey, hey.

162
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,260
Can you keep the key?

163
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,680
Keep listening!

164
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,100
Backwards, backwards, backwards!

165
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,460
I'm Riauli.

166
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,360
Say hi, Corbin.

167
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,120
Good news, Zamba.

168
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,080
We're going to the lock.

169
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,000
Lock.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,280
Nam.

171
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,140
Eton.

172
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,500
Oh.

173
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,120
Oh.

174
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:37,420
I have, I have received a full range of messages from your spiritual soul.

175
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,760
You could have been the most gorgeous creature in the whole world.

176
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,100
If you come near anyone in my family,

177
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,560
I have to kill you.

178
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,520
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,480
You are, at the present time,

180
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,060
you are just covered with filth,

181
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,480
and you will hurt my family.

182
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,600
And I have no choice but to retaliate, you know?

183
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,760
And I have superior powers to anything that you are aware of.

184
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,240
And I must tell you right now,

185
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,880
I have no toleration for evil.

186
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,220
I will destroy it when I need it.

187
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,680
And this way we're fair and square.

188
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,780
I understand that you loved Bob,

189
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,760
and that maybe you and Bob are,

190
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,160
somehow,

191
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,260
help each other in a good way.

192
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,380
I don't know.

193
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,760
You will not attack people.

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,820
You will not turn them into frogs.

195
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,220
If you stay in the United States,

196
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,360
you will be destroyed,

197
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,500
and you will be void,

198
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,480
one way or another.

199
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,740
It's a waste of your time to remain in the United States.

200
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,920
Forget about it.

201
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,600
That is my advice to you.

202
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,640
Take it or leave it.

203
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,060
And stop harassing me.

204
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
I want to kill her.

205
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,460
Obviously you don't want to.

206
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,460
I want to kill you, Connie.

207
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,800
You're responsible for the pain of these four.

208
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:05,880
I want to kill you.

209
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,720
I'm so tired of you.

210
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,100
Get your hands off me.

211
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,580
So how do we know?

212
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,260
How can we tell whether our friends are ready to watch the path of Dodge?

213
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,560
I used to like it better before you guys were on the radio.

214
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,740
I liked it better when you were just in a book.

215
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,360
I liked it better when I used to dial up at this time of the morning and hear just dead air.

216
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,620
Can't the station go back to that?

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,180
I am writing them right away to recommend this.

218
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,220
See, that's one of the letters.

219
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:39,840
Another writer from Beaumont expressed the idea that it did crowd the airwaves a lot more to have a subgenius radio show than to have a regular radio show.

220
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,660
Yeah.

221
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,280
We have a writer from Irving who says that can we move out to the Texas stadium to be near him?

222
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,260
He would feel better.

223
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:58,040
We have a writer here from East Dallas who says he came home and he heard his children listening to the subgenius radio show on non-radio.

224
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,780
And that he had to take both of his children out and shoot them.

225
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,060
They both had a broken leg.

226
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:10,640
Here's a letter from a fellow in Pasadena who asked why we allow the show to jump around a buck like that.

227
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,680
In the bar downtown.

228
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,080
He said one of his friends was trying to ride the show and got hurt when he got thrown off.

229
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,720
And he'd had a little too much drink and a whole bunch of nice ladies were laughing at him and hurting him.

230
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,380
And now he's trying to sue the station.

231
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,040
Okay, people are calling. Please don't call 848-4425 and try to be on the show.

232
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,720
We don't even have a phone down here.

233
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:39,380
If I can just get it out of this sacred socket in which it resides here.

234
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:58,400
Now, dear friends, I promised at some point that I would try to explain the church of the subgenius to those of you who have absolutely no knowledge of our guru, our invisible, most of the time invisible guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,340
The living saint of slack and sales who we do worship quite seriously.

236
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,460
You may get the idea.

237
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,360
Some people get the idea.

238
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,480
This is some sort of a comedy thing.

239
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:24,520
And I will admit that one common trait that separates subgeniuses from humans, our enemies, the humans, is the sub...

240
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,820
It's a big war over what's funny and what's not, I guess is what it is.

241
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,260
And I think the subgeniuses are willing to listen a little closer sometimes.

242
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,560
On the other hand, they're also brain damaged.

243
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,480
So, you know, I'm not like bragging or anything.

244
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:55,540
But the church of the subgenius, although you could say it was headquartered in Dallas because it is the most disorganized religion in the world, is really spread out everywhere.

245
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:08,540
The real church is all subgeniuses everywhere churning out the material that we play on this show, that we print in pamphlets and in a magazine, a monthly magazine that comes out once every week.

246
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:23,680
And we have a book out, a McGraw-Hill book, which you can generally order from most better bookstores if you give them a real hard time about it.

247
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,920
There is a conspiracy against all of us to take away our slack.

248
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,400
And those bookstores are part and parcel.

249
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,740
Sometimes I wonder about Bob himself.

250
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,260
But...

251
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:47,780
As I was saying, this show, the reason that it sounds the way it does is because it's a mixture of many other subgenius shows, although the church started in this town.

252
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:56,280
Bob founded the church in the 50s here in Dallas to confuse the conspiracy and to bring slack to subgeniuses.

253
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,860
Now, only in 1979 did we go public.

254
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,840
And since that time, there have been subgenius shows that crop up all over the country.

255
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,240
One of the main ones is the Moyn.

256
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:18,360
It's more than an hour less than a show from KPFA in Berkeley, where Puzzling Evidence and all those other evil guys, Gary Gabrogfran and Buck Naked...

257
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,740
That's why Buck isn't here. He's on that other show now all the time.

258
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,760
These shows collide in midair and there's not much I can do about it.

259
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,700
I could read you from the book of the subgenius, but that probably wouldn't upset you nearly as much.

260
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,020
As this media barrage tape here.

261
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,060
This is the classic subgenius ad. I haven't played the whole thing in quite a while.

262
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,660
Some of you may have heard it, but those of you who haven't, this should explain the church.

263
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,520
Attitude corrected. Hold.

264
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,140
The subconscious will listen and absorb this message.

265
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,360
Exactly.

266
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,320
Three, two, and one.

267
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,600
Now to continue with the tape recording.

268
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,420
Superior mutants, repent! Quit your job! Slack off!

269
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,660
The world ends tomorrow and you may die!

270
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,120
Well, no, probably not, but whatever you do, just keep listening.

271
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,820
Are we controlled by secret forces?

272
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,460
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

273
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,980
Do people think you're strange?

274
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,620
Do you?

275
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,400
Then you may be on the right track.

276
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,320
Are you abnormal?

277
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,580
Then you are probably better than most people.

278
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,760
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

279
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,460
Now at last the step-by-step process is revealed.

280
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,620
This is it. The only faith that promises action, thrills, success in sex and business.

281
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,480
Having all the guilt, but none of the sex.

282
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:18,380
Having intercourse with a beautiful live girl or damn near anything else.

283
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:25,940
Thought you tried everything. You ain't seen nothing yet. Learn to think big.

284
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,200
Develop the tricks of length extension.

285
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,520
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

286
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,740
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

287
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,060
Bob is a way of life to millions. Yet half of them don't even know it.

288
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:54,540
He's the one true living Slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

289
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,580
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

290
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,500
Now see another life.

291
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,580
Another dimension on your TV.

292
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,340
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

293
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,280
Become physically attractive overnight.

294
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,200
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

295
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,520
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

296
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,840
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

297
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,800
And coming right back.

298
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,240
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

299
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,780
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

300
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,860
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

301
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,420
And channel them into an illusion of creativity that will fool normals and get you sex.

302
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,520
To help you create a new reality.

303
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:08,520


304
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:08,520


305
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,560
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

306
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:28,400
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon, which, in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change, and carnage, insanity, and destruction, than all of mankind's history and pre-history before it.

307
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,220
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

308
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,020
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know.

309
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:47,240
While billions of deserving conspiracy dupes fry in hell on Earth.

310
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:57,760
Uncontrolled Thinking, controlled by Bob, will usher in a spiritual rebreath and a cascade of astounding mysteries.

311
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,140
Supernatural riches.

312
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,840
And a restoration of lost psychic abilities.

313
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,620
That will totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

314
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,380
That's right. You're lucky to live in the end time.

315
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,940
Here's more money, Bob!

316
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,760
Wise up! They're out to get you.

317
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,180
The different are being silenced by a global conspiracy.

318
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,040
Weird men arise!

319
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,960
Find out who they are.

320
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,120
And how to smash them!

321
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,800
You probably already knew that the U.S. government is a sham.

322
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,420
Something propped up there for you to blame.

323
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,800
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

324
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,200
That they are actually shambling?

325
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,440
Unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?

326
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,480
Yes! Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!

327
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,760
Defy the sinister Star Forces which mock us all.

328
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,240
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

329
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,280
God has been misquoted all this time!

330
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:23,020
His actual words may disturb you, but Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind.

331
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,880
There's no problem with Bob.

332
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,700
Bob is a sex god.

333
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:40,100
Bob is a sex god.

334
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,460
Unbelievable, unspeakable, unbearable.

335
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,800
The world is full of these terrible things!

336
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,320
I don't know.

337
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,300
Billy! Billy! Billy!

338
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Billy!��

339
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,540
Hey, that new church air is just great!

340
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,180
It's fun!

341
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:20,300
Well son, if you'll just keep breathing an equal portion of church air with all the bad air too,

342
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,720
you'll get like me!

343
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,100
Your head will begin to expand.

344
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,620
The inside will eventually become larger than the outside.

345
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,720
I don't know quite how to explain this, but I've put my trust in Bob.

346
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,620
Thanks to Bob, the inside of my head is much larger than the outside ever was.

347
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,120
But doesn't that make it hard to get through doorways?

348
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:56,360
Sometimes I do get lost inside my head, and I've had trouble finding my way out,

349
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,360
especially early in the morning.

350
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,600
But thanks to Bob, I'll be a much more productive employee on the job.

351
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:12,020
And I've had a great time at parties with this new big head that came with my glandscaping.

352
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,640
Will the same thing happen to me when I get to be a man too?

353
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,360
Yes, son.

354
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,100
You'll go live with Bob.

355
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,100


356
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,680
You'll go through the operations too.

357
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,820
The doctors will open your third nostril with their musical instruments, and you'll be able

358
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,100
to whiff-read the stenches of all the normals and pinks around you.

359
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,260
You'll be able to sell them anything, son.

360
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,980
Just like me.

361
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,300
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend.

362
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,800
Oh, look out, son.

363
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,380
Here it comes now.

364
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,680
Bob-time train.

365
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,700
Bob-time train.

366
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:48,700


367
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:48,700


368
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:48,700


369
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:48,700


370
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,100
It's frightening, isn't it?

371
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,500
It's unbelievably big and scary.

372
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,520
It's not wrenching enough for you.

373
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,500
We stand to receive the Eeyore of the flesh and understand not the way of the lead-clad

374
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:05,980
ones.

375
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,000
Stand direct for your abnormality.

376
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,060
Wise up.

377
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,700
They're out to get you.

378
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,140
Send one dollar to P.O.

379
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,960
Box 14.

380
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,100
Well, we can't tell you where Bob-time train is, but we can tell you where Bob-time train

381
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


382
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


383
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


384
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


385
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


386
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


387
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


388
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


389
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


390
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


391
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


392
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


393
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


394
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


395
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,100


396
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,680
We can't really tell you to send a dollar to P.O.

397
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:30,580
Box 140306, because you really should send that dollar to K.N.O.N., even though Bob is

398
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,000
coming.

399
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:40,840
I'll tell you, friends, that ad was that 45-minute commercial.

400
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,100
Oh, listen to that.

401
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,580
Boom.

402
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
That's pretty dramatic.

403
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,600
I hear the footsteps.

404
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,080
I hear the footsteps.

405
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,080


406
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,240
I hear the footsteps of the Dobbs as he approacheth.

407
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,260
That's the microphone stand.

408
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:07,120
There's magic everywhere in the world when you're tied up in this insane mess.

409
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:14,940
Well, that ad was put together by myself with Reverend Bleepo Abernathy up in Boston, who's

410
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,940
got a subgenius hour of slack there now that just started up.

411
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,060
He's got a subgenius hour of slack there now that just started up.

412
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,220
He's much more of a radio professional than I am.

413
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,660
Ironic that it took him longer to get slack in this way.

414
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:37,200
But also, a lot of the cuts on there come from Dr. Byron Werner, a mysterious character

415
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:46,160
who lives amidst the largest collection of spoken word records and musac, strange, just...

416
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,740
We know a lot of collectors of strange things.

417
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,840
And a lot of that stuff ends up over here.

418
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,320
And a lot of that stuff ends up over here.

419
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:59,120
But the reason we have a less tightly edited show tonight is because, like so many of you,

420
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,740
I'm still recovering from the expeditions performed for New Year's, the celebration

421
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:11,000
of the year of the P.O. Box 1403-06.

422
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,160
I can't answer the phone right now.

423
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,940
And if I did, you still wouldn't be able to hear it on the air because we're not set up

424
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,740
for that yet here.

425
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:28,540
But what happened to me at New Year's was we journeyed into darkest Arkansas for a concert

426
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,800
performance with Doctors for Bob, that great old subgenius band.

427
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,880
And it was...

428
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,260
God, the show...

429
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,180
It was at the S.O.B. Club.

430
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,980
See, this is a church, but we don't have our own tabernacle, so we have to act like we're

431
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,520
some kind of showbiz act and do these things.

432
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:47,720
And it was...

433
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,000
We were in these amazing clubs and art museums, you name it.

434
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:59,780
Anyway, this particular club, for some reason, was full of full-blood humans rather than subgeniuses.

435
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,660
I think they were waiting to get into a restaurant next door, and they weren't Doctors for Bob's

436
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:03,940
audience.

437
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:10,040
By the time the show was over, the Arkansas police had to come in and protect the Doctors

438
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:16,020
for Bob, these great preachers, from their audience, who had been paid to attack them

439
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,960
by the club owners.

440
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,240
They were the owners, who couldn't get out of the contract any other way.

441
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,860
However, the rest of the audience loved it.

442
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,300
And I've spent a lot of time trying to edit some of that stuff down.

443
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,880
And next week, we will present a Doctors for Bob special show, but I did manage to retrieve

444
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,820
from their foul dungeons some rare studio outtakes.

445
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,680
And I'm gonna have to really ride the censorship button on this song.

446
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:52,120
But it's a beautiful song by Jane or Hyperclete and Doctors for Bob, called You Can't Hide

447
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,940
From God.

448
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,760
And this should also, this is like an explanation for subgenius in a lot of ways, too, I think.

449
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,840
You can't hide from God.

450
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,780
He's bigger than you.

451
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,660
He's bigger than you.

452
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,800
He's bigger than the whole world.

453
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,820
He's bigger than all reality.

454
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,380
He's bigger than all infinity.

455
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,400
Help me somebody.

456
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,020
She ain't got no legs.

457
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,020
My legs are on fire.

458
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,700
Whatever.

459
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,200
Yeah.

460
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,620
Yeah.

461
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,500
Yeah.

462
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,580
Yeah.

463
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,200
Yeah.

464
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:40,660
Yeah.

465
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,340


466
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,660
Yeah.

467
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,060
Yeah.

468
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,080
Yeah.

469
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,080


470
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,080


471
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,080


472
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,280
He's a great guy.

473
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,280


474
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,280


475
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,280


476
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,280


477
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,660
And he has a healthy puberty, his face has been mimed and put up more places than yours

478
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:49,900
has.

479
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,560
He smokes more prop than you do.

480
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,840
He's got more black and white dots on his face than you do.

481
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,740
You cannot hide from the J.R. Bob God.

482
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,320
You're the superhero of the universe.

483
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,180
You can't hide from God.

484
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,220
He's bigger than you.

485
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,440
He's bigger than all reality.

486
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,460
Help me somebody.

487
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,020
He's got no legs.

488
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,340
My legs are on fire.

489
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,660
Go with the lever, right down.

490
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,960
There you go, need some help, need some help?

491
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,220
Whoo, a prairie dog.

492
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,680
You can't run from your own legs.

493
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,880
There's not a man or woman in this auditorium tonight

494
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
who can run from their own legs.

495
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,520
If you run from your own legs,

496
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,520
what are you gonna use to run away from them with?

497
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,220
You can't run from your own legs.

498
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,920
You cannot hide from this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

499
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,760
because he's stupider than you.

500
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,020
You can't hide from God,

501
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,720
because he's bigger than you, he's bigger than all reality.

502
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,980
Whoo, help me, somebody, my legs are on fire.

503
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,080
Pull the lever down, you go,

504
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,520
she ain't got no legs, praise God.

505
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,140
You can't wash water, it's already wet.

506
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,320
All you're gonna do is make more water.

507
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,160
What are you gonna do, pour water on water?

508
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,660
You're just gonna end up with a bunch of water.

509
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,240
You can't wash water, you can't run from your own legs.

510
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,980
You can't hide from Bob, because he's stupider than you are.

511
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,000
You can't hide from God, because he's bigger than you,

512
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,660
he's bigger than all,

513
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,700
infinity, whoo, help me, somebody, my legs are on fire.

514
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,520
Pull the lever down, you go, she ain't got no legs.

515
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,080
Need some help, praise God.

516
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,420
You cannot wash soap.

517
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,520
What are you gonna do, cut it in half

518
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,940
and rub the two edges together?

519
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,900
You can't wash soap.

520
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,920
You can't wet water.

521
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,480
You can't run from your own legs.

522
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,080
You cannot hide from Bob, because he's stupider than you are.

523
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,000
You cannot hide from God,

524
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,780
because he's bigger than you, he's bigger than all, infinity.

525
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,340
Whoo, help me, somebody, she ain't got no legs,

526
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,480
my legs are on fire.

527
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,020
Pull the lever down, you go, need some help, praise God.

528
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,100
You cannot swallow your own throat.

529
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,400
What are you gonna swallow it with?

530
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,320
And if you use it to swallow it with,

531
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,300
then what are you gonna swallow?

532
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,280
You cannot swallow your own throat.

533
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,180
You cannot wash soap.

534
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,380
You cannot wet water.

535
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,740
You cannot run from your own legs.

536
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,640
You cannot hide from this man, J-Har Bob Dobbs,

537
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,940
because he's bigger than you, because he's stupider than you.

538
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,560
You cannot hide from God, he's bigger than you,

539
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,340
he's bigger than all, reality.

540
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:07,840
Whoo.

541
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,820
He had no legs, and you guys When the air is on fire,

542
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,040
This fishy taste of fry's coming up.

543
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Of course no thing smells like

544
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,040


545
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,040


546
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,800
So, you cannotya don't be scared,

547
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,840
ACE is out.

548
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,620
Or you don't have outside most walls.

549
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,800
Your soul will heal later,

550
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,280
you all know that for that matter,

551
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:28,300
and none of this shit is gonna bring a fridge to God,

552
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,360
aw come on,

553
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,840
that's what you can do about it though.

554
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,200
Because you don't mean there is a chance here,

555
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,940
you've got to do something, hopefully,, for a living.

556
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,780
And cabaneros.

557
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,440
Let go of his ass.

558
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,340
стabbed.

559
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,640
You can't hide from God.

560
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,560
He's bigger than you.

561
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,440
He's bigger than all reality.

562
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,480
Help me, somebody.

563
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,480
She ain't got no legs.

564
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,520
Pull the lever down and go.

565
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,040
My legs are on fire.

566
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,160
I can smell praise dogs.

567
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,660
You cannot...

568
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,220
All right, friends.

569
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,200
I've got to be careful about how much is actually played of this song.

570
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,560
Yeah, see what I mean?

571
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,440
It's tricky.

572
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,400
It's tricky with these subgenius songs.

573
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,620
Well, that...

574
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,380
God, I wish I could play the rest of that.

575
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,020
It's such an...

576
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,700
You cannot hide from this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

577
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,660
He's stupid as you are.

578
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,500
You can't hide from God.

579
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,340
He's bigger than you.

580
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,180
He's bigger than all reality.

581
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,680
Help me, somebody.

582
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,080
She ain't got no legs.

583
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,280
Pull the lever down and go.

584
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,740
My legs are on fire.

585
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,640
I can smell praise dogs.

586
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,940
You can't think about your own brain.

587
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,200
That's part of the problem.

588
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,360
How are you going to think about your own brain?

589
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,280
There's going to be more thoughts spewing through.

590
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,440
You cannot think about your own brain.

591
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,020
You cannot wash soap.

592
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,920
You cannot wet.

593
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,020


594
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,180
You cannot drink water.

595
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,180
You can't run from your own legs.

596
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,680
You cannot hide from this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

597
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,620
He's really stupid as you.

598
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,340
You cannot hide from God.

599
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,120
He's bigger than you.

600
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,140
He's bigger than all reality.

601
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,980
Help me, somebody.

602
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,140
He ain't got no legs.

603
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,200
Pull the lever down and go.

604
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,880
My legs are on fire.

605
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,880
I can smell praise dogs.

606
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:04,400
First, let's look in the book of the subgenius, Free Scriptures 614, and yea, even the banks

607
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,720
shall topple.

608
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,460
There is no hope for the people in the end times, when these preachers of Bob Dobbs shall

609
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:18,940
come, and it shall wash away the filth and the unclean seed with the new seed, upon which

610
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:26,280
the mobile homes of the subgeni will float and be carried on high with their party equipment,

611
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,240
chainsaws, and scalpels.

612
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,420
Yea, lo!

613
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:42,160
Those doctors for Bob shall float or mount enter first, and achieve true slackness.

614
00:33:45,060 --> 00:34:00,200
And now, friends, our rival cults, those dear, dear other denominations which I shan't mention,

615
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:12,660
whose numbers swell so every day, they, like us, see the family falling apart in America

616
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,120
today.

617
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,300
The attack on the American family.

618
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,700
And they're right.

619
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,120
Even as we speak, it is happening.

620
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,000
Father against son.

621
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,800
Sister against mother.

622
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,280
Father real close up against sister.

623
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,060
Yes, yes, yes, and civilization is falling apart.

624
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,340
One in every two marriages ends in divorce.

625
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:56,860
And these dear rival churches would say that this comes from pornography, from sex gags

626
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,540
on TV.

627
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,840
And premarital permissiveness.

628
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,280
Well that's a lie, my friends.

629
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,100
It's the devil's lie.

630
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,180
Now I know what you're thinking now, I'll say it again.

631
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,960
It's the devil's lie.

632
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,640
The devil is in that Texaco station.

633
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,240
The devil is in that car pulling up behind you right now.

634
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,560
The devil is in the IRS office.

635
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,060
The devil is everywhere.

636
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,260
The conspiracy is everywhere.

637
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,520
And it's tearing the family apart.

638
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,900
And I'll tell you how that devil does it.

639
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,520
And it's what those others are doing.

640
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:27,520


641
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,640
churches love the most? Oh it's what they say that we're trying to destroy and we

642
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:47,040
are. What's tearing the family apart is nine to five jobs. Conspiracy, corporate,

643
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,460
pink situations where daddy gets up in the morning and goes to work, kisses the kid

644
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,200
goodbye. It's the first time he sees him during the day, kissing him goodbye, kind of a

645
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:06,260
simultaneous goodbye and hello. Then he gets home about seven o'clock, ticked off

646
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:12,860
to use a polite term, after a long drive out back from the suburbs and he comes home

647
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:18,820
and he kisses his kids hello and goodnight and they go to bed. And the

648
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,200
other churches dare to say it's because the kids see a little tittering

649
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,440
dog.

650
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,820
And stupid sexy gags on television or it's because of the new permissiveness where men

651
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:35,100
are allowed to do things with other men. I say it's a bunch of holy hooey my friend.

652
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:44,060
I say why not legalize pornography and ban work? Work is what takes the parents away

653
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:49,640
from the kids. Most of the kids nowadays grow up and don't have parents at all. They have

654
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,760
scarecrows looking over them in some daycare center.

655
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:00,280
If that mother can bear with them, can stand to change diapers till they're one and a half,

656
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:07,300
she'll send them off to that daycare center just as quick as she can. And they're still

657
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:14,000
led by human teachers. It ain't robots yet. But the kids ain't got no parents.

658
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:22,740
Because Mr. and Mrs. Mommy and Daddy think it's so important to have jobs and jobs. And

659
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:30,420
security. It's so important to be a real American. A normal American. A normal American

660
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:39,240
that doesn't know his kids as well as he knows his boss. Or his employees might be a better

661
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,440
metaphor.

662
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:50,160
And we find then the family falling apart.

663
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,720
Oh they will.

664
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,280
Girl.

665
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,600
Oh that's gonna be Her哥는כ.

666
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,260
Seminares say that they need to consider,

667
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,660
Ah, rent,

668
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,240
um.

669
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,720
Not rent.

670
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,300
Ring me up a hour to at the table.

671
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,720
But wait a minute.

672
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,280
I know grandma's doing that.

673
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,120
I know what,

674
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:22,680


675
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,700
National News,

676
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:29,580
As J.R. Bob Dobbs himself once said, I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the

677
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,000
kind of man I'm preaching to.

678
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:39,400
But that preacher can get up there on TV and oh, he's so glad to keep you normal, keep

679
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,320
you working so hard you don't even know your own wife anymore, keep young wifey stuck in

680
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:53,580
the house with the kid 24 hours a day, turn her into a raven maniac from boredom and pinkness

681
00:38:53,580 --> 00:39:01,980
while old dad, well, he's out making his sales calls and his martinis and that way mama don't

682
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,740
get no slack.

683
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:12,920
Mama turns into a nut, a dingy, cooped up housewife and you wonder why her kids turn

684
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,660
to drugs.

685
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,300
They see a woman.

686
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,800
They see her just as out of it as she can be and they think, well, I'm going to go get

687
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,860
messed up on drugs.

688
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,100
I don't want to be like her.

689
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,720
That's worse than being messed up on drugs.

690
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,040
It's a God's truth, my friend.

691
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:33,360
So next time they start saying how just because your subgenius book has some pictures of nakedness

692
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:40,680
and dirty words, you just come back at them and say, sir, sir, ma'am, do you work so hard

693
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,020
that you can't remember your kids' names?

694
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,280
Trying to preserve their names?

695
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,280


696
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,960
This little neighbor who worked so hard to keep the kids teaching your kids is gonna

697
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:50,960


698
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,160
This kid before I see you running into your Somehow completely

699
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,620
There's some kind of.

700
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:00,840
My GABANG emergency call.

701
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,460
So you're going to contra Taj people.

702
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:03,760
Okay.

703
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


704
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,260
Okay, take it easy girl.

705
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,720
Don't be in trouble.

706
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,280
Be quiet.

707
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,220
Jessica Heinola live in The Ranch.

708
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,400


709
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,460
No.

710
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,180
Go ye down.

711
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,840
There's nothing that says you can't.

712
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,360
The devil don't have a rule book.

713
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,000
That's right.

714
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,500
The devil.

715
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,120
The devil.

716
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,020
You heard me right.

717
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,560
Does not have a rule book.

718
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,920
He is not humanistic.

719
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,760
He is not pacifistic.

720
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,700
But that devil owes you money, my friend.

721
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,160
That's right.

722
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,440
The devil owes you money.

723
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,360
And so does Uncle Sam.

724
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,480
You have to recognize the devil just like you have to recognize Uncle Sam.

725
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,580
Now, I'm going down there to pay taxes.

726
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,400
As far as I'm concerned, I might as well be paying taxes to the devil.

727
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,080
I'm sorry.

728
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,320
It's just the way things are.

729
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,540
It's a test of faith.

730
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:46,280
It's why God put the devil down here to see if you can tell the difference between the devil and Uncle Sam.

731
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,140
You've got to fear that devil and that government.

732
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,820
They'll walk right over you.

733
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,460
The devil owes you money.

734
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,860
But Bob Dobbs is the bank where you can cash it in.

735
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,380
We've got to burn out the banks of the devil.

736
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,760
We've got to root him out.

737
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,200
Burn out the hate.

738
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,380
Burn out.

739
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,020
The radiation.

740
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,900
Burn out the fire.

741
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,620
These words may be harsh.

742
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:20,960
They may not go down well on the polished ears of the rationalists, the modernists, those who wish to see proof of Bob.

743
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,980
But I don't care what they say.

744
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,260
I'll keep preaching.

745
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,660
If ye go down, pull them with you.

746
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:33,540
Boy, these so-called, this so-called civilization.

747
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,380
On the day that we finally reach.

748
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,800
Realize that things are all backwards and we have slack without work.

749
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,400
And the promised kingdom of Bob Dobbs.

750
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,980
Then perhaps we'll find the true civilization which needs not Xerox machines nor fancy coats and ties.

751
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,060
It doesn't have to have them.

752
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,460
It can have them.

753
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,740
You can be civilized and you don't have to live in a cave.

754
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:04,760
But you're probably going to be more civilized being one of these characters that sits in a cave scratching his butt.

755
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,380
Then you are running around on this.

756
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,860
Treadmill of false slack.

757
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,900
Oh yes.

758
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,800
And look at the humans lining up for the slaughterhouse.

759
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,940
Oh yes.

760
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,080
The harvest.

761
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,660
It's a squirting universe, friends.

762
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,360
And that's why we have to call for your help on the great new tabernacle.

763
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,980
We've only been in there a month.

764
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,360
But it's going back into the hands of the conspiracy.

765
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,100
They're going to turn it into a war games participation video game.

766
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:50,680
Where we're reaching YB Mark Hamble to decide which of those Хотos of M Shark EST's would be a good time leaves.

767
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,280
Let's take this quick listen.

768
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,280


769
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,640
0 Is this...

770
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:53,780
0 The

771
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:59,360
0 Got

772
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,000
0 Cat

773
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,860
0 Advisory

774
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,080
0 Consultant

775
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,060
0 cult

776
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,380
0 Order

777
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:17,120
church a joke but I have to wonder is the subgenius church a joke or is this

778
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:24,420
world a joke Bob Dobbs owns deed and title to the church but who owns deed

779
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,340
and title to the world not Bob yet uh-uh no I'm afraid not no sir the conspiracy

780
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,300
owns this world those policemen on motorcycles they won't let me preach on

781
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,240
car hoods downtown because they think I'm a crazy man or a drunk man and they

782
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,520
got no reason to arrest me yet they would because I'm free free free enough

783
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,240
to rant to myself in public because I come for Bob Dobbs against taxes work

784
00:43:51,240 --> 00:44:01,420
death and premature immaculation your mind has to be certified okay by them by

785
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,280
them dame dame and oh we have to

786
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,960
take them they and their tools of iniquity not the tools of the preacher

787
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,520
nay not the tongue nor the other parts but tools of false slack dangled

788
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,780
forever in front of you like that Rays right around the corner or like that rat

789
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:33,180
swimming in poison cheese and so we find that as my time is running out and it's

790
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,240
so sad that we only have 15 minutes on each

791
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:42,460
broadcast but it all balances out in one great religious urge well it does

792
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,300
doesn't it Thank You Reverend staying that was a beautiful sentiment there

793
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,220
hypocrisy in the church that thanks to Reverend Chris gross for the lovely

794
00:44:53,220 --> 00:45:00,380
organ music in the background on on that one and here once more we get the hideous

795
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,700
and scary zoogs rift

796
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,580
face

797
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,900
6

798
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:08,900


799
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:20,400
they'll

800
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:30,020
your

801
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,060
you

802
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,260
As I was about to receive communion,

803
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,340
and you received my communication request,

804
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,960
but you didn't wonder, what is it that we know?

805
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,560
The great A.C. breaks.

806
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,560
Now there be no wine for the priest next Sunday.

807
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,180
Now there be no vino.

808
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,300
The congregation grew coins without making wishes.

809
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,720
Some of them landed into holy water dishes.

810
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,560
The apes saved them up.

811
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,020
They didn't spend any.

812
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,560
When you're locked behind bars, you can save every penny.

813
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,880
Now they can find freedom and find their salvation.

814
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,200
Their mouths holy water from holy salvation.

815
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,160
The priest's law spoke out in righteous indignation.

816
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,280
There'll be hell and damnation throughout the whole day.

817
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,840
Damnation!

818
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,220
You'd be hard-pressed to find a priest,

819
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,900
except at times when you need him the least.

820
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,200
Then at times when you need him the most,

821
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,580
you'll be drinking the wine and eating a host.

822
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,960
His guests, I guess, would have nothing to boast

823
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,000
when he's eating good cracker

824
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,280
and drinking a toast.

825
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,700
Toast!

826
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,600
Is there no end to your horrible imaginations?

827
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,700
None whatsoever, madam.

828
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,220
This is Dr.

829
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,380
Dr. Swerbob again.

830
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,980
Dr. Swerbob from Little Rock, Arkansas.

831
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,180
This is our next, quote, version, unquote, ma'am.

832
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,820
This is a little thing we do

833
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:52,040
about a process which is known as electroshock therapy,

834
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,800
a very therapeutic process

835
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,640
which has helped these young men

836
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,660
become productive members of the musical industry.

837
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:04,600
But hell, that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they...

838
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,480
shocked the living gee out of me.

839
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:12,540
Dr. Swerbob, the

840
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,220
Listen to my tale, then.

841
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,700
But why, why do you call me mad?

842
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,820
Could a madman have written songs such as these?

843
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,680
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

844
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,060
I think not.

845
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,620
I'm not mad.

846
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,440
I'm merely an ordinary person seeking life, liberty,

847
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,620
and the pursuit of happiness.

848
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,180
My pursuit of happiness includes machine-gunning 127

849
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,580
innocent people.

850
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,580


851
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,580


852
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,580


853
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,580


854
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,580


855
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,580


856
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,580


857
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,580


858
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,580


859
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,960
Listen, children, if that's mad, go ahead, lock me up.

860
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,940
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

861
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:45,180
Just because I enjoy washing my face in the blood of infants,

862
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,580
is that any reason to lock me up?

863
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

864
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,580
I think not.

865
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,640
I've even got a piece of paper that says my mind is still okay.

866
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,580
Hell, I bet that guy down at the employment agency

867
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,060
who wouldn't give me a job

868
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,260
just because I've been locked up one time,

869
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,580
bet he ain't got a piece of paper that says his mind is still okay.

870
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,140
Hell, I tried to tell them it was not me.

871
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,860
It was the green energy demons, but they merely laughed at me.

872
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:18,460
But now those green energy demons are ruling the planet.

873
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,220
They're not laughing right so hard now, are they?

874
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,080
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they

875
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,100
shocked the living gee outta me.

876
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,060
I tried to explain it was not me, it was the brain.

877
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,580
The brain was the one that was making me laugh.

878
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:34,580


879
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:34,580


880
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,000
The brain of Arlo Palmer, which was controlling my mind

881
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,440
via laser beam, via the FBI, via the CIA,

882
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,500
via the Communist Party, via satellite.

883
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,600
It was the demon, the demon that forced me to do the deed.

884
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,600
But that wasn't nearly...

885
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:51,840
Dot, dot, dot.

886
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,720
But it wasn't...

887
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,040
I'm not insane.

888
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,880
I'm more sane than Son of Sam and Charles Manson put together.

889
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,580
How many people must I kill to prove that I'm sane?

890
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,800
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they

891
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,520
shocked the living gee outta me.

892
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,520
Well, I didn't mind when they shocked the living pee outta me.

893
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,600
In fact, I kind of enjoyed it when they shocked the living see outta me.

894
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,560
I mean, that time they ran over my face with a pickup truck.

895
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,820
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

896
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,580
That time they cut me in half with barbed wire, and then peeled my face off.

897
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,380
And then pulled a bandaid off my anti-semitic arm.

898
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,020
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

899
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,140
That time they skinned me alive and called me dirty names.

900
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,740
Woo-ha! That was a big ol' cocaine party.

901
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,980
That one time they converted my entire body to a wall of membrane

902
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,000
whose only purpose was to feel pain.

903
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,980
No, that time they converted my entire body to a wall of membrane

904
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,860
attached to a human brain

905
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,580
whose only purpose was to feel pain.

906
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,480
And then applied the flame.

907
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,640
Oh, yeah, that was fun!

908
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,160
That time they converted every cell in my body

909
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,180
to the same nerve endings found in male testicles.

910
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,620
Enlarged each cell to the size of a sun.

911
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:27,200
And then inserted huge, sun-sized dentist drills

912
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:34,300
into each of these sun-sized male testicle cells.

913
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:43,700
else. Woo-ha! That was the time of my life compared to that time they shocked the living

914
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:58,700
gee out of me. Hell, I thought a frontal lobotomy was a warm fuzzy. I mean, I'm okay, you're

915
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:07,260
a frontal lobotomy, but it's all a very therapeutic process. Hell, that time they put me in the

916
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:16,480
room where you don't get any of the good pills. Then they had a needle that was so big they

917
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:23,560
had to lower me on top of it by a helicopter in order to anesthetize me. That was only

918
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,680
the needle. I'm not talking about the syringe. And even that wasn't anesthetized.

919
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,240
They had enough to put me out. Then they hooked me up to that device. I'm not talking

920
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,760
about that A.C. device. I'm talking about that D.C. device they had Jones' titty hooked

921
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,660
up to. Then they applied the electrodes to my head. I was still trying to explain to

922
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:54,360
them how I wasn't insane. I'm not a bad psychopath. But hell, all that was fun, I reckon. I guess

923
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,300
you'd call that a good party compared to that time they...

924
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,160
Shocked the living gee out of me.

925
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:51,920
You know what, when it comes to avisers, here's the thing. I think when guys really

926
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,360
regard self-finitely a steakhead, they're slightly fried in their mother's Sonny läuft

927
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:52,360


928
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:52,500
The best deal you can go into dating is when you're 8 or 9 years of age, aged 100 to 100,

929
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,480
and then you just sober up and go buy yourself twenty feet of food and make a bottle of candy.

930
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:55,960
Do it!

931
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:02,100
So Bob was there in 1776.

932
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,480
Bob formed up with David Crockett and all those other silly people with flintlocks and guns that really didn't shoot that far.

933
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,040
You understand?

934
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,640
Yes, giant guns that projected balls of lead around.

935
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:21,840
The flint was very much like a translucent brittle substance that was capable of sparking.

936
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,560
What are we going to do with this?

937
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,100
There are a couple of shows going on here, ladies and gentlemen.

938
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,300
We'll just have to fix the show.

939
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:32,060
If you'll just rewind your house, you can probably...

940
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,600
Here we go.

941
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,960
Why it doesn't sound more interesting.

942
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:40,140
Okay, it's dawn, and here's the picture of the Indian, and here are the lines.

943
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,540
And then you just stare at the TV for an hour while you eat your cereal, okay?

944
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,080
Okay.

945
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,440
And then we'll show you wavy grain, and here's a picture of New York Harbor.

946
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,440
Yeah, and here's some...

947
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,020
That's a nice wavy grain.

948
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,220
Yeah, here's a picture of Nebraska.

949
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,180
And here's Arizona.

950
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:55,780
This is contrast.

951
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,380
And then, see, here's some California.

952
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,440
And then slowly we introduce jet fighters.

953
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,760
Want to get a conversation started in your hometown?

954
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:07,080
Just mention what happened in Berkeley, California when frogs fell out of the sky.

955
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:07,840
It's so good and funny now.

956
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,280
I got the tape started again.

957
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,220
Okay, thanks, Mr. Mobius.

958
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,140
Sure, guys.

959
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,980
Thanks for that funny white powder.

960
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,960
Where'd you get that?

961
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,100
A coke.

962
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,360
The carbonation ruined my nose.

963
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,520
That's just a ground-up show, but he'll never know.

964
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,020
Wow.

965
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,660
I never tell, guys.

966
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,280
He must have used it all up himself.

967
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,760
I didn't see any.

968
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,920
There's not even any crusty residue around the top of his head.

969
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,740
Oh, I see.

970
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,040
Suck my nose.

971
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:39,880
Ah, those giant fuzzy slippers that Mobius Rex is wearing on his ears have gone to his head again.

972
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,660
Yes, yes, friends.

973
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,840
Oh, yes, dear friends.

974
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,100
Just mention that.

975
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,900
Yes, well, well.

976
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,260
That story.

977
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,340
Listen, as I crank up the volume on my little...

978
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,380
Well, when I popped out, I was able to float around the room like a helium balloon.

979
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:50,840
Look at Bob.

980
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,720
There he goes.

981
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,340
He's floating.

982
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,200
He just floated out of the room.

983
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:54,920
He began to bleed.

984
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:55,460
Scurvy.

985
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:02,740
Everybody that wants to make a serious doubt of the known facts of the case, there's related

986
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,280
objects and organizations for reference and complaints.

987
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,580
Those of you out there still wondering what the hell is going on here, you can call up

988
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,300
8484.

989
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:16,380
No, you can't call up that number because, oh, friends, it's so sad, but our time is

990
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,460
slowly coming up now.

991
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:24,220
Don't worry, Norm, because I know that you're having incredible technical difficulties.

992
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:24,700
What?

993
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,300
Me worry?

994
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:25,460


995
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,180
So I've got a record here we can put on.

996
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,000
Praise Bob!

997
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,560
In the meantime, folks, I must say, while I still have this background music, that,

998
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:40,400
uh, while the church needs volunteers, this week we're about to mail out the new subgenius

999
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,880
pamphlet number two, which I've been slipping into people's back pockets and purses lately

1000
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,020
because we didn't have enough postage.

1001
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,560
And now we need that slave labor, all those Bobbies out there.

1002
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,140
Send a postcard to us and get your pencil ready.

1003
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,440
I'll read that number pretty soon.

1004
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:55,660
I'll read it to you pretty quick.

1005
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,900
And write us quickly if you want to.

1006
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,420
If you're a friend of the church that we know, we'll actually allow you into our house to

1007
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:09,680
do this slave labor for Bob, pasting stamps on 3,000 little pamphlets and making sure

1008
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,420
it all works out.

1009
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,360
Now get ready because I'm going to read that box number, or you can write for information

1010
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,340
or to volunteer.

1011
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,820
And that's P.O.

1012
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,980
Box 140306.

1013
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,320
Dallas, Texas.

1014
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:25,420
P.O. Box 140306.

1015
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,180
Of course it's Dallas, Texas, friends.

1016
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,340
75214.

1017
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,440
Once again, that's P.O.

1018
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,760
Box 140306.

1019
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,260
Dallas, Texas.

1020
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,480
75214.

1021
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:41,980
Ah, yes.

1022
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:48,000
And now as our time is running out, I'm going to put on a record by Negative Land.

1023
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,460
Negative Land is a fantastic recording group.

1024
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,540
It's hard to call them a band exactly.

1025
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,060
You can write us to find out where to get their records too because they self-distribute

1026
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,220
them.

1027
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,140
You might be able to find them at some of the special record stores around here.

1028
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:09,040
But I consider this band that I'll play after the closing titles, if I have to.

1029
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,180
You have to.

1030
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,120
Okay.

1031
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:17,540
But first, before that, we'll be hearing Buck Naked's beautiful close-off song, Drinking

1032
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,220
Bud, Watching Bob, as requested earlier tonight.

1033
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,000
Thank you.

1034
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,520
Drinking Bud, Watching Bob.

1035
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:29,440
Drinking Bud Wiser, Watching Bob on TV.

1036
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:39,340
Swallowing red man, the day my coon dog died.

1037
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:48,760
Reading the pamphlet over and over again.

1038
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,620
Eyes drinking.

1039
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:58,440
Thinking Budweiser and Bob was on TV.

1040
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:08,280
The day that Uncle got kicked by a mule.

1041
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,120
I was with Cousin Junior.

1042
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,940
The DNA backfired.

1043
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,380
I was drunk.

1044
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,900
I was lonely.

1045
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,120
I was plastered.

1046
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,760
I was drinking Budweiser.

1047
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,640
And Bob was on TV.

1048
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,700
Drinking Budweiser.

1049
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,500
Watching Bob on TV.

1050
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,060
Swallowing Redman.

1051
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,540
The day my coon dog died.

1052
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,680
I was reading the pamphlet.

1053
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,920
Over and over again.

1054
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,460
I was drinking Budweiser.

1055
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,300
And Bob was on TV.

1056
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,020
I was drinking Budweiser.

1057
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,840
And Bob was on TV.

1058
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,520
Do you like Bob?

1059
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,360
Yeah!

1060
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,300
Do you like Ivan Stank?

1061
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:37,520
Yeah!

1062
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,260
Like my little drum man?

1063
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,100
Yeah!

1064
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,340
How about Buckley's Evidence?

1065
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:41,920
Yeah!

1066
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,820
What about Dr. Sparrow?

1067
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,140
Whoa!

1068
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,820
How about Pasha Buckley again?

1069
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:46,300
Yeah!

1070
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,440
Buckley's Evidence.

1071
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:47,820
Yeah!

1072
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:47,900
I'm a good guy.

1073
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:48,380
Yeah!

1074
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,900
About Paul Papini.

1075
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,560
Yeah!

1076
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,420
St. Jane.

1077
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,460
Oh, how to please.

1078
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:52,700
Yeah!

1079
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,400
Gotta be a covillian.

1080
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:54,840
Yeah!

1081
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,620
About my friend, D.K. Jones.

1082
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,120
Yeah!

1083
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,480
I'm never this physical.

1084
01:00:58,780 --> 01:00:59,220
Oh!

1085
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,120
I'm a hot-ass.

1086
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,000
I'm a dreamin' experience guy.

1087
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,380
Well friends.

1088
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,100
Norm's still setting up and this,

1089
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:11,180
I'm ready.

1090
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,080
Oh, you're ready?

1091
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:12,580
It's time.

1092
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,100
Oh!

1093
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,340
Have at it.

1094
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,500
It's your theme music time buddy.

1095
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:17,800


1096
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,800
Music, please.

1097
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,820
Turn it on.

1098
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:21,060
Okay.

1099
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:21,680
We ready?

1100
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,240
Hit it.

1101
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,000
Hit it again.

1102
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:25,240
Hit this?

1103
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:25,620
Pause.

1104
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:26,100
Oh.

1105
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,120
And?

1106
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,640
I don't care what you say.

1107
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,380
Irving Stang is a tough act to follow.

1108
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:10,900
Yeah.

1109
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,120
Wait until you get to the afterlife, pal.

1110
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:14,840
Again?

1111
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,040
Just before life.

1112
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:17,460
Listen.

1113
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:17,780
You understand?

1114
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,000
You want to take this home with you?

1115
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,180
It didn't work.

1116
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,500
It didn't work.

1117
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,640
It didn't?

1118
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:22,940
No.

1119
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:28,500
That subgenius pamphlet I left in your bag didn't bring you eternal salvation?

1120
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:29,600
Not yet.

1121
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,880
Does that mean I have to give you triple your money back?

1122
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,560
It's a good thing I gave it to you for free.

1123
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,020
Yeah, this cover price of, what, $1?

1124
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,080
It doesn't say U.S. American or anything.

1125
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:45,060
I like the UPC code there.

1126
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,760
I'm sure that's an exclusive code of the subgenius.

1127
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,240
Oh, yeah.

1128
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,800
Yeah, we have our own.

1129
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,800
And those codes.

1130
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,440
You got your own zip code, too, right?

1131
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,000
Yeah.

1132
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,620
That comes after the UPC code.

1133
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:58,440
That's why you can just write Bob at 75214 and it'll get there.

1134
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,120
Next week.

1135
01:02:59,460 --> 01:02:59,860
Yeah.

1136
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,160
And just think about Bob.

1137
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,760
Throw those pills in the mailbox and think about Bob.

1138
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,340
I don't want that over here.

1139
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,520
Put it out on the community bulletin board where it'll do everybody.

1140
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,440
Does this offend your religious sensibilities or something?

1141
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,040
Where it will do everybody some good, Irving Stang.

1142
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,000
I've been leaving them everywhere.

1143
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,900
I want to share the subgenius.

1144
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:17,740
I've been leaving them everywhere.

1145
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:17,740


1146
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:19,120
I want to show you folks that this radio is.

1147
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:19,660
God, man.

1148
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,780
I can't believe you don't want it.

1149
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:26,640
This thing will be worth a bucket load of peach can peaches come the apocalypse.

1150
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,300
Oh, you laugh now.

1151
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,740
You laugh now and don't listen to him.

1152
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,980
Oh, it's a big joke.

1153
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:35,300
I've heard him joke about hell, too.

1154
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,040
Wait a minute.

1155
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:36,620
Yeah.

1156
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,320
Wait a minute.

1157
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,240
Hell's a big joke.

1158
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,440
It's a popular joke these days.

1159
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:41,960
Ha, ha, ha.

1160
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,740
Irving Stang, your hour is up.

1161
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,520
Oh, you got it.

1162
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,560
Thank you.

1163
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:47,720
You're welcome.

1164
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:47,720


1165
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:47,720


1166
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:47,720


1167
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:47,720


1168
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:47,720


1169
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:47,720


1170
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,620
I'm trying to get these little frames out of here.

1171
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:51,940
I understand.

1172
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:51,980
I understand.

1173
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,220
Have we got a second mic yet?

1174
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,580
Well, it's in here.

1175
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,420
But guess who, guess who, guess who we got here?

1176
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,620
How can you be such a big Gene Scott fan?

1177
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,440
Not today.

1178
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,520
Are you making fun of Dr. Gene Scott, Norm?

1179
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:17,620
Because I think Dr. Gene is one of, and I'm serious here, I believe that Dr. Gene Scott

1180
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:17,700
is a big fan of Dr. Gene Scott.

1181
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:17,700


1182
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:17,700


1183
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:17,700


1184
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:17,700


1185
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:17,700


1186
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:17,700


1187
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:17,700


1188
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:17,700


1189
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:17,700


1190
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:25,120
He's one of the greatest preachers on television right now, and I want his job at 12 hours

1191
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,120


1192
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,380
Okay, wait.

1193
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,640
Do you think, do you think Dr. Gene Scott might be an underground subgenius?

1194
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,600
Oh, we ought to be finding out pretty soon.

1195
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,040
We've got infiltrators working in his ministry.

1196
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,300
I say this because, to assure disbelief.

1197
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
He's into the same thing the Church of the Subgenius is, which I don't know what it is.

1198
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,400
You can tell he's into the same thing.

1199
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:46,900
That's a bad.

1200
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,040
Say no more.

1201
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:48,720
Say no more.

1202
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,940
You heard it here first.

1203
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,040
We need Dr. Gene Scott.

1204
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:52,540
Yeah.

1205
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,760
Please, Gene.

1206
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,940
Please, Dr. Gene.

1207
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,480
When we call, pick up the phone.
