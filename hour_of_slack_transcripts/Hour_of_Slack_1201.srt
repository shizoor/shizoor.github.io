Are you ready, eager young space cadet?

I'm a-a-a-a-a-a-all set, your hero ship, sir.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,780
And now here comes the blind commissioner

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,540
Where the cannon in a stress

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,440
One hand is tied to the tightrope walker

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,560
The other's in his pants

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,260
And the riot squad, they're restless

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,120
They need somewhere to go

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,840
As the lady and I look out tonight from

We forgive him because he is a genius

Teabagging day

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,080
for the right wing

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,040
and they are going nuts

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,720
for it

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,920
Thousands of them whipped out

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,820
toothless

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,500
The teabaggers are full strong tongue lashing

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,200
and lick Bush and Reagan

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,580
under Reagan

38
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,780
That's teabagging in a nutshell

39
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,180
In a nutshell

40
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,160
Teabagging is a spontaneous uprising

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,600
uprising

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,620
The people who came up with it

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,360
are a familiar circle of Republicans

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,640
including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich

45
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,100
and former House Majority Leader Dick Armey

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,800
both of whom have firm support

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,980
from right wing financiers and lobbyists

48
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,140
as well as Washington prostitute patron

49
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,580
Senator David Vitter

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,480
Teabagging

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,200
Dick Armey

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,140
tight tight tight

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,520
back in Sean Hannity

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,680
Both are looking forward to an up close and personal

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,220
taste of teabagging themselves

56
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,220
back in Sean Hannity

57
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,160
Teabagging

58
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,380
got them confused with

59
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,480
Dick Armey

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
Teabagging all around the country

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,120
you're gonna need a

62
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,320
Dick Armey

63
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,240
Do you guys really

64
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,860
do you think about the multiple homicides

65
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,940
I mean

66
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,240
Honestly I don't

67
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,180
Do you think that maybe we're kinda weird

68
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,720
America's getting a little weird

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
I think America's always been weird

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,960
Well they've been having multiple homicides

71
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,080
all over the civilized world

72
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,500
America's too damn normal

73
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,840
Healthy people have a need for

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,540
Hookers for Jesus

75
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,600
Prostitute, stripper, what have you

76
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,540
I went to Sunday school

77
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,160
I went to the gym

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,160


79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,160


80
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,160


81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,160


82
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,160


83
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,500
I had a lot of issues going on

84
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,220
MTV

85
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,240
and pop culture

86
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,860
I was living the life I had a pimp

87
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,840
and I OD'd on cocaine

88
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,580
I had a blast it was really fun

89
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,940
I can't even count

90
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,320
and now I reach out to prostitutes

91
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,600
Hairy, horny in my imagination

92
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,220
writhing on the floor

93
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,200
all over the world

94
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,040
my mom and dad manifested horny, freaky, scary

95
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,620
the psychosis, the pathological fear

96
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,180
People, people canceled history

97
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,160
People, people canceled history

98
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,680
very good

99
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,500
God, he wants automatons

100
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,760
Automatons, he wants

101
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,460
Bang, bang

102
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:30,920
totally

103
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,360
How come we have these ideas

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
that are so mythical

105
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,860
that are so primitive

106
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,100
Why don't you

107
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,380
um

108
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,720
I have to dance

109
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,380
Drink beer

110
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,240
Him, or her or it

111
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,160
and Hitler

112
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,480
who also believed in Jesus

113
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,960
and thought he was doing God's will

114
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,020
I went to Sunday school

115
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,460
Fem lui mes nas

116
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,260

117
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,000

120

Fem lui mes nas

123
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,420
It seems like if Jesus was going to show up somewhere, it wouldn't be an ice cream.

124
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,500
But maybe he's everywhere.

125
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,460
He'd show up anywhere.

126
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,260
Sweet Jesus.

127
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,400
I don't see her.

128
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,320
I don't either, but it's still a good story.

129
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,120
It's a good story.

130
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,500
I see it on the toast.

131
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,520
I see it on the cat.

132
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,740
I saw it on Cheetos.

133
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,380
Butter.

134
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,320
Trees.

135
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,960
Potato chip.

136
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,340
Potato chip.

137
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,100
A mint.

138
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,220
Remember the mint and squirrel?

139
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,120
Oh, yeah.

140
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,060
Maybe that was Jesus.

141
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,440
I forget.

142
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, we see it at ice cream, grilled cheese, on trees, roadways.

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,440
Awesome.

144
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,980
You can see it in the sunrise and the sunset.

145
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,160
In Emmy's eyes, you can see it in that way.

146
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,040
But what a feeling.

147
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,000
In your heart.

148
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,860
In storms.

149
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,880
When you're storm chasing, you're out there.

150
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,700
God's control.

151
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,340
You treat Jesus like a box lunch.

152
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,260
Go ahead, say it.

153
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,420
You treat Jesus like a box lunch.

154
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,160
Holy fuck.

155
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,600
Look, if you don't turn your face away,

156
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,280
I'm the looking glass you see like you see yourself in.

157
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,160
Uh-Uhhh, Ahhhhh!

158
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,760
Mama's raging.

159
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,560
Mama's raging.

160
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,580
Mama's raging.

161
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,240
Mama's raging.

162
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,280
Mama's raging.

163
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,940
Mama's raging.

164
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:24,420
Mama's raging.

165
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,120
Nobody can kick the butt of Jesus Christ.

166
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,480
He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.

167
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,840
Nobody can kick the butt of Jesus Christ.

168
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,860
He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.

169
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,920
He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.

170
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:38,500
Nobody can kick the butt of Jesus Christ.

171
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,840
He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.

172
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,340
That's gone over the line.

173
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,540
My life is just one big joke.

174
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,680
I don't think your life is a joke.

175
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,300
Yeah, well...

176
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,540
I'm sorry if I don't trust your sense of humor.

177
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:43,840

That's gone over the line.

That's gone over the line.

Well, that tender moment.

187
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,120
Well, that tender moment.

Pleasure.

We started talking.

191
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,400
And we talked.

192
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,140
Keeping the most important thing, the most important thing.

193
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
You was precious to me.

Yeah.

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,980
Stay at home.

196
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,200
You have.

197
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,020
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well.

198
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,420
I didn't know why I was crying.

199
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,980
And it's just crazy.

200
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,160
If you don't know what's going on, it's not comfortable.

201
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,080
Rubbing her.

202
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,560
Rubbing her.

203
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,060
Her bi mommy.

204
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,020
What, what, what, what?

205
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,560
That feeling.

206
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,300
Balls.

207
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,360
I have no value.

208
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,060
Axe.

209
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,240
Hey, well, let's talk about the other problem.

210
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm so happy.

211
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,880
I'm so happy.

212
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
I think it's one of the best things that could have happened to this country.

213
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,040
Yes.

214
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,360
Yes.

215
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,580
I think of women.

216
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:02,960
Women.

217
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,200
Women who ache to do.

218
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,000
To do.

219
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,000
Prophylactic.

220
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,840
Prophylactic.

221
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,180
Yes.

222
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,060
Those mothers.

223
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,620
Those mothers.

224
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,160
I always suggest when they're in these situations to swallow.

225
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,040
To remedy the situation.

226
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,280
And things.

227
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,720
Shock.

228
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,240
Ball.

229
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,260
Being greedy.

230
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,040
It is.

231
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,420
I was finishing up my patient.

232
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:26,880
Subgirl.

233
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,820
And you know what?

234
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,060
Boy, I got a lot of hate.

235
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,620
Got a lot of hate.

236
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,180
Got a lot of hate.

237
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,200
And then I got.

238
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,380
Got a lot of hate.

239
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,940
Got a lot of hate.

240
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,780
Put a lot of money in the bank.

241
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,280
Money in the bank.

242
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,780
Money in the bank.

243
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,080
In the bank.

244
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,420
In the bank.

245
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,000
People.

246
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,620
Meaning and fulfillment.

247
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,680
Don't make babies.

248
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,300
Babies.

249
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,660
Come.

250
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,280
Come.

251
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:40,980
Every.

252
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,420
Every.

253
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,120
Every.

254
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,620
Every.

255
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,060
Every.

256
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,400
Every.

257
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:43,680
Every.

258
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:43,840
Every.

259
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,860
You're right.

260
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,140
You're absolutely nuts.

261
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,700
It's true.

262
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,340
People.

263
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,360
Squash it.

264
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,180
Rip it up.

265
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,300
Scribble on it.

266
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,880
Throw it away.

267
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,120
Experience it.

268
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,820
You know, I love being a mother.

269
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,900
Oh.

270
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,480
Oh.

271
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,620
Boys need.

272
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,540
Women can get a little piece.

273
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,200
Ooh.

274
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,100
Evidently came in the pool.

275
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,980
The mothers.

276
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,320
Yeah.

277
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,840
I.

278
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,340
I.

279
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:06,960
Hmm.

280
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,480
Hmm.

281
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,500
We're all doing it.

282
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,760
A couple of times.

283
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,040
You know, maybe I'm wrong.

284
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,700
Maybe I'm wrong.

285
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,060
Ha ha.

286
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,620
The mummy.

287
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,100
The mummy.

288
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,260
Mummy.

289
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,460
Mummy.

290
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,640
And there's a lot of resentment and anger.

291
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,280
And.

292
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,420
Uh.

293
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,700
Ha ha ha.

294
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,360
Ha ha ha.

295
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,300
I.

296
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,680
I.

297
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:19,840
I.

298
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,000
We had to come.

299
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,340
S.

300
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,640
S.

301
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:21,860
S.

302
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,300
Got it.

303
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:22,820
Well.

304
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,460
My.

305
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,040
Butt.

306
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,840
Touched.

307
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,760
You feel sexy.

308
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,140
Having sex.

309
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,800
Want women to be sex slaves.

310
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,980
Want women to be sex slaves.

311
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,660
Sex time.

312
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,100
So.

313
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:31,820
So.

314
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,400
Really.

315
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,520
Feel like a man.

316
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,520
And frankly.

317
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,500
And Frank.

318
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,320
He will eat out of your.

319
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,340
So when women are.

320
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,080
So when women are.

321
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,840
Ha ha ha.

322
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,820
Ha ha ha.

323
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,520
Ha ha ha.

324
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:41,740
Ha ha ha.

325
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,200
Ha ha ha.

326
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,480
Ha ha ha.

327
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,040
Ha ha ha.

328
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,260
App.

329
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:44,760
App.

330
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,180
App.

331
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,160
That's nutty.

332
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,480
Yeah.

333
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,500
Isn't that nutty?

334
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,500
Don't you think that's nutty?

335
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:48,800
Nutty.

336
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,040
Nutty.

337
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,960
I like being told.

338
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,940
I like being told.

339
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,580
I like.

340
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,700
Very open.

341
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,380
I didn't have a relationship.

342
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,060
Cult woman.

343
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,820
Cult woman.

344
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,280
Uh.

345
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:56,620
Uh.

346
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,420
Very narcissistic.

347
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,100
Very hard.

348
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,120
I feel bad.

349
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,740
Rob yourself.

350
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,400
Hmm.

351
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:00,760
Hmm.

352
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,120
Yes.

353
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,480
Hmm.

354
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:01,760
Hmm.

355
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,220
Ha ha ha.

356
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:02,960
Yes.

357
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,180
Yes.

358
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
And as we rep.

359
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,380
Rep.

360
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,580
Rep.

361
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:04,760
Rep.

362
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:04,880
Rep.

363
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,480
Now sex is nothing simple such as smoking or lie.

364
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,980
I see a lot of goodness in a teasing glance of thine.

365
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:31,200
I think I'll reevaluate lascivious behavior and declare this incarnation a new pro-sex

366
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,080
kind of savior.

367
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,760
Libido is a freaky thing.

368
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,800
I find it fairly vexing.

369
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,700
And sure it's true it's cooler when you love the gal you're sexing.

370
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,600
But horny pairs who wish to share in hopping in the sack-o are twice as blessed as them

371
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,680
still dressed in holy ipso facto.

372
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,560
Guys and gals and guys and guys and gals and gals.

373
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:08,880
Amen.

374
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,540
One at a time or two or nine.

375
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm thinking.

376
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,000
One at a time.

377
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,400
The birds, the bees, the dogs, the fleas, the meek ones like the rabbit.

378
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,820
All like their fun.

379
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,780
So what's up, nun?

380
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,540
How about you drop that habit?

381
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Now you do think I'm mischievous and lack erotic powers.

382
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,080
But I've had a few direction and it kept me nailed for hours.

383
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,420
The point I make and what to take.

384
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,520
You have a chance.

385
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,360
Don't lose it.

386
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,460
matured於

387
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,440
G todo uma médio

390
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:49,800
Pum was lost.

391
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:49,940
E avemos morido?

392
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:49,940


393
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,320
Cantuamos.

394
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,240
Rápido!

395
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,060
otz serious.

396
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:18,060
Poor dinosaurs lost their jobs, but we do have dinosaurs here as members of the panel.

397
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,380
So I want to start with, well I curse the ground because of man.

398
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,060
I'll destroy all living members of the clergy.

399
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,840
I believe that's the infallible word of 24, and that's the way it's going to be.

400
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,700
This time to be over.

401
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,620
Destroy the theological, religious beliefs.

402
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,320
Perfect.

403
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
And I do appreciate that.

404
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,320
What is there about frozen water that makes you think one religion is more true than another?

405
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,960
What's it going to be, eh?

406
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,220
Is it going to be in and out of institutions like this?

407
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,300
Or are you going to attend to the divine word?

408
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,300
The subgenius.

409
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,600
Power of the subgenius.

410
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,080
This is some new form of torture.

411
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,660
Say it, brother sir.

412
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,660
I hope to God it'll torture you to madness.

413
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,660
And how's that working out?

414
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,400
I hope it's working out for you, listener.

415
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,940
Thanks for that intro, and for the first intro, Mr. Leemur, for this hour of Slack number 1201,

416
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,720
which is on the theme of Jesus and X-Day coming.

417
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,520
Because they are.

418
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,780
Our biggest subgenius annual gathering at Brushwood Folklore Center near Sherman, New York,

419
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:36,640
on July 5th weekend and the prior week, which happens also to coincide with the end of the planet Earth.

420
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,080
More about that soon, but first, credits.

421
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:47,660
Going back in time, the bluegrassy song about the pro-sex savior is from a movie called Ultra Christ.

422
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,660
Look it up.

423
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,800
There were some clips from the 2007 movie Cthulhu.

424
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,520
The collages that mostly didn't have music were by the great Nor El Pref of norelpref.com,

425
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,900
while the more musical collages were by Phineas Narco and National Cynical Radio.

426
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,980
Available at nationalcynical.com.

427
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Those would include the mashup of My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult with Phil Hendry, called Cooler Than Hendry,

428
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,740
and the one about the black and white Jesus, which was Phil Hendry versus Michael Jackson.

429
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,140
From nationalcynical.com.

430
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:34,040
As is this next piece, My Watts, smushing Gary Neumann into Alan Watts.

431
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,840
Starring the famous

432
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,800
Oh, use me, Jesus. Use me.

433
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,420
Oh, use me, Jesus. Use me.

434
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,460
Now, you see, if you were brought up in the Bible Belt,

435
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,840
you came out of Arkansas somewhere and that's all the religion you knew,

436
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:04,220
and you had a mystical experience of the type where you suddenly discover that you are one with God.

437
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,480
and you had a mystical experience of the type where you suddenly discover that you are one with God.

438
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,060
then you're liable to get up and say, I'm Jesus Christ.

439
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,920
And lots of people do.

440
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,780
Well, the culture that we live in just can't allow that.

441
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,780
There's only one Jesus Christ.

442
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,760
And sort of you don't look like you were Jesus Christ coming back again

443
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,880
because it's said in the scriptures that when he comes back,

444
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,860
there'll be no doubt about it.

445
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,540
He'll appear in the heavens with legions of angels,

446
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,480
and you're not doing that.

447
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,320
You're just old Joe Doakes that we knew years ago,

448
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,680
and now you say you're Jesus Christ.

449
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Well, he says that when Jesus Christ said he was God,

450
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,940
nobody believed him, and you don't believe again.

451
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,540
You know, you can't answer that argument.

452
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,700
But you see, he says it that way

453
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,480
because he is trying to express what happened to him

454
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:59,080
in terms of a religious language which is circumscribed by the Holy Bible.

455
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,520
He's never read the Upanishads.

456
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,460
He's never read the Diamond Sutra.

457
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,000
He's never read the Tibetan Book of the Dead or the I Ching or the Lao Tzu.

458
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,060
And therefore, there is no other way in which he can say this.

459
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,960
But if he had read the Upanishads,

460
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,140
he would have had no difficulty,

461
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,340
and nor would the culture, the society in which he was talking,

462
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,400
have any difficulty.

463
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,440
Because it says in the Upanishads,

464
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,880
we are all incarnations of God.

465
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,020
Only they don't mean by the word.

466
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,000
In fact, they don't use that word.

467
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,860
They use Brahman.

468
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,780
They don't mean the same thing that a Hebrew meant by God.

469
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,560
Absolutely not.

470
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,880
Absolutely not.

471
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,280
Absolutely not.

472
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,560
The Brahman is not personal.

473
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,960
Absolutely not.

474
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,380
Brahman is, we would say, suprapersonal.

475
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,520
Not impersonal, because that is a negation.

476
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,020
But I would say suprapersonal.

477
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,280
Brahman is not he or she.

478
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,720
Has no sex.

479
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,240
Brahman is not the creator of the world.

480
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,620
As something underneath and subject to Brahman.

481
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,080
But the actor of the world.

482
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,600
The player of all the parts.

483
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,080
So that everyone is a mask.

484
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,160
Which is the meaning of the word person.

485
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,660
In which the Brahman plays a role.

486
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,520
And like an absorbed actor,

487
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,060
the divine spirit gets so absorbed in playing the role,

488
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,920
as to become it.

489
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,040
And to be bewitched.

490
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,040
And this is all part of the game.

491
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,160
The mission at hand.

492
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,560
The mission as part of the game.

493
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,260
This game is released, that is to go with,

494
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,120
Pokemon.

495
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,120


496
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,120


497
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,600
For Viola.

498
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,360
For

499
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


500
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


501
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


502
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


503
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


504
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


505
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


506
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


507
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


508
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


509
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,360


510
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,700
I'm ready

511
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,700
I'm ready

512
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,040
For

513
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,680
For

514
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,560
This

515
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,560
The

516
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,260
Game

517
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:30,260


518
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:33,800
This

519
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,020
So

520
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
Is it?

521
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,960
Is it?

522
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,580
Is it?

523
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,460
All my life, I have believed in nothing.

524
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,280
All my life, I have believed in nothing.

525
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,660
VapRDude, thank you so much.

526
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,460
VapRDude, thank you so much.

527
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,460
She is not, she is not at her office.

528
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,300
So if she is not here and she is not there.

529
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,220
She is not, she is not at her office.

530
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,060
So if she is not here and she is not there.

531
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,060
Use everything, leave nothing.

532
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,540
Use everything.

533
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,840
Leave nothing.

534
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,060
Why did those things happen?

535
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,940
Why did those things happen?

536
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,440
Howard Amos, The Howard Amos Show.

537
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,920
Is that them?

538
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,820
Is that them?

539
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,320
Is it?

540
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,600
Is that them?

541
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,020
Is it?

542
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,480
Good afternoon. Thank you so much.

543
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,080
The devil.

544
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,740
Welcome to hell.

545
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,580
He goes by many names.

546
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,680
Satan, Lucifer, Mephistopheles, Beelzebub, Old Nick.

547
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,100
Let's not forget Ryan Seacrest.

548
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,780
I wish I could.

549
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,720
Hello, you're on the air.

550
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,440
I think the idea of the IBM people,

551
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,960
that is, if you can call them people.

552
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,040
The irritable bowel movement?

553
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,200
See, I was going to say that,

554
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,400
and you knew I was going to say that,

555
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,320
so I didn't say that.

556
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,600
I was waiting until a time when it would be,

557
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,620
well, I actually forgot for a brief moment,

558
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,840
but I was thinking maybe incalculable,

559
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,920
impacted, innocuous,

560
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,560
incubus is the one I settled on

561
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,520
because I thought it would show the otherworldliness of it.

562
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,000
Or an international bowel movement.

563
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,580
That's what happens when you're on an airplane crossing the ocean

564
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,920
or perhaps if you're taking a tour of the UN

565
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,940
and have to use the facilities.

566
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,840
Hey, Senator, I just realized you got a line.

567
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,940
Did you know that?

568
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
I'm sorry, Rockner, what?

569
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,580
You've got all your lines tied up.

570
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,740
Stan's trying to call back.

571
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,720
I want to free up a line.

572
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,480
All right, well, thank you for calling.

573
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,500
All right, talk to you later.

574
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,720
Thanks, Rockner.

575
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,500
Here's the sad thing about what's happening.

576
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,720
I hit the wrong button.

577
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,580
All right, well, Buddha, sorry I hung up on you, too.

578
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,220
You hung up on the actual compassionate one himself?

579
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,560
Buddha's not that compassionate.

580
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,160
He doesn't care.

581
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,400
He'll keep calling you back and calling you back

582
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,520
and hoping you get it.

583
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,140
Hey, I actually saw a video of a cow

584
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,240
eating a baby duck the other day.

585
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,180
Was it a zombie cow?

586
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,380
No, this was a real cow.

587
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,220
It's on that YouTube website there.

588
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,380
And it made me think a lot about Buddhism.

589
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,640
Well, it does make you think of Buddhism,

590
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,520
but at the same time, you can't really, you know,

591
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,760
in your mind's eye, see the compassionate one as a zombie, can you?

592
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,540
If you came back to life.

593
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,560
If you came back, well, there you go.

594
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,040
That's all beyond religion, for sure.

595
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,720
That's the thing.

596
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,640
We're all kind of, like, covered in this zombie glaze right now.

597
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,600
So it's hard to really tell who's illuminated from without

598
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,400
and who's illuminated from within because we're all shiny from it.

599
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,280
I, for one, welcome our new zombie overlords.

600
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,520
I do believe that zombies are our morals.

601
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,420
We're all superiors in every way.

602
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,060
I also carry a flashlight, so illumination's easy.

603
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,020
Did you hold it under your chin and go,

604
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,780
I want to eat your brain?

605
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,600
Stuff like that?

606
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,160
Sure, why not?

607
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,040
Well, it looks cool.

608
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,340
Well, that's about all it does, though, unfortunately.

609
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,340
It just scares some children and causes some weird little nervous pomeranians

610
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,760
to bark real loud and stuff.

611
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,420
I can think of no higher calling.

612
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,120
Fear can be a path to illumination.

613
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,400
Well.

614
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,780
Was Rocknard talking about the defecation of our economic system?

615
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,920
I think it was pre-defecated.

616
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,920
It was pre-defecated?

617
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,020
Just like that cow regurgitating that duck.

618
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,020
That's what you didn't see.

619
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,800
That's what you YouTube guys never see,

620
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,320
is when the duck is actually back in the cow's mouth and it's...

621
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,260
Never mind.

622
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,240
Maybe the duck was trying to eat the cow.

623
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,860
How does a cow digest a duck, you know what I mean?

624
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,660
Do they have to, like, you know, chew its cud on a duck?

625
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,100
Yeah.

626
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,480
I wonder.

627
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:58,600
I wonder.

628
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,840
And besides, since they don't really digest things in their stomach,

629
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,580
that duck, I mean, they don't...

630
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,500
Probably got puked up later.

631
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,080
Yeah.

632
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,500
That duck wanted a burger.

633
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,100
He had a plan.

634
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,100
The duck probably had a little bit of burger while it was down there waiting

635
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,320
because they have two stomachs.

636
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,720
Not ducks.

637
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,440
I mean, ducks only have one that I know of.

638
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,380
But cows have two stomachs, and one is, like, where the cud goes

639
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,700
and waits until it's something else, and then it goes to something else.

640
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,220
Only two?

641
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,440
I thought it was, like, four.

642
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,420
Really?

643
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,360
I don't know.

644
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,380
I'm not sure how many stomachs.

645
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:28,680
I don't want to say.

646
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,740
They're multi-bowled and multi-stomached.

647
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,060
Just like the multinationals that are moving.

648
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,220
Like, IBM is actually moving to China, or they want to.

649
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,440
The, uh...

650
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,220
Oh, gosh, what's that?

651
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,840
Lenovo.

652
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,020
Lenovo, that's the new spin-off.

653
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,740
That's the spin-off company that makes the computers now that IBM used to make.

654
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,040
It's a Chinese company.

655
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,560
Yeah.

656
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,540
So the, um...

657
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,660
But as far as digestive tract comparing mammals to birds,

658
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,960
I'm glad we don't have cloacas.

659
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,180
I'm glad it has made...

660
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,300
Heaven happy that the emperor will also be happy.

661
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,200
Yes.

662
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,080
Father, son, holy cow!

663
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,100
Well, well

664
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,980
Moses went up to the mountain high

665
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,200
To find out from God why did you make us?

666
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:28,900
Why?

667
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,700
Secret words in a secret room

668
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,640
He said, wop, bop, a-loo, bop, a-lop, bam, boom

669
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,640
I did not put you here to suffer

670
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,380
I did not put you here to whine

671
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,180
I put you here to love one another

672
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,560
And to get out and have a good time now, now, now

673
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,660
Let my people go, go, go

674
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,520
You gotta let my people go, go, go

675
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,640
Let my people go, go, go

676
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,760
You gotta let my people go

677
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,240
Yeah

678
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,500
Josh and Victor battle in Jericho

679
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,540
He tell the boys with the horns

680
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,320
Get down and blow

681
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,000
They rear back, aim their bells at the stars

682
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,640
He said, wop, bop, a-loo, bop, a-lop, bam, boom

683
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,840
I did not put you here to suffer

684
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,780
I did not put you here to whine

685
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,520
I put you here to love one another

686
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,000
And to get out and have a good time now, now, now

687
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,260
Let my people go, go, go

688
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,280
You gotta let my people go, go, go

689
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,620
Let my people go, go, go

690
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,000
You gotta let my people go

691
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,880
What'd I say?

692
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,480
Now, when Jesus went out for a walk with his mother

693
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,920
The scribes and the Pharisees

694
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,460
Plotting hugger-mugger

695
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,140
They locked him up and they threw away the key

696
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,980
He said, why is everybody always picking on me?

697
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,020
I did not put you here to suffer

698
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,860
No, I did not put you here to whine

699
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,520
I put you here to love one another

700
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, I said, now, get out and have a good time now, now, now

701
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,620
Let my people go, go, go, go

702
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,940
You gotta let my people go, go, go

703
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,420
Let my people go, go, go, go

704
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,760
You gotta let my people go, go, go

705
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,220
You gotta let my people go, go, go

706
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,340
You gotta let my people go, go, go

707
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:14,400
Let my people go, go, go

708
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,200
You gotta let my people go, go, go

709
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,840
You gotta let my people go, go, go

710
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,640
You gotta let my people go, go, go

711
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,560
Sing in time...

712
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,800
The Bible does.

713
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,340
Bugs Bunny, Roadrunner, it's fairytale, and I don't believe that is the case.

714
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,240
Everything is one.

715
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,220
And that gives me great joy because...

716
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,440
What? What?

717
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,440
That is irrational, that is primitive.

718
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,480
Uncreative, fuck, fuck, up and down, hot, hot, fuck you.

719
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,460
Actually, yes.

720
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,080
As best as man, as best as man.

721
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,340
Totally irrelevant to me, I'm just being honest with you because I experienced my life.

722
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,720
And, and, um, dumb, dumb, no one boy, you know, it's not going to work for you.

723
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,040
It's, it's not the truth.

724
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,760
And making things up, upside down.

725
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,120
Let's create a religion.

726
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,760
Eating chicken wings.

727
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,560
Belief is a cover-up for insecurity.

728
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,340
All belief is a cover-up.

729
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:22,920
For insecurity.

730
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:29,800
And the most fervent believers in the world are the cause of all the problems in the world right now.

731
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,560
You know?

732
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,600
You know, who causes their own mess?

733
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,720
Ignorance.

734
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,200
Some boogeyman out there.

735
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,860
Choose evolution or entropy.

736
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,240
And our boogeyman is Bob.

737
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,040
Friends, thanks to Noral Pref for that cut as well as the next two to come.

738
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,140
And the song before that, Let My People Go, was the one song by The Rain.

739
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,200
And it was a hit.

740
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,080
It was the first hit of the kind that ever became an actual, what you would call, hit.

741
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,760
One hundred years ago is when that happened.

742
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:06,300
Prior to that and more coming up was and is from Radio Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

743
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:14,880
Hosted by Dr. Sinister with call-in guests Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Dr. Aganfly, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

744
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,120
The music in the background is by The Amino Acids, who will be at next day.

745
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,100
But now, I must ask you.

746
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,940
Oh!

747
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:29,120
Oh, many of you out there by radio truly believe in that man J.R. Bob Dobbs as your short-nuration personal savior.

748
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,600
Ten percent of us believe that there is, believe that there is a God.

749
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,340
We seem to be pushed around.

750
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,760
Don't believe in God.

751
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,900
Don't believe in God.

752
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,800
Worship a broom.

753
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,780
Worship a broom.

754
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,700
I could really worship a broom.

755
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:51,160
Remove God from, from America entirely and, uh, you can't even now use the, use the word.

756
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,680
I ain't forcing it down your throat.

757
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,100
I ain't forcing it down your throat.

758
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,540
I don't care what you believe in.

759
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,100
Religion.

760
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,800
Warp their minds.

761
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,400
Here's Dobbs.

762
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,300
Hello, Dobbs.

763
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,680
Dobbs.

764
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,060
Dobbs.

765
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,800
Goofy.

766
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,600
Goofy.

767
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,360
Goofy.

768
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,120
Goofy.

769
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,100
I like Dobbs.

770
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,880
That's crazy.

771
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,600
That's crazy.

772
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,660
Sit and think.

773
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,540
Sit and think.

774
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,420
Game, game, game, game, game, game, game.

775
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,740
Eliminate.

776
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,240
You know, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs.

777
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,900
Oh, I'm traumatized.

778
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,480
Our rights come from Dobbs if you eliminate Dobbs.

779
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,040
Uh, it, and, uh.

780
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,680
Uh, it, and, uh.

781
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,320
Everything is rap, rap, rap.

782
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, humanity.

783
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,380
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs.

784
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,140
Ted Bundy.

785
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,880
Ted Bundy.

786
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,100
I remember being a kid with Ted Bundy.

787
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,400
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

788
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,300
Well, I did.

789
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,280
Well, I did.

790
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,140
Ted Bundy.

791
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,660
Pornography.

792
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,280
Pornography.

793
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,240
Pornography.

794
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,440
Ted Bundy.

795
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,820
He wanted me to come.

796
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,880
He wanted me to come.

797
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,600
Pornography.

798
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,440
Got a dick.

799
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:43,680
Dick.

800
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,240
Pornography.

801
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,520
Pornography continues.

802
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,360
Dobbs, Dobbs.

803
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,940
Thank you very much.

804
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,440
Thank you very much.

805
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,040
Goofy.

806
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,820
Goofy.

807
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:49,580
Goofy.

808
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,380
I like Dobbs.

809
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,940
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?

810
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,640
We'll take all afternoon.

811
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,680
Michael is terrified of Bob.

812
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,120
What do you think?

813
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,060
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.

814
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,680
Those minds aren't going to sweep themselves.

815
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,860
We're in.

816
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,720
I have sent for you, Dodgers, because we are facing a crisis.

817
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,780
The world's supply of Illudium Fosdex, the shaving cream atom,

818
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,820
is alarmingly low.

819
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,060
Now, we have reason to believe that the only remaining source is on Planet X.

820
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,980
The old world is dying and we are giving birth to the new.

821
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,340
Look!

822
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,520
They come!

823
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,860
But I really need you to tell me what's going on here.

824
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,060
I'm not allowed.

825
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,620
These people are freaks, man.

826
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,640
They're friggin' cuckoo.

827
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,780
Vic, look.

828
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,420
You need to relax, all right?

829
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,760
I'm sorry.

830
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,860
Can you tell me what the mission is?

831
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,620
The teacher says we were chosen.

832
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,560
Chosen?

833
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
What does that mean?

834
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,780
When the sun comes up in the morning, the teacher is going to take us to the new world.

835
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,540
He says we can live there forever.

836
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,420
And where is this place?

837
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,960
On the other side of the universe.

838
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,300
Did you hear that, man?

839
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,700
This is some kind of...

840
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,320
Frickin'...

841
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,160
Hail Bob or Bob or some kind of Heaven's Gate kind of suicide cult, man.

842
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,180
Freaks!

843
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:25,480
Vic!

844
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,400
Please!

845
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,060
Libby.

846
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,700
Libby, did the teacher tell you how he was going to take you there?

847
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,960
We will come to X-Day!

848
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,720
Shut up, pink boy.

849
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,480
That was actually the fr-

850
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,200
I don't mean you.

851
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,900
The listener.

852
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,680
Those were the first-

853
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,060
First transmissions we received from Planet X.

854
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,820
Tuned into a CB car radio in Dr. Drummond's Bobmobile.

855
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,380
At random.

856
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,820
Randomly scanning the channels, we heard those fateful words.

857
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,440
Shut up, pink boy.

858
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,560
And so they shall shut up.

859
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,540
On July 5th, 1998.

860
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,200
Which could be any second now.

861
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,600
Although it's convenient for us.

862
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,960
To just name July 5th of every year.

863
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,640
To remind us to ask ourselves.

864
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,820
Am I ready?

865
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,100
Am I ready?

866
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,500
Or did I just come to X-Day because I thought it was a funny joke?

867
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,980
Oh yeah.

868
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,320
Bob's take off on other crackpot religions.

869
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:41,860
Yeah.

870
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,380
He was just making fun of the Jehovah's Witnesses.

871
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:44,960
Heaven's Gate.

872
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,280
Uh huh.

873
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,760
Or Jim Jones.

874
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,860
Speaking of which.

875
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,440
Children.

876
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,000
Take the Kool-Aid.

877
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,140
On 7 AM.

878
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,780
So many of you come to X-Day.

879
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,720
You come so far.

880
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,720
From many distant climes.

881
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,880
And yet.

882
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,280
At 7 AM.

883
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,380
There are so few who've been able to withstand the hangovers.

884
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,600
And the travails of the night before.

885
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,220
So few professional X-Day goers.

886
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,740
Who've actually dragged their asses.

887
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,560
Out at 6 30 in the morning.

888
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,080
Every X-Day.

889
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,400
On the other hand.

890
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,520
Some of you drag your asses out of bed at 6 30 in the morning.

891
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,980
Every god damn day.

892
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,680
I am not one of those.

893
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,340
Anymore.

894
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,580
And so.

895
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,420
When I get up at 6 30 on X-Day morn.

896
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,260
To come down here to the pavilion at 7 AM.

897
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,880
And await the saucers in faith.

898
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,900
And I keep up the FIB.

899
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,980
The faith in Bob.

900
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,020
I feel that I'm.

901
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,160
You know how Jesus died for the sins.

902
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,460
And Bob wears polyester for the sins of the pinks.

903
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,160
I get up at 7 AM.

904
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,500
Or 6 30 AM.

905
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,800
Once a year.

906
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,120
Because I'm thinking of you poor suckers.

907
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,080
That have day jobs.

908
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,840
And when we talk about the excess friends.

909
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,440
We're not talking about your.

910
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,800
Flying saucers.

911
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,860
Made of metal.

912
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,700
That crash in New Mexico.

913
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,180
And get reverse engineered.

914
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,800
By the Z-Rocks corporation or what not.

915
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,360
No sir.

916
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,920
We're not talking about.

917
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,120
We love to talk about the saucers arriving.

918
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,700
But the excess are so advanced.

919
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,080
They don't even need bodies.

920
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
They're so advanced.

921
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,440
They don't even need money.

922
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,480
And yet.

923
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,180
They take it anyway.

924
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,080
Like Bob.

925
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,760
Bob doesn't need money.

926
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,120
He only needs your belief.

927
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,920
And how can he.

928
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,460
How can that belief be proved.

929
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,840
Until you are willing.

930
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,540
To give up.

931
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,180
The thing that's most important to you.

932
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,460
More important than your parents.

933
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,580
Your children.

934
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,580
Your brothers and sisters.

935
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,480
Your money.

936
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,380
Well that's wonderful.

937
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,300
That means we can get off.

938
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,060
No you can't.

939
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,280
Why have you stayed hidden from us all this time?

940
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,280
Because contact with my own species has always disappointed me.

941
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,940
Solitude gives me freedom of mind.

942
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,040
And independence of action.

943
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,800
Why have you picked this particular town.

944
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


945
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


946
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


947
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


948
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


949
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


950
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


951
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


952
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


953
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,820


954
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,120
And time to interrupt this solitude.

955
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,140
I'll tell you.

956
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,300
I don't believe personally in aliens.

957
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:23,760
I mean.

958
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,420
Do you?

959
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,000
I don't think it's a question of whether or not you believe in aliens.

960
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,460
I think if you believe in aliens or.

961
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,260
I think it's obvious that there's other life forms out there.

962
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,180
I don't think it's a belief system really.

963
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,300
It's not really obvious that there are other.

964
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,200
It's not a planet that can support life.

965
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,360
It's not obvious that there are other life forms out there.

966
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,500
It's obvious that the possibility is very real.

967
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,740
And that the universe is vast.

968
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,920
And you know.

969
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,000
What is life?

970
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,040
How do we define life?

971
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,160
There's definitely no zero.

972
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,960
Self replicating molecules that.

973
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,340
There's definitely no zero probability of it.

974
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,980
It has to exist somewhere.

975
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,100
But the vastness of space is just so vast.

976
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,200
That it makes it very theoretically challenging.

977
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,700
It's one of those questions that we are not equipped to answer right now.

978
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,020
Oh no.

979
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,300
I can answer their question.

980
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,780
They will come on July 5th 1998.

981
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,720
Whenever you want.

982
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


983
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


984
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


985
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


986
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


987
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


988
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


989
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


990
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


991
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


992
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


993
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,720


994
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:15,980
Whenever that is.

995
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,640
It's that simple.

996
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,580
Whenever that is.

997
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,160
Whenever that is.

998
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:25,920
I think once in a while you just rip in and just laying out exactly where them X's come

999
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,280
from.

1000
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,340
And what their real, real, real, real agenda is.

1001
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,700
Which you so well espoused throughout these years.

1002
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,340
What year is it in the year?

1003
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,200
But we rarely hear this in an ectoplasmic of spirit.

1004
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,680
I mean an auditorium.

1005
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,680
You know on the public platform.

1006
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,360
Like that.

1007
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:45,720
Like that.

1008
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


1009
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


1010
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


1011
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,420
I tell you if you can get arrested for doing that on a public platform.

1012
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,900
That's been a problem at various X days.

1013
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,480
People wanting to commingle with various.

1014
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,520
That only happened once.

1015
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,060
The infamous floating object in the hot tub.

1016
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,660
That was a one time thing.

1017
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,400
I can tell you this though.

1018
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,900
Turned out to be a Baby Ruth candy bar.

1019
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,240
If you know a band.

1020
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,880
If you hear about a band called the Date Rapists.

1021
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,900
Don't invite them to your party.

1022
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,720
Oh my God.

1023
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:15,720


1024
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,620
I think everybody who remembers getting invited to a pool party.

1025
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,300
When they were younger and stuff.

1026
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,360
Did have a sudden urge to go.

1027
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,840
Just as soon as you hit the water.

1028
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,060
Just as if it was something that you were meant not to do.

1029
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,500
That you had to suddenly do.

1030
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,900
You know some existential angst had taken you over.

1031
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,540
And you're just like.

1032
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,140
I'm going to put a Tootsie Roll in this pool.

1033
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,480
Just because I'm not supposed to.

1034
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,480
It's like the big red button that says do not press this button.

1035
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,240
Yep.

1036
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,360
The shiny candy bar.

1037
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,720
You can't press the big red button.

1038
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,420
Do not press.

1039
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
The history erase button.

1040
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:52,420
Right here.

1041
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:52,420


1042
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:52,800
Yeah.

1043
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,800
Doug is here to see you.

1044
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,340
Yeah I'll be right out.

1045
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:54,600
Okay.

1046
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,660
That'll be just one minute.

1047
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,800
Doug.

1048
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,540
Bob.

1049
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,200
Good to see you.

1050
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,040
Come on in.

1051
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,500
It's through here.

1052
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,160
Now help me out here Doug.

1053
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,020
You were interested in a memory of.

1054
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,600
Yeah.

1055
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,300
Mars.

1056
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,460
To be perfectly honest with you Doug.

1057
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,940
If outer space is your thing.

1058
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,940
I think you would be much happier with one of our Saturn cruises.

1059
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,280
Everybody raves about them.

1060
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,660
Okay.

1061
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,940
You're the boss.

1062
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,840
Mars it is.

1063
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,640
Now let me see.

1064
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,380
Basic Mars package will run you 899 credits.

1065
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,620
Now that's for two full weeks of memories.

1066
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,760
Complete in every detail.

1067
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,100
If you want a longer trip that'll cost you a little more because it's a deeper implant.

1068
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,880
Well first of all Doug let me tell you when you go recall you get nothing but first class

1069
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,300
memories.

1070
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,900
Private cabin on the shuttle.

1071
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,220
Deluxe suite at the Hilton plus all the major sites.

1072
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,420
Mount Pyramid.

1073
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,200
The Grand Canal.

1074
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1075
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1076
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1077
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1078
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1079
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1080
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1081
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1082
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1083
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1084
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1085
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,260


1086
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,500
The Grand Canal.

1087
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,660
And of course.

1088
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:47,920
Venusville.

1089
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,840
As real as any memory in your head.

1090
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,820
No I'm telling you Doug.

1091
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,400
Your brain will not know the difference.

1092
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,220
And that's guaranteed.

1093
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,060
Or your money back.

1094
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,860
I claim this planet in the name of Mars.

1095
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,100
Isn't that lovely?

1096
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,520
It's great to talk to you Sang.

1097
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,200
It's been a while.

1098
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,640
I was actually working.

1099
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,300
Oh you must be the guy with the bob shark.

1100
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,800
I'm Dr. Agonfly.

1101
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,260
I think you're the guy with the bob shark.

1102
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,260


1103
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,260


1104
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,260


1105
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,260


1106
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,260


1107
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,260


1108
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,260


1109
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,180
I think you might remember me.

1110
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,900
Oh oh oh oh oh okay yeah.

1111
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,020
No I didn't recognize your voice over the phone but uh.

1112
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,420
I think we had a cup of coffee at uh some sort of uh subgenius festival one time.

1113
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,380
Some sort of coffee?

1114
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:28,900
Yeah yeah sure.

1115
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,780
I bet you haven't made it to Cali yet.

1116
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,380
I don't know I remember how you uh.

1117
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,120
Some sort of.

1118
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,780
You're in San Angelo now huh?

1119
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,120
Yeah I'm on my way to Ex Day actually.

1120
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,560
I've already begun my trip.

1121
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,980
I will be doing the subgenius couch crashing tour on the way.

1122
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,640
Oh my god.

1123
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,240
That's a long trip.

1124
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:45,620
That's a long way.

1125
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,140
Well well at least somebody's coming to Ex Day.

1126
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,820
Yep.

1127
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,840
This is going to be a quiet one I think.

1128
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,060
Everybody's broke.

1129
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,740
Maybe you'll get one of the multiple homicide guys.

1130
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,860
Everybody heard I was coming too.

1131
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,540
You know the the going postal guys will come to Ex Day and expect to find more than three

1132
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,980
people there sleeping in the sun while somebody's ranting.

1133
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:13,440
I keep expecting a going postal guy you know I mean and I suspect we're not I'm not the

1134
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,240
only one who kind of has that.

1135
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:20,140
I expect a going postal guy but by definition those guys always kill all the wrong people.

1136
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,200
Well yeah.

1137
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,480
So I know I'd survive.

1138
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,680
Yeah well maybe you should offer that as some kind of commercial you know PR thing come

1139
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,220
to Ex Day there's no chance that one of those guys you're gonna well no wait maybe.

1140
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,260
You know the very first Ex Day somebody uh right at the end of the festival I was up

1141
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,560
there blathering away thanking people for being there and somebody got tired of it and

1142
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,620
walked up on stage pulled out a handgun.

1143
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,240
Pointed at me.

1144
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,460
Pointed it at me and shot.

1145
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:52,620
And of course it was merely a starter pistol and it was Dr. Legume.

1146
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:59,860
But I fell down and the funny thing is nobody did a thing the musicians didn't stop playing

1147
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,360
or anything.

1148
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,520
The show must go on.

1149
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:07,340
It was a perfectly realistic death scene and then and then everybody just stood there it's

1150
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,580
like man.

1151
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,300
When Bob got shot it was a huge uproar.

1152
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,880
Oh no Bob shot.

1153
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:19,660
Everybody was screaming and yelling and gnashing their hair and pulling their teeth out.

1154
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,120
For one thing you're not Bob.

1155
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,500
But second of all.

1156
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,220
I knew Bob and you're no Bob.

1157
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,420
But second of all why would anybody be disturbed by Bob getting shot.

1158
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,420
Gosh he'll be fine.

1159
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,180
He'll be just fine.

1160
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,780
Well I mean it was yeah sure he was asking for it but um but you don't know what it's

1161
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:43,600
like when you know when you actually see somebody get shot that's a pretty traumatic event.

1162
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:49,020
Stan you gotta remember you at that time you were in the ages of squibs and uh and uh

1163
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,520
center flies and all kinds of like uh you know acoustical ceilings that's not a real

1164
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,780
gunshot sound there you know that's that's a cap gun or something.

1165
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,540
No look man I was at Dealey Plaza I know what a real shooting looks like.

1166
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,680
But there were no there were no blood bags no squibs you know there were no no shooting

1167
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,700
out any any uh plasma on the floor of the place.

1168
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,860
I was in the basement of the Dallas jail when Lee Harvey got shot man.

1169
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,480
I know what it's like I know what physical violence is like and you just don't.

1170
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,060
You were what all of 10 years old then?

1171
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,680
You don't just lay there and well I guess you know at X Day I can see how they'd just

1172
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,480
they'd be so full of flack they'd go oh look somebody just got killed oh well.

1173
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:38,100
Oh well who cares X Days are coming the future looks grin as Reverend Sodi said on

1174
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,980
allthoughtslack.

1175
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,720
What we just heard was of course radio synesthesia.

1176
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,220
From WCSB Cleveland before that many clips and uh Clutters.

1177
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:55,540
From Noro Pref, Mr. Sister, Neuromancin, uh the movies Believers, Mysterious Island, Total

1178
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,300
Recall and Cthulhu or pronounced Cluloo.

1179
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:05,480
Which we also have to thank along with Sweetness McGee for this preview of the upcoming X Day

1180
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:05,720
12.

1181
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,840
I implore you not to turn away.

1182
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,700
The most wonderful thing in the world.

1183
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:12,700


1184
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:12,700


1185
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,820
The most wonderful thing you could ever imagine.

1186
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,840
Eternal life.

1187
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,540
And in the hall of Cthulhu we shall dwell forever.

1188
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,220
I trust we've managed to plumb an heir out of you.

1189
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,840
I cared for your mother a great deal.

1190
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:42,040
But what's two years on a life or 10 or even a hundred when it's not going to last anyway.

1191
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,700
I'm sorry.

1192
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,780
Our bodies will last a hundred thousand years in the sea.

1193
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:55,120
They drive and drive the highways we built even though it's destroying their world.

1194
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,520
Great Cthulhu carries us.

1195
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,500
They keep moving, searching.

1196
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,440
They look into his eye for it.

1197
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,620
All they have is the moment and they can't bear it.

1198
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,340
They can't bear our death.

1199
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,500
the loneliness of it.

1200
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,920
When the waters rise into their cities,

1201
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,500
everything shall be ours with you to lead us, my glorious son.

1202
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,800
Oh, the sick room.

1203
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,620
Oh, the air. The air is almost unbreathable.

1204
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,420
No clothes on.

1205
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,020
Gaunt.

1206
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,620
Vacant eyes.

1207
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,180
Oh, rose.

1208
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1209
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,340
Betrayed.

1210
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,440
Betrayed.

1211
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,380
More than they do.

1212
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,540
They're gonna bring them to the factory

1213
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,900
with a heart attack machine.

1214
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,440
It's strapped across their shoulders

1215
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,700
and in the car seat.

1216
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,140
It's brought down from the castles

1217
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,620
by the insurance men who go

1218
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,120
just to see that no one is escaping

1219
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,320
to desolation row.

1220
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,340
Joe.

1221
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:38,320
Joe.

1222
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,480
I'm talking to you. You're listening to me.

1223
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,200
What's the answer?

1224
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,780
Ten little words for my name.

1225
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,380
You're giving up quicker than usual, Tony.

1226
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,580
Just tell me the goddamn word.

1227
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,140
Palindrome.

1228
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,120
Your name's a palindrome.

1229
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:54,700
Palindrome.

1230
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,660
What's that? Huh?

1231
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,700
You making fun of me?

1232
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,700
Is that something bad?

1233
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,860
Spelled the same way forwards and back.

1234
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,400
It's like the phrase,

1235
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,880
Madam and Eden, I met him.

1236
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,920
It's a palindrome.

1237
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,240
And it's the same way it begins.

1238
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,660
Oh, I get it.

1239
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,960
So it's like the name Bob.

1240
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,840
That's one too, right?

1241
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,120
Is this the ghost milk hotline?

1242
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,140
You're listening to the emergency broadcast system.

1243
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,960
Please be advised, this is not a test.

1244
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,100
Violence is taking place in post-heteronormative...

1245
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:59,680
There's a lady buying a stairway.

1246
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,180
What's the matter with you? Come on!

1247
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,280
I'm sorry.

1248
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:09,640
I'm sorry.

1249
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:10,500
I'm sorry.

1250
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:11,320
I'm sorry.

1251
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:11,860


1252
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:11,860


1253
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:11,860


1254
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:11,860


1255
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:11,860


1256
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:11,920
I'm sorry.

1257
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,840
I'm sorry.

1258
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,060
I'm sorry.

1259
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,100


1260
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,100


1261
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,100


1262
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,100


1263
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,100


1264
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,800
Joe!

1265
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:31,800


1266
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:31,800


1267
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,520
Oh.

1268
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,080
Oh.

1269
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:56,840
When you fall asleep before the end of the day

1270
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,540
You start to worry

1271
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,780
Like when a taxi comes to take you away

1272
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,800
When you're in nowhere

1273
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,220
Up at high into the sky

1274
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,980
All the stars still shine so bright

1275
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,040
Above

1276
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,740
At least

1277
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,700
It's not on the other world

1278
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,720
At least

1279
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,820
It's not the end of the world

1280
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,640
We can live in a barge

1281
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,300
Because there's one way out at once

1282
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,800
Let's make a difference

1283
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,320
Turn all the hate in the world

1284
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,620
Into a walking bird

1285
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,960
Make it fly away

1286
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,240
As the light turns grey

1287
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,240
Everything is far from

1288
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,820
A-A-A-OK

1289
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,080
At least

1290
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,760
It's not on the other world

1291
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:38,760


1292
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:38,760


1293
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:38,760


1294
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:38,760


1295
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,000
Not the end of the world

1296
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:43,600
Nothing

1297
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,020
Never

1298
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,140
A-A-A-O

1299
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,860
At least

1300
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,980
It's not on the other world

1301
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,920
Not the end of the world

1302
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,640
Way, way, way, way

1303
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,480
This is nothing

1304
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,220
When people fraud

1305
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,180
The participation

1306
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,760
Till the night

1307
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,200
The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.

1308
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,680
I agree with the second part.

1309
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,260
Good morning! Are you injured?

1310
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,580
The Lord knows why, but it seems not.

1311
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,840
A miracle. I expect you'd like to use my phone.

1312
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,360
Thanks, I would.

1313
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,120
Well, it's right in there.

1314
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,820
All right, all right.

1315
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,320
So, what are you babbling about?

1316
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,860
The world's an imperfect place.

1317
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,220
What? Over?

1318
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,040
Did you say over?

1319
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:56,380
Uh, yes, friends, Hour of Slack is almost over for this week.

1320
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,780
The world itself ends July 5th, 1998,

1321
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,320
but salvation is available through the Church of the Subgenius and J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1322
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,240
The song mix we just heard,

1323
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,760
Imagine the End of Time,

1324
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,300
The world was by The Kleptones.

1325
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:18,100
That's Kleptones with a K, as in K-L-E-P-Tones.com.

1326
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,020
Before that, Lemur, Cthulhu, The Large,

1327
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:26,560
and the Desolation Row clip was by My Chemical Romance.

1328
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:32,060
You can learn more about Bob and X-Day from subgenius.com,

1329
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,840

7 Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1332
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,400
Once again, that's box 1-8-1-4-1-7,

1333
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,800
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1334
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,560
The zip code is 44118.

1335
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,660
The background music is The Amino Acids

1336
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,780
from their incredible, horrifying album,

1337
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,900
Humanity Will Fall Like Pins.

1338
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,620
Praise Bob.

1339
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,720
In a moment, Lemur.

1340
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,100
In a moment, The Planet Man.

1341
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,360
The Planet Man.

1342
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,900
This is the fascinating story of The Planet Man.

1343
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,580
The Planet Man.

1344
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,280
The Planet Man.

1345
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,660
The Planet Man, victim of his own evil,

1346
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,520
was himself poisoned by FEMA,

1347
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,440
but though badly wounded, he is alive, planning revenge.

1348
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:54,480
US zoomed in on the

1349
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,940
horrifying ещё film.

1350
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,980
The Planet Man named,

1351
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,300
The End

1352
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,420
The End

1353
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,060
Well, I have to go in now. Goodbye.

1354
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:09,260
31110, 13, 13, 13, 130, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 1110, 10, 10, 130, 13.
