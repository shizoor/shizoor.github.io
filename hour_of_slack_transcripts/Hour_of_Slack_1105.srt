1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
The smell of good boys, as they stand in line.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,520
He's there to smell them, all that he can.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,780
To make them smell, he's a good holy.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,440
Some genius, power of science.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:19,960
What?

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,760
How far, what?

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,920
What's a genius?

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,180
That would slam it.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,560
Keep that all deep.

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,540
And then they taste that.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,960
A new car.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,960
And KPVA will receive a million cupcakes.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,700
Giant piles of sugar.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,920
And cups of oil.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,040
Nature's perfect food.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,820
So, it's...

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,680
I get the weirdest mix here.

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,780
The scary thing is, what's happening with...

19
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,120
Oh, yeah?

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,320
Here, let me...

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,720
With...

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,800
Can you...

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,220
What?

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,320
What?

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,980
It's like...

26
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,820
Truth is fiction.

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,480
And this is...

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,080
Be warned, it be not.

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,980
Bule Ismail was the real father of his country.

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,000
He had fathered 540 boys and 340 girls.

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,280
At the age of 8, they warned it.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,120
Leenott.

33
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,620
B Scriptures

34
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,100
Oh, turns on my feet?

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,820
For some reason I felt like its my hail integration

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,420
Because B-

37
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,540
Is harassment forgarmin раз

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:56,300
La- Try to follow the rules.

39
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,200
Now what do you hear?

40
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,080
Oh, you have to say.

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,220
You have to talk.

42
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,880
No change.

43
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,900
There's no change.

44
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,860
Yeah, somewhere in the deep end, they've got something wrong.

45
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,680
It could be as simple as those headphones.

46
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, whatever that is.

47
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,240
Boots in your buddy.

48
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,520
That's what makes me think it's got to be within the electronic bay.

49
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,520
The phantom.

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,180
Yeah, right?

51
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:16,900
Yeah.

52
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,740
They're all asleep.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,020
They're all little callers.

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,560
Out our way with Major Hoople.

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,040
The SFX.

56
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,960
Because it's a show.

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,620
It was a major influence on me, I'm afraid to say.

58
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,900
Side glasses.

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
Grin and Barrett.

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,300
Well, that might not exist.

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,060
You sleep here?

62
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Oh, yeah, we do.

63
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,300
Right on the show.

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,960
So what does that tell you?

65
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,300
Hello.

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,500
The walls are like mine.

67
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,980
They're not like yours.

68
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,260
In what manner are mine like yours?

69
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,620
So they...

70
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,040
It's just the way it is.

71
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,760
What's going on?

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,560
What's going on?

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:04,620


74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,540
Oh, my.

75
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,680
I don't know what's happening.

76
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,220
Oh.

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,940
Folks are having a...

78
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,740
This one sounds much better.

79
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,920
Yeah, no, it's the mix going to those headphones.

80
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,660
Yeah, I'm going to move over here.

81
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,320
They're screwed up.

82
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,260
Let's just say that we're experiencing...

83
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,480
If you want a better listening experience, it sounds like it's in that room or in that

84
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,500
space in your brain.

85
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,540
Why I can move.

86
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,540


87
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,540


88
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,540


89
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,540


90
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,540


91
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,540


92
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,540


93
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,260
I'm just going to sit here just fine, or can.

94
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,460
Sometimes it takes a while to be sure.

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,840
Oh, my God.

96
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,020
I don't know what happened, but...

97
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:39,820
Just...

98
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,120
This is a show.

99
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,640
Relax.

100
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,480
Remember, this is...

101
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,740
Oh, what?

102
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,580
Something began to wake us up.

103
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,680
We're on the air now?

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,640
In fact...

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,700
Hey, Philo, we're on the air now.

106
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,860
Maybe we are asleep.

107
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,720
What?

108
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm asleep?

109
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,700
Oh, God.

110
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,900
No, that is to say, this show is something we could do.

111
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,260
We are.

112
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,500
We are.

113
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:55,500


114
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:55,500


115
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,120
We are not asleep.

116
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,920
So, maybe we are asleep.

117
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,560
But, now...

118
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,660
From PR News, this is the news.

119
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,900
From PR News in Washington, I'm to be tried by tribunals at Guantanamo.

120
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,600
A new report from the FBI finds violent PR news for the second straight year.

121
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,360
There was a slight rise in the overall percent, but the Pentagon says it still considers PR

122
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,560
news unclear, unlawful.

123
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,340
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez jumped by 6%.

124
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,700
On Wall Street, four.

125
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,540
Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expressing his support for the U.S.

126
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,860
and the United States.

127
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,740
He's also expressing concern about PR news in Washington.

128
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,380
PR's bad PR.

129
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,720
But why?

130
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hello, Dr. Sims.

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,640
Good evening, Betty.

132
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,480
Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty.

133
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,740
So, you've really done some growing up since I saw you last.

134
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,180
Thank you.

135
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,720
Hello, Doctor.

136
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,500
Good evening, Dr. Sims.

137
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,720
Would you like to sit over here, Doctor?

138
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,220
Thank you.

139
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,460
Thank you.

140
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,880
I was just telling Betty how quickly she's growing.

141
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,460
She sure is.

142
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,140
We have a hard time.

143
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,260
We have a hard time, hard time, hard time.

144
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,240
Talk to Betty about growing up.

145
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,400
You notice any difference between yourself and some of the older girls, Betty?

146
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,020
Well...

147
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,480
Yes, well, that's perfectly normal.

148
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,600
Believe it or not, believe it or not, you're acting silly, you're acting silly about the

149
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,580
girls who are bigger and who wear bras.

150
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,420
You see, there's nothing wrong with them, Betty.

151
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,860
Shoot up.

152
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,560
Yes.

153
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,060
That's right.

154
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,060
But don't let that bother you.

155
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,800
There's nothing you can do.

156
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,360
There's nothing you can do.

157
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,980
Hurry up, hurry up.

158
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,080
Oh, oh, sample, sample.

159
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,520
I brought some drawings so that you can actually see the things I'm going to describe.

160
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,820
Let's take a look, Betty, at drawing one in this booklet.

161
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,120
You see, you see in the drawing here?

162
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,580
Mm-hmm.

163
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,900
You started out as a very small being, the head of a pin.

164
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,280
First figure here in drawing two.

165
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,760
Can you see this?

166
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,160
Yes.

167
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,740
Isn't that amazing?

168
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,500
It sure is.

169
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,300
In the second figure and in the third figure.

170
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,860
That's right, Betty.

171
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,840
Now, do you have any questions?

172
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,520
Well?

173
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,440
Well, Betty, your dad took your mother.

174
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
I was there too, Betty.

175
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,220
Now look at drawing three.

176
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,060
This is how every girl and woman looks.

177
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,080
You would see as in drawing four, you see here?

178
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,040
Go to the bathroom.

179
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,280
The vagina is capable of being stretched a great deal.

180
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,480
Look at drawing number five.

181
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,900
Now, this is the wonderful thing called, I'm amazed at the wonderful thing that happens.

182
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,780
You know what, Betty?

183
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,620
Your mother cried.

184
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:41,980
Why?

185
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,260
Because she was so happy.

186
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,020
Long, nine, and she kept kissing.

187
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,240
And your dad, why was he happy?

188
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:46,720
Doctor?

189
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,140
Yes.

190
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,260
Look at drawing six here.

191
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,160
Isn't this wonderful, Betty?

192
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,820
It sure is.

193
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,280
Gosh.

194
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,540
Now, Betty, do you have any questions to ask me while I'm here?

195
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,860
Well?

196
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,920
That's a good question, Betty.

197
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll answer it briefly now.

198
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,120
I don't understand, Doctor.

199
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,140
Well, Betty, in order for you to understand how this happens, let's look here at drawing

200
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,460
seven.

201
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,460
Betty, this is called through the vagina, as you see in diagram eight.

202
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,420
Now, this is perfectly normal.

203
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,500
Don't worry about it.

204
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,280
I suppose, Betty, that you've wondered what sanitary napkins are for, haven't you?

205
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,980
As you see here in drawing nine.

206
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,020
Does much come out?

207
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,540
Well, usually only a few tablespoons.

208
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,980
Feel fresh and comfortable.

209
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,680
Your panties.

210
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,060
No, it doesn't hurt, Betty.

211
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,900
You see, Betty, some girls imagine they feel worse than they actually do.

212
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,700
So, pay no attention to a little ache or two.

213
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,020
She's already done that, Doctor.

214
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,180
Well, that's not at all unusual.

215
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,920
Sex organs.

216
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,080
Do you know what love is, Betty?

217
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,160
Well, it's a very special kind of love.

218
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,880
What do you mean, Betty?

219
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,340
Well?

220
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,800
Yes, what about older girls and women?

221
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,120
Well?

222
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,860
Very good, Betty.

223
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,080
Now, let's look at drawing ten.

224
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,740
You see here?

225
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,040
Betty will notice that a man has organs.

226
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,100
What are testicles for, Doctor?

227
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,740
Well, Betty, look at drawing number eleven.

228
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,560
Is that clear, Betty?

229
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,940
Well, not exactly, Doctor.

230
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,700
Well, Betty, let's look at this other organ of the man, as in drawing twelve.

231
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,260
You see here?

232
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,080
It's called a penis.

233
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:42,760
Penis.

234
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,220
Penis.

235
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:43,980
There's an opening.

236
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,420
There's an opening of a sponge material.

237
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,700
This makes the penis get larger and become hard.

238
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,140
This is called an erection.

239
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,020
Very, very small.

240
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,940
Is this clear, Betty?

241
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,920
Yes, it is, Doctor.

242
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,880
Now, another job, Betty.

243
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,180
I want to tell you about something else.

244
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,540
It's really nothing to worry about at all.

245
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,900
Perfectly normal, natural thing.

246
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,780
Doctor, do you think that Betty should know something about masturbation?

247
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,660
Yes, I do, Mary.

248
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,300
Betty rubbed sex organs, causing a sensation of pleasure.

249
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,980
See a minister, priest, or rabbi.

250
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,340
Do you have any questions, Betty?

251
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:06,920
Yes, Doctor.

252
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,700
That's a good question.

253
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,720
Now, here in drawing thirteen.

254
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,600
Can you see this all right, Betty?

255
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,040
Yes, Doctor.

256
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,620
Yes, Betty.

257
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,500
Dr. Sims, won't you stay and have a piece of Betty's cake?

258
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,080
I'd like to.

259
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,500
Thank you.

260
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,660
Well, I think that after tonight's discussion, Betty won't feel embarrassed about coming.

261
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,160
Will you, Betty?

262
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,180
Not anymore, Mother.

263
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,680
I feel a lot better about it now.

264
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,480
You're right, Betty.

265
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,760
In the meantime, this business shouldn't be any problem for you.

266
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,860
Now, let's get to that cake.

267
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,540
Thank you, Betty.

268
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,020
Hello?

269
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,540
Doh.

270
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:25,900
Doh.

271
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,360
Betty, would you get my hat and coat?

272
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,880
Sure, Doctor.

273
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,680
Next time, maybe.

274
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,520
I am too, Mary.

275
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,160
Thanks, Betty.

276
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,200
You're very welcome, Betty.

277
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,860
Hello, I'm Mrs. Butt.

278
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,500
Butt?

279
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,840
That's just so sad.

280
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:37,880
Cheaper.

281
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,560
Cheaper.

282
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,180
Cheaper.

283
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,340
Cheaper.

284
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,460
Cheaper.

285
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,080
You can talk!

286
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,600
Why yes!

287
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,520
Mrs. Butt's body tastes SO GOOD!

288
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,320
It's because I'm so thicc.

289
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,620
I like big butts and I cannot lie, you get sprung, wanna pull up tough, cause you notice

290
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,540
that butt was stuffed!

291
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin', oh baby, I wanna get whipped out, I'm so thicc.

292
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,900
She's got a pack much bags, so-

293
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,280
Shake it!

294
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:04,860
Shake it!

295
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
Shake that healthy butt!

296
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,880
That's right.

297
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,160
Baby got ballet feet with the open cleanness!

298
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,160


299
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,160


300
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,160


301
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,160


302
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,160


303
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,160


304
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,160


305
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,160


306
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,320
We'll see how much thicker I am.

307
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,600
Baby got back.

308
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,780
Thicker, thicker, thicker.

309
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,360
Wow.

310
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Uh, uh.

311
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,420
Wow.

312
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,440
Uh, uh.

313
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,540
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

314
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,100
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna.

315
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,460
Ooh.

316
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,280
Till the break of dawn.

317
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,480
Baby got it going on.

318
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,880
A lot of the Mrs. Butterworths.

319
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,860
So thick, so thick.

320
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,160
Even white boys got the shout.

321
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,120
Baby got back.

322
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,840
But, but, but, but, but, but, but.

323
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,720
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

324
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,400
Baby got back.

325
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,760
And still just as sweet.

326
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,020
Saturday Night Live!

327
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,880
Monday Night Football!

328
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,420
Gilligan's Island!

329
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,200
Flintstones!

330
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:43,960
Jefferson!

331
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,620
There's fucking room to move as a fry cook, man.

332
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,760
You know, I could be manager in two years.

333
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,780
Ordinary fucking people. I hate them.

334
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,160
Me too.

335
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,480
See, an ordinary person spends his life avoiding tense situations.

336
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,500
Repo Man spends his life getting into tense situations.

337
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,760
Gypsy dildo punks!

338
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,140
Wow!

339
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,440
That was intense!

340
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,600
Repo Man's always intense.

341
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm a Repo Man.

342
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,640
What's that?

343
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,440
It's a repossessor.

344
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,460
They take back cars from dildos that don't pay their bills.

345
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,660
Cool, huh?

346
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,360
Looks like sausage.

347
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,700
It's Sausage Otto.

348
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,500
That's a picture of four dead aliens.

349
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,960
Laugh away, you fuck face!

350
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,100
That picture's gonna be on the cover of every major newspaper in two days' time.

351
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,120
I'll kill you.

352
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,820
I'll kill anybody who crosses me.

353
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,480
You know what I mean?

354
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,140
Read that book I gave you.

355
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,400
What book?

356
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,800
Diuretics. Signs of mad overmind.

357
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,780
Uh-uh.

358
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,540
Well, you better read it. And quick.

359
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,420
That book will change your life.

360
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,140
A lot of people don't realize what's really going on.

361
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,660
You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now?

362
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,640
UFOs. How the Mayans invented television.

363
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,180
There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine.

364
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,360
Well, where did all these people come from?

365
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,180
Hm?

366
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,880
The future.

367
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,120
Where'd all these people disappear to?

368
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,100
The past.

369
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:12,960
That's right!

370
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,460
And how'd they get there?

371
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Flying saucers.

372
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,940
Which are really...

373
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,480
Yeah, you got it.

374
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,180
Time machines.

375
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,140
I think a lot about this kind of stuff.

376
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,740
The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.

377
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,820
The least you can do is give me a blow job.

378
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,220
Oh, free? Free, my ass. What do you fucking call me? Huh?

379
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,500
Oh, you know Commie.

380
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,720
Oh, you better not be. I don't want no Commies in my car.

381
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,660
No Christians either.

382
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,080
Roswell, New Mexico.

383
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,840
The New Mexico

384
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,580
The New Mexico

385
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,440
The New Mexico

386
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
The New Mexico

387
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:53,720


388
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,980
The New Mexico

389
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,740
The New Mexico

390
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,420
The New Mexico

391
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,180
The New Mexico

392
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,800
The New Mexico

393
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,140
The New Mexico

394
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,580
The New Mexico

395
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,020
John Wayne was a fag.

396
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,480
The hell did he was?

397
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,660
He was too you boys.

398
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,840
I installed two-way mirrors in his pad in Brentwood.

399
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,440
And he come to the door, he didn't dress.

400
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,800
Fuck this! Let's go do some crimes.

401
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,460
Doobity Doop Wop Wop Say a word again

402
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,460
Come on Duke, let's go do those crimes!

403
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,040
Yeah, let's go get sushi and not pay.

404
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,940
Pernicious nonsense.

405
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,200
I'll show them. I had a lobotomy in the end.

406
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,480
I want you to have my baby.

407
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,980
Drop it, motherfucker!

408
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,700
The lights are growing dim.

409
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,460
I know a life of crime led me to this sorry fate.

410
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,080
I blame society.

411
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,800
Society made me what I am.

412
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,260
That's bullshit. You're a white suburban punk, just like me.

413
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,200
You're gonna be alright, man.

414
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,640
Maybe not.

415
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,320
Some weird fucking shit, eh, bud?

416
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,160
Holy sheep shit!

417
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,240
Read this book?

418
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,640
Now you're ready?

419
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,520
What about our relationship?

420
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,540
Fuck that.

421
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,420
This is intense. This is intense.

422
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,240
Oh, some crazy stuff there, eh?

423
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,100
That was Reverend Norrell Preff's cut-up of Reverend Alex Cox.

424
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,420
This is Reverend Alex Cox's movie Repo Man.

425
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,740
And this is the 1105th hour of slack.

426
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,340
That's a lot of slack, friends.

427
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,960
And that's something we gotta praise Bob for.

428
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,400
And I'm just cutting myself a lot of slack this particular episode

429
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,420
by letting the other subgenius, Artiste, do pretty much all the work.

430
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,100
Since at this recording, I'm mere seconds away from rupturing

431
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,760
with the sex goddesses from Planet X, my friend,

432
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,420
and X-Day, July 5th.

433
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,680
Cause this is a pre-recorded show.

434
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,380
Meanwhile, the KPFA Berkeley Puzzling Evidence Show

435
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,380
has been pre-recordedly most share-worthy,

436
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,920
as has Radio Synesthesia of WCSB in Cleveland,

437
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,400
as also have the great collagiasts,

438
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,560
Fernanda Nande-Lemur,

439
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,620
and elsewhere, Reverend Norrell Preff.

440
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,680
And that covers about all the credits for this whole show.

441
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,360
Actually, so I guess I can...

442
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,480
I guess I can relax and go on back to X-Day drillpackin'

443
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,200
and let this particular hour of slack auto-assemble itself,

444
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,920
if only by virtue of what the old doctors like Philo

445
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,100
heard in the background here with the swingin' love corpses,

446
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,320
can scavenge.

447
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,500
From the flock at large, Bryce Bob.

448
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,300
Now, I got a letter tonight from a listener named...

449
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,600
Let's see what this is about.

450
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,360
Yeah, I actually have this letter. See over here?

451
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm gonna read this letter.

452
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,660
This letter that was found in the street by my wife.

453
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,720
We're walking down the street.

454
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,100
My wife finds a letter.

455
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,940
And this letter is peculiar in that it doesn't have any punctuation.

456
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,460
Pull your wife out, man.

457
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,960
It says,

458
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,400
Adam, I heard what happened. That sucks a lot, you know.

459
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,740
You should not be doin' that.

460
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,240
But I hope you did not know that that was in your drink.

461
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
Your teacher said he only seen you take one drink,

462
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,940
so I hope they believe you,

463
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,540
that you did not know that what was in it.

464
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,420
I hope that... I will be praying every night for you.

465
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,560
I hope you don't have to stay in there for a long time.

466
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,360
That day I talked to Chris Dan,

467
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,340
and she told me what happened.

468
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,500
And I tried to call you so I can talk to you before you go back in.

469
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,820
But I was too late.

470
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,960
Anthony said they picked you up right after you left school.

471
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,140
They are some little bitches,

472
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:22,640
because they didn't let you stay by to say bye to your family first.

473
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,520
I wish I can break you out, but I can't.

474
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,780
That would just make things worse.

475
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,380
If you are in there for a minute,

476
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,860
tell me what person you are going to get that iPod from.

477
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,460
And I can get it before someone gets it first.

478
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,120
Today school is hella gay.

479
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,560
The day is going by hella slow.

480
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,800
Kids are always throwing stuff around the room.

481
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,120
I'm just waiting till someone hits me so I can drop them.

482
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,300
I just have a lot of anger to take out.

483
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,760
I know I should not get in a fight,

484
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,420
but I know I will if I get hit with something.

485
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,720
I'm going to be a bitch.

486
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,800
I'm going to make them look like a bitch.

487
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,680
The end.

488
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,220
Isn't that something?

489
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,860
That's what the youth of today think is good communication.

490
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,160
One youth of today.

491
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,100
Just like the one listeners to the show.

492
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,640
Yes, youth holds the promise.

493
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,820
You keep laughing, laughing boy, and then one day...

494
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,440
Oh, we can laugh now, but that person will be taking care of you.

495
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,740
You keep laughing, laughing boy, and then one day...

496
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


497
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,340
You keep laughing, laughing boy, but there's no karma in there.

498
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,360
Yeah, no karma.

499
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,880
Laughing boy, that was a...

500
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,700
Laughing Boy, 1967.

501
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,560
It was a novel about...

502
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,360
And here's one from 1969.

503
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,820
Tree-walking brain-socking doctors.

504
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,400
Guess what?

505
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,340
Guess what would taste good right now to everyone in the car?

506
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,040
Garbage.

507
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,640
We've got your favorite kind at the concession stand.

508
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,480
Come on down and pick out the kinds you want to enjoy during the rest of the show.

509
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,440
Be sure to get plenty because everyone likes garbage.

510
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,000
And our big variety is chosen to please everybody's taste.

511
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,480
Honestly, I don't necessarily believe in democracy all the time.

512
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,840
I mean, like, it's the...

513
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,720
I believe in perhaps...

514
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,420
It's the best thing we've got so far, but honestly, I would put restrictions on there.

515
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,020
I mean, like, we've got people showing up to vote who have not even read what it is they're voting on.

516
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,520
And I think that that is the greatest crime of all.

517
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,140
You look at Congress, and they commit that crime all the time.

518
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,940
Congress is worse than the American electorate.

519
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,040
You know, the pieces of legislation they pass in Congress, they're hundreds of pages long.

520
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,900
And how many of the congressmen have actually read the weighty legislation they're voting on?

521
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,220
Not that many.

522
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,500
Not that many.

523
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,340
They'll have...

524
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,360
They have their congressional staff read it for them, and the staff will just...

525
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,080
You know, they're all just college kids.

526
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,280
You know?

527
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,440
Who don't sleep enough.

528
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,940
And, you know, they're all like...

529
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
How much attention are they really paying when they read it?

530
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,920
And they just tell their boss, thumbs up or thumbs down, and the boss votes a quarter.

531
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,020
And they vote accordingly.

532
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,340
And that's terrible.

533
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,420
That's terrible.

534
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,080
You know?

535
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,500
No grassroots is what it's all about.

536
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,340
You're talking about right there.

537
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,360
People should read the things they're voting on.

538
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,060
You know how long it takes me to vote in a typical election if there's enough issues in the ballot?

539
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,340
I can be in the booth for an hour.

540
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,560
I will take an hour to vote.

541
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,800
If that's what it takes for me to read...

542
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,540
With a large coat.

543
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,520
I mean...

544
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,220
And a funny hat.

545
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,180
But typically, you know, before an election, I read the papers.

546
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,640
And I read online.

547
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,460
Yeah.

548
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,380
And get as much information as I can.

549
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,600
I go to the websites of the people putting things on the ballot.

550
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,580
Candidates and issues.

551
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:33,960
You know?

552
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:40,240
I try and read up on these things because I care about what my country is and my community is going to be like.

553
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
What is wrong with you?

554
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,900
You're a good American.

555
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,400
I have an opinion.

556
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:42,960
Geez.

557
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,760
People don't do that anymore, Rob.

558
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll tell you why.

559
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,560
I'll tell you why.

560
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,840
Because, you know, if everybody did it, it would work.

561
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,780
And it's not that hard for me to do it.

562
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,980
It's pretty easy for me to do it.

563
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,160
And it kind of comes naturally to me.

564
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,420
Because I have a number of interests.

565
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,520
Yeah, but you can read.

566
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,100
Yeah.

567
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,900
I can read.

568
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,460
Isn't that great?

569
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,300
I believe in the classical way.

570
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,540
I think since we're all the intelligentsia, we should be allowed to vote and nobody else should.

571
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,700
Because they don't read.

572
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,100
And that's kind of what I was kind of afraid of bringing up.

573
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,240
Because you talk about literacy tests and voting.

574
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,360
You talk about literacy tests for voting.

575
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,320
And what do you think of?

576
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,900
You think of Jim Crow.

577
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,440
You think of Jim Crow is what you think of.

578
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,840
Hey, can I ask one bizarre question?

579
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,280
But those things were all done wrong.

580
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:29,680
What?

581
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:36,240
Did anybody hear about Bush somehow proclaiming himself to be, in effect, dictator if need

582
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,140
be if the war on terror doesn't go right or something?

583
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,580
I know that sounds really off the wall or, you know, a day-to-day, daily, daily vote.

584
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:44,740
Well, I've been hearing that for all forever.

585
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,100
Ever since Bush won.

586
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,260
Yeah, I haven't heard anything specific.

587
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,120
Nothing extra lightly.

588
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,260
Yeah, I was thinking of extraordinary war powers.

589
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,260
Oh, they did that last year.

590
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,480
The concentration camps.

591
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,540
Didn't you get your letter?

592
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,120
The military commissioners act?

593
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,360
Your invitation, they call it.

594
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,840
Are they sending out letters now?

595
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,260
Yeah.

596
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,720
Are they really?

597
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,640
Well, who are they?

598
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,580
Are they coming from the camps?

599
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,540
Are they coming from the people in the camps?

600
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:25,540
No, it's just basically, I got one that said, Reverend Ivan Tsang, please report sometime during the next 30 days for internment.

601
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,140
Or, you know, a stay.

602
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,680
They act like, it looks like a hotel invitation, but I know what it is.

603
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,260
Wow.

604
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,940
You know, they just want to put me in this special camp for, they don't say how long.

605
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,660
Well, don't get involved in the delousing program, I guess is what kills you.

606
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:51,020
You know, it said something about, you know, to question me about where we got some of the copyrighted materials on the Hour of Slack.

607
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,120
Well, you know, they come up with any kind of excuse they want.

608
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,880
Well, sometimes it lets you go home for your own.

609
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm not going to go.

610
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,200
Of course I'm not going to go.

611
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:07,520
And I figure it'll be another six or eight months, they'll send another letter going, you know, you will be facing a firing squad if you don't report to the firing squad next week.

612
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:13,340
And I'll wait until they, some bureaucrat will come to the door and go, sir, you're supposed to report for firing squad.

613
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,900
Yeah, it will take a while, you know, given the bureaucracy.

614
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,980
But I'd say, you know, it's better to be on the safe side.

615
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,100
Because if you get a letter saying that you have to appear to be deloused sometime.

616
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,100


617
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,080
Somewhere, then that usually means you're limited.

618
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,860
Well, one way of being on the safe side is not to have an address where they can send you the letter.

619
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,760
But then they just bulldoze the people who don't have an address.

620
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,980
They just go where they live in their little cardboard box or whatever and just, you know, shovel them under.

621
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,980
So, you know, you don't see that on the national news.

622
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,100
That's only on YouTube and only for a few seconds at a time.

623
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,900
You know how it is.

624
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,440
Yeah.

625
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,560
Anyway.

626
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,060
And you have to have the special sunglasses to even be able to perceive any of this stuff.

627
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,820
Otherwise, it just sounds like a bunch of sci-fi nonsense ripped off from some old Arnold Schwarzenegger movie of the 80s.

628
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,280
Yeah.

629
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,100
But why do you think they made those movies?

630
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,540
So that it would seem perfectly normal by the time it happened to people who grew up watching them.

631
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,800
Acclimation, public acclimation.

632
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,100
Right.

633
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,280
Oh, it's time for me to go to the camp for dissidents.

634
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,580
Yeah.

635
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,000
It's like graduation.

636
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,780
But as the camps grow, they begin to subdivide.

637
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,060
Some of them get a certain degree of autonomy.

638
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,880
So things might go back to normal a little bit if enough people can just stay out long enough, you know.

639
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,000
Rob, have you made any plans?

640
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,100
For what?

641
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,620
For internment or pre-internment or post-internment.

642
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,320
I'm not talking about the kind of shady lawn or whatever.

643
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,240
I'm talking about, you know, work and camps and stuff.

644
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,940
Anyway, guys.

645
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,500
I'm sorry.

646
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,000
I agree.

647
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,320
I'm sorry, too.

648
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,660
I didn't mean to be embarrassing.

649
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,680
All right.

650
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,480
If you want a fast, sure way to kill the government, try 5-Mosquito Spray.

651
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,960
This pleasantly scented liquid spray combines fast action and sure death.

652
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,060
In fact, it is so fatal that the government, it has earned a double A rating for effectiveness.

653
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:31,780
With the exception of the inter-genetroid reactions and the indesignable withdrawals of support and sudden round wages, this human being is entirely instinctless.

654
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,280
Man is man because he has no income.

655
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:43,060
Because everything he is and has become he has learned, acquired from this culture, from the man-made work, the environment, from other human beings.

656
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:51,440
Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war.

657
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,640
And such a war is every man against every man.

658
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,500
In such condition there is no place for industry because the front era is uncertain.

659
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:21,420
And consequently no culture of VR, no navigation, no commodious buildings, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death and life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, prudent, and dangerous.

660
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,420


661
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,420


662
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,200
And so the human being is in short.

663
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:36,480
My friends, we interrupt this show at this particular key point because it's high time that I paid some respect to people who have paid us respect.

664
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:50,440
On subgenius.com, our website, there's a little button where a person could donate to keeping that website up and to the Hour of Slack.

665
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,420
Subgenius.com. Our website. There's a little button where a person could donate to keeping that website up and to the Hour of Slack.

666
00:24:51,440 --> 00:25:00,160
And I'm going to read the names of these beloved reverends who have done that because they earned it, friends, with their skinny, peeling face of pain.

667
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,220
And that first name would be the beautiful Benjamin Sherburn.

668
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,180
I'm sure that's not his real name.

669
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,280
Michael Mihalko in Florida.

670
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,580
That previous one was in Washington or Oregon or one of those places.

671
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,900
Scott Wise.

672
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,940
And boy is he in Michigan.

673
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,140
Justin Jacobson, who we might also call Chibithuyo.

674
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,100
So kindly to us there out of Virginia.

675
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,700
I'm not giving cities because then you could look these people up and attack them.

676
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
The good Reverend Zeston Norelko has helped us out several times.

677
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,200
What a fine, fine figure of a listener that person is.

678
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,020
Ah, yes, dear friends.

679
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,260
Those are our real dear friends.

680
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:07,500
Speaking of dear friends, this music in the background is by Nino Rota from the soundtrack of Fellini's Eight and a Half.

681
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:18,760
Nino Rota, the great composer and not a poseur of these fine Italian music.

682
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,580
Him and Jobs. Praise God.

683
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,700
Stiff. Copyright there, there.

684
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,460
Crimes of anatomy.

685
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,400
Body snatching and other sordid tales from the dawn of human dissection.

686
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,360
Life after death.

687
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,280
On human decay and what can be done about it.

688
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,020
Dead man driving.

689
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,620
Human crash test dummies and the ghastly necessary science of impact tolerance.

690
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,840
Beyond the black box.

691
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,080
The cadaver who joined the army.

692
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,060
The sticky ethics of bullets and bombs.

693
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,060
Holy cadaver.

694
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,060
The crucifixion experiments.

695
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,300
How to know if you're dead.

696
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,320
Beating heart cadavers.

697
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,700
Live burial and the scientific search for the soul.

698
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,300
Just ahead.

699
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,040
Decapitation. Reanimation.

700
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,380
And the human head transplant.

701
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,780
Medicinal cannibalism and the case of the human dumplings.

702
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,600
Out of the fire into the compost bin.

703
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,860
And other new ways to end up.

704
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,620
Will she or won't she eat me?

705
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,360
Guess what? Guess what would taste good right now to everyone in the car?

706
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,000
The devil.

707
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,660
We've got your favorite kind at the concession stand.

708
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,500
Come on down and pick out the kinds you want to enjoy during the rest of the show.

709
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,540
Be sure to get plenty because everyone likes Satan.

710
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,020
And our big variety is chosen to please everybody's taste.

711
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,020
Maybe I'm just talking out my other mind.

712
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,400
I'm out of here for the rest of the day.

713
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,060
Hello, you're on the air.

714
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,000
I just heard a very interesting story about the...

715
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

716
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,080
Hey, Dave.

717
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,080
Hey, Rob.

718
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,340
I mean, doctors.

719
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,180
I'm sorry.

720
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,700
I just heard an interesting story about the origins of the American gun lusht.

721
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,820
And it was called how they changed the name Chattahoochee to Columbus, Georgia

722
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,860
after a 3,000-year-old town.

723
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:53,020
And the name was raised and everybody was deported in the 1830s during the Native American

724
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,740
and American Indian Deportation Act.

725
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,820
You know what's really funny?

726
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:01,840
The state of Oklahoma, their license plate has a Native American-themed design.

727
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,940
Yeah.

728
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,940
Yeah, because...

729
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,220
But it's deportees.

730
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,440
Yeah, that's where we sent them all.

731
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,020
That was the other end of the Trail of Tears.

732
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,580
And then of course, eventually, we stole that too.

733
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,280
And we don't understand that they had barbed wire in those days.

734
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,580
Now, the muskets looked funny.

735
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,360
But they had repeating kind of guns.

736
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,480
Gatling gun.

737
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,740
We must think of this in terms of a large army deporting a bunch of civilians in their

738
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,580
cities and towns, living urban lives like normal people.

739
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,720
And suddenly, someone says, get out of your house.

740
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,640
We're taking it over.

741
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,220
Kind of like the Israelis and the Palestinians almost.

742
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,260
Well, America does have a gun lusht that is big.

743
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,000
If you ever listen to Canadian radio, they're talking about all of the...

744
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,600
Oh, I think there's something wrong with their minds.

745
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,240
Yeah, you know, we love to have guns too.

746
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,420
You don't see us doing that there.

747
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,160
You know, we...

748
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:55,000
Well, you know, our country was founded on a violent insurrection, whereas Canada was not.

749
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,320
I think it was from stealing from the Indians, very frankly.

750
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,460
I think it's just...

751
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,940
Well, it all starts with stealing.

752
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,080
But then, you know, it was the British who stole the land first.

753
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,720
But the American, you know, the colonists, they had a violent insurrection.

754
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,700
Didn't the Canadian territories come about because of Benedict Arnold being captured?

755
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,780
I don't know.

756
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,840
It was a Tory thing, I think, or a lot of people from New York State and Virginia.

757
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,200
Yeah, a lot of loyalists fled there.

758
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,740
Supposedly, one of the reasons why they say, Oud, is from all the people from Virginia,

759
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,520
of all things, that decided to get in there with goofy-looking things and go north.

760
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,640
I heard that was a Scottish influence, but...

761
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,420
Well, that's probably the original Virginia one, because a lot of them still go, Oud.

762
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,780
And it's like, you know, you're not a hockey stick or whatever.

763
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,520
Oud in a boat.

764
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,120
Now, Judy, what has our czar war story?

765
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,020
Yoda, Yoda, Yoda.

766
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,000
Loot.

767
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,400
More on RockJoyTaxi.com.

768
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,400


769
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,580
I'm going to tell you a story about a guy who was trapped.

770
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,840
He'll report directly to President Yoda.

771
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,440
What you have now is somebody who's going to be able to...

772
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,380
On the ground.

773
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,160
Keep in mind, also, that he has folks on the ground.

774
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,820
Not all moron.

775
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,220
He's now history at the Institute for Public California.

776
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,720
You're too slow.

777
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,640
The war.

778
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,240
War.

779
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,700
War.

780
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,320
The war.

781
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,280
But why?

782
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,000
Because, because wars.

783
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,180
Well, you know, I have a very high regard for loot-loot.

784
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,120
Telling loot-loot.

785
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,840
Not going to work.

786
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,340
Failing.

787
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,120
The point is telescope.

788
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,280
And work the telescope.

789
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,540
Every day.

790
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,980
I'm not worried what's going on.

791
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,040
Loot.

792
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,760
What about that?

793
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,320
What to do.

794
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:26,800
Loot.

795
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,020
Bob.

796
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:28,880
Loot.

797
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,120
Bob.

798
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,420
Bob.

799
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,040
And Bob.

800
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,700
History.

801
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,200
Top.

802
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,720
Problem.

803
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,200
Fail.

804
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,380
Work that problem.

805
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,420
I'm for it.

806
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,900
Bottom line is bad strategy.

807
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,720
Yoda, Yoda, Yoda.

808
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,760
Hey, I wanted to let you know, too, tonight, everybody in the audience, I'm selling carbon

809
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,700
offsets.

810
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,900
If you want to become carbon neutral, call me up.

811
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,440
I can sell you offsets over the phone.

812
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,020
I can't sell you on this show.

813
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,380
And I really can't sell you, but I'm going to pretend like I can.

814
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:58,980
I want an Easter egg.

815
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,820
I want an Easter egg.

816
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,200
Wow.

817
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,580
An Easter egg is a carbon offset?

818
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:03,960
Incredible.

819
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,920
I never saw such a.

820
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,180
Just your possession of an Easter egg proves that you're wasteful of the resources of

821
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,200
Earth.

822
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,280
Impressive.

823
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,480
If you didn't waste the Earth's eggs like you do.

824
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,680
The oppressor, by the way, will always send two.

825
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,400
While some chick is unborn.

826
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,580
No matter who the oppressor is.

827
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,060
A small, tiny chick who could feed a.

828
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,900
Stormtroopers are simply updated silence.

829
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,680
I'm against Easter.

830
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,780
Who could feed a fourth world nation with the chicks that are made into Easter eggs.

831
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:29,800
The Easter eggs.

832
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,560
Darth Vader.

833
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:31,900
Stormtrooper.

834
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,480
And not only that, what about the poor chick?

835
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,400
It didn't have a chance to live its life.

836
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,960
Yeah, stormtroopers are the sperm of Darth Vader.

837
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,460
It represents map of Earth.

838
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,480
Little Hermes is wasting that egg.

839
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,460
I don't know how to put that egg in a bucket.

840
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:44,460


841
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:44,460


842
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:44,460


843
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,180
Whereas the Cylons are true robots.

844
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,920
Because they're shiny.

845
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,700
You put.

846
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,800
You put on them.

847
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,200
Aluminum.

848
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,760
And they.

849
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,780
But the eyes are the thing.

850
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,680
They made the eyes work.

851
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,200
You made it your way.

852
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,380
You know.

853
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,920
Wait a minute.

854
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,740
Now do you think that the.

855
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Stormtroopers just kind of go.

856
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:03,100
The luminescence of the plastic versus aluminum itself should not be a factor in this discussion.

857
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,700
Well, in an ideal world, perhaps, Doctor.

858
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,480
But we must attend to the realities of this situation.

859
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,120
Reality?

860
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,940
Once again, we are polarized into extreme opposites.

861
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,040
That can't possibly find a consensus area.

862
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:18,700
Oh.

863
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,900
Into which we can both proceed.

864
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,620
Winners.

865
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,320
And not winners.

866
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,940
And not losers.

867
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,680
And not losers.

868
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:26,720
And not.

869
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,360
Lotteries.

870
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,400
Great life.

871
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,500
Which you are stronger.

872
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,640
You can win that way.

873
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:30,740
Lottery.

874
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:30,760
Yeah.

875
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,280
Truth is fiction.

876
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,740
And this is.

877
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,060
Be warned it.

878
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,540
Be not.

879
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Albert Einstein, the great mathematician and author of the theory of relativity, truly

880
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,920
was a genius.

881
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:49,660
In 1928, he grew beans more than six feet long and 10 to 17 inches around.

882
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,920
In April 1939, they were brought to trial and 458 were found guilty of buying clothes

883
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,840
for snowmen.

884
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,520
However, when he was 16, he was stoned and failed his entrance exams.

885
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,780
He died at the age of 121, 301 years later.

886
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,800
Be warned it.

887
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,240
Be not.

888
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,400
.

889
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,920
.

890
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,700
toppled me

891
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,900
30 years later I

892
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:43,900


893
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:43,900


894
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:43,900


895
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:43,900


896
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:43,900


897
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:43,900


898
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,920
.

899
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,480
Bush is experiencing tremendous growth. Mr. Bush wants to expand.

900
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,520
The government now says it can legally ban women in public places.

901
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,640
The cabinet said it wears crash helmets with scarves that cover PR News in The Hague.

902
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,380
PR News.

903
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,300
This is PR News.

904
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,100
Figures from Wall Street.

905
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,660
1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 9, 9.

906
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,820
Hundreds of people had to be rescued from PR News in Washington.

907
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:18,100
The emergence of the poop and pee dog tales are among the most important literary movements of the late 20th century.

908
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Apparently begun in the late 80s, by 1994, these encyclicals replaced science fiction and the Harlequin novel as the most popular form of fiction.

909
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:37,400
Much of the wide appeal of poop dog and pee dog were due to the fact that all the stories were thematically similar to medieval literature.

910
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,080
Which was wholly concerned with man's relation to God.

911
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,320
I have a question, Dr. Drummond.

912
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,060
Yeah.

913
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,520
Was there a real poop dog?

914
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,900
Well, you might ask yourself, was there a real Jesus?

915
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,140
What do you mean a real poop dog?

916
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:05,020
I mean, besides the trans reality, the living reality and literary anecdotes, stories and legendary lore, was there an actual, original?

917
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,120
No, it was not.

918
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,740
It was not.

919
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:06,880


920
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,540
It was not.

921
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:07,800
It was not.

922
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:07,800


923
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:07,800


924
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:07,800


925
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:07,800


926
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,100
It was not.

927
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:14,220
So it wasn't somebody's misguided personal pet with a previous predilection.

928
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,420
No, a personal pet that couldn't control himself.

929
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,520
Although we should never let anybody know that.

930
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,380
Never let a real dog know there's no real poop dog.

931
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,580
I'll make a note of it in my memorandum book.

932
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,580
Because they would be crushed.

933
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,600
I'm just getting rid of some Red Bull here.

934
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,940
And who would not, after all?

935
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,660
After all, we...

936
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,500
Peep Dog and...

937
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,560
Peep?

938
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,400
Pee Dog?

939
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,380
Sorry.

940
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:37,620
Sorry.

941
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:37,720


942
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:37,780


943
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:37,780


944
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:37,780


945
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:37,780


946
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:37,780


947
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:37,780


948
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,380
It's okay.

949
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:38,760
Yeah, it's okay.

950
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,180
It's tragic, satirical and sympathetic.

951
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:49,120
The whole of mankind's aspirations, troubles and desperate attempts to cope with a sense of awe and religious wonder

952
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,200
could be found by the reader in the poop dog.

953
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,260
And especially in the immensely popular pee dog novellas.

954
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,200
Of course, another reason these forms of cultural progress became central to Western humanities was that

955
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,800
the tail cycles broke out of the old hackneyed and futile forms in which we were born.

956
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,760
western Belle de Terre

957
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,660
had been frozen

958
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,540
for decades.

959
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,920
Frozen in the ice?

960
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,560
New Dog were a breath of fresh air in a world of

961
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,460
tired writers, dismal

962
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,620
novels, stale literary

963
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,640
back-patting. We're getting awful

964
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,780
critical all of a sudden.

965
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,960
Society's self-criticism

966
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,640
of the 70s and 80s and

967
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
90s and 2000s.

968
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,520
Chop that wood!

969
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,520
That room in the barn's a lot better

970
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,220
than any Dodge City hotel room.

971
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,980
Are you a gunman?

972
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,440
I have been. You want it?

973
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,360
You don't suppose he's staying out there at the

974
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,180
farm with her, do you?

975
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,320
Ain't none of your business if he is.

976
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,880
Gosh, he sure is a

977
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,920
rugged, handsome-looking fella.

978
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,360
Don't blame me for being jealous.

979
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:00,880
Oh!

980
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,480
Just kind of spread that all over, you know.

981
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,500
Cooking her amaranth.

982
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,180
Ramrod, got your belly and backside.

983
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,840
Oh, that's sure the truth.

984
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,600
Oh!

985
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,100
Oh!

986
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,520
Got a new ramrod that really is pushing the boy's heart.

987
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,100
Think of it, think of it, think of it, think of it, think of it, that's not a bad idea.

988
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,620
You don't dignify a back shooter by calling him a man.

989
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,060
You have your nerve wearing white, white, white, white, white.

990
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,580
I'll take an end piece.

991
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,520
Cream if, cream if, always comes out right.

992
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,620
Seize.

993
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,020
Now may be the time to act.

994
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,220
I'm Margaret Jenkins.

995
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,180
And I breed.

996
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,400
I don't know anything about.

997
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,940
I'm not afraid to reach out and touch life.

998
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,560
We'll both feel a lot more comfortable if you put both hands back on a ramrod.

999
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,700
You got feelings.

1000
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,700
Please, please.

1001
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,680
I'm begging you.

1002
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,980
Get on your feet.

1003
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,660
I got no brain.

1004
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,700
I got no brain.

1005
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,400
More meat, more delicious.

1006
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,220
The life of the party.

1007
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,400
It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean like I can't go back.

1008
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,820
A live warm blooded farm animal, there ain't no choice, it's just instinct.

1009
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,060
Well, what's going on?

1010
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,160
Well, it's a long story, Abelia.

1011
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,360
It goes back a long way.

1012
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,520
We're fixing to kiss this dog.

1013
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,280
You won't watch?

1014
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,440
You're too dumb.

1015
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,420
Been a long week.

1016
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,160
Get off by myself for a while.

1017
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,520
I just got the rights to pukingskunk.com.

1018
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:30,880
Go on.

1019
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,120
pukingskunk.com.

1020
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,680
Mm-hmm.

1021
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,320
He's got the biggest...

1022
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,480
Dad, I don't like ranching.

1023
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,660
I know I'll make good as an artist if you listen to reason.

1024
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,560
Hey, come on, Sunder.

1025
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,480
I've heard enough of this.

1026
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:54,260
If I hear any more about that crazy peen, I'll smash up that stuff of yours and burn

1027
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,320
the pictures you already did.

1028
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,160
And if you fool around any more with that peen, I'll turn you out.

1029
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,840
Dad, do you mean it?

1030
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,700
Yep, I sure do.

1031
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,300
I'll be back.

1032
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:02,360
I'll be back.

1033
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,360


1034
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,520
I'll be back.

1035
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,540


1036
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,540


1037
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,540


1038
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,540


1039
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,540

00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,540


1044
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,540


1045
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,380
Yes, sir.

1046
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,760
I may be stubborn, but I'm always willing to take the advice of the loa-

1047
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,700
Meanwhile, the loa-ger listened intently, then remarked.

1048
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,860
Not me.

1049
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,120
The loa-ger.

1050
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,360
I remember that.

1051
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,820
May everything you ever see contain copyrighted imagery designed to make you want to spend

1052
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,240
your dough.

1053
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:31,820
May everything you hold dear to you sell out at every chance and tag you as a mark to all

1054
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,180
they mean.

1055

This is Spammer's Cuts

1057
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,780
May the orifices of those you love be covered whenever you're around

1058
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,200
With pages of helpful consumer tips and health advice

1059
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,640
And when you're finally tired of getting all those paper cuts down there

1060
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,260
May the condom you choose leave a tattoo on your pipe

May I rent out space on the inside of your corneas to charity?

1064
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,700
Would you mind if I ran some wire into your brain?

1065
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,280
You know if you're not using your mouth all the time it's a crime

1066
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,560
It's idle bandwidth, it's a disgraceful lost opportunity

1067
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,300
And you're the one to blame, blame, blame

1068
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,660
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?

1069
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,140
Hello, I love you, won't you jump in your game?

This is Spammer's Cuts

1073
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,380
May the very essence of your being be reducible to enumeration

1074
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,260
And legal tend to good for all debts, public and private

1075
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,800
May currency replace oxygen for you and dwell in your sinuses

1076
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,140
And your synapses and your receptors and your fingerprints

1077
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,180
It's the Spammer's Cuts by Norrell Preff

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,100
From PR News in Washington, this is news.

1082
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:13,200
From PR News in Washington, I'm charged with murdering a former GKB agent with a rare radioactive.

1083
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,680
PR News in London, in Russia.

1084
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,940
PR's bad.

1085
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,780
PR's bad.

1086
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,880
This is PR News from Washington.

1087
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,180
Oh, those collages were by Leemur, and these are by Norell Kraff.

1088
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,080
He called my religion yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

1089
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,600
Scientology was invented by...

1090
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,300
L. Ron Hubbard.

1091
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,660
Who started out as a science fiction writer.

1092
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:43,200
He said, and I quote, writing for a penny a word is ridiculous.

1093
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,060
If a man really wanted to make a million dollars, he'd start his own religion.

1094
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,340
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know.

1095
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,020
Brother Hubbard.

1096
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,020
He'd start his own religion.

1097
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,120
You know, the origin of...

1098
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,460
Illness.

1099
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,180
Life, according to Scientology.

1100
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,060
Illness, illness.

1101
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,040
Uh, ammonia.

1102
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,680
Most Scientologists believe Brother Hubbard will return.

1103
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,300
And Christians believe Jesus will come again.

1104
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:03,980
Are they all nuts?

1105
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,580
Most.

1106
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:13,280
Scientologists also believe that 75 million years ago, an evil galactic warlord, and here's

1107
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,640
where I can almost taste the maple syrup, an evil warlord by the name of Xenu dumped

1108
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,380
13 trillion aliens from different planets into the Earth's volcanoes and then vaporized

1109
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,480
them with H-bombs.

1110
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,960
Odor.

1111
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,620
Panting.

1112
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,820
You're a vomit.

1113
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,080
Basically every time you piss, puke, or crap, you're a step closer to immortality.

1114
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:33,240
Uh...

1115
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:39,280
I went over for the first time to the psychology department and found out for the first time,

1116
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,080
first time, first time, first time, first time, first time, T-U-M, T-U-M, dum dum.

1117
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,620
I had just put a foot in a ass.

1118
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,080
Why did you do that?

1119
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,680
There was no attempt to understand thinking, thinking.

1120
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,360
That's my claim to fame.

1121
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,020
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, duh, duh, duh.

1122
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,540
You put the rap, the rap, the rap, rap, rap, rap.

1123
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,380
T-U-M, T-U-M, I'm really not so bright.

1124
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,020
My ignorance of the subject.

1125
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,360
My ignorance, my ignorance.

1126
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,980
But stupid people remain stupid.

1127
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,240
I was always stupid.

1128
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,940
And intellectual that I'm not.

1129
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,520
Become stupid, become stupid.

1130
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,860
I'm really not too bright.

1131
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,380
I've got a brain, but it is numb.

1132
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,520
It was the smack heard across America.

1133
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,600
Bash the actor, bash the actor, jumped on Oprah.

1134
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,360
Thank you for coming.

1135
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,720
Falling star, rehabilitation.

1136
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,520
I've never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever,

1137
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:27,520

Get a job, get a job, get a job, get a job.

1143
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,420
What are you doing here?

1144
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,780
Why are you afraid of Hubbard?

1145
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,040
What is your problem?

1146
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,580
You're afraid of the crime, crime, crime, of Scientology.

1147
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,380
Crime, crime.

1148
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,060
Get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off.

1149
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:58,780
Nothing but bad.

1150
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,540
Murder, perhaps?

1151
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,980
Why are you here trying to interpolate people and upset people?

1152
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,240
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1153
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,160
Why, why, why, why, why, why?

1154

Why are you afraid of Hubbard?

1155

What are you afraid of Hubbard?

1156
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,600
What are you afraid of Hubbard?

1157
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,800
I don't even, you know, I'm not really sure, uh...

1158
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,980
No, no, no, you don't understand.

1159
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,280
Interpolating, interpolating.

1160
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,560
Later.

1161
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:14,800
Bye.

Jack Scientology.

1163
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,380
Good point.

1164
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,020
Criminal activity.

1165
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,660
Spit it out.

1166
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,780
Child molester myself.

1167

Crime, crime, crime, of Scientology.

1170
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,640
Thank you.

1171
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,120
Your account has been charged.

1172
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,760
Your balance is zero.

1173
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,840
Please come back when you can afford to make a purchase.

1174
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,460
I'm sorry you're having trouble.

1175
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,020
I'm sorry you're having trouble.

1176
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,720
This should help you calm down.

1177
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,800
Please come back when you can afford to make a purchase.

1178
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,720
Your kids are starving.

1179
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,000
Carl's Jr. believes no child should go hungry.

1180
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,620
You are an unfit mother.

1181
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,720
Your children will be placed in the custody of Carl's Jr.

1182
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:54,960
Carl's Jr.

1183
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:55,800
Fuck you.

1184
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,740
I'm eating.

1185
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,600
I've been fired for more jobs than most people have been hired to.

1186
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,160
All I have to do to avoid taking any responsibility...

1187
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,540
I've been fired for more reasons, more stupid reasons than you can imagine.

1188
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,880
I've been fired for telling the truth.

1189
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,340
I've been fired for telling the truth.

1190
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,180
I've been fired for calling my boss a liar.

1191
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,920
I've been fired for not smiling enough.

1192
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,600
I've been fired for massaging places on my body that don't deserve attention.

1193
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,860
Yes, and I have it on video too, in the Snooper canon.

1194
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:44,820
It's all those little innocent children that we fed to the crocodiles that one year that come back to haunt me at my most darkest hours.

1195
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,380
Poke fun.

1197
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,040
You know what?

1198
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,660
I'm gonna announce it on a Dr. Sinister show.

1199
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,380
I didn't want to really tell anybody, and I was kinda making stuff up.

1200
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:58,920
Oh, you too.

1201
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,260
Well, I was fired from my job.

1202
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,180
Already.

1203
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,660
Already, huh?

1204
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,100
But that's okay.

1205
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,140
They kind of do me a favor.

1206
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,860
I didn't really like conning old people out of their money.

1207
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,540
I don't know you speak so high letter.

1208
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,540
I had a job and I had to start a cult and con old people out of their money anyway.

1209
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,340
It's sad.

1210
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,340
Sign the Social Security check over.

1211
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:22,840
I feel terrible about it.

1212
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,180
But I couldn't get work.

1213
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,940
What else could I do?

1214
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,000
But then they said I was going to go to hell.

1215
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,960
Didn't have much of a choice, really, but to start the old cult.

1216
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,360
Rip off ignorant old people.

1217
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,360
It's a noble calling, you know.

1218
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:46,400
Well, I suppose that's what we'd like to tell all the people we're stealing from.

1219
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,620
Don't think I'm proud of it.

1220
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,300
I could never.

1221
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,500
Circumstances.

1222
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:59,100
They wouldn't hire me down, but Walmart had to start a cult.

1223
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,160
You should be proud.

1224
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,940
It's not satanic.

1225
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,500
You know what?

1226
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,640
We could start a Walmart cult.

1227
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,460
No.

1228
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,920
It's a sex cult for old people.

1229
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:21,160
I belong to more cults than too many.

1230
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,500
You're not a Mason, are you?

1231
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,560
I can't talk about that.

1232
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,940
Oh, give me a break.

1233
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,720
You could, too.

1234
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,100
No, I'm not a Mason.

1235
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,400
I'm not a Mason.

1236
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:38,580
I know a lot of Masons, and I would join the Masons myself, but I got my own cult that I'm having to memorize.

1237
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,220
It's ridiculous rigmarole.

1238
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:40,620
It's ridiculous rigmarole for.

1239
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,520
Yeah, you know.

1240
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:47,020
I mean, how many mystic brotherhoods can you memorize stupid rituals for?

1241
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,140
I'd have to.

1242
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:48,760
That's what it comes down to.

1243
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:54,740
They also don't want you if you don't believe in a supreme being, and I do not.

1244
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,580
Oh, what about Bob?

1245
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,000
Bob is not a supreme being.

1246
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,440
Well, he's a supreme being.

1247
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,500
He's a higher power.

1248
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,780
He's a higher power, but he's not a supreme being.

1249
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:06,780
Yeah.

1250
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,800
I mean, he's...

1251
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:09,940
I'm not a supreme being.

1252
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,280
Exactly.

1253
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,840
No, he's not, but he didn't create the universe.

1254
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,820
That's for sure.

1255
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,220
We know that much about Bob.

1256
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,160
Although he is kind of like a...

1257
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,620
Like a...

1258
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,820
But he could wreck it.

1259
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,720
He's kind of like a...

1260
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,960
Yeah, he's kind of like a black hole.

1261
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,540
The first rule of Mason's Club is don't talk about the Mason's Club.

1262
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:26,700
Yeah.

1263
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,420
Yeah, right.

1264
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,460
Actually, I don't know.

1265
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,560
I mean, you'll hear other...

1266
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,640
You'll hear other Masons talk.

1267
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,700
Some Masons will talk about the stuff that you...

1268
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,520
It's...

1269
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:35,840
I don't...

1270
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,760
To be honest, I don't think it's anything that we like to think it is.

1271
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,360
Oh, I...

1272
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,380
It's just what they say it is.

1273
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,240
Fraternal societies are kind of funny.

1274
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,900
Yeah, the secretly rules the world.

1275
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,180
But, you know, somebody has to be doing that.

1276
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
And it's not just them.

1277
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:56,260
There's other mobs that they have to contend with.

1278
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:56,880
How many different clubs are there like that?

1279
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,520
There's the Eagles.

1280
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,460
The Elks.

1281
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,160
Actually, the Odd Fellows are the ones you really have to worry about.

1282
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:03,360
The VFW.

1283
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,800
The Illuminati.

1284
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,800
The Odd Fellows are really...

1285
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,040
They make the Illuminati look like pikers.

1286
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,680
The Fraternal Order of the Moose.

1287
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,860
Yeah, the Moose.

1288
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,660
That's another really powerful secret society.

1289
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,500
Is it the Order of the Ends and the Means?

1290
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,320
Or is it the Means and the Ends?

1291
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,720
I can't remember.

1292
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,900
They all grew from the Secret Order of the Water Buffalo.

1293
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,460
I think was the original one.

1294
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,560
From prehistoric...

1295
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,040
Yeah, I was going to say.

1296
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,720
Which one of the Flintstones belonged to you?

1297
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:33,920
Right.

1298
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,320
Yeah, Australopithecus.

1299
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,680
Fred and Barney really did not work this.

1300
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,260
Not very well.

1301
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,120
They were all drawn Australopithecines.

1302
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,760
I thought they were Homo erectus.

1303
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,720
They weren't anatomically correct.

1304
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:46,880
Huh?

1305
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,660
I thought they were Homo erectus.

1306
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,440
Yeah, actually.

1307
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,900
They would in fact fit more into the Neanderthal or Cro-Magnon.

1308
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,920
They're fully human.

1309
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,260
You know, you wouldn't catch me saying Homo erectus.

1310
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,580
You could tell by looking at Betty and Wilma.

1311
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,720
Which one would you take?

1312
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,400
Betty.

1313
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,700
She just looks like a whore.

1314
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,200
Wilma wore that.

1315
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,780
That great low-cut, that one-shoulder thing.

1316
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:19,120
See, I'm more partial to redheads, but I don't like the way she wears it.

1317
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,460
I'll tell you something, man.

1318
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,240
I ain't going to do nothing where Barney Rubble's been.

1319
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,640
You know what?

1320
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,200
Good point.

1321
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,640
Good point on both of them.

1322
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,240
I'm going to leave that.

1323
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,000
They can keep that for himself.

1324
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,840
I think we're showing our age.

1325
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,500
Barney, what do you mean we?

1326
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,200
I'm not showing my age, am I?

1327
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:45,440
I'm keeping up with the old men when it comes to outdated cultural references.

1328
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,400
I've been waiting to be an old man my whole life.

1329
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,540
I've been one since I was two years old.

1330
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,800
I found a gray hair in my head the other day.

1331
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,640
Uh-oh.

1332
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:02,140
Yeah, Dr. Sinister, you're like 25 going on 50 or something, aren't you?

1333
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,200
I was going to say 65.

1334
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,780
It's time for Doc to get a hover around.

1335
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,640
I know a lot of-

1336
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,920
Old news ain't what they used to be.

1337
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,980
Or they're 65 going on 15.

1338
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,940
I know quite a few of those, too.

1339
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,060
Yeah.

1340
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,880
It works both ways.

1341
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,720
In fact, sometimes it goes in reverse.

1342
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:30,020
You may find that 35 years from now, Dr. Sinister won't be the sane, sober-sounding fellow,

1343
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:35,780
but he'll be acting his age, or the age he is now, a beer-drinking slob.

1344
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:36,720
A slob.

1345
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,740
If I can destroy enough brain cells now, yes, I may eventually.

1346
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,740
I can promise you that that can be done.

1347
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,180
He may be able to rise himself to the gutter.

1348
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,540
Maybe in the gutter, but I'm looking at the stars.

1349
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:49,740
Yeah.

1350
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,940
It is possible to destroy enough brain cells to become less intelligent.

1351
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,700
That is how a genius can join the church of the subgenius.

1352
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,640
You know, I actually do like the smell of paint thinner.

1353
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,720
Well, there you go.

1354
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,940
That may be a good place to start.

1355
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,160
I don't know.

1356
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,180
You know, I don't know.

1357
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,520
I've lost my short-term memory.

1358
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,720
It went bye-bye a long time ago.

1359
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,040
Oh, how would you know?

1360
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,760
But the fact that they say that it makes you sterile and can't have kids, well, that's a damn lie.

1361
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,200
Running rugrats prove that wrong.

1362
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:31,240
Yeah, honestly, like, if there were drugs out there that really did cause infertility, I'd be all over that.

1363
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,700
Well, I bet what was the problem with Cho was the infertility.

1364
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,120
I mean, it's not just the infertility drugs.

1365
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,940
It's the transubliminal beaming system.

1366
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,200
His parents didn't take enough of them.

1367
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,880
No, yeah, right.

1368
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,780
But, no, it actually is a transubliminal beaming system, and that's how the hormones are controlled.

1369
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,760
It's not by taking a pill or with taking a pill.

1370
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,480
It's the actual brainwave patterns being altered.

1371
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,440
So that's what happened to him.

1372
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:03,600
I mean, as his gonads shriveled, so did his lust for violence, so to speak.

1373
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,440
That's a good theory.

1374
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,440
Well, it's not really a theory.

1375
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,160
It's a fact.

1376
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,540
I know a disgruntled postal worker.

1377
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,100
We've got a disgruntled postal worker here at the station, actually.

1378
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,440
Well, how did you disgrunt?

1379
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,820
I mean, this has been going on since the 1820s, hasn't it?

1380
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,540
I don't know.

1381
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,640
I'm pretty gruntled myself.

1382
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,840
How could you be any other way?

1383
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,800
I've got slack.

1384
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,580
We need to be well-gruntled.

1385
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,060
I think we all need to be well-gruntled.

1386
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,180
Not like being well-grounded, just gruntled.

1387
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,440
Oh, to be gruntled.

1388
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,120
That's all we ask, isn't it?

1389
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:47,720
And that was some business from Radio Synesthesia with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Dr. Sinister

1390
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,140
and the various callers and friends.

1391
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:58,860
Friends, friends, you are listening to Hour of Slack number 1105 from the Church of the Subgenius.

1392
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,740
If you want more information about that mighty edifice, the Church of the Subgenius, friends,

1393
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,700
check out subgenius.com.

1394
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:27,640
Or you can write for free information from Subgenius at Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118, baby.

1395
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:33,920
And now that that's been done, finally, I can play what this whole show has been pointing towards,

1396
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,080
the world premiere, friends.

1397
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:43,220
Of a new recording by none other than the great, groovy, bearded, not-you-Gary-himself,

1398
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,680
Dr. Gary Gaprogfan and his new song, Dobbs Farm.

1399
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,780
Dobbs Farm.

1400
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,320
Dobbs Farm.

1401
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,980
Dobbs Farm.

1402
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,900
Dobbs Farm.

1403
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,180
Dobbs Farm.

1404
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,780
Dobbs Farm.

1405
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,480
Dobbs Farm.

1406
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,200
Dobbs Farm.

1407
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,960
Dobbs Farm.

1408
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,940
Dobbs Farm.

1409
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,280
Dobbs Farm.

1410
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,380
Dobbs Farm.

1411
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,480
Dobbs Farm.

1412
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,600
And in all this world of anguish,

1413
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,960
he found me.

1414
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:43,220
He did not want none to help, for he fed the captive, clothed the hungry, and comforted the naked.

1415
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:51,420
Wouldn't it be funny if, you know, it's just, you know, and when you're funny, I have a hunch.

1416
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,600
Of course.

1417
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,460
Laugh.

1418
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,360
Think about it.

1419
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:55,520
Okay.

1420
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,500
So, just, and I get out of the bathroom.

1421
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,380
And notice.

1422
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,180
Laugh.

1423
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,060
There's another.

1424
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,100
