1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,460
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,740
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:07,740


5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,260
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

6
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:08,260


7
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,160
This is Timothy Larry

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,320
reminding you that just as

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,400
you need slack, Bob

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,640
needs your help.

11
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,880
Send in those pledges and

12
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,000
praise Bob.

13
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:19,960
Sound impossible?

14
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,780
Yes, you rub it between the forefinger

15
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,520
and the thumb.

16
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,120
Hey, what?

17
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,060
You take a pinch of salt, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb,

18
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,800
walk with a shim around a turning decapitated child's head,

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,780
and then jump into the grave and say,

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,060
hop on my thumb, hop on my thumb, this is a problem I must overcome.

21
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,060
Throw in a dead cat, or a live cat that's not feeling well.

22
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,300
Then cover with the sod, and when the birds chirp on the third Saturday after mickle mass,

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,060
take a large dill pickle and insert it in the tumulus.

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,940
Insert it in the tumulus, the heap, the shambling mound over the grave.

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,400
And this time you will experience a divine regurgitation,

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,640
somewhat like under the immaculation of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,240
the slain and martyred hip-hop in the Church of the Seventh-Decade.

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,740
I believe it's something God puts in us.

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,560
It's something somebody put in us.

30
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,720
Fusion, may I help? Hydrogen fusion?

31
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,700
Hydrogen fusion?

32
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,780
Hmm, well, if I don't have my fusion,

33
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm going to church at a service.

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
Yes, hydrogen fusion.

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,160
Hybrid fusion.

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,880
This material contains information affecting the national defense of the United States

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,380
within the meaning of the espionage laws, Title 18, U.S.C., Sections 7098 and 74,

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,100
a transmission or revelation of which in any manner to an unauthorized person

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,900
is inevitably prohibited by law.

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,160
Ah!

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,500
Ah!

42
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,640
Ah!

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,720
Ah!

44
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,560
Ah!

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,060
Ah!

46
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,300
Ah!

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,920
Ah!

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


55
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


56
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


57
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


58
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


59
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


60
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


61
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


62
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,860
Ah!

63
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,020
Ah!

64
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:04,700


65
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,900
A beginning is a very delicate time.

66
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,200
Shut up!

67
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,020
Look out, guys!

68
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,020
Ah!

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,840
Ah!

70
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,260
Ah!

71
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,040
Ah!

72
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,300
Ah!

73
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,940
Ah!

74
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,000
Ah!

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,700
Ah!

76
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:24,800
Ah!

77
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:24,800


78
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:24,800


79
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,840
Well, we're tuning in on you right now.

80
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,380
And there, we're centered on...

81
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,720
Oh, okay, we're on lockup.

82
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,420
Oh, okay.

83
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,880
Okay.

84
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,760
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

85
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,660
That is why you are here.

86
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,500
We are controlling transmission.

87
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,620
Control, control, control.

88
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,900
No trouble.

89
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,340
Just get set and get going.

90
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:05,940
Hey, man.

91
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,380
Recording.

92
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,580
Everything's going fine.

93
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,380
No trouble.

94
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,960
Wait a minute.

95
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,280
Wait.

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
That's this switch here.

97
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Okay, I think we're ready to go.

98
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,420
Let's go.

99
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,260
Welcome, dear friends,

100
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,040
to the...

101
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,980
The subgenius hour of...

102
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,780
What?

103
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,300
What?

104
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,120
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...

105
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,680
Bob?

106
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,540
That's your key phrase.

107
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,500
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

108
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,480
We are controlling transmission.

109
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,580
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,880
Ah, it's been nice out here in the little...

111
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,780
The Learning Studio.

112
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
Oh, yes, dear friends.

113
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,580
As you may have guessed, this is another rerun show.

114
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,580
Technically, this is hour of slack number 1071.

115
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,600
But in truth, it's a rerun of an old taped show, number 66,

116
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,820
which would make it from probably around November or December of 1986.

117
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,700
20 years ago, this particular show was marked by me.

118
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,960
Headphones, sound effects, and then it says,

119
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,980
end is amazing, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

120
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,860
I'll have to go through and clean up some of the Dallas station

121
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,100
and Dallas address references on these old shows.

122
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,860
But, friends, we're doing reruns,

123
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,420
partly because we're working really hard on a subgenius history project

124
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,160
that takes the form of an online course,

125
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,360
which you can learn more about at maybelogic.com

126
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,040
or maybelogic.org.

127
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,600
Maybelogic is one word that sounds like those two words.

128
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920
Praise Bob.

129
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,840
Anyway, let us go back in time now to the olden hour of slack number 66.

130
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,300
Perfect concentration.

131
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,820
No distractions.

132
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,440
No anxiety.

133
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,100
No fear.

134
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,580
No fear.

135
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,540
Brazil

136
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,980
Brazil

137
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,280
Brazil

138
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,840
Brazil

139
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,200
The rogues were entertaining him

140
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,580
We stood beneath an amber moon

141
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,360
And softly murmured, someday soon

142
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,800
We kiss

143
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,200
We kiss

144
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,620
We do the work, you do the pleasure

145
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,600
We kiss

146
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:25,600


147
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:25,600


148
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:34,860
there i want to talk to you about ducts do your ducts seem old-fashioned out of date central

149
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:42,240
services new duct designs are now available in hundreds of different colors to suit your

150
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,120
individual taste hurry now while stocks last your nearest central service has shown

151
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,580
designer colors to suit your demanding taste

152
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,840
the rumor became reality another satanic cult

153
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,940
no yes just another evil cult that was supposed to be a good one

154
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,200
this is how the war gets on the radio

155
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,540
i think a lot of

156
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:25,720
subjects

157
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,980
this is originally believed they were doing something good by joining the church

158
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,360
that wheel and chain setup makes the sound of moving artillery sounds like a real battle

159
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,440
well it's nothing compared to what it takes to move this show don't be alarmed

160
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,000
more work than saving souls believe me that punch didn't connect the sound was fake although

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,540
stang suffered a real blow from an infuriated gabofran oh that was a great blow yes the

162
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,800
mallet on a grapefruit gave the sound of that blow

163
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,720
curiously refreshing

164
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,700
ambled

165
00:07:59,700 --> 00:07:59,900
a

166
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,100
a

167
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,360
a

168
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,620
and again

169
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:25,800
etc.

170
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,080
But here they come, there, the guard is forming to march the guilty offender away

171
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,620
Yes, those who believed the wrong lies in the book of the subgenius

172
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,680
Taken into the stadium near Dobstown

173
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,200
And all the Malaysians pour into the little wooden seats

174
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,520
For the clumsy child with the hard-to-fit shoe size

To full walking, trotting and running

183
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,480
Until he is actually strutting, dancing and doing gymnastics

184

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,240
Bob.

191
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,680
Here and there, clowns and ballerinas everywhere.

192
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,660
Bob?

193
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,060
We work.

194
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, yes, dear sir.

195
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,080
This is Bill Beeson, a Chinese subgenius.

196
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,260
And you are listening to the Hour of Flag.

197
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,600
Remember, Bob is the comrade of all people.

198
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,140
He is a Chinese, just like in America.

199
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,620
And people need to flag.

200
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,680
In Chinese, we call flag leeting.

201
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,380
But it must be true flag, not the bad flag of our husband.

202
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,420
Boy, will you look at that guy's flag.

203
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,300
Help me somebody.

204
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,460
Thank you, Lily Jing.

205
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,020
Yes, my friend.

206
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,080
We have the great Ivan Stang here tonight.

207
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,960
Ivan Stang himself, the grand auditor and chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith,

208
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,460
who has every subgenius's name on his special basement computer.

209
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:46,020
And he's here tonight to make the hour and a half of slack seem like, well, like forever.

210
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,580
Ivan Stang.

211
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,640
That Stang of Stang's.

212
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,580
Sibling star of rain.

213
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,800
Of Cerno's claws and Jinger's fangs.

214
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,200
When the beaks' cysts are upon us, when it's staking finally upon us,

215
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,220
the beaks will broil, but not in song.

216
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,940
Nature and men will stand aside.

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,720
The jaws of doom shall open wide, while Ivan Stang shall perch inside.

218
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,000
Where promise-ness and ignorance dwells, false prophets,

219
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,300
from their citadels, he topples down to nether hells.

220
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:36,260
He judges pigs and guinea-paws, and renders into visit dogs,

221
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,960
those who proclaim the name of gods.

222
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,780
He rules the masts of Kilo host, evens his knights on the coast,

223
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,400
a fridge from his name as from a ghost.

224
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,660
Where can we go?

225
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,120
Where can we find?

226
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,240
No one knows.

227
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,120
Our place in all this world so wide shall escape the dire subgenial tide.

228
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,700
The Jinger's howl, the Cerno's plea,

229
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,220
Bohemondus rises from the sea, no hiding place for you and me.

230
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,300
What future does our doom procure us?

231
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,840
Hamlet earth, indeed endure us.

232
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,200
Let the damned wound of sin lure us.

233
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,820
A man will not stand around here.

234
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,240
The gangster of the world.

235
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,340
Like no one ever was.

236
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,260
Nay, Britannia awakened by the entrée of a chief-of-the-igona aish it toothpaste.

237
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:38,260
он painter sample tougheneth bury still a blah living contract

238
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:51,460
say ev'ry man's multitudes.

239
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,460


240
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,040
raise an arm from nothing.

241
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,620
Egg any Moore and aynı Panem marble.

242
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:54,620


243
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,800
Ah, yes, dear friends.

244
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,000
So good to be here.

245
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,900
Say it, Ivan, say it.

246
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,420
Feeling the power here in this hideous, hideous place.

247
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,020
Bob lives, friends.

248
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,160
Bob lives.

249
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,560
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

250
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,360
He ain't dead.

251
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,300
Oh, what is this?

252
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,160
I should know.

253
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm the guy that has to read sooner or later all the mail that comes to that P.O. box

254
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,660
that you probably thought was just made up.

255
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,140
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff

256
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,900
and management of this radio station, the other staff, the relations and spouses of

257
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,640
the staff and management, or the staff of this staff and staff.

258
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,920
That's really true, Al, but he doesn't know that it's all over the place these days.

259
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,260
I'm the Bob body dragged out of the Victoria Theater with these eyes.

260
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,440
These deadlights looked on Bob and the light was chilling from them forever.

261
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:01,000
There's saint of sale corpses dotting the landscape all the way from Little Rock to Berkeley here.

262
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,600
I don't know what the big deal is.

263
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,240
I mean, just because there's a Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily...

264
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
I mean, can Bob really die?

265
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,320
This is the...

266
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,680
R.

267
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,420
S.

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,400
S.

269
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
S.

270
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


271
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


272
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


273
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


274
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


275
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


276
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


277
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


278
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


279
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


280
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


281
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


282
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180


283
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,200
S.

284
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,200


285
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,200


286
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,200


287
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,300
S.

288
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,300


289
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,300


290
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,300


291
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,500
S.

292
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,500


293
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,060
Here we go.

294
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,960
When it blows its stacks, he ain't nowhere to be found

295
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,140
When the wolves close, well, we're down

296
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,260
River watch out, river, town is around

297
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,500
Hide all the women in town

298
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,620
Hide, hide all the women in town

299
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,240
When it blows its stacks, when it blows

300
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,660
All you girls, make no mistake

301
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,940
Here's a cold and a snake's new show

302
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,520
He takes them out, out on the nice mud

303
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,980
The town of Bronson

304
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,480
They all see around

305
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,240
When he's straightened up

306
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,280
They all bend down

307
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,680
He don't bow to bad water

308
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,940
He don't push it around

309
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,940
When it blows its stacks

310
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,400
When it blows its stacks

311
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,420
When it blows its stacks

312
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,500
When it blows its stacks, he ain't nowhere to be found

313
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,260
Nowhere to be found

314
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,860
Nowhere to be found

315
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:46,560
All you girls, make no mistake

316
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,380
When it blows its stacks

317
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,780
When it blows its stacks

318
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,240
When it blows its stacks

319
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,240


320
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:19,240
When it blows its stacks

321
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,600
When it blows its stacks

322
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,780
When the cold tear takes the dukes

323
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,060
When the cold dry drops

324
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:39,020
When the cold rain comes

325
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,120
When the old show time

326
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,880
When the

327
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,120
cold hairstyle

328
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,240
When the cold air touches you

329
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,180
ским

330
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:55,300
You probably don't deserve the date, but if you do go ahead and try go ahead and try it's important

331
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,340
If you want to know the truth

332
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:56,220
I love that. I love that. Do you want that? I love that. Do you need that? I need that.

333
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:07,840
You like me? Come on, I need me. What about Lulu? No. Look at me, I'm a dismal. Get down the program. No. Right out the hole, boy, boy.

334
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:18,000
Like a naturalist. No. Got the balls and they show. No. You and I, baby. No. That was a removal. No. Out of the world, no problem. No.

335
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:30,860
Yeah, he'll be hopping to the barbershop with more slack. I gotta have my slack. Give it to me. Yeah. Praise Bob.

336
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,580
Hey. Boy, I mean, slack is better than red beans and rice.

337
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:49,000
On top of a smoky, all covered with sand, I shot my 14.

338
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:59,300
I shot her with pleasure, with a red rubber band. I shot her with pleasure. I shot her with bleak, bleak.

339
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:12,800
I couldn't have missed her, she was 40 feet wide. I went to her funeral, I went to her grave.

340
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,360
Everybody threw flowers, ran through a grenade.

341
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,240
I was walking down the hall, everybody threw flowers, ran through a grenade.

342
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,240


343
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,580
The police came and got me and put me in jail.

344
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,640
They brought a bazooka and shot him to H-E-L-L.

345
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,180
Oh, thank you, Tevis.

346
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,640
That was a beautiful rendition of a classic, classic childhood song.

347
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,780
And there'll be more from the tiniest subgenius prophet coming up.

348
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,440
But friends, you know, we've been griping about those who didn't pay their pledge.

349
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,020
But we haven't really thanked those who had.

350
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,320
And, well, the Willa Dobbs and I got to looking at this board in here,

351
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,400
this poster that they've put up that keeps track of what shows are ahead

352
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,580
and what shows are behind on the pledge drive.

353
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,460
And, friends, I could scarcely believe it,

354
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,680
but the hour of slack.

355
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,760
It's not over.

356
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:21,420
Number five among all KNON shows as far as paid pledges go.

357
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,180
And the other, the four shows out of 80, what, 81 shows, I think.

358
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,220
Yeah, 81 shows.

359
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,380
Out of 81 shows, the four shows that made more money during that pledge drive

360
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,380
than the hour of slack were all on for like 10 hours a day.

361
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,520
They're on every day.

362
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,400
We did better in pajama party, better than anybody.

363
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,480
Now, the gospel shows, they got as much pledges as the subgenius show,

364
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,780
but strangely only 8% paid.

365
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,020
I wonder what that means.

366
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,480
Well, anyway, 50% of you subgeniuses have paid, I think.

367
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,900
By now, probably 50%.

368
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,860
And those who haven't, if you haven't gotten the calls already, you will.

369
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,320
You'll get that call.

370
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,040
And it's all being recorded, not only on magnetic media here in this century,

371
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,020
but on the Akashic records, the records of all things,

372
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,600
that have ever occurred, even inside your brain.

373
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,100
That's all recorded.

374
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:22,180
And we have access to those through our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

375
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,420
And friends, we're going to continue with the show.

376
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,680
I hope you're, once again, I hope you're in headphones.

377
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,060
This is a real headphone show.

378
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,920
The world's better.

379
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,380
We know you're not being talked about.

380
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,140
Okay.

381
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,780
God.

382
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,400
Just have to tell him we don't see anything.

383
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,260
What is this world coming to?

384
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,440
Don't listen to him.

385
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,200
Don't listen to him.

386
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,160
Yes, you can find help.

387
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,320
You can be deprogrammed.

388
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,640
You can find out the truth.

389
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,720
They beat me every day.

390
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
It's a hell of a day.

391
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,260
I know you're a dumbass.

392
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,620
They force you to sleep on board.

393
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,240
I'm sorry.

394
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,340
But that's the fact.

395
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,660
No, he's not.

396
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,260
He's a bastard.

397
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,740
He's a witness.

398
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,900
He's going to kill you.

399
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,080
I'm the motherfucker.

400
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,660
I'm the bastard.

401
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,380
I'm the bastard.

402
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:13,380


403
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,720
All right.

404
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,580
Now, stay in my house.

405
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:26,160
When the subgeniuses came in, they took all my furniture and sold it to buy me this neck brace that I can't take off now.

406
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,540
They said it was an 11 billion and that.

407
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,700
He lived here.

408
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,020
He lived here.

409
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,340
I haven't talked to anybody else in the entire city.

410
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,340
Bring the upper lip down below the upper teeth.

411
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,120
Be sure to keep it down.

412
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,180
Until the fingers are in position.

413
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,880
Here comes the frat.

414
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,620
At each corner of the mouth, insert a thumb under the upper lip.

415
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:59,580
Now, slide the thumbs along the inside of the upper lip until they are positioned just below and to the side of each nostril.

416
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,780
The results are thrilling.

417
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,540
Everywhere these messages are heard, souls are being saved and sick bodies are being healed.

418
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,200
Don't send them your money.

419
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,320
They've got me locked up in there.

420
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,780
Ah!

421
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,480
Ah!

422
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,980
Ah!

423
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,380
Ah!

424
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:13,380


425
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:20,160
I too refused to send money to the church of the subgenius.

426
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,920
And I too fell under the power of Iggy.

427
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,520
You must tell them what the deal is.

428
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,780
And I don't think they must know...

429
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,820
They're trying to shut us up, but there are subgenius dissonance there.

430
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,240
Stop right there.

431
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,300
Sorry for keeping you in, Doctor. Go on.

432
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,800
Don't leave me here.

433
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,500
They make me say things.

434
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,480
Don't leave me here.

435
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,440
I understand.

436
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,780
Don't let them kill me.

437
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,680
Torture me.

438
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,580
I understand.

439
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,540
They torture me.

440
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,480
I don't want to be seen.

441
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,040
Torture me.

442
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,940
I don't want to be seen.

443
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,280
Don't let them kill me.

444
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't let them kill me.

445
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,360
I hate this place.

446
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,280
Parrot and parakeet training.

447
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,700
They torture me.

448
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,400
Go ahead.

449
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,020
Kill me.

450
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,240
I hate this place.

451
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,920
Parrot and parakeet training.

452
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,160
Go ahead.

453
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,540
I'll kill you.

454
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,020
This has been the subgenius.

455
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,180
Parrot and parakeet training.

456
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,340
I'm proud of my language.

457
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,020
Let the sons of God and man be a witness.

458
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,240
Even in the belly of the Thunderbird,

459
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,660
I've been casting out the false prophets.

460
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,540
I'm busted.

461
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,860
I've gotten blown my O-ring.

462
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,060
No!

463
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:27,940
No!

464
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,100


465
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,720
No!

466
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,860
No!

467
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,400
No!

468
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,600
No!

469
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:33,600


470
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,580
No!

471
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:34,820


472
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:34,900
No!

473
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:34,900


474
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,500
No!

475
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:35,560


476
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:35,560


477
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:37,200
No!

478
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,280
No!

479
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:38,840
No!

480
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


481
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


482
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


483
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


484
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


485
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


486
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


487
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


488
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


489
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


490
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


491
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


492
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,380


493
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:53,120
We have with us from the Ministry of Information, Deputy Minister Eugene Heltman.

494
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,460
Good evening, David.

495
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,840
What do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?

496
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Bad sportsmanship.

497
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:08,820
A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old-fashioned virtues.

498
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,320
They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win.

499
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:18,120
If these people would just play the game, they'd get a lot more out of life.

500
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:25,060
Nevertheless, Mr. Heltman, there are those who maintain that the Ministry of Information has become too large and unwieldy.

501
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,200
David, in a free society, information is the name of a game.

502
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,520
You can't win the game if you're a man short.

503
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,740
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister, 7% of the gross national product.

504
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,100
I understand this concern on behalf of the taxpayer.

505
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
People want value for money.

506
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,160
That's why...

507
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,740
We always insist on the principle of information retrieval charges.

508
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,140
It's absolutely right and fair that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention

509
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,880
and for the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation.

510
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,320
Do you believe that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?

511
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,040
Oh, yes.

512
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,940
Our morale is much higher than theirs.

513
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,440
We're fielding all their strokes.

514
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,160
Running a lot of them out.

515
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,160
And pretty consistent.

516
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,460
Constantly knocking them for six.

517
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,420
I'd say they're nearly out of the game.

518
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,340
One should floor abiding citizens and have to subsidize people.

519
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,200
But, Mr. Heltman, the bombing campaign is now in its 13th year.

520
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Beginner's luck.

521
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,620
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

522
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,940
Thank you, David.

523
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,420
And a very Merry Christmas to you all.

524
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,240
Know then that it is the year 10,191.

525
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,080
There have always been bobs.

526
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,900
There has never been a world without a bob.

527
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,480
Just as there's never been a bob without a dick.

528
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,480
His corresponding evil twin brother, Dick Dobbs.

529
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,060
The demons you may see during the initial...

530
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,780
...hallucinations.

531
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,320
...get him away from me.

532
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,920
...are not real.

533
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,460
...get him away from me.

534
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,580
Erotic carnality.

535
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,400
If...

536
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,420
...if you do not panic...

537
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,560
...this phase will end after a few minutes.

538
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,480
...so always resurface from the hypgnosis slowly, dear friends.

539
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,180
...hyah-yah-yah-yah.

540
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,780
...h-h-h-h-h-h-h.

541
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,260
...oh, yeah, I want a...

542
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,380
...h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h.

543
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,080
...I want a...

544
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,060
...that's not right, Gary.

545
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,860
That should be a...

546
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,320
...h-h-h-h-h-h-h.

547
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,660
...okay.

548
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,140
...h-h-h-h-h-h-h.

549
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,300
Well, yes, I was going to make...

550
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,860
...I was going to make serious funny noises.

551
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,780
Because...

552
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,300
...because we all know that Bob is the man that makes all the ladies go...

553
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,740
...h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h.

554
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,460
...he's the man that makes all the men go...

555
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,000
...well, let's take a little rest.

556
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,320
It ain't an own-chattin' laid-back universe, dear friends.

557
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,320
It's a...

558
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,360
...take a little rest and...

559
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,180
...universe.

560
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,040
An action-packed universe.

561
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,060
...uh...

562
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,460
...heh-heh-heh-heh.

563
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:04,740
...yes.

564
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,760
...heh-heh-heh-heh.

565
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,540
...a boring and...

566
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,420
...heh-heh-heh-heh.

567
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,460
...a virulating and...

568
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,680
...a universe where everyone has an orange glow...

569
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,720
...a cute, present, biologically active universe.

570
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:12,980


571
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,200
...coming from the holes between their shoelaces.

572
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,420
...just because.

573
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,140
...enormous bioplasm that stretches throughout infinity.

574
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,720
...enormous bioplasm that stretches throughout infinity.

575
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,020
Oh, did you get some of that, too?

576
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,500
Yes, it was delicious.

577
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,740
...that he'd force him to eat this big, ugly piece of meat.

578
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,040
...that he'd force him to eat this big, ugly piece of meat.

579
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,980
He was a little, short, chubby guy, and that's where Bob got the idea.

580
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,540
...that he'd force him to eat this big, ugly piece of meat.

581
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,480
They say he came in with checkered pants on, but I just don't remember.

582
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,220
He was allowed to eat all he wanted.

583
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,160
...challenging...

584
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,140
...anything he wanted.

585
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,180
Bob's big boy...

586
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,260
...closing in on mine.

587
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,020
...was a real person.

588
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,040
That's true, but there was...

589
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,180
...a myth, turns out, would have been based on facts.

590
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,840
...a real Bob, and this parable goes to show that there is indeed always a real Bob.

591
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,040
...in your mind.

592
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,740
There has to be a Bob, dear friend.

593
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,960
Even the things which you cannot possibly believe in, Bob's big boy, indeed, turn out to be an...

594
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,240
...actual, historic person.

595
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:13,120
And as it is with Bob's big boy, surely it is with the far more impressive and major deity...

596
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,100
...we know as the Avatar of All Slack.

597
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,560
That's how we know him.

598
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,060
That's how we know him.

599
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,540
Others, others call him Pimp, or Mongrel.

600
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,560
Others call him a demon!

601
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,680
Or your mama.

602
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,460
Indeed.

603
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,600
And the children of Bob are everywhere.

604
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,640
Bob lives on in his millions and millions, literally millions, of illegitimate children.

605
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,780
All of them pressing lawsuits.

606
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,400
Against me, personally.

607
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,360
Well, Doctor, I'm sure you're used to it by now.

608
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,280
Well, when I took on the job as Sacred Scribe at the church...

609
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,140
...the first time to share the lives of the church...

610
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,840
...I had no idea what I was going to be getting into.

611
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,820
We had 500 employees in 1980.

612
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,360
Now it's just me and someone else.

613
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,980
Well, uh, that's just the Reagan-esque spirit that's been infusing society for its own sake.

614
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,820
And yet they say that Bob doesn't even exist!

615
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,760
There are some who say that Bob...

616
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,560
...there is no Bob.

617
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,700
If there's no Bob, then where did all of those dead bodies come from?

618
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,360
What about all those ads in the 50s?

619
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,440
...that he posed for?

620
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,240
Well, it says right here, the body store.

621
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,560
Dead Bob's for any occasion.

622
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,020
Oh, put that away. That's not impressing anyone.

623
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,020
No Bob too small, no Bob too big.

624
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,000
No, really, uh, guys, all kidding aside, I, I, I, all kidding aside...

625
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,200
...the, uh, at least the official Father Church, the subgenius foundation...

626
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,080
...which we don't expect, uh, any of you except the...

627
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,180
...the stinking Bobbies to cling to.

628
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:42,560
Uh, nevertheless, we, we have the only true word of Bob, the original apostles.

629
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:48,660
And as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing about Bob being dead is a ruse!

630
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,960
Bob staged that whole thing himself!

631
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,680
It was fashionable in the 60s.

632
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

633
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,140
That big...

634
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,200
...bubble.

635
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,920
It's the same frontwards and back, friends.

636
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,980
And there's a reason there's an O in the middle.

637
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,020
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

638
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,840
Red, there's red.

639
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,960
A, a, a hole in the middle between those two Bs.

640
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,340
It's symbolic, friends.

641
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,040
You can look through that, the center of that O in Bob's name and see the future and the past.

642
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,500
But...

643
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,660
...the spice must flow.

644
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,080
A woman, age 93...

645
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:41,020
...was killed on a merry-go-round, um, when her, she and her wheelchair were thrown from the thing in Sherman's amusement park.

646
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,580
...the thing in Sherman's amusement park.

647
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:03,580


648
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:03,580


649
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:03,580


650
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:03,620
The

651
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:03,820
The

652
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,000
The

653
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,020
The

654
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,060
The

655
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,060


656
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,060


657
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,060


658
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,060


659
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:34,060


660
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,660
The

661
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:34,660


662
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,880
The True Riley

663
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,480
The True Riley

664
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,000
Has

665
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,680
The True Riley

666
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,640
Has

667
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,760
гляed

668
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,520
The True Riley

669
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,620
inherent in life on earth and gain control of the situation,

670
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,340
we will return you to your previously scheduled conversation.

671
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,360
If this had been an actual phone call,

672
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,000
you would have been instructed to leave your name, number, time,

673
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,060
and message when you hear the tone.

674
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,260
Thank you.

675
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,600
Reference 9, praise Bob.

676
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,220
This is Robert Anton Wilson

677
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:23,000
and about my appearance for the Church of the Subgenius,

678
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,580
Jeff Rosenbaum, who arranges the tours.

679
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,900
We'll be calling you about that

680
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,640
because he's the one who has all the flight plans

681
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,560
and the airline tickets and his controls.

682
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,380
He will be the one who arranges the dates with you when I'll be there.

683
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,220
I better shut up because I'm running out of time.

684
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:37,940
Praise Bob.

685
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,360
Praise Bob.

686
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,500
Well, yeah, that's right.

687
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,020
That was Robert Anton Wilson.

688
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,400
About 10 of you listeners probably know who he is.

689
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,520
We have the chance of setting up a lecture

690
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,980
or an ordeal,

691
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,760
or show or whatever with Robert Anton Wilson.

692
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,100
He's going to be coming through Texas

693
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,700
to do shows at least in Austin

694
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,760
at the Book People's Bookstore.

695
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,300
I know about that one.

696
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,700
We could set one up here in Dallas,

697
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,920
but we need about $450 or $500 front money, see,

698
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,320
to get him in.

699
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,360
That's just the cost of the show, basically.

700
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,720
We also need a place to do it.

701
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,980
If anybody is wild and crazy,

702
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,300
crazy about Robert Anton Wilson

703
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,640
and wants to get real involved in bringing him to Dallas,

704
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,380
then let us know.

705
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,580
For those of you who don't know,

706
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,240
he's the author of Illuminatus and Schrodinger's Cat

707
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,280
and several other cosmic science fiction books

708
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,680
that, well, you just have to check them out.

709
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,640
And you can't hear them.

710
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,280
But write us here at the station

711
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,980
or write to Bob or call us right now.

712
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,660
You can speak to the Will of Dobbs.

713
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,820
So we're going to continue here.

714
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,580
All right.

715
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:52,820
Thank you.

716
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,120
You're negatively in the background.

717
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,560
We have a swimming pool in the dishwasher.

718
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,300
Well, as you can hear,

719
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,320
Dr. Hal Robbins and Gary Gabroga,

720
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,700
our guest in the studio,

721
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,140
them and several movie soundtracks.

722
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,840
That's what we're doing, is movie soundtracks.

723
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,280
You're hearing the soundtrack of Brazil in stereo.

724
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,340
That's why I insist on the headphones.

725
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,980
Brazil, Big Trouble in Little China, and Dune

726
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,160
are our favorite sound effects horrors for tonight.

727
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,700
So...

728
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,680
This is Steve.

729
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,520
I'm going to be in town all the time.

730
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,120
What are you talking about, man?

731
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,600
But hurry.

732
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,480
But hurry.

733
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,360
But hurry.

734
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,060
But hurry.

735
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,160
All right, it's Mike at Jimmy Carr.

736
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,440
Oh, too bad we missed you.

737
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,780
This is Mike and Pam in Chicago.

738
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,320
We didn't know if you had caught

739
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,480
Pee Wee's Playhouse this morning,

740
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,240
but Bob was...

741
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,220
prominently displayed on the bulletin board.

742
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,900
If you didn't get it, let me know,

743
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,240
and I'll send you off a copy.

744
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,540
Have a good one. Bye.

745
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,960
How long have you been in the U.S. of A?

746
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,780
Three months.

747
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,380
Where from?

748
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,500
Hong Kong.

749
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,520
What happens?

750
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,420
You stay here a while?

751
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,780
Old girls leave, new girls come in?

752
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,100
Maybe.

753
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:17,660
Maybe.

754
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,140
Take your tie off, please.

755
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,600
Yeah, I know what you mean.

756
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,800
My wife gave it to me.

757
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,540
You owe me for Christmas.

758
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:39,420
A lot of thought was put in that trailer.

759
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,920
Ray Smith, the dad of Chen's wife.

760
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,180
How could he say that?

761
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:41,860
Reverend Ed first burned things on a southern island.

762
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:41,860


763
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:41,860


764
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:41,860


765
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:41,880
and twisting a harsh السing.

766
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,760
The old men now

767
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:42,760


768
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:42,760


769
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,240
Where is they left to put it?

770
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,240


771
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,960
One-e।

772
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,040
Timberlake?

773
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,940
One-e⁶

774
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,420
Blackriminal Service

775
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:49,420


776
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:49,740
The tough, answered question.

777
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:49,740


778
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,040
この hour areas It's a mistake, Peggy.

779
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,280
Green explosions.

780
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,600
People flying in and out.

781
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,640
That was not real.

782
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,880
I want to talk to the cops.

783
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,280
I want my truck back.

784
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,420
Now, where the hell am I?

785
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:44,920
Landsman.

786
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,280
It's no use.

787
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,840
Give up.

788
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,620
Chris!

789
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,340
Chris.

790
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,500
You hurt me and broke my heart.

791
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,880
You're not doing well.

792
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,520
What?

793
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,080
What?

794
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,100
I think you guys are afraid of J.R. Bob Bob.

795
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,440
You've been doing this show for almost five years now,

796
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,020
disrespectfully making fun of your high E-pop.

797
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,600
The man who brought you...

798
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,120
I'm not afraid of J.R. Bob Bob.

799
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,560
I'm not afraid of J.R. Bob Bob.

800
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,720
...to die for your sins,

801
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,140
to enjoy...

802
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,360
Nobody knows how many times...

803
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:54,900
...to his own sake.

804
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,020
The only thing that ever brought me slack

805
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,840
was leaving Paul and St. Louis.

806
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,260
I'm not kidding, Bob.

807
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,900
I shared this message with you.

808
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,280
I was the only slack I ever got out of this damn church,

809
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,880
and it cost me $3,000 to have him shipped back.

810
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,020
Well, most people don't fear Bob.

811
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,400
Don't fear him a bit.

812
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,640
Oh, they think Bob's always going to be their buddy.

813
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,360
And then as soon as they think Bob's dead,

814
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,620
they turn around...

815
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,860
Now, they think he ain't looking anymore.

816
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They turn around and go to the pinks.

817
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,300
Going to the pinks, every one of them.

818
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,580
Oh, friends, he's just testing you.

819
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,540
He's been testing you for two years.

820
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,240
He knows if you've been bad or good.

821
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,020
Oh, yeah.

822
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,820
But more people are frightened of Gary than frightened of Bob.

823
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,820
Anybody want to go to an...

824
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,260
Why does this situation persist?

825
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,680
Well, it's because of the general loss of faith

826
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,920
to companies that modernize

827
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,280
and the feeling that one can no longer support

828
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,140
the fragility, superstition,

829
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,600
and fanaticism of the world.

830
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:48,620
...and the feeling that one can no longer support the fragility, superstition, and fanaticism of the world.

831
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,520
...and the feeling that one can no longer support the fragility, superstition, and fanaticism of the world.

832
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


833
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,380
...an earlier time when one might well believe

834
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,100
in the smiling, pipe-smoking benevolent figure

835
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,300
known from the book of the subterranean.

836
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,020
That's right.

837
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,140
That was really beautiful.

838
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,320
Very touching, yeah.

839
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,180
It was just beautiful.

840
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,140
Could you repeat that?

841
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,100
Everybody welcome.

842
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,120
Well, I'm here to talk about

843
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,880
the conspiracy again.

844
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,340
As usual.

845
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,280
Well,

846
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,600
let's talk about it again.

847
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:18,620


848
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:18,620


849
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:18,620


850
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,420
My favorite conspiracy this time.

851
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,300
The conspiracy within the Church of the Subteens.

852
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,360
Those right on the brain, it's true.

853
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,940
And that's the conspiracy that's away in my brain again.

854
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,040
And I think most of you know what I mean by the conspiracy.

855
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,000
I knew God's day that he comes back.

856
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,520
It'll be a world without slack.

857
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,220
I'm the God of the world.

858
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,080
And he's coming again.

859
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm the God of the world.

860
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,500
I'm the God of the world.

861
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,780
I'm the God of the world.

862
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,840
And he's coming again.

863
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,040
If we don't want the answers upon us,

864
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,480
then we need more to be honest.

865
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm the God of the world.

866
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,200
I'm the God of the world.

867
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,020
I'm the God of the world.

868
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,860
I'm the God of the world.

869
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,620
And he's coming again.

870
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,380
I'm the God of the world.

871
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,040
And he's coming again.

872
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,920
Again.

873
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,160
Yes, I'm the purple flower of hell.

874
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,240
Give me wide berth when I drop my droves.

875
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,420
Mother nature swoots.

876
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,340
A six million year cycle.

877
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,160
I'm the God of the world.

878
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:47,180


879
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,280
And in 1998,

880
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,260
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon,

881
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,180
which in a few years,

882
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,980
will bring more wondrous and miraculous change

883
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,480
and carnage, insanity and destruction

884
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,860
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

885
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,580
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

886
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,740
A time of cataclysmic economic change

887
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,340
that will offer untold riches and power

888
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,200
to those in the know.

889
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,160
While billions of people

890
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,600
deserving conspiracy dupes

891
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,260
for hiding in hell on Earth.

892
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,140
Uncontrolled thinking,

893
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,920
controlled by Bob,

894
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,120
will usher in a spiritual rebirth

895
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,540
and a cascade of astounding mysteries,

896
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,760
supernatural bridges,

897
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,460
and a restoration of lost psychic abilities

898
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,280
that will totally transform the lives

899
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,480
of those who dare to seek them

900
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,020
and pay for them.

901
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,120
That's right.

902
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,900
You're lucky to live in the end of time.

903
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,340
Here's more money, Bob.

904
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,640
Wise up.

905
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,000
They're out to get you.

906
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,140
Moving podium.

907
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:00,660
Prods.

908
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,540
And having once prodded moves on.

909
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,840
I'm not moving.

910
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,160
You know, the subgenius is not just below a genius,

911
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,740
whatever that may be.

912
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,200
The subgenius does not pretend

913
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,100
to suit the subgenius.

914
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,460
It's not just the super knowledge,

915
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,680
but the subknowledge.

916
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,940
Knowledge of the underthings,

917
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,680
the underwear lurking beneath the clothing of existence.

918
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,300
The foundation garment, if you will.

919
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,260
Underlying reality.

920
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,960
You see, the subgenius is a strange beast indeed.

921
00:46:46,120 --> 00:47:05,840
The two superb subgeniuses represent the secret brains

922
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,560
of our ageless human race.

923
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:06,800
We can't give a rat's deluge

924
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:06,840
if we'reểu debate strength,

925
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:06,860
really guilty of lazy thinking.

926
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,440
Conviction slowly passes off

927
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:07,540
as cruel as the context of my inherent

928
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:07,540


929
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:07,540


930
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:07,540


931
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,580
Between pure curiosity

932
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:12,580


933
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:12,580


934
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,400
over and over again.

935
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,240
Hurry now. We have to catch the last one.

936
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,700
I gave the anti-virgin a hot protein tassel wash.

937
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,620
I'm a bacteriological weapon.

938
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,760
I'm armed and I'm loaded.

939
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,560
I'm a fishing reactor.

940
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,980
I fight plutonium.

941
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,440
Power plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow.

942
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,720
When they plug me in, the lights go out.

943
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,440
In Hong Kong, I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

944
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,620
Come and get me.

945
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,800
Soon they'll begin to fold space.

946
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,540
Space far off in the control rooms of Spice Gas.

947
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,120
Traveling without moving.

948
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:00,680
Ivan Stang, 15, shows scars after being attacked by an alligator near West Palm Beach, Florida, Monday.

949
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:09,180
Ivan and a friend were swimming in a lake when suddenly he was grabbed by the head and pulled underwater by a giant sharp-toothed saurian.

950
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,780
I couldn't see anything but teeth and didn't know what had hold of me.

951
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:20,140
Until the gator let loose and swam away, said Ivan, who suffered wounds requiring 41 stitches.

952
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,140
This is supposed to be a religious show.

953
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,260
Now what is the interpretation of this parable, my friends?

954
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:34,840
The alligator is the worldly mob, the rabble, who always seek to devour and assimilate the holy men of the Church of the Subgenius.

955
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,420
The lone swimmer, buoyed up by the fluid element, represents, upon the other hand,

956
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,060
the striving outward...

957
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,380
...force of the Church of the Subgenius, which requires 41 stitches,

958
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,560
the same number as the number of bullet holes in Bob's bullet-reddled body.

959
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,400
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

960
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,920
What are we gonna do?

961
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,280
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocrities?

962
00:48:59,380 --> 00:48:59,960
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

963
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:08,240
These pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens, these normals who have made normality the norm?

964
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,640
Well, no, I wouldn't like revenge on those people.

965
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,640
I'd like revenge on you!

966
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,840
I wouldn't, Ivan, because you've taken one too many twenty-dollar check from me.

967
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,820
I've never got...

968
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,080
I want my slack!

969
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,880
Let's see your Subgenius membership card, hmm?

970
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,440
Now let's not get into any...

971
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,240
I mean, say the end times came a little bit soon, Gary.

972
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:31,800
Do you think you'd make it on the escape saucers of the sex goddesses without your little Subgenius membership card?

973
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,660
I'd sure try.

974
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,380
Oh, this is a great example you're setting for the people out here.

975
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,620
I've got my Bob Amira card here.

976
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,740
It says that I paid up to 1997?

977
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:42,740
1997?

978
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,620
You see, Gary is the Rasputin of the Church of the Subgenius, often thought for, but rarely encountered.

979
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,420
And it is this self-same-learning for slack which separates us from them.

980
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,120
At the hip.

981
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:02,120
The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness, yet he never feels cheated.

982
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,580
He thinks it's natural.

983
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,840
He thinks it's fine.

984
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:05,340
Who?

985
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:05,920
Big deal.

986
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,400
Who cares?

987
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
Well, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Tsang.

988
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,600
And, uh, we've been getting some calls tonight.

989
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:12,780
We've been getting some calls.

990
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:12,980
It's a big deal.

991
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:12,980


992
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:12,980


993
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,820
Well, I've been talking to people who have apparently never heard of the Church of the

994
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:19,340
Subgenius before, don't know anything about it, don't know that there's acres and acres

995
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:25,840
of reading material available, don't know—which is at least up to the level of the incredible

996
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,000
mixing you're hearing on this show.

997
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,980
And you can write for information.

998
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,600
That's all we can tell you on this station for a very good reason, because you need

999
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,280
to send your money to the station.

1000
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,880
But, uh, you can send your letters of your questions.

1001
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,860
Send your questions to Bob.

1002
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,280
That's J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1003
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,620
And friends, that address is coming up as you stay tuned for Ron Lindsay's Soul Oldies.

1004
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,460
Have that pencil ready by now?

1005
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,460
Well, you need to write to Bob at P.O. Box.

1006
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:09,200
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com

1007
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,300
So friends, your hour of slack is coming to an end.

1008
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,520
But be ready for more slack, more slack dripping and leaking all over you.

1009
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,080
Oh, yeah.

1010
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,120
I suppose we could get in, but there are nothing but half-witted cattle

1011
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,860
racing each other to be first.

1012
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,420
First to the slaughterhouse and stampeding you along with them.

1013
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,500
But what do you care?

1014
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,800
Oh, you've got slack.

1015
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,460
Slack.

1016
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:45,720
Yeah.

1017
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,500
Anybody want to go down the slack?

1018
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,480
That's them all.

1019
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,080
Oh, get along, little bobbies.

1020
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,180
Go head on down to Dobbstown now.

1021
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,360
Get on in that Dobbstown corral, you little bobbies.

1022
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,160
Hey, burr.

1023
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:00,740
Mmm.

1024
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,500
Ooh, what's up?

1025
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,860
Oh, there's a nice fat one.

1026
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,140
Yes, you'll be a good trading commodity.

1027
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,260
Come the bargaining session with the exes.

1028
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,280
First up, I notice y'all don't talk about religion much.

1029
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,480
I guess it's real hip out here in California.

1030
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,760
It's a more humanistic approach to life.

1031
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,940
No, we believe in just letting the holy benediction of Bob

1032
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,580
flow out like puss in a puss tank.

1033
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,420
I just don't understand the true power of the show.

1034
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:35,320
It's very fashionable to say Bob is a good man.

1035
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,680
Oh, he was a prophet.

1036
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,220
But, uh, the son of Jehovah's Witness will protect him.

1037
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,540
I don't know why he was superstitious.

1038
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,380
Certainly.

1039
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,180
Very fashionable.

1040
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,620
He had an unpretentious, crazy, unproving look.

1041
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,420
Oh, is he also God?

1042
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,340
But silently, my slow degrees, my spirits are debarred.

1043
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:01,520
In humble trust, my eyelids, in reverential resignation.

1044
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,420
No wish to strive, no thought expressed.

1045
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,660
Only a sense of suffocation.

1046
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,720
With the groove I only got, we shall all be moved.

1047
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,560
Ready or not, here we come.

1048
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,940
Getting down on the one which we believe in.

1049
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,380
Can I get it on my super-thick gourd?

1050
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,580
If I turn my gas down, I'm going to hell.

1051
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,000
We're on the move.

1052
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,640
I think it's time for us to go.

1053
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah!

1054
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,760
Hey, don't tell me now!

1055
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,060
We're on the move!

1056
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,580
We're on the move!

1057
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:48,580


1058
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:48,580


1059
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:53,720
Uh, friends, if you're interested in more history of the Church of the Subgenius, there

1060
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,760
will be an online course taught in that.

1061
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,180
That's why we're doing these rerun-type shows.

1062
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:07,620
If you want information about that, you can check out MaybeLogic.org or even Maybelogic.org.

1063
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:07,620


1064
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:07,620


1065
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:07,620


1066
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:07,620


1067
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,200
MaybeLogic.com.

1068
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,620
It's MaybeLogic Academy that is doing this.

1069
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,400
For information on the Church of the Subgenius,

1070
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,500
please look into Subgenius.com.

1071
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,020
Speaking of ancient fossilized subgenius tapes,

1072
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:38,940
I'm going to close with some cuts from Media Barrage No. 4,

1073
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,200
which predates Hour of Slack.

1074
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,280
This was put together in late 1980.

1075
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:52,580
And it'll be okay because remember where Bob is?

1076
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:58,780
Bob is at PO Box 1403-06.

1077
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,020
Bob can help you.

1078
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,500
That's right. Thanks, Bob.

1079
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,200
Thank you for bringing that joy and sunshine and blood into my veins

1080
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,120
and bringing those pills into my briefcase

1081
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,080
where I can get them out and take them whenever I want.

1082
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,120
Yeah, pumping through me.

1083
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,940
And I like the pills that Bob sends

1084
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,180
because Bob sends pills that make my heart wise.

1085
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,240
I have wise blood and family.

1086
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,560
I love to feel the blood that Bob makes me.

1087
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,840
I pump through my brain because the drugs and oh, Bob.

1088
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,600
I like it.

1089
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,160
I love you.

1090
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,520
I love you.

1091
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,660
What if somebody isn't really good with throat noises?

1092
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,020
Will you still take their money?

1093
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,280
We do not require proof of subgeniusness at all.

1094
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,700
We often find that we're able to, once they join up,

1095
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,400
we're able to get them off to one of our subgenius retreats,

1096
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,380
change their diet, start feeding them propaganda,

1097
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,840
repeating the same thing over and over again until they forget who they are.

1098
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,440
And start responding only to our dogma.

1099
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,680
But it's all real. It's really real.

1100
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,020
It was really, really real at the time we were there.

1101
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,140
The communications are wide open.

1102
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:18,680
We can hear everything coming down that pike, coming our way.

1103
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:23,220
And we like to be on the radio and talk to all the boys and girls that are all out there.

1104
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,200
We're letters and keep them cards and letters coming, girls.

1105
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,880
And send pictures of yourselves, if you know what I mean.

1106
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,600
Because we need more girls.

1107
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,460
And bring your rich fathers.

1108
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,160
And we'll convince them that we're not really that weird.

1109
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,660
And we can get some money and really make him a lot more money.

1110
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,600
Because we're a modern mystical business, man.

1111
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,560
Marvelous.

1112
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,900
The smell of success is never too sweet.

1113
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,260
We can help you out.

1114
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,160
I think we're being sold a bill, a big bill of goods.

1115
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,000
Oh, oh, oh.

1116
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,120
Oh, oh, oh.

1117
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1118
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1119
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1120
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:13,020
You can fly to Malaysia and Dobstown.

1121
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:20,840
And you can fly to the special mountaintops where Bob learns from great holy men

1122
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,180
that have helped him along when he was younger.

1123
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,560
And now he's teaching them.

1124
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,200
And you can be with Bob and be listening to the teachings that come through.

1125
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,060
And I tell you, friends,

1126
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:36,140
if you can just get that, if you can just pull out that wallet,

1127
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,180
pull it out of your pocket, pull it out of your purse,

1128
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,040
pull it out of wherever you got it.

1129
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,780
Pull it on out.

1130
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:44,280
You can put one hand on the radio and with the other one you pull out that dollar bill.

1131
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,060
And I tell you, if you don't feel that power coursing from that dollar bill

1132
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:52,560
to that radio or that tape recorder or that whatever you may have.

1133
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,400
I mean, some people tell me they hear the voices

1134
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,980
and they don't have no machine running at all.

1135
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,580
That's the only experiment people can do if they're listening on the radio.

1136
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,680
Or on their tape machine.

1137
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,540
So they can take that dollar bill out of their pocket

1138
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,560
and hold it by one end above the machine that they're listening on.

1139
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,160
Whether it be the radio or the tape recorder.

1140
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,220
Hold it there on one end with two hands.

1141
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,480
One grasp on each corner and hold it above the machine.

1142
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:27,080
And you'll notice that it bends down and points towards the radio.

1143
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,040
It will point down towards it.

1144
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,560
Down towards the center of that machine right there.

1145
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:31,560


1146
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,660
Right where the real power is meeting the wires.

1147
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,380
And it's all coming together.

1148
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,260
It's coming out of the reality of the physical world.

1149
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,160
And turning into the spirit world.

1150
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,080
And there's a bridge there.

1151
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,120
And Bob can help you make that bridge to where the physical world

1152
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,680
don't no longer mean nothing to you.

1153
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,460
And that dollar bill won't mean nothing to you.

1154
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,260
And friend, I'm telling you that in five years

1155
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,960
that dollar bill ain't going to mean nothing in the spirit world,

1156
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,160
the physical world, or the mental world to anybody.

1157
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,340
It doesn't mean anything now.

1158
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,540
It means nothing.

1159
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,680
It means very little.

1160
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,880
It can mean a bottle of beer for some lost individual.

1161
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,940
It can mean a cigarette or two.

1162
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,960
It can mean enough gas to get you back home from the gas station, sure.

1163
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,700
But I tell you what, when that tribulation money starts coming down,

1164
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,740
you're going to find out that those little green pieces of paper

1165
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,940
made by the clones in Washington,

1166
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,680
the people that aren't people, they're making that stuff

1167
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,100
and it ain't going to be worth nothing.

1168
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,520
You can't sleep on it. You can't burn fires with it.

1169
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,840
You can't stay warm with that.

1170
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,400
You have to have too much of it.

1171
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,400
But I tell you what you don't need too much of,

1172
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,540
and that's the word of Bob.
