1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
For men on the go, it's not what's in the pipe, it's the pipe itself.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,960
The Bob Dobbs Classic Meerschaum, hand-carved by the finest craftsmen in Malaysia.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,820
This and other fine Bob Dobbs smoking accessories cast a spell of their own for the discriminating smoker.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,420
Bob Dobbs pipes never go out. Of style.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,560
Available at Kmart, Walmart, Target and Hypermart.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,880
Too much church air.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm expanding my...

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,600
It's...

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,880
It's...

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,360
Now!

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,180
Praise...

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,400
Machine!

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,160
And welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

14
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,940
Hour of...

15
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,900
Church!

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,560
Praise God!

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,180
Yeah! Now, before we really get going with this sermon here, I'd like y'all to share something.

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,080
It's something we've done in Texas and Arkansas for many years.

19
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,700
It's just...

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,980
To kind of...

21
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,060
Make people understand the solemnity, the profundity of the whole thing.

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,120
Lower your heads and we'll share a sacred moment of...

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,940
NOISE!

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,320
Yeah!

25
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,720
Take those!

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,160
Take those!

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,680
Take those!

28
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,920
All right!

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,940
Ah! There we go!

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,520
Now I see some people that are into it!

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,900
These people have slack!

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,560
The sound itself...

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,060
It...

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,180
It has a stink to it!

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:00,820
It's...

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:01,880
Baaaaaaaaaaah!

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,080
Baaaaaaaah!

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,260
Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,840
Who's gonna drive that greyhound, children?

40
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,860
Greyhound!

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,220
Who's gonna drive that greyhound, children?

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,280
Greyhound!

43
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,980
Who's gonna drive that greyhound, children?

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:20,980


45
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,800
Sonic and I come from little to the middle!

46
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,120
Greyhound gone!

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,340
Woo!

48
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
Always let everybody save ya!

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,720
Greyhound gone!

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,040
Always drive to defy!

51
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,440
Greyhound gone!

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,360
Almighty Father Christ, first man!

53
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,980
Greyhound gone!

54
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,780
Holy Ghost of the lucky train!

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,540
Greyhound gone!

56
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,620
Mary and Joseph waiting at the station!

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,820
Greyhound gone!

58
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,280
They're hitching a ride to the Holy Nation!

59
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,800
Greyhound gone!

60
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,980
There's no smoking or chewing on the...

61
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,920
The ginger roots of the hill!

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,580
There's a virgin Mary!

63
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,660
Paying out the old debtors for me!

64
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,040
Sack me and I'll break his fall!

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,240
He's infuriating us!

66
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,860
We're talking to violence!

67
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,500
And I'm coming down for the dead!

68
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,420
He's gone!

69
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,000
At court plan is headed for the border!

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,540
And they're running out of kids from a federal court order!

71
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,540
It's all ahead!

72
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,920
It's exact change please!

73
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,700
Three Hail Mary's and on your knees!

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,080
Take it to the bridge now!

75
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,440
Oh!

76
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,060
Oh!

77
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,120
Oh!

78
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:40,900


79
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,340


80
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh!

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,500
Oh!

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,100
Oh!

83
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:46,600
Oh!

84
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,780
Oh!

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,760
Oh!

86
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:52,780


87
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,380
Oh!

88
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,000
He's gone!

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,100
Oh!

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,280
Oh!

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,140
Oh!

92
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh!

93
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:01,840
Oh!

94
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,340


95
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,140


96
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,340


97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,800
Oh!

98
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,020
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

99
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,960
He's our driver and our host

100
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,020
We always drive 55

101
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,440
So smoke it or chew it

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Or go to Jerusalem

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,700
There's a virgin Mary

104
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Right on your dashboard

105
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,200
We've got me, don't make it more

106
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,860
He didn't put it in

107
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,580
We're talking about

108
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,480
And I'm calling God for a man

109
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,760
He's our driver

110
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,920
He's our driver

111
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,740
He's our driver

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,980
He's our driver

113
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,540
He's our driver

114
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,820
He's our driver

115
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,480
He's our driver

116
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,040
So smoke it or chew it

117
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,040


118
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,040


119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,040


120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,040


121
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,140
There's a genius down here with a bomb

122
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,560
So smoke it or chew it

123
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,520
You goddamn won't better enjoy it or he'll kill all of you.

124
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,060
He is Bob.

125
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,860
Ready for fun.

126
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,380
He wears a smile.

127
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Everybody run!

128
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,900
Yep, the decks are all running dear friends.

129
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:16,080
That wonderful song that started the show out was Greyhounded Jordan by my brother Cleve Donut Duncan.

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:24,800
I think his best song yet, making it perhaps the greatest song ever recorded.

131
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,020
Praise Cleve. A lot more Cleve coming up tonight.

132
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,040
So, hang in there.

133
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,800
And from now on the first words I want to hear out of your filthy sewers is praise Bob. Let me hear it.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,200
Praise Bob!

135
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,120
Sound off like you got a pair. Praise Bob!

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,380
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely.

137
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,560
Because of your ministry.

138
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,620
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely.

139
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,740
Because of your ministry.

140
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,840
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely.

141
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,020
Because of your ministry.

142
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,480
Here's another one.

143
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,920
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely because of your ministry.

144
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,320
Bob needs an order to pursue his plan for world domination.

145
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:53,960
I say, Bob, God's my hand in all things and pays me off in pure slack.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,520
Here's another one.

147
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,680
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely.

148
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,820
I dare you to kill me!

149
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,620
This is the mark. You can always tell it's going to be a Bob Righteous revival.

150
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,500
And there's technical problems.

151
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,200
Yes!

152
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Headaches.

153
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,060
Yes!

154
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,840
And there's always a normal group, and not normal.

155
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,880
You know, the potheads always seem to show up whenever the subgeniuses do.

156
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,340
As a matter of fact, I went into the restroom to make sure my fly was up,

157
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,620
which is the most important part of any public preaching, by the way.

158
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,440
And somebody in there said,

159
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,640
Hey, Reverend Stang, you want to blow one before the show?

160
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,280
I said, yeah.

161
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,060
Yeah.

162
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,160
I said, Bob is the only drug.

163
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,160
That's the only drug.

164
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,340
You can't come down to Bob.

165
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,540
I just, just say no.

166
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,940
Just say no.

167
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,520
Wow.

168
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,240
That's an old one.

169
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,800
Oh, yes, dear friend.

170
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,520
Hey, Bob!

172
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,580
Hey, Bob!

173
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:29,960
Hey!

174
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Bob!

175
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,540
All right, all right, I can see we've got the spirit.

176
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,520
The spirit is moving tonight.

177
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,600
Yeah!

178
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,280
Yeah!

179
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,760
Yeah!

180
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,260
Yeah!

181
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,280
Yeah!

182
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,960
This is the subgenius.

183
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,000
This radio ministry hour of slack.

184
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,860
Spreading the seed word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

185
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,800
High E-Bot of the Church of the Subgenius.

186
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

187
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,220
Ha!

188
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,740
Ha!

189
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,540
Ha!

190
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:26,760
Ha!

191
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:27,760
Ha!

192
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,260
Ha!

193
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,720
Ha!

194
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,120
Ha!

195
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,280


196
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:29,900


197
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


198
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


199
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


200
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


201
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


202
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


203
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


204
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


205
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


206
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


207
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


208
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


209
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


210
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


211
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


212
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


213
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:29,940


214
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,340
Ha!

215
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,180
Ha!

216
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,880
Now hear merrily how we spread life's

217
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,060
Sachen Laugh out loud,

218
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,220
And you listen to our slammed lines.

219
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,620
Come on!

220
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,160
Whatever.

221
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,980
That's filin'.

222
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,800
Come on!

223
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,520
Hear your screaming wholegans when

224
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,520


225
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,520


226
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,520


227
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,240
And the heart full of what you've learned.

228
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,140
And the power of Old German, old German, and old German.

229
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,360
I'm playing loud and proud, I'm playing loud and proud.

230
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:04,680
Welcome.

231
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,260
Hari Krishna, Hari Rama, here's a flower, here's a dog.

232
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:19,100
Well, here we are at Columbia University's Halloween Spook House.

233
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,120
I recognize your voice, man.

234
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,260
Hello.

235
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,120
You're the radio guy.

236
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,360
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,200
Oh, dude, he's the radio guy.

238
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,280
Reverend Ivan Stang.

239
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,980
That would be you. I've read the statement.

240
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,100
That book, that book, that kind of one is, uh...

241
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,280
Hey, wait, you gotta explain something to me.

242
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,040
Yeah, I got some...

243
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,440
But has Bob seen your $20, my friend?

244
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,120
Then you're still king in the eyes of Bob.

245
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,160
A king, boy.

246
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,300
Then you gotta keep...

247
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,400
And your $20 would earn you a seat.

248
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,020
Well, anyway, as I was saying, some people think the church is like

249
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,340
some sign of the end.

250
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,820
The end times.

251
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,240
The mockers that will come at the end times.

252
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,540
And those people should be damn glad we're helping to fulfill biblical prophecy.

253
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,980
To us, who've been with the church a long time, it's a mystery.

254
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,780
We don't know what the hell this thing's gonna turn into.

255
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,720
If we did, it'd be boring to us.

256
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,580
The great Bob.

257
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,080
Um, it founded...

258
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,860
The church actually was founded in 1953 by that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

259
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,380
Hey, Bob.

260
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,300
Hey, Bob.

261
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,880
Bob founded his church when he discovered that there was a conspiracy, a conspiracy

262
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:38,740
of normals robbing away the slack of the true subgeniuses, as opposed to human beings,

263
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,760
mere humes, as we call them.

264
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,780
It's sort of a do-it-yourself religion.

265
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:51,880
Bob founded his church not on a rock, but rather on sort of a shifting sandy beach of

266
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,600
hypocrisy.

267
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,360
Every church must have its fair measure of hypocrisy.

268
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,050
And certainly we've got more, we dole out more of it than anybody else.

269
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,630
Um, it, like I said, it's a non-organization for non-joiners, which makes it a little bit

270
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,230
difficult to raise funds at times.

271
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,650
But the point of it is that all subgeniuses, people say, well, what the hell is a subgenius?

272
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,770
There's no definition.

273
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,810
They're all different.

274
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,050
That's what it means.

275
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,350
Um, if, uh, there is no typical subgenius.

276
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,610
If any two are alike, one must die.

277
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:31,350
The only thing that the subgeniuses have in common is that they have nothing in common

278
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,650
with the conspiracy.

279
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,090
What we're trying to do is, is tempt sinners away from the devil.

280
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,750
Because Bob is a better tempter than the devil.

281
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,270
However, what they, where they go after that, it's up to them.

282
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,490
The subgeniuses believe in the God that doesn't want you to believe in it.

283
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,590
And, uh, our, one of our many subgeniuses, uh, are not the same.

284
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:54,590


285
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,430
They're just the same.

286
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,010
So, uh, we're, uh, the headquarter is in Dallas, Texas.

287
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,810
This is what they often call the buckle on the Bible belt.

288
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:08,010
What we try to do is unbuckle the Bible belt so that its pants may drop and it may gaze

289
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,090
unflinching upon its own private design.

290
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,410
It's a war, dear friends, it's a war against the normals.

291
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,550
And we're just the regular kind of mutants we're talking about here.

292
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,190
These are more like the monsters.

293
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,570
And we're just the ordinary people.

294
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,570


295
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,570


296
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,570


297
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,570


298
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,570


299
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,570


300
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,570


301
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,870
the monster type of mutants.

302
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,630
It's the humans versus the subgeniuses.

303
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,530
And the ironic thing is, in the early days of the church,

304
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,150
80 million years ago in fabled Atlantis,

305
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,910
we helped to design the humans.

306
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,210
Probably our biggest mistake.

307
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,090
So, friends, as I said, you know,

308
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,490
the fact that Jesus smoked Chesterfields,

309
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,410
even though they didn't exist 2,000 years ago,

310
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,270
is an example of our faith.

311
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,390
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

312
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,850
You just feel it. You feel it in your heart.

313
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,730
Bob sold it. I smoked it. That settles it.

314
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,910
It's a question of faith.

315
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,990
This is like the sorrow of world religions

316
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,250
putting those two Cs on both cheeks,

317
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,650
the bloody marks on the beefy seat of the conspiracy.

318
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,470
It's like the Robin Hood.

319
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,410
Robin Hood of world religions,

320
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,570
robbing from the lost, who were mostly thieves to begin with,

321
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,510
and giving to the saved.

322
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,090
And if you, my friend, can make it,

323
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,250
can buy those books of the subgenius,

324
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,970
that videotape on sale for only $30 tonight,

325
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,410
if you can make it to the jungle encampment in Dobstown, Malaysia,

326
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,350
if you can survive the acubating, the extra meditation,

327
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,390
the pyroflatulation, and the head-launching, my friend,

328
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,890
you will be a weapon.

329
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,710
A weapon for Bob.

330
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,790
A weapon for J.R. Bob Dobbs.

331
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,190
A minister of Bob praying for slack.

332
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,190
Yes, sir!

333
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:03,230
You and your subgenius fools shall never defeat me, Bob Dobbs.

334
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,990
Oh, no?

335
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,050
Then have a taste of my stark fist of removal, Dr. Conspiracy.

336
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:14,330
Negi's henchmen won't get any slack when they face Bobco's new Bob Dobbs action figure

337
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,910
with flying rocket fist, flamethrower pipe, and magic briefcase.

338
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,870
Too much is always good.

339
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,610
But better than not enough when you collect the subgenius universe.

340
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,790
Bobmobile not included.

341
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,570
Batteries and some assembly required.

342
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,210
Action figure sold separately from Bobco.

343
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,630
I am a subgenius.

344
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,110
And by that threat you will touch what falls to the greatest man.

345
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,590
My power was a given.

346
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:58,810
To me, in exchange for prayer or meditation, I paid for it in cold, hard American dollars.

347
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,450
Salvation you get for free is worth just that, doesn't you, queer?

348
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,870
Of course, your money ain't worth jack anyway.

349
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,650
The conspiracy sees to that but a very potent element of your soul.

350
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:20,030
And here's to those otherwise worthless greenbacks that Bob needs in order to pursue his plan

351
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,110
for world domination.

352
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:31,650
I say, Bob guides my hand in all things and pays me off in pure slack.

353
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:39,950
So I say to you whips, you fools, you dupes, you pigs, give me your money.

354
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,190
You won't need it in the future.

355
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,750
The future offers you naught but destruction.

356
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,390
You know what I mean?

357
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,150
I mean,

358
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,510
I dare you to kill me.

359
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,150
I need to be, I mean, I'm one of the good guys.

360
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,390
My cards shall prevail.

361
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,750
Let out the crazy man inside you.

362
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,010
He knows what's what.

363
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,170
Smile when you call me a fanatic.

364
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,210
Oh, you say,

365
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,830
You think I'm dumb, but you are blind to the conspiracy that runs your life.

366
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,610
And you have your geniuses running things for you and you think they're going to make

367
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,890
things safe and simple.

368
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:39,190
And I'm going to make things safe and simple and easy for me and the entire subterranean

369
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,590
rich.

370
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:46,490
Even if it means wiping out your sex society in total with no more sentiment involved and

371
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,350
swatting the blood.

372
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,290
Oh,

373
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,290
we might survive the end.

374
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,510
You know why?

375
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,690
Because I am, I am, I am, I am a sub-TV.

376
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,590
I say,

377
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,470
Oh, you blow dried, white wine sipping, designing a jean clad French film watch and walking

378
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,710
and toting hip whips.

379
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:13,310
If you house coated and choir and reading trailer and camp ball shopping, hair curl,

380
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,870
motor heads, cock holsters.

381
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,470
All you know.

382
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:22,850
You do the corporate big money or the straw tree, killing land, red food, freezing death,

383
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,170
warm and try that.

384
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:24,570
Really?

385
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,150
He established with Terry and both hunting back, stabbing poverty, spreading bomb, wielding

386
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:37,590
morang, heading pencil, neck, eraser headed, politicals, kill the conspiracy, kill them

387
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,290
and eat them, kill them and eat them.

388
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,790
And then why?

389
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,430
Who do you think you are?

390
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,550
What do you think you're doing?

391
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,750
Do you think you got it good?

392
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,490
Well,

393
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,150
dispose of those illusions.

394
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,170
Dispose of them all right now.

395
00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:00,910
Because on July 5th, 1998, 730 in the morning, you shall be judged.

396
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,830
Calculating alien races,

397
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,370
the

398
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:14,410
most

399
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:14,410


400
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:14,410


401
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:14,410


402
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:14,410


403
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:14,410


404
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,470
You will meet Larry DiSanto.

405
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:17,470


406
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,130
If so, why can't I believe that you were up to something so时候

407
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,250
vem.

408
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:24,410
You don't want to think P Vous ti es est hair colorful.

409
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,990
You are telling me Somount by four all cool, govet.

410
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,510
You will flyee.

411
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:37,410
artists where you live, photos.

412
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,890
And he said I'm a nerd.

413
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,370
I always wanted to do politics.

414
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,270
I am the next version.

415
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,550
You know why, Daddy? You know why?

416
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,650
Now, some of you Christians out here may be getting a little upset at what I'm saying,

417
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,710
but I'd like to remind you that the founder of your religion was not quite so squeamish as some of you.

420
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:17,010
And the amazing rant that you heard just a little while ago

421
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:27,890
was a heavily censored version of Brother Cleve Duncan's testimonial

422
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,870
with background sampled music by Huge Voodoo.

423
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,790
More on that in a minute.

424
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,030
I'm really sorry about having to put...

425
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,530
...cuts in that rant,

426
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,430
where the taboo verbal expressions were excised.

427
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,470
You may or may not have noticed them,

428
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,950
but, you know,

429
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,910
until the prudish word-fearing conspiracy is defeated,

430
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,830
well, you know, we're not allowed to play certain words

431
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,210
because of the assumption in some quarters

432
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,890
that some words can actually harm you.

433
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:16,050
Now, more than the images of rape and violence

434
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,970
shown pretty much all the time on television.

435
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,810
Someday these things will change under Bob.

436
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,830
Now, almost all of the rest of this show

437
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,130
was recorded this weekend.

438
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,690
It's all...

439
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,070
It's almost all material recorded this last weekend,

440
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,110
last weekend, in New York and New Jersey,

441
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,730
by myself, Reverend Ivan Stang,

442
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:55,010
and especially the Reverend Dr. D.K. Jones,

443
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,310
as well as his friend, Reverend Bruce Grant,

444
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,490
before, during, and after a subgenius revival

445
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,530
at Columbia University.

446
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,070
D.K. Jones, uh,

447
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,550
is a subgenius musician you'll be most familiar with.

448
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,130
I guess from his score for the subgenius video, Arise.

449
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,570
And, in fact, the music that'll be coming up

450
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,230
and that you've heard some of already,

451
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,410
the stuff with preachers,

452
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,750
sampled bits of preachers over it,

453
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,730
is by Bruce Grant and D.K. Jones

454
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,350
going under the name of Huge Voodoo.

455
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,470
The more linear instrumental background music,

456
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,890
such as the stuff behind us right now,

457
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,150
is by D.K. Jones and myself,

458
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,490
believe it or not,

459
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,510
but mostly D.K. Jones.

460
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,690
I would like to thank

461
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,010
all of those who helped support the station

462
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,210
with their pledges,

463
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,850
uh, last couple of weeks,

464
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,390
and especially to those who helped with the pledge drive,

465
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,830
such as Reverend Willa Dobbs

466
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,450
and, uh,

467
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,370
the good Pope S. Cecilia

468
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,610
and the bad Reverend Trickster Shaman.

469
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,110
Praise Bob, dear friends.

470
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,830
Stay tuned, and, uh,

471
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,770
you'll eventually hear the post office box number

472
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,010
to write to for information regarding

473
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:35,730
this mighty church of the subgenius,

474
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,390
whose, uh, radio voice program,

475
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,130
you're now hearing

476
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,970
the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

477
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,590
Ha, ha.

478
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,730
Praise old Bobby.

523
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,670
JOO SEO O S

524
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,730
No, wait, I'm sorry about the last message.

525
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,130
I just had to tell you this.

526
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,030
This is just the funniest thing.

527
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,510
We're seriously toilet training Sylvia for the first time, right?

528
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,670
So she's sitting there in her little potty watching the Bob tape.

529
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,650
And for the first time, while she's watching the Bob tape, she poops in the potty.

530
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,530
This is a big moment.

531
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,230
You've got to understand.

532
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,350
And just as she's starting to poop, she starts going, Bob!

533
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,270
Bob!

534
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:37,950
And so, like, she has this whole positive feeling about Bob because, you know, right after she poops, she goes, yay!

535
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,390
So it's like, Bob!

536
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,250
Yay!

537
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,150
Bob!

538
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,870
Yay!

539
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,090
It's like this whole pattern is set up in her mind now.

540
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,690
And this is really true.

541
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,210
This is really what just happened just last night.

542
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,610
This is a breakthrough.

543
00:35:52,770 --> 00:36:02,290
And I think I recommend it to other parents who are potty training their children to use subgenius tape on the TV at the time.

544
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:07,350
Because it somehow sends, I don't know what it is, but it just works so well for Sylvia.

545
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:12,570
But what happens when that loose, easy, so-called tramp is your own sister?

546
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,130
Sylvia?

547
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:13,450
Yeah.

548
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,330
I wouldn't want to lie now.

549
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,230
How did Bob strike his first million?

550
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,790
Bob said it was a visuality.

551
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:27,350
When a man like you paid a dollar for one of these bumpers in here, or ten dollars for this amazing poster,

552
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,070
it's true.

553
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,310
Bob, Bob, Bill, $10, Bill.

554
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:39,730
And it's ridiculous to think we're going to give it away just because a bunch of lazy mutants think they own the planet.

555
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:40,930
Bob?

556
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:41,870
Bob?

557
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,010
Bob?

558
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:42,370
Bob?

559
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:42,550


560
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:42,550


561
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:42,550


562
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:42,550


563
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,010
Bob?

564
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,590
I'd like getting a copy of the Economicon.

565
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,130
Is that spells?

566
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,210
We can't know.

567
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:55,870
If every four-by-four people would have one of those, there'd be so damn many old ones and guardian demons coming up out of that main stage.

568
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,810
So are there any patrols?

569
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,350
There'd be like ghostbusters on the mission.

570
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:58,810
Bloody or not.

571
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,290
Bloody or not.

572
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,930
I'm casting out a false prophet.

573
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:04,830
Bob?

574
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:05,830
Yeah?

575
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,530
Doug Quaid is here to see you.

576
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,410
Yeah, I'll be right up.

577
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,110
Okay.

578
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,350
Now, help me out here, Doug.

579
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,930
You were interested in a memory of, uh...

580
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,270
Why?

581
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:15,950
We saved.

582
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,390
We gave unto Bob that which is Bob's.

583
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,090
Render unto him that which...

584
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:22,470
No, I...

585
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,550
Before he renders you like that.

586
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,690
Pink boy in the slaughterhouse.

587
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,210
Uh, there are people who are...

588
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,210
Swag.

589
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,730
What are you?

590
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,030
Uh...

591
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,610
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug,

592
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,270
if outer space is your thing,

593
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,950
I think you would be much happier

594
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,630
with one of our Saturn cruises.

595
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,070
No, I'm telling you, Doug,

596
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,830
your brain will not know the difference.

597
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,830
You're gonna love this, Doug.

598
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,090
We offer you a choice of alternate identities

599
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,010
during your trip.

600
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,310
It's your first trip?

601
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,510
Mm-hmm.

602
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,830
Good evening, Doug.

603
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,330
Hey!

604
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,050
Hey, Doug!

605
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,510
What do you want for Christmas?

606
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,290
Benny, what were you doing

607
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,890
launching that bleeding ad on a Thursday?

608
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,610
Why was you wearing them big green straps?

609
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,670
You know you should not do that, Benny.

610
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,350
Take it easy, Doug.

611
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:27,990
Okay.

612
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:29,670
Doug?

613
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,810
Doug, I'm gonna call a doctor.

614
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:37,470
Doug.

615
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,610
Doug, there's something I want you to know.

616
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,310
You were the best assignment I ever had.

617
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,890
You wouldn't shoot me, would you, Doug?

618
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,870
After all we've been through.

619
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,010
If things have gone wrong,

620
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,350
I'm talking to myself,

621
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,850
and you've got a wet towel wrapped around the head.

622
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,350
No!

623
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,330
We're sorry, Bob.

624
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,150
We didn't mean it.

625
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,770
We didn't mean it to...

626
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,690
We won't call you anymore, Bob.

627
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,190
Please don't call me, Bob.

628
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,590
Die!

629
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,890
No, Bob, don't do it.

630
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,070
Please.

631
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,270
No.

632
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,430
Once that Bob won't get here, Bob.

633
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,850
I already filled up my will.

634
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,250
Oh!

635
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,910
Oh, I wish you was the little one, Bob.

636
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,250
Mickey.

637
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,510
Bob.

638
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,190
Frock Bob.

639
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,450
Where in the world can Mickey be?

640
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,830
Mickey.

641
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,430
Where is to, Mickey?

642
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,850
Where is to, Mickey?

643
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,510
Mickey?

644
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:39,930


645
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,170
Where is to?

646
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,570
I know you are there, Mickey.

647
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,630
You're not going to get me this time, Mickey.

648
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,870
Because I have the gun,

649
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,310
and the diamonds,

650
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,950
and the map,

651
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,130
and the documents,

652
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,150
and I have the device.

653
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,210
Yes, I have the device,

654
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,450
and you are foiled, finally,

655
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:01,950
Mickey.

656
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,470
Mickey?

657
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,730
Where did you go?

658
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,030
Where did you go, Mickey?

659
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:09,350


660
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,430
You can't fool me this time, Mickey.

661
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,090
I signed the papers already.

662
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:21,750
You hold on.

663
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,910
What, no!

664
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,390
What is this!?

665
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,890
Th, the tapes?

666
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,010
The blank!

667
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,310
The documents, they've fallen to dust!

668
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,390
The negatives, what about the negatives?

669
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,010
What, they're gone.

670
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,210
They're gone!

671
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,530
I had the negatives!

672
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,130
I had the...

673
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:48,070
I have the device, I have the girl, the gun, the map, but, but, but Neegi has them now.

674
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:54,370
I should have listened in the temples of the old ones when they told me.

675
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:03,050
They told me that for every Bob particle there must always be a Neegi particle.

676
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:09,650
Why didn't I listen? Oh, oh, the, the pain.

677
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,990
To think I could have had it all.

678
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:20,030
I could have had everything, but, but Neegi has it now.

679
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:26,370
You can go to Dodd's town and get the formal training for coming over, man.

680
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,490
Uh, I skirted him, as many times as I could.

681
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,550
You know what you do, guys? You go to Dodd's town.

682
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:31,930
Sure.

683
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,030
I skirted him.

684
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,010
I skirted the, uh, the formal training.

685
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,010
I sort of came in at a little level.

686
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:37,490
Neegi, did you go to Malaysia?

687
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,350
Oh, man, I, I, uh, laid the first, uh, cornerstone.

688
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,950
It was a human skull.

689
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,570
A human skull, not a subgenius skull.

690
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,550
A big difference.

691
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:53,110
You ever seen, have a nice day spelled out in the skull of a normal human?

692
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,610
It's sweet. It's kind of neat.

693
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:02,730
Or save the earth spelled out in the chopped off arms of, of, uh,

694
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,950
of a Caribbean peasant.

695
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,250
It's a joyful sight.

696
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,230
It's so neat.

697
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,090
It's like the new age.

698
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,730
I'm afraid.

699
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,930
Come on, Archer.

700
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:18,830
Shh.

701
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:19,790
Come on, Archer.

702
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,530
Come on.

703
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,750
I got her.

704
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,510
Ow!

705
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,470
Don't let her go!

706
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,750
She's coming for real!

707
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:31,970
What?

708
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:32,990
She laid out here.

709
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,210
Where'd she go?

710
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,370
She's going down the bottom.

711
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,470
Down the what?

712
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:40,970
Down here, here.

713
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,150
You're wrong.

714
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,610
Here, here.

715
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,950
She's gonna be in here.

716
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,510
What's that?

717
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,490
Keep back, keep back, don't care.

718
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,810
Grab her, man. We're gonna lose her.

719
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:50,570
Damn it.

720
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,430
Come on, Archer.

721
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,550
Get down.

722
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,510
Come on, Archer.

723
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:57,710
All right.

724
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,330
All right.

725
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,130
This is the problem.

726
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:04,810
I'm sitting around.

727
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:09,850
I don't know where's Buzz aloffs.

728
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,850
I'm standing around here.

729
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:11,150
But I have to seal her up.

730
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,150


731
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,150


732
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,150


733
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,790
I had no control over the situation whatsoever.

734
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,810
I had no control.

735
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,310
I had no control.

736
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,830
Now come on, Archer.

737
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,990
I have no control over the situation whatsoever.

738
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,490
And I didn't give a damn about anybody else right now.

739
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,450
I, I have control over the situation whatsoever.

740
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,630
I'll be keeping you in the house.

741
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,710
Wait.

742
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,110
I'm not even...

743
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:43,550
It's okay.

744
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,490
You're gonna be alright now.

745
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,130
Easy.

746
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,090
Easy.

747
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,030
It's gonna be okay.

748
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,190
It's alright. You're gonna be okay.

749
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:05,730
You know, it's this morning, and I have made the post office.

750
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:14,170
This morning, I'm gonna be wearing a new Johnny Dog's perfume, you know?

751
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:19,150
And that will remind you of me.

752
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,710
Okay?

753
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:22,890
Uh...

754
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,270
Uh...

755
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:24,710
Uh...

756
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,010
Uh...

757
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:25,350
Uh...

758
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:25,550
Uh...

759
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:25,550


760
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,610
It's too late now.

761
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,370
It's alright.

762
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,970
Now, I'll be sure to keep this all clean.

763
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,810
I love this.

764
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,190
I...

765
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:48,810
I don't think I can control it this time.

766
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,410
I hope it can...

767
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,690
...come around to...

768
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,110
...my...

769
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,730
...my...

770
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:56,730


771
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:58,970
...my...

772
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,010
...my...

773
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:00,130
Uhhhh.

774
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:02,630
Yeah.

775
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:09,550
I love that feeling so much that now...

776
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,670
... now, I feel like I can armor this beautiful crazy little pomoc that you could do with

777
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:12,670


778
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:12,670


779
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:13,550
...and with a cosplay.

780
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:13,550


781
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,270
I'm trying to remember if I can ever...

782
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,090
...be healthy again?

783
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,230
Right now.

784
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:22,270


785
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:22,270


786
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,270
She has something to hide.

787
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,390
...de 나온.

788
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,650
...in your head.

789
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:25,650


790
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:25,650


791
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:25,650


792
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:25,650


793
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:25,670
I just was on my own.

794
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,330
Make something up dipping off yourナс.

795
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,310
Ailleе, que esta bien?

796
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,730
Where's our lucky groom and poor pathetic bride?

797
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,750
The poor martyred bride.

798
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:44,770
Let's see, I guess if y'all would see Brandy and Glenn.

799
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,670
If y'all could stand in front.

800
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,310
Yeah, right there.

801
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,490
Wait, wait, we gotta get, we gotta get.

802
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:52,370
Woo!

803
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,690
I'm more used to preaching in tents.

804
00:45:59,070 --> 00:45:59,890
Hey, hey.

805
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,030
Ah, yes.

806
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:11,610
Hey, if Reverend Sun Yung Moon can marry thousands of people who've never even met, then a Church

807
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,930
of the Subgenius short duration marriage could be the answer.

808
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:20,510
Yeah, as a matter of fact, this is one thing you can do as a subgenius minister.

809
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,090
You can do legal weddings.

810
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:22,350
You can do legal weddings.

811
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:25,570
You can also do the short duration marriages.

812
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:30,930
This certificate here produced by Reverend Buck Naked in Dallas can come in very handy.

813
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:36,690
Because the short duration marriage can last for an hour, a night, a week, a year, whatever.

814
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:38,930
And the divorces are cheap.

815
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,970
They come with the certificate.

816
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:42,530
All right.

817
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,710
Anybody else want to get married tonight?

818
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:45,630
Step right up.

819
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,030
Get your holy short duration marriage certificate here.

820
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:52,350
Test your mettle and win the little lady a rubber stooge.

821
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:52,350


822
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:52,770
And you're a stupid doll.

823
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:59,690
Guaranteed, friends, to absolve and sanctify all otherwise illicit couplings.

824
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,210
Free short duration divorce if you're not completely satisfied.

825
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:04,050
All right.

826
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,490
Now, you two stand together and face me.

827
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:08,810
Oh, I like that.

828
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,490
All right.

829
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,050
Let's be solemn now here.

830
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:22,350
Do you, Glenn, take the responsibility to get married?

831
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


832
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


833
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


834
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


835
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


836
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


837
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


838
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


839
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


840
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


841
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


842
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


843
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,350


844
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,810
I do.

845
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,890
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

846
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,130
Tell me about it.

847
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,070
I do.

848
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,130
Do you, Brandy, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

849
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:31,670
Say, I love you, Bob.

850
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:32,090
Yeah.

851
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:32,710
All right.

852
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:32,910
Good.

853
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:33,210
Okay.

854
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,450
Now, how long do you wish for this period of sanctified couplings to last?

855
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:37,810
One year.

856
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:38,810
One year?

857
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:39,470
Oh, yeah.

858
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:39,790
That's right.

859
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:40,310
You told me that.

860
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,470
One year.

861
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:42,270
Me.

862
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:46,230
You sure?

863
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:48,030
Yeah.

864
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:49,910
All right.

865
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:50,690
Two years.

866
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:51,710
Oh, yes.

867
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,330
Two years.

868
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:52,330


869
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:52,330


870
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:52,330


871
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:52,330


872
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:52,330


873
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:52,330


874
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:59,350
Dearly beloveds, we are gathered here today in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs and insert

875
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:06,750
other deity names here, any other deities, to join this man, Glenn, and this woman, Brandy,

876
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:12,650
in the bondage of holy matrimony, for better or for worse, but not for long.

877
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,850
Do you feel the spirit?

878
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,550
Yes.

879
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,650
Then put your hands on each other.

880
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,330
If there are any here who feel this man and this woman, share your hands.

881
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:23,490
You should not be joined temporarily.

882
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,570
Just hold your peace, because we don't want to hear about it.

883
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,130
All right.

884
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:29,730
Now, put your hands.

885
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:30,170
Hold tight.

886
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:30,850
Hold tight now.

887
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,670
Oh, lovely.

888
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,770
Lovely couple.

889
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:39,510
Do you, Glenn, take this woman, Brandy, to be your lawful wedded wife and short-duration

890
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:45,850
subgenius matrimonial, to have and to hold for richer or poorer in sickness and kinkiness

891
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,650
for the next year?

892
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,330
Say, I do.

893
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:50,630
I do.

894
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:51,690
Do you?

895
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:52,330
I do.

896
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:52,330


897
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:53,350
I do.

898
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:06,390
I do.

899
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:10,510
Shake on it and say, it's a deal.

900
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,670
Now, get up.

901
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:14,990
Oh, he's not up there.

902
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,310
Oh, yeah, we're not over.

903
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,130
We're not finished yet.

904
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,150
We've got a really important part, the symbolic part, coming up.

905
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:20,970
Get out the ring.

906
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,190
You do have a ring, don't you?

907
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:22,330
All right.

908
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


909
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


910
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


911
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


912
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


913
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


914
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


915
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


916
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


917
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


918
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


919
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


920
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


921
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,330


922
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:22,870
All right.

923
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:23,450
The best man.

924
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,750
The best man here.

925
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:25,910
Let's give a hand for the best man.

926
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,150
All right.

927
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:30,770
We take this ring.

928
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:31,330
Give that to Glenn.

929
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,290
And, Glenn, you...

930
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:38,050
And she inserts her finger into the hole.

931
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:44,270
We take this ring as a holy symbol of the estate of marriage as well as of the pole

932
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,410
going deep into the hole repeatedly, obviously.

933
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:52,310
By the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dobbs in defiance of the law.

00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:52,530


936
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:53,970
Now we arestudying between the laws of the state and of nature.

937
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:57,250
I pronounce you man and wife for the next one year.

938
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,970
You must...

939
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:03,270
You must now kiss each other right in front of all these people.

940
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:06,550
Praise Bob.

941
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,470
Alright, temperate your Ottawa.

946
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:08,910


947
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:08,950
Praise Bob.

948
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:08,950


949
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:10,190
This is a show of the man who...

950
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:10,730
Yeah.

951
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,310
Yes, yes, yes.

952
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:12,310


953
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,450
Thank you, yes, yes, yes.

954
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:15,790
Praise Bob.

955
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:16,970
Whoa!

00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,530
Praise God! Praise God! Praise God!

957
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:28,810
You are now duly authorized and excused for sexual couplings of any perverse and unspeakable kind for a period of one year.

958
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,850
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, it is done, amen, and a-women.

959
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,810
Praise God! Praise God!

960
00:50:53,690 --> 00:51:07,430
The Tennessee and Ball garages of rock and roll music is obviously a means by which the white man is driven to the level with a nigger.

961
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:15,450
If you talk to the every teenager of today...

962
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:16,650
Actually he's brain dead.

963
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,770
If you talk to the every teenager of today and you ask them what it is...

964
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,970
If you talk to the every teenager of today, and you ask them what it is...

965
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:28,570
Ah hmm...

966
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,150
They are incredibly dear...

967
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:32,490
Come on...

968
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:39,070
If you talk to the every teenager of today and you ask them what it is about rock and roll music that they like...

969
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:39,650
...

970
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:40,090
...

971
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:52,910
If you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it is about rock and

972
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:57,350
roll music that they like, the first thing they'll say is the beat, the beat, the beat.

973
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:04,890
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels when you sing it.

974
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:06,890
I know what it does to you.

975
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:15,110
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

976
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:20,110
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels.

977
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,430
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

978
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:32,490
I know the loss that you can get from the beat.

979
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,870
Well, if you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it does to you,

980
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:43,950
you ask them what it is about rock and roll music that they like, the evil feeling that

981
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:44,970
you feel when you sing it.

982
00:52:52,490 --> 00:53:02,630
If you talk to the average teenager of today, if you talk to the average teenager of today,

983
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:06,710
you'll get the beat, the beat, the beat.

984
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:08,850
The beat, the beat, the beat.

985
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:16,110
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

986
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:20,450
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels when you sing it.

987
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,350
The feeling of the living in you.

988
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,590
Come out, Arthur, come out of this body.

989
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:31,870
Come out of those muscles.

990
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,170
Come out of those bones.

991
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,530
Come out of that heart.

992
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:35,730
Arthur, come out.

993
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:36,730
Arthur, come out.

994
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,110
Come out of those muscles.

995
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,110
I believe that is because I know how it feels when you sing it.

996
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,090
I know what it does to you.

997
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,630
I know the evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

998
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:00,110
I know the lost position that you get into.

999
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:01,650
Come out, come out of this body.

1000
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,870
Come out of those bones.

1001
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:08,090
You see a group today and you ask them what it is about rock and roll music that they like,

1002
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:11,410
the first thing they'll say is, the beat, the beat, the beat.

1003
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,310
The beat, the beat, the beat.

1004
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:19,470
The beat, the beat, the beat.

1005
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,590
The beat, the beat, the beat.

1006
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,790
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing.

1007
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:44,770
I want you to come out, I said come out of this boat, come out of this boat, come out of this boat, come out of that horse, I said come out, I said come out, in the name of Jesus.

1008
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,610
I wanted to go to the devil, boy, to the trouble, boy, because the devil i was sinking into my soul.

1009
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:27,630
I don't want my soul to go дома where иде万가지고의.

1010
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,630


1011
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,630


1012
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,630


1013
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,630


1014
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,630


1015
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,630


1016
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,630


1017
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:33,070
Go on, go find it!

1018
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,570
The beat, the beat, the beat.

1019
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:39,990
The evil.

1020
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:42,510
Beat, the beat, the beat.

1021
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,110
The evil.

1022
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:46,570
Beat, the beat, the beat.

1023
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,670
Beat, the beat, the beat.

1024
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:48,370
The evil.

1025
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,850
Beat, the beat, the beat.

1026
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,930
Why I believe that is because I know...

1027
00:55:59,150 --> 00:55:59,870
Subgenious hell.

1028
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,150
It's cold.

1029
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:02,590
Cold.

1030
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,190
cold kind of hell.

1031
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,190
Cold in here.

1032
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:11,070
Wish I could light this here pipe.

1033
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:13,950
They gave me all the frappy in the world.

1034
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,610
And it's too cold to light this pipe.

1035
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,570
Oh, Bob, where are you now?

1036
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:24,190
Why did you leave me in the hands of me?

1037
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,450
However, Bob will offer you

1038
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:34,430
eternal salvation or triple your money back.

1039
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:41,150
Which unfortunately gives some the image in their minds

1040
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:45,930
of Bob standing at the gates of hell handing out $60 checks.

1041
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,550
Well, that's real funny.

1042
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,810
I hope you boys are having a good time.

1043
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:56,110
I bet you thought this old church thing of yours

1044
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:58,450
was gonna be big, big fun.

1045
00:56:59,070 --> 00:56:59,430
Big fun.

1046
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,430
Big barrel of laughs.

1047
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,110
Oh, yeah.

1048
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:08,410
I bet you thought you were gonna be some kind of high school lawyer

1049
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:12,090
with that Bob fellow of yours.

1050
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:18,490
Well, you're looking at a pretty damn long eternity.

1051
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:23,310
Oh, by the way, here's that triple your money back.

1052
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:25,650
It's, what, $60?

1053
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,850
One for you, Smith.

1054
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,250
One for you, Jones.

1055
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:36,330
And, uh, don't let this deter you from doing business with us again.

1056
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,750
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1057
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:46,850
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1058
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:51,170
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1059
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:55,010
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1060
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,250
Bob, Post Office Box 140306.

1061
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:01,790
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1062
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:06,370
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306.

1063
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:09,330
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1064
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,350
Stay tuned and praise Bob!

1065
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:15,650
Ah!

1066
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,610
Ah!

1067
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,330
Ah!

1068
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:21,210
Ah!

1069
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:22,490


1070
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,710
Ah!

1071
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,310
Well, then.

1072
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,490
Dennis locked me in this little box.

1073
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:31,630
I can't feel anything.

1074
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,970
I can't see anything.

1075
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,550
It's totally black.

1076
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,130
I have no sensation in my hands.

1077
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,050
I don't know if I'm moving or what.

1078
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,530
I'm just in this little box.

1079
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,310
He said I could talk to you.

1080
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,430
He said you'd know what to do if you wanted to help me.

1081
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,630
Oh, good, happy mid-wilming!

1082
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:54,450
I, I promise I'll pay you all the royalties that I didn't tell you about.

1083
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,290
And, and, whatever you want to do, I'll pay you.

1084
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1085
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1086
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1087
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1088
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1089
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1090
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1091
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1092
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1093
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1094
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,290


1095
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,110
I mean, anything.

1096
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,210
Te-te-te-te-tevis.

1097
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,310
You can have Tevis.

1098
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,310
Just get me out of this box, Wilman.

1099
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:03,710
Please, don't.

1100
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,050
No.

1101
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,270
Don't believe what Paul told you.

1102
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,150
It's all a lie.

1103
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:08,110
It's all a lie.

1104
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,690
Whatever I did, I, I, I'm sorry.

1105
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,830
I'm sorry I let you out of the box, Wilman.

1106
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:13,690
I, I can't.

1107
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:16,190
This is a bad show, Wilman.

1108
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:18,790
This is a real bad show.

1109
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:24,990
She says she'd almost rather see me in Tevis than in nothing at all.

1110
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:25,950
Right.

1111
