Joe Doakes was just a guy who liked to tinker around his barn.
Some people thought Joe was lazy.
Some even thought he was nuts.
But one day, he had an idea.
I thought I was good.
I thought I was good.
I was mental.
Very mental.
A couple of ladies' eyes.
Very mental.
Mental.
Very mental.
You just get motionless to you.
You get a phone call.
It sounds great.
You're mental.
Forget about that phone call.
Whether it happens or it doesn't happen.
You better be mental.
Hello.
You better be mental all the time.
I'm blessed being mental.
That's the way I see it.
No matter what you say about me, I think I'm mental.
That's what you gotta be.
Mental.
And if it ain't good enough for the person next to you, that's just unmental.
Very unmental.
Another word for unmental is you're mental.
Willing spirits as well.
That's trying to look good.
I'm a gay chick.
I'll do my therapy.

You know?
Mental.
Very mental.

Beloved, I wish above all things that it's mine. Flush it down the toilet, because it's mine.
How long will you sit? But it's mine. Sin, sin, it's mine. Hatred, it's mine. Bitterness, it's mine.
Covetousness, it's mine.
The Bible says that it's mine.

My name is Coco, and the reason I do drugs is because I have Down syndrome.
Because having Down syndrome, I can't really tell what's right or wrong.
So I do drugs because I have Down syndrome.
And I feel that I need to do drugs.
Spotted by PCP for Free America.
A nice lucky number.
Well, you better hope I don't.
You can't.
Oh, you can.
Right.
This man's drugs.
I know.
Yeah, well, watch it.
Whatever.
So he's trying drugs.
Alright.
He's spending more time with his loves.
Ah, yeah, don't mess with me.

I hate society.
And I hate people like you.
But I have one question that nobody ever asks.
And that's this question.
What would happen?
What would happen?
What would happen?
I'd like for any of you to answer that.
There are some things you just do.
Like smoking marijuana.
Because when you get high, it's your mind you're messing with.

I'm really glad I wasn't able to make it.

and other people.
The ESO stuff on the show was done in early 2003,
a few days after the tragic Columbia shuttle explosion,
15 minutes before landing would have happened.
Although the space collage by Chaz Smith,
which you'll hear that's also in the show,
predates that.
It's from around 1998.
Conspiracy year.
Even though it sounds like it must have been assembled yesterday
just for the shuttle show of 2003.
Anyway, special thanks to all the Alt Binaries Slack artistes
from back in Usenet day who posted the collages,
especially Fernanda Nende-Lemur.

You better run along out if you want to have your invasion before dark.
It is time.
















I want you to tell me the truth.
What is this invasion silliness?
It isn't silly.
It's just a game.
That's all.
Whoa.
That was a funny little radio show, wasn't it?
Did you want the peaceful victim or did you want the...
That was a funny little radio show.

There are a lot of kooks out there.
There are a lot of people that will use, you know, what the scripture says wrong.
They will interpret it in a way to benefit themselves.
And then I go and I fix the problem.

I cut the potato and then I cut the potato and I eat the potato and then I make another
potato into a potato flute and I go up the mountain and I yell to greet the new day and
then I yell to greet the end of the day.
That is my potato life.
I'm so full of happiness.
Hooked on something new.
Yeah.
Almost out of coolness.

We can't spend as much time around the Earth.
That's what they were singing.
They came down that last 15 minutes of flight.
15 minutes from landing.
We set sail on this new sea.
Because there is new knowledge to be gained.
And this is my room.
And you're all here.
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever, ever again.
So what's your theory about the...
I think they slapped the taste right out of Chaz's mouth.
Don't you think it's highly distasteful?
To talk about that jet.
What got the shuttle?
I think it was Zeus with his mighty blue thunderbolt.
They're talking about...
He's got some great thunderbolts this year.
Who's got blue thunderbolts besides Zeus?
I mean, it might be the Zeus liberation army.
Which I guess is very fundamentalist in their beliefs.
They go back to your zip.
I don't know.
I've heard that Ra has green thunderbolts.
No, but you notice the thunderbolts that rolled off good old...
And Bob has great big red...
Straps.
Great big bungee sticks.
He whooped the hell out of me, that thunderbolt.
For using a Chinese...
So I heard that NASA knew from the beginning of the flight that that was going to happen,
but didn't tell the astronauts because they couldn't do anything about it.
Oh, man.
What a grim thought.
You know, I had...
And then they made up this whole thing that they're going to do this big, you know,
the inquiry and all that to, you know, cover that off.

Oh, actually, I had an even more paranoid whole scenario unfold in my imagination.
Underwear?
Shortly after I heard the thing.
It was like a movie.
It was just like an action movie.
Well, imagine if those guys were up there and they're, of course...
Just having a smoke after some copulon.
Quintus interruptus.
Just check it out.
I'm listening.
I'm listening.
And...
Okay.
Okay.
The astronauts have been instructed to dump.
This mysterious cargo into orbit.
One of them does some homework and discovers that it's a doomsday privacy erasing device
to be put into orbit that could easily be used by the wrong hands to enslave all humanity
under fill in the blank.
The astronauts confer and decide not to activate the evil device.
But one of the astronauts is, of course, secretly with them, the big them.
And he pulls out a death ray or something on the other astronauts.
Now, stand up.
Stand back.
I'm going to bring this baby down.
But this one woman astronaut who he had knocked out earlier, she comes to behind him.
I didn't wake him up.
And she's just in time to clobber him from behind.
And there's this dramatic fight aboard the shuttle as it's coming in for a landing.
Wow.
Okay.
Now, the good guys, the good astronauts defeat the bad agent astronaut and have informed
mission control.
We're coming in for a landing with big news that will shake the world and shock everyone.
And that...
Is when they in Washington or Langley or wherever ordered the secret button push that makes
the shuttle explode upon reentry just as if a heat panel or something had been damaged
during takeoff.
And they even had fake footage of that standing by just in case of that kind of emergency
and sudden cover-up.
Wow.
And that makes me a real conspiracy theorist and made-for-TV movie director.
You think as a movie director they could come up with better prosthetics than fake feet?
Hey, who's on the line?
You know?
Man stank.
You've been working in the methamphetamine mines way too long.
It's time for you to find a new line of work.
Look at his fingernails.
They're all like Fu Manchu'd and long and have weird things sticking out.
I knew how dangerous it was when I went up there.
We all wanted to get off and those American, those brave Americans got off Earth.
Man is frozen as frosty spines.
Just a bunch of flaming monkeys falling from the sky.
I can't see out the window.
They're all glazed open.
Matt, have you ever saw flaming monkeys falling from the sky before?
Well, of course we've seen it numerous.
We saw it like 17 years ago.
Well, sure.
Back when the amphetamines were...
They were flaming.
Good reference, Strange.
He knows about flaming monkeys and amphetamines.
This whole thing gives me a great new idea to start up a whole new cottage industry.
A new burial technique for people with way too much money.
Cottage cheese.
Shoot their corpses up into orbit.
Cremation by re-entry.
Oh, I thought you were going to turn them into a cheese.
If you can't afford it, 100 grand will descend your head up and re-enter your head.
No, you don't even have to.
You just have to pump them up a little bit.
You know?
You don't even have to get them that high.
Why?
And they'll just come back down.
You could probably do it with a military device.
Why not leave them in the methamphetamine labs?
You just take their money and you throw their corpses on the heap with the rest of the rotting monkeys.
Why not re-amphetimate them?
You know what I mean?
Bring them back to life with the amphetamines we've created in our lab.
Admiral Timothy Leary, yeah, right.
And Admiral Posty Leary was honored by that type of cremation.
But he couldn't ejaculate at the wrong moment.
And so he was incinerated just the same.
Of course we believe in it.
You really believe we are?
We've actually been in space.
It's dog.
We've never been in space.
Hey, really, I don't believe we walked.
Nobody's ever made it outside the dome.
I don't believe we walked on the moon.
I don't.
You want to know why?
Nobody's ever really made it past those warehouse walls with Shell Beach painted on them.
Friends, the first half of this show, all those zillions of collages that mess with your head
were by the great cut-up of Alt.BinarySlack for NendeNendeLieber.
Mer.
Praise.
Leemer.
Of Leemuria.
And they were arranged by me.
In fact, friends, half of the next four shows will be the cut-ups from that great cut-up.
Now, there was also the long space collage preceding the talk of the sad shuttle situation.
And that collage was by the great Professor Chaz Smith.

On ESO radio.
And, uh, friends, coming up, stay tuned for more, more, more.

I'm going to have to get a new one.

Looks like we need to go for a full shot of the...

I don't believe...
Hey, how do you fix this robot, man?

I don't believe it.
I never could.
The robot's head exploded, dudes.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
You know that...
Maybe Phil Spector actually grazed the shot, you know, Columbia as it was coming into our airspace.
As he was aiming at Xena's double.
He was already confused by thinking he was shooting at Xena.
He shot her double, but actually he fired five shots.
One went off the rim of the old canister there next to the neck, you know, neck...
So it was one of Phil Spector's...
...neck of the Philiac pool.
Ricochet bullets?
It might have been Phil Spector's Ricochet.
That brought down the...
Oh my God.
Think of it numerologically speaking.
Phil Spector has 11 as the numerological bedroom, which comes out to two.
Okay.
Needless to say.
All right, now two is an interface between the yin and the yang.
As we both know, it's a...
Right, right.
Duh.
Duh.
And everything.
Okay.
So you've got the yin and yang.
You've got a perfect balance.
And then he throws it out of balance.
And what have we got going on in space?
We've got a curry party.
We've got people talking about golf.
And next thing you know, the last...
Well, now how does Michael Jackson admitting to sleeping with the boy...

Boys have to play with it.
It's a hit.
These are all hits.
But did you...
The space shuttle was a hit.
Michael Jackson is having hits all over again.
His crappy albums are selling better than ever.
Okay, here's a conspiracy theory.
Did you hear that Michael Jackson, and the reason for his weird intolerance to sunlight
and his facial diseases, is that he was a former shuttle casualty?
Come to me.
I thought he was just an evil.
That's from a Canadian website.
That word come is an invitation.

Proud to swing my ding-a-ling against your empty brain pad.
That's a just a ding-a-thing.

I'm not.
I'm not a baby dangler.
You're not a baby dangler?
I'm just hanging out with my kids.
He's not a baby dangler.
He's hanging out.
See, you can take that two ways.
Yeah, exactly.
That's very logical.
Because he's known to expose himself to the elephant or whatever the name.
If there is a God and he made everything beautiful, how'd you guys get here?
We came on the plane.
We came around the covenant nation.
We do not need people that are hung up this way.
That is the exact same grammatical form, obviously just reversed.
But I have a real problem.
If it means one and only one, obviously under 60, a person who is sober minded.
And if you can't handle that, we do not need people that are hung up this way.
You would get people more in tune with what may lie ahead.
I couldn't tell you what city it was or what, where everything started being somewhat civil

Listen to your music backwards and reverse.
It's okay, world, but...
You can't do that.
Heavy metal, heavy metal, heavy metal.
I'm not saying I don't...
Well, you know, I'm kind of...
The bottom of the age...
Right.
I'm not saying I don't...
Heavy metal is heavy. Get it?
Cool!
You ran for me.
I used to be a nice guy just like you.
And then I found...
The truth is in the taking...
You know what's wrong with you.
I will need a lie.
I bet you have a spit in your face.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You ran for me.
Better be ready to face the consequences.
It's never too late to redeem yourself.
One last chance.
That's all you have.
It's up to you.
You ran for me.
No escaping my eyes.
You'll see them in every dream.
You'll see them in every dream.
You will see them in your dreams.
You will see them in your dreams.
A dream you can't ever see for real.
A dream you'll never see for real.
You'll see them in every dream.
You'll never escape the eyes.
A dream you can't ever see for real.
The sun will never shine in the eyes again.
Would you like to be my ex-girlfriend?
Oh yeah!
You'll still be my ex-girlfriend.

Ready for me from beyond?
You've got to be ready to face the truth, my friend.
I'm here for you, slow.
That was...
That was...
That was...
You rang from Reverend Bill T. Miller.

When girls go by, then I play high.
I thrill them with each note.
Oh, how I get their goat.
I'm the fellow with the fiddle.
Oh, boy, I can play the best in town.
I make a smile from every round.
And every time I start to play,
I say the whole of Dorna Town begins to sway.
A-votey, votey, votey, and a-fretz-hat-say.
A-root-a-toot-a-toot-a, and a-raz-a-ma-taz.
When I play, though, the girls say,
Oh, and tremble like they're freezing.
I know that I'm the reason,
for I'm the fellow with the fiddle.
Oh, boy, I can play the best in town.
Oh, boy, I can play the best in town.
Oh, boy, I can play the best in town.
Just a little girl, she'd come in,
and she'd see, she'd notice,
and she'd run all around.
And she'd want to ask her mother for a fiddle.
And she'd learn to sing for her.
She'd tell her mother, say,
Sing for your fiddle and you can get it.
And she'd jump out in front of her and sing.
Give me a little fiddle.
No, a titty mama, titty.
Titty mama, titty.
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.
A titty on the hill, mama.
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.
Say it again.
Titty mama, titty.
Titty mama, titty.
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.
A titty on the hill, mama.
A titty on the hill, mama.
A titty on the hill, mama.
A titty on the hill, mama.
Friends, that was Mary McDonald, and I don't know anything more about that.
Before that, we heard a little bit of Mel Blanc singing Fellow with a Fiddle
from the Warner Brothers cartoon of the same name.
This music in the background is from the amino acids from Detroit.
Check out www.aminoacids.com.
We're going to be doing a revival in Detroit soon with the amino acids.
Ah, yes.
And now this.
Boy, he was quite a man, Bob Dobbs.
Right, that Bob.
Quite a woman, too.
He was everything. He was an animal.
He was an animal.
He made a believer out of you.
J.R. Bob Dobbs was an amoeba.
He was an amoeba and a super genius.
He was like the smartest amoeba that ever existed and the most mindless man.
He was like Big Brother and Little Daddy at the same time.
You felt like love-hate in one emotion at the same consternation.
Right, like the tallest midget and the shortest giant.
You knew both concepts at one time.
You'd see him, you'd know height and small at the same time.
You could feel it, you could smell it.
He was like the essence of everything.
Like the cleanest dirt.
Oh, they used to use that clean dirt.
Bob used to give off clean dirt that sprang flowers and little vegetables out.
He was like the driest water.
He was like Santa Ana winds blowing a big old polar bear.
Try not to.
He was like burning hot ice.
He was like that polar bear in a bad dance club.
He was like the furniture you can't believe in and yet you try.
He was the source.
He was the...
He was...
He was...
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
He's gonna be back.
I know he's gonna be back.
I know he's gonna be back.
He's gonna be back.
J.R. Bob Dobbs, if you're listening to me now...
I have faith.
He's gonna be back.
Faith in you.
He made the salmon sweat.
He made the eye cheese come out where it's not supposed to grow.
He made the Eskimo buy ice.
He made the ice for the sorcerers.
And he kissed each and every one of them with an Eskimo.
He sold hate to the Nazis.
He gave love.
He gave love wherever he could find a place to sit down.
He sold hypocrisy to the Baptists.
He sold retardation to the subgenius.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.


















Sold water.
He sold water to old St. Nick.
He sold a fluoroscope to his uncle.
And then he sold himself out of business.
But he still kept on being and seeing and being the source.
He had insurance, my friend.
Bob had insurance.
Do you?
Do you have Bob's insurance policy?
Bob is your insurance policy, my friends.
And it's just one payment you make.
The premium lasts forever and ever and ever.
And never comes back.
And if for any reason you should chance to die or drive into a car
or perhaps just fall asleep and not wake up sometimes,
that's your problem.
And that's Bob too?
He's your insurance policy?
And he's what kills you both at the same time?
Bob resold your insurance policy to a crooked bunch of weird scam artists at the Pentagon.
Because he loved you.
He had so much love for you.
Look, look, look at his leg.
He's...
He needs a towel.
He can't...
Bob loves you more than you love anything.
Oh, those chromosomes are so bleak.
But at the same time, if you could just pack one little bit of that essence...
They're rock hard, the chromosomes are.
You'd be rock hard like those chromosomes.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not a baby dangler.
I'm not a baby dangler.
Bob's a baby dangler.
He dangled you at the moment of your birth.
He dangled me.
And it's taken all this time for you to wake up.
Is he gonna smack you?
Are you gonna wake up and start breathing and being alive?
Baby poop poop bait!
...city probe scanner.
Are you gonna just be...
...across some illegal sexual activity?
A reprobate.
It should be on your DTO screen now.
Reprobate.
Pay close attention to the following transmission.
Your eyes may become unfocused.
You may feel heat around the back of your neck and shoulders.
The forehead may become indented.
Ooh, that feels good, Bob.
Further down. A little further down.
I'm phasing.
I'm phasing now.
Ooh, nope, I got...
I...
I got a squishy.
Oh, that's perfect.
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna put it in my pants.
Oh, that's perfect.




Pipe down.
Pipe down in there.
Bob's trying to sleep.
Hey!
Pipe down!
Bob's trying to sleep!
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Relax.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.

Oh, it's very, very easy.
Talk to the leper first.
You don't encourage the leper.
You talk to the leper.
It's hard for a leper to change its patches.
Take it.
You're in there.
Okay, you're impaired now.
Oh, disgusting.
Your convolution.
My
Galena wants you to listen to this music with pride now.
The music will make you hard and frightened.
Frightened and hard.
Take down those, take down those, take down those drops.
Who's there?
It's the tax assessor.
Tax assessor?
Tax assessor?
Tax assessor?
A little music there from Fellow with a Fiddle, and now more from Reverend Cobblestone's collage.
Yes, I'm just pleased about the loss of the manufacturing command and presence that we once enjoyed.
It's gone the route of what everything else has in America.
A global war of...
One world order, the new world order, whatever you want to call it.
The culture of death.
The culture of death.
You know, I guess I was vaguely weak, but until you said flat out, it hasn't been in my consciousness.
Isn't that special?
Well, I think you're right here.
The effect of the sense of modernity, the American values, have some value.
I'm not going to take that ride.
No, I'm not going to.
Let's have a moment of silence for the little twinkle twinkle.
Twinkle little stars that burned up in the atmosphere.
Yeah, that is kind of, you know...
They got off.
They got off.
You know, I'm always so radical in my stanchies.
I get all sheepy when I think of, what's your name, the Indian girl.
Dave's got the hot...
He's looking at the pictures.
Well, I have. I have no necronomicon or whatever you call them.
You know, I'm not a necrophiliac.
Or affiliated with any of those.
You're an asher.
An asher.
They like it dry, eh?
They like it dry, don't they?
Eh.
Just add water and you're back to...
All the basic ingredients, just make them up in your own mind the way you want them.
A moment of silence is a kind of a heart...
A little crack.
When you have a day...
Did you hear?
A day.
It's a moment of silence.
God bless America.
God bless the space program.
And may we continue to shoot monkeys into space in the name of science.
Yes.
Yes.
It's the best way...
It's a better reason for killing people than some you can come up with.
May we continue to hook small animals up to car batteries to see what happens.
That's a taxpayer's expense.
Works for me.
After all, the shuttle program was funded by CIA drug money.
I thought you were going to say CIA druggies.
You know how good they are at fooling things.
It's all funded by the CIA drug money.
And Labrador's smuggling ring.
Why do you think they called the first shuttle Columbia?
Can I ask you a question?

Can I ask you a secret question?
Are you a bonesman?
They don't want you touching the wreckage.
They're afraid you'll find the CIA stash that was hidden in the cargo bag.
Bales of cocaine falling all over Midwest.
The aliens.
Well, I think Chaz had it right on the nostril.
No, it was actually Stang who had the wrong nostril, right?
You claim...
They discovered the dangerous satellite they were putting out in the nick of time
and were about to land and explain what had happened.
And they were silenced by them.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
That's right.
That's right.
Till next week, keep your hat on tight.
You're back to the wind.
You're sacking the saddle.
See y'all.
Give your sack to Princess Wayne.
Become an astronaut.
Achieve your dreams in the sky.
Look to the blue as your nostrils inflame.
You will realize...
Now the party's over.
Now the party's over.

And praise Bob.
Good.
Good.
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Good night.
Come in.
Goodbye, dear Pietro.
Oh.
Goodbye.






Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Why?
