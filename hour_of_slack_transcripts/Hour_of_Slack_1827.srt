my task of making hour of slack easier for me

15
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,880
by putting all subgenius audio on one huge 14 terabyte hard drive is done

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,000

april 22nd i'm doing these credits first then i'll organize the files by title

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,020

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,220
the credits are easy

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,820

21
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,000
professor chaz smith's show but with me and lone cow dave doing most of the talking

00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,560
princess we was there sometimes too

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:22,120

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,380
in between each track i plan to put really short clips from this short funny clips folder

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,100
slacking off

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,600

i really think that bob is enjoying it he just has this wonderful sort of cheshire cat smile

41
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:19,560
on july 5th 1998 7 a.m when we all have hangovers wotan's judgment will take place in the form

42
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,000
of what the priest scriptures call the advent of the angelic host

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,960
oh this is timothy larry reminding you that just as you need slack bob's out!

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:44,760


48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,320
oh Game David

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:59,940
this house restaurant whatever They were all having some kind of a party and then they ordened

50
00:03:59,940 --> 00:03:59,940


51
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,560
fire to the walls and just kept partying away while the place burned down around

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,880
them it was like a vision of hell itself but people just kept paying money

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:19,920
walking in swigging drinks at the bar their clothes on fire they just laughing

54
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,560
it up it was if they didn't feel any of it it was kind of a cult like a name and

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,940
in the end they were all dead I stood outside watched the place burn to the

56
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,320
ground it was like they you know they they all acted like this was something

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,380
they did every night

58
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:52,020
you got me don't ask me I don't know nothing about it I just soon stay here

59
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,360
working at the at the quick shop

60
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,620
it looks like that

61
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,460
I I

62
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,400
I

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,200
Some of my friends are believers.

64
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,140
Some of my friends are believers.

65
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,340
I'm not trying to put them down.

66
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,080
But I ain't gonna give away all my worldly goods.

67
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,840
I've already been through.

68
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,820
I had religion once.

69
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,700
I was in the Jehovah's Witnesses.

70
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,180
Had me give my Cadillac away.

71
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
The world was supposed to end on April 23rd.

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,220
We all sat around the hilltop waiting for the end of the world.

73
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,840
Well, after a while we got bored waiting and wandered off.

74
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,640
So I ain't gonna fall for none of that stuff this time.

75
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,840
But you know what I heard that was really sad?

76
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,240
I saw in this newspaper it said the Loch Ness Monster was dead.

77
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,380
I seen it right on the cover of that newspaper.

78
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,460
It was so sad.

79
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,820
It looked like a giant prairie squid or a big oyster with flippers on it

80
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,200
and a cute little otter's head.

81
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,820
Aww.

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,840
And she was...

83
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,900
Did you know it said in there she was over a thousand years old

84
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,400
and left a little tiny baby Loch Ness Monster homeless?

85
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,300
Friends, you don't want to let that little baby Loch Ness Monster go hungry, do you?

86
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,360
No, for in her belly are thousands of spider eggs.

87
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,300
Well, here in the Church of the Subgenius we offer

88
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,080
the special food.

89
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,860
Food and toys and modeling clay and clothing to those slackless children.

90
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,580
You know...

91
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,160
Even cosmetics and toiletries.

92
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,420
Those kids that you see the pictures of on milk cartons, they're not lost, friends.

93
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,540
They've just found Bob.

94
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,440
They are frolicking with the baby Loch Ness Monster now in a special swimming pool

95
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,060
at the Home for Slackless Children in Malaysia.

96
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,780
Oh, there is no secret Neptune agenda.

97
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,320
Look, Ness is...

98
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,420
Nessie's dead.

99
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,960
It was all a big hoax.

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,620
Well, we'd prefer not to go into too much detail at this time about the origins,

101
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,180
since our own research is not complete.

102
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,320
But the Church of the Subgenius does seem to have a direct connection

103
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,080
with the program known among conspiracy nuts as the Neptune Agenda.

104
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,720
And in fact...

105
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,340
The Neptune Agenda.

106
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,880
Yes, the Neptune Agenda, which we can trace the beginnings back to the discovery of sonar

107
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,460
in 1915.

108
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,460
It's a watery, fishy theory, a philosophy, a conspiracy.

109
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,380
Well, it seems that after the first use of sonar to detect German U-boats in the North

110
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:15,220
Atlantic, unusual and cryptic Morse code messages began to be received by listeners in many

111
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,020
different areas.

112
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,700
A separate code of a logarithmic nature was created to communicate with what turned out

113
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,140
to be aquatic mammals.

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,120
I probably shouldn't elaborate further here, because some of the things I've picked up

115
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:37,660
about this seem very new-agey, stupid, having to do with ley lines and a global network

116
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:45,180
of crystal skulls used as mind control transmitters to direct the actions of technologically advanced,

117
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,120
or left-brained, humans.

118
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,680
I can hear the talar caracara.

119
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:50,680


120
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:50,680


121
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,460
This is the way I navigate.

122
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,440
I move my body close to the earth.

123
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,920
The talar occurrence, it will talk the insides of my ears.

124
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,120
Sonar.

125
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,860
Sonar.

126
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,280
Sonar.

127
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,660
You can hear the whales of the briny deep moan out their love songs.

128
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,240
They can hear me, yes, they can.

129
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,700
Lonesome cowboy Dave up there on the prairie could hear them whales all the way out in

130
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,140
the ocean.

131
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,340
And he knew he wasn't going to be lonesome for long.

132
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:31,520
He'd heard from old Bob what fun a giant sea-cation, sea-going mammal could be.

133
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,500
Oh yeah, they're not that different from human beings, really, the way their bodies are set

134
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,760
up.

135
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,580
They're warm-blooded.

136
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,600
Warm-blooded.

137
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:39,880
Mmm.

138
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:48,040
When you're in the freezing, frigid Atlantic Ocean, and you got you a kind of...

139
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:57,780
Romantically-inclined she-whale, and you're a particular lonely cowboy preacher with

140
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:04,180
a guitar, you smell that ambergris floating on the seashore there.

141
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,860
Oh yeah.

142
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,660
Oh yeah.

143
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:15,060
You'll drop your sheep and your horses and just shuck your chaps and go swimming right

144
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,700
out there.

145
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,040
Oh yeah.

146
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,200
Yeah.

147
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,620
Lonesome cowboy Dave riding them dolphins all the way out to meet his queen, the great

148
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,220
blue whale in the center of the North Atlantic.

149
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,740
Yes.

150
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,380
Dave Tristed, just as had his mentor Bob.

151
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:45,660
But unfortunately, whereas Bob was man enough to handle a female blue whale, Dave got tangled

152
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,940
in the harpoon rope.

153
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:56,180
He was last seen with his wooden leg a-floppin' as she sounded one last time.

154
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm the Blue Death with Davey Joe Logger, we got 1,000, 10,000 stories of Neptune.

155
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,240
Yep.

156
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:12,400
Dave's back down there underground, underwater, underneath the great web.

157
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,040
I can't fucking breathe.

158
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,920
I can't even breathe.

159
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


160
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


161
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


162
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


163
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


164
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


165
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


166
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


167
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


168
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


169
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,980
I feel like I'm suffocating.

170
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,060
This is not as fun as it was before.

171
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,580
I'm just gonna relax this bandage.

172
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,800
Shh.

173
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,580
He was deep, deep inside the blowhole of the she-whale.

174
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,140
He thought he was gonna be having some kind of a big, hot date that night, and here he

175
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,920
was, stuck halfway in the blowhole, halfway out.

176
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,380
She couldn't spout, and that's about all he could do.

177
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, baby, Leviathan be thy name.

178
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,120
I got a wooden leg.

179
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,720
He was...

180
00:11:52,380 --> 00:12:01,240
But they later got over their marital differences, and Dave took up residence inside Mrs. Monstro.

181
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,220
I'll take all the garbage.

182
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,460
I will take all the garbage.

183
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
I'm gonna take all the garbage.

184
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,560
I'm in the garbage bag.

185
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,900
All he had to do was occasionally empty the garbage.

186
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm in the garbage bag.

187
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm in the garbage bag.

188
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:15,600


189
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:15,600


190
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
I've got a little box out of Mrs. Monstro.

191
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:27,080
He'd scrape up the old license plates and tin cans and used syringes and so forth that

192
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,480
washed into her stomach that managed to get through the baleens.

193
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,920
He'd have to empty that stuff out now and then.

194
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,300
He was like a parasitic life form inhabiting the body of the she-whale.

195
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,340
Little man's here, little man's there.

196
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,900
Little harpoon cleaning the area.

197
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,360
Little harpoon cleaning the area.

198
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,360


199
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,360


200
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,360


201
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,400
Oh, it's so shiny.

202
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:57,800
Their only natural enemy was Eskimos and Norwegians and Japanese whaling boats

203
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,160
who had broken the international laws against such things.

204
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,620
Dave was Dave of the whales.

205
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,140
I'll learn this baby's song, and then I'll record it and make a million dollars.

206
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,800
And Dave thought he was going to be a big rock and roll star with Cetacean Whale Song Rock.

207
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,740
See, now, these songs last about a year and a half.

208
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,480
It takes about two years to compose them.

209
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,340
I figure if I just shrink it down in a data bank,

210
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,700
I'll take it all the way down to, like I say, three vibrations for every 25 seconds.

211
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,440
I could have a perfect three-minute pop rock song.

212
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,180
Whale, whale, whale, whale, yeah.

213
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,280
But unfortunately, the new age composer, Yanni,

214
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,120
beat him down.

215
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,360
He beat him down.

216
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,800
He beat him down to it and made all the big money.

217
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,680
Dave and his wife, the female blue whale, Mrs. Monstro,

218
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:55,240
were left in the gutter singing bad country-western songs

219
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,040
hoping for spare change from the citizenry and tourists

220
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,480
who would walk down the boardwalk there.

221
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,060
Bleak ending for a man who'd never learn to live his life

222
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,560
and let it be that way.

223
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,040
Lost enough to a whale like that, a man like that,

224
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,540
there's something wrong with him.

225
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,200
Well, no, actually, like I said,

226
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,860
the whale is not like it's a different order of animals.

227
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,760
They're mammals.

228
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,820
They're not that different from a person.

229
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,760
They have a vestigial sort of hind leg

230
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,020
and rather a longer tail than people do.

231
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,120
But, you know,

232
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,660
they breathe air, they cry tears,

233
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,320
they weep tears just like you or I.

234
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,060
Well, like you, anyway.

235
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,380
And they don't seem to be able to take very good care of their fingernails.

236
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,220
Why is that?

237
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,200
This fungal growth seems to have traveled all the way

238
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,280
to the base of the spine.

239
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,340
And this basal area here is completely covered with the fungus.

240
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,820
Oh, superstitious, eh?

241
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,780
My great gifts

242
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:23,780


243
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:23,780


244
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:23,780


245
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:23,780


246
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:23,780


247
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:23,780


248
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,240
Dear diary, today I have added a fourth circle

249
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,480
to my pre-pooping ritual.

250
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,740
As before, the first circle is to verify that I do in fact need to poop.

251
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,260
The second is to check for gremlins and men with beards and hats.

252
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,220
The third is to re-verify my need for pooping.

253
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,980
And now the fourth is to honor my newly deceased toy.

254
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,900
Stuffed Llama, rest in peace.

255
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,040
I didn't mean to shake your head off.

256
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,860
I get it.

257
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,580
Here's hoping this romantic pair have a happier ending.

258
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,860
See, she's doing it.

259
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,620
Boy, you gotta watch out. This could lead to dancing.

260
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,720
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.

261
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,980
How much room on the saucers, why?

262
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,020
Holy head!

263
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,040
Don't worry, folks.

264
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,000
This is us.

265
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,660
Gross and perverted.

266
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,600
In gross?

267
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,180
Obsessed and deranged.

268
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,980
Down by the Rose River side.

269
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,100
The eyebrow picker.

270
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,220
And the french fry curler.

271
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,880
These are a few of my favorite things here on Mars.

272
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,340
Can we?

273
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,720
Just sit down here and have a little fireside snack.

274
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,340
You'll notice the person to your extreme right is catching fire right now.

275
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,700
And we'll be ready to eat in a few moments.

276
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,320
Have you guessed me yet?

277
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm the slime oozing out from your radio set.

278
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,240
You will obey me while I eat you.

279
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,460
Alright, here we go.

280
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,460
Here we got Frank Zappa's, the real Frank Zappa book here.

281
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,460
Let's read a little bit here while Frank sings.

282
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,380
If you wind up with a boring, miserable life because you listen to your mother, your dad, your priest, to some guy on television,

283
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,420
to any of the people, or someone on radio for that matter,

284
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,960
to any of the people telling you how to do your shit,

285
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,260
then you deserve it.

286
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,220
You want to be a schmuck? Be a schmuck!

287
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,980
But don't wait around for respect from other people.

288
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,240
A schmuck is a schmuck.

289
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,440
I suggest we learn how to take anything badly,

290
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,620
and the bad that happens to us, and polarize it.

291
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,200
Instead of being overwhelmed by a negative event,

292
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,620
dodge to the side like those Tai Chi guys,

293
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,940
and let it whiz by your pants.

294
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,080
Maybe it makes a little breeze big deal.

295
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,640
Please don't mistake this for optimism.

296
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,140
There's an organization in Texas called the Church of the Subgenius,

297
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,640
devoted to the teachings of some guy with a pipe in his mouth named Bob.

298
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm not a member, but I'm a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

299
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:26,440


300
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:39,340
But I hope local faith can help movement without the Pope.

301
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,900
But to have a man of faith,

302
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,840
and all those Bah bravo to me to their understanding,

303
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,780
is the 놀�ifiant eightfold

304
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,940
This works the same for me even when I'm in my mom and dad's office.

305
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:55,920
Bible says that for a nation that's enough is ▣

306
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,400
to have my life.

307
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,400


308
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,400


309
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,020
Beautiful disclaimer.

310
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,700
Well, this is the same idea.

311
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,840
If you think about George Clinton saying, free your mind and your ass will follow.

312
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,400
An old Sundiata story of in order to fly, you have to lose your shit.

313
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,600
Here, listen on.

314
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,440
He says, techniques must be developed to enable each of us to escape the other guy's bullshit.

315
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,840
Just as he wishes to escape ours.

316
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,780
Heaven would be a place where bullshit exists only on television.

317
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,940
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

318
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:34,380
Now, this is a man who came up with nine squadzillion hundred records and albums and CDs in his lifetime.

319
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,580
Who spent all his excess energy creating his shit.

320
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,380
And while he was doing this, all this stuff came into his head.

321
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,000
And so he spat that out too.

322
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,060
And he was right.

323
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,380
And he never had one hit album.

324
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,040
Not one hit song on the top 40.

325
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,760
No.

326
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,020
No.

327
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,700
I think in Genoa, he was probably a big star.

328
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:01,440
His silliest novelty song, the Montana, moving to Montana scene, the dental floss song.

329
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:01,980
Yeah.

330
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,840
Was the closest thing.

331
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,340
Dynamo Hum got airplay.

332
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,620
At least in Cleveland, it got a lot of airplay.

333
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:06,940
Really?

334
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,460
Now, you must think there were a few movies, weren't there?

335
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:10,880
Not anymore.

336
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,720
In Dallas, nothing got airplay by Frank.

337
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,180
He was not well liked, was he?

338
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,180
Well, sure.

339
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,020
At my house.

340
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,840
At Dr. Drummond's house.

341
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:29,000
Just, but, you know, but, yeah, they, we, most of my fellow Texans like to torture Frank.

342
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,640
They nailed him up on sticks.

343
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,760
They'd run him through town, painted all tarry and set him on fire.

344
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,460
And, hey, they used to do that to me too.

345
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,640
That's why I left.

346
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,820
That's why Frank left.

347
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,200
That's why we all drifted away.

348
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,260
Frank was also abused by his mom and dad who had supper, if you want to call it that, with their French poodle, Larry.

349
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,000
Frank's father was...

350
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,780
He was a full-blowed army colonel in the New York United States Armies.

351
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:03,240
His mom was an insane woman who belonged to the Altium Rose Society and made him do things he didn't want to do.

352
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,680
His dad was a strict disciplinarian.

353
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,340
Who are we talking about?

354
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:08,860
Frank.

355
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,540
That's not true, is it?

356
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,060
Yeah, I think he was an army brat.

357
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,180
No, none of that's true.

358
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,180
No, he was an army brat and they drove him nuts.

359
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,040
They didn't drive him nuts.

360
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,820
Frank Zappa was a relatively sane individual.

361
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,540
Well, no.

362
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,540
No, they drove him sane if that's the result.

363
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,220
You know, there's a shame.

364
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,260
He had good relationships with his parents and stuff.

365
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,480
What I read...

366
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,420
See, then that's another myth exploded.

367
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,680
Well, yeah.

368
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,180
I read that his father was like real anal because he was an army colonel and stuff.

369
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,040
Well, was that Frank Zappa talking or was that...

370
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:46,920
His mom was like one of those worrying Italian-American ladies who will not leave you alone for one minute.

371
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,360
Dynamo hum.

372
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,620
You went that ugly.

373
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,120
Fuck it.

374
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,580
You're on free fucking whale, doc.

375
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,380
Yes.

376
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,280
Yes, I am.

377
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,120
I'd rather be lucky than smart.

378
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,020
Where are we, Bob?

379
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,460
The code is broken.

380
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,320
Trouble?

381
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:05,920
Big.

382
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:06,920
Security.

383
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,140
I have the lid on tight.

384
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
Well, take it off for me.

385
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,060
The message is Mars needs women.

386
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,740
Pills, pills, pills, Bob.

387
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,580
Bob, pills.

388
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,420
Bob, pills.

389
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,120
Bob, pills.

390
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,160


391
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,360
Bob, pills.

392
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,100
Bob, pills.

393
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,100


394
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,160
Bob, pills.

395
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,400
Bob, pills.

396
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,180
Zippy, bop, bop.

397
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,560
Praise Bob!

398
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,700
Thanks.

399
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,440
Thanks.

400
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,100
There were a couple times when I didn't think you were buying it.

401
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,680
You know what Jankum is?

402
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,380
I saw one of those TV shows that has America's most fascist, home, hilarious cop abuses.

403
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,480
Oh, those are great.

404
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,520
And it was, I gotta admit, it was pretty funny.

405
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:51,040
This cop had pulled over this sort of a buck-toothed, hayseed po-bar.

406
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,020
And it was a guy named Jack Walker just got in town, Jasper, sort of a feller talk, kind

407
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,460
of like me.

408
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,600
They love them newcomers.

409
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,700
They're the least mean.

410
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:03,240
And on the vid, there was a cop and a video cameraman talking to this guy, and the cop's

411
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,040
going, sir, I suspect that you've been smoking marijuana.

412
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,300
Now, do you know why I would suspect that?

413
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,380
And the guy's going, I don't know.

414
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,660
The whole time he's got this joint in his ear, right behind his ear.

415
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,860
The cameraman, of course, zooms in on it.

416
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,260
And, you know.

417
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:30,600
And it embarrassed me, you know, to see that pot smoker look so very, very dumb.

418
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,720
Because I know it was the beers he had.

419
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,900
And he admitted to the beers.

420
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,460
He said, well, I did just have a couple of beers before I came out here.

421
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,700
But I don't know why you'd think I'd be smoking dope.

422
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,740
And the cop finally points to the joint behind the guy's ear.

423
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,860
And he goes, well, damn.

424
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,100
So I didn't even smoke it.

425
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,440
Now I ain't going to get a chance to smoke it.

426
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,460
If I'd have been smoking it, why would it be?

427
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,900
Well, darn.

428
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,140
That's right, too.

429
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,160
Wasn't it?

430
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,080
Yes, friends.

431
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,140
It's right.

432
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,820
Right, right, right.

433
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,540
The next time you eat a hamburger, don't just eat the hamburger.

434
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:19,280
Pull the damn joint out from under your ears and smoke him in remembrance of you.

435
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,160
Ah, yes.

436
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,560
And then when you have truly remembered you,

437
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,840
pick pieces off of yourself,

438
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,460
pull yourself into little tiny bits and let the seeds roll away.

439
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,600
And then kind of fluff yourself over into that huge bowl of Bob's giant pipe

440
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,880
and let him smoke you.

441
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,780
And as you become the molecules coursing down and hitting his little airy vulva,

442
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,100
but...

443
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,100


444
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,060
And as you enter Bob's bloodstream,

445
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:01,660
and as the essence of you becomes that which is interfering with Bob's rational thought...

446
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,460
Don't forget.

447
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,580
Don't forget what you owe Bob at that moment.

448
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,560
You owe Bob more than the air you breathe.

449
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,580
You owe Bob the liquid you reconvert into spatial D-cells and brain signals

450
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,740
like those shown in Mom's.

451
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,180
Like a

452
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,560
sculptural

453
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:21,620
...

454
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,660
...

455
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,100
...

456
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:27,860
...

457
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,160
...

458
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,520
...

459
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,660
...

460
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:39,680
...

461
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,460
...

462
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:42,480
...

463
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,500
...

464
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,520
...

465
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:42,540
...

466
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:42,560
...

467
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,220
that easily.

468
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,400
Ha!

469
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,800
Here we go.

470
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,600
Look at the monkeys

471
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,840
and the dwarfs

472
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,280
and midgets

473
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,420
and the bears

474
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,860
and the pigs

475
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,900
and the normals

476
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,820
and the subgeniuses

477
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,520
all running around.

478
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:55,940
I can see them now

479
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,280
as if they were

480
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,380
right in front of me

481
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,540
sweating and farting

482
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,240
like the other

483
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,220
circus animals.

484
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,040
God almighty,

485
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,480
I love the circus.

486
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,400
The smell of the peanuts,

487
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,500
the quaint,

488
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,160
piquant aroma

489
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,340
of the dead chef.

490
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,260
God, I love the circus.

491
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,620
If I could just make

492
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,060
Cavill perhaps live,

493
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,540
one wish it would be

494
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,700
to be in the circus

495
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,360
always front row center

496
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,820
and a master ceremony.

497
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,860
I am afraid, monsieur,

498
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,980
you have failed.

499
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,280
You have failed

500
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,300
the test miserably.

501
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,620
You have taken

502
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,760
a very, very detailed log

503
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,900
of your activities

504
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,320
and your moral,

505
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,860
your moral responses.

506
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,760
You are what we might call

507
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,520
a spud animal.

508
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,980
You little spud man,

509
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,100
little silly spud people.

510
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,860
You would do no

511
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,480
of a roots.

512
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,500
You little spud man.

513
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,780
How can he see in any one direction?

514
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,220
Dirty little man.

515
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,740
He's like a

516
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,440
swollen piece of flesh

517
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
that has no use.

518
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,520
Filthy, filthy, filthy.

519
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,960
Dirty, dirty.

520
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Steve, Dr. Dog,

521
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,900
we're ready to tee off now.

522
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,620
Those of you who haven't watched

523
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,600
are gonna have to,

524
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,440
gonna have to,

525
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,740
gonna have to,

526
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,200
gonna have to go back and hit the...

527
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,780
This is Reverend D.K. Jones

528
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,080
in New Jersey.

529
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,320
Great subgenius.

530
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,880
A song called

531
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Midnight Ramblin'.

532
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,240
I don't mean just black men.

533
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,100
I mean you black-hearted

534
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,860
men and women.

535
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,760
Yes.

536
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,780
I'm Midnight Ramblin'.

537
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,100
Yes.

538
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,580
All Midnight Ramblin' faces

539
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,460
are not black.

540
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,720
Yes.

541
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,140
What's our harm?

542
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,660
Yes.

543
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,260
It's as black as midnight.

544
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,360
Yes.

545
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,800
This is Reverend D.K. Jones

546
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:10,800


547
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,740
in New Jersey.

548
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,840
I'm talking to you.

549
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:14,820
Yes.

550
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,720
Hold up, men.

551
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,140
Yes.

552
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:20,840
Yes.

553
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,440
And women.

554
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:26,800
Yes.

555
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,240
Yes.

556
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,700
You bank robbers.

557
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:30,820
Yes.

558
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,320
You say so.

559
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,060
Yes.

560
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,740
Yes.

561
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,060
Yes.

562
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,380
And you bank robbers.

563
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:39,800
Yes.

564
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,940
And kidnapped.

565
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,800
Yes.

566
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,240
All right.

567
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,680
I'm talking to you.

568
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,620
Yes.

569
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,340
And we got some people in the church

570
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,220
Yes, sir.

571
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,080
just as late

572
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,360
as a midnight ramblin'.

573
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,960
Yes, sir.

574
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,460
I don't know what time

575
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,180
Reverend D.K. Jones

576
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,300
got in last night.

577
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,920
Yes, Reverend D.K. Jones

578
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,700
got in last night.

579
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,480
Yes, they had him.

580
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,940
But you haven't told

581
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,880
why they had that

582
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,300
Mr. Bell.

583
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,640
Why did they have him there?

584
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,100
Yes.

585
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,640
Yes.

586
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,740
He was in jail

587
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,540
for a thing or two.

588
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:26,580


589
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,660
Yes.

590
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:30,540
Yes.

591
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,440
Yes.

592
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,040
Yes.

593
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Now, Mrs. Jones,

594
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,740
where was your husband?

595
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:38,980
Yes.

596
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,180
Where was your husband?

597
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,380
My husband didn't get home

598
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,080
last night.

599
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,420
You told me not to tell you.

600
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,000
No.

601
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,080
Well you don't have to

602
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,240
tell me I'm not holding court.

603
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,460
No.

604
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,720
I'm just telling you

605
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,060
And the jurors will tell him what to do.

606
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,800
Him what to do.

607
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,220
Him what to do.

608
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,200
Him what to do.

609
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,860
Him what to do.

610
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,700
Him what to do.

611
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,400
All right.

612
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,160
And in the corner, you don't mind, you get six long.

613
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:19,720
Eight.

614
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,360
Ah, ten.

615
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,940
And now I'm talking to you midnight rams.

616
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,660
All right.

617
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,560
Oh, yeah.

618
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,360
Out with somebody else.

619
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,900
But he's got an answer for himself.

620
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,980
Yes, sir.

621
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,120
I went out there for him, but he doesn't stand for himself.

622
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,080
That musical break was Midnight Rambler by D.K. Jones,

623
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,840
from before My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, by the way.

624
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,640
And now Captain Beefheart.

625
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,560
The black paper between the mirror breaks my heart.

626
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,360
The moon frayed through dark velvet lightly at heart.

627
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,520
Steal softly to sunshine.

628
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,840
Steal softly.

629
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,680
Be too slow.

630
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:00,880
What?

631
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,200
The princess is a creature of antiquity.

632
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,040
Ten million years at least in age.

633
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,760
Dear diary, I told the cat about how my dearest human has promoted me,

634
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,340
teaching me to shake so I can participate in his business dealings.

635
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,420
However, cat pointed out that I'm often unaware of what I'm shaking on.

636
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,780
For example, when I shook the neighbor's hand,

637
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,860
The cat seemed to feel dead.

638
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,180
I did.

639
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,420
And most importantly-

640
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:37,420


641
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,620
Great-

642
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,820
It doesn't feel like I feel any better.

643
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,000


644
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,000


645
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,860
I'm glad you're out spent about your day.

646
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:45,920
tet you are.

647
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,500
And then one thing...

648
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:48,500


649
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,180
Now, Stephen.

650
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,540
We're looking for you since this morning.

651
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,040
I know what you did.

652
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,420
If you agreed to...

653
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,900
I wanted to...

654
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,680
He's hers and hers alone

655
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,320
Cause Toby has to have a girl to call his own

656
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,980
I must have a girl to call my own

657
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,020
For I am Toby, son of Goom

658
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,340
You pitiful, fixed-legged earth fools

659
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Milling about in your cage of only three dimensions

660
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,960
Toby, go find me a nymph

661
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,880
Maynard, bring me a woman

662
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,280
Give me a fury

663
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,680
A hundred of little furies

664
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,740
I want more

665
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,940
Bring me harpies with chests of steel

666
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,040
And bring me the furies themselves

667
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,460
They want Medusa

668
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,580
Yes, I will make love to Medusa

669
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,480
Let her turn me to stone

670
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,460
I could be no stonier of heart

671
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,980
Than I am already

672
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,440
If only the fools would leave me in peace

673
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,020
To complete my experiments

674
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,860
They want to know who I am and what I am

675
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,780
Well, I'll show them

676
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,160
I'll show them all

677
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,460
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

678
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

679
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,140
It's here, in this dark cave on the Aegean Sea

680
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,780
Where lights have been seen for scores and scores of years

681
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,260
Fishermen have noticed lights in this cave

682
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,080
For a period of five weeks at a time

683
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,120
During the summer solstice season

684
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,900
And after that time, the lights appear to...

685
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,240
These crop circles, or frock circles as they're called

686
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,860
Originally appeared in wheat fields in England and Ireland

687
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,160
These crop circles, or frock circles as they're called Originally appeared in wheat fields in England and Ireland

688
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,240
Ireland, Scotland.

689
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,620
Lately, they've been appearing as concrete circles

690
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,320
in the center of New York City in Chicago.

691
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,200
Decorated with the bodies of mutilated cats.

692
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,900
Mysteriously mutilated cats.

693
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,920
What could this mean?

694
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,120
There are no secrets in the Church of the Subgenius

695
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,200
and I will not be endangering myself or my family in any way

696
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,980
despite rumors to the contrary

697
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:29,720
because you, dear listener, will probably not believe a word of it.

698
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,800
It's all just more quaint fiction to you.

699
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,820
Just a lark, a joke.

700
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:45,980
Eh, well, if the frog circles and the smoke from Bob's pipe are just a joke,

701
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,200
then what is your life?

702
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,440
Your very life, my friend.

703
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

704
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,740
Where to begin? Where to begin?

705
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,080
There are so many impossible stories and bizarre events

706
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,960
associated with the Church that it is hard to choose where to start.

707
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,760
Oh, man, this is so like, dude, it's like Venusians in the, like, hollow earth.

708
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,800
They just look like the Nazis.

709
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,960
They're just two weird guys.

710
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,580
They're just dimensions from, I mean, these people from the, they never care.

711
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,860
To set the tone, let me tell you what I've seen with my own eyes

712
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,460
while visiting Palmer Vredes.

713
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:20,820
Yes.

714
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,980
Artist Hal Robbins, a.k.a. Dr. Hal,

715
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,640
in his San Francisco apartment in 1993.

716
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:30,880
Hmm.

717
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,720
Well, I'm a good member of the Wellborn House.

718
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,380
Uh, yes.

719
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,220
Lies and Vredes began an apparently innocent brag fight,

720
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,880
each proclaiming their abilities in the most outrageous terms.

721
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,320
But after a quarter hour without significant gain,

722
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,440
Vredes became agitated.

723
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,180
And so did I.

724
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,600
Suddenly swept lamp and telephone from an end table.

725
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,060
Watch this.

726
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,160
He then seemingly lifted the table into the air without touching it.

727
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,320
It shot out the window and crashed onto the sidewalk two floors below

728
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,720
where it burst into flame.

729
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,820
Vredes changed the subject immediately,

730
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,200
and the event was never spoken of again.

731
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,280
Having set the tone with that story,

732
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,100
I can pretty much say anything I want to,

733
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,600
and be assured that no listener will believe a word of it.

734
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,340
On the same visit, I took a trip into the desert

735
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,580
with D. Woodman Atwell of puzzling evidence.

736
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,200
A harrowing experience all around,

737
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,520
for I saw him apparently drive his truck through a concrete wall

738
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,580
without damage of any kind to anything.

739
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,020
Oh!

740
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,220
I was then shown a series of missile silos

741
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,720
from which shone beams of bluish green light

742
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,500
for a period of about two hours,

743
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,140
around midnight.

744
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,320
This is February of 1992.

745
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,440
There were a number of unusual gravitational and magnetic events

746
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,200
in the area around this time.

747
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,800
There were also a number of what I took to be

748
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,680
very large sandstone rock formations

749
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,000
which appeared to change positions when I wasn't watching.

750
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,580
Grrr...

751
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,240
Ah...

752
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:19,800
Ah...

753
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,200
Thanks for the frog.

754
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,780
Frog.

755
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:23,800
Frog.

756
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,300
Frog.

757
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,120
This is nothing compared to the bizarre political and extra-legal connections

758
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,900
of the Church of the Subgenius.

759
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,940
Ivan Stang is known to have made trips to England and South America

760
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,500
in the past few years to meet with, among others,

761
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,440
high-ranking members of the P2 Masonic group

762
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,460
and an organization of which the Priory of Zion

763
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,360
and Bilderberger Group are sanitized fictionalizations.

764
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,460
Stang and Drummond are known to be 33rd degree masons

765
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,160
and Stang's position in a control group hinted at as a Texas Mafia

766
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,280
is hereditary through his father, an ex-district attorney for general Dallas.

767
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,900
Stang has employed a man named Doug Smith

768
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,880
to pose as the real-life person of Ivan Stang.

769
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,440
Stang, however, is his real name, although he now uses the Smith name in his daily life.

770
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,000
I have met Smith and can assure you

771
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,680
they are two very different people of entirely different capabilities.

772
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,480
Smith seems to be a victim of arrested development

773
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,660
and though he is the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet,

774
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,220
Stang is perfectly correct in calling him

775
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,160
dumb as Dave.

776
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,800
I have never met Drummond, but the stories I've heard...

777
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,020
uh...

778
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,860
are as strange as anything yet.

779
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,100
Relate.

780
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,980
Now, I've seen the real Doug.

781
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,940
I've seen the real Doug and he is just as smooth as buttermilk pie.

782
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,180
He would never do a harmful thing to another human being.

783
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,620
This other man, now you can see there's a big difference.

784
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,480
Look at his chin right there. There's a big scar on his chin.

785
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,080
And I don't see how they can get away with that.

786
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,520
I've told all my kin so far that this is it with me, boy.

787
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,440
I'm just giving up on everything the government ever says ever again.

788
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,560
I just don't believe it.

789
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,780
Did you see what they had on the head the other night?

790
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,420
They had a man who could actually make a man make a man.

791
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,500
I'm not gonna make a man. I'm not gonna make a man.

792
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:25,740
Oh...

793
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,220
You're right.

794
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,360
Scrapple.

795
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,140
Scrapple.

796
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,060
Bob put it in Ayn Rand!

797
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,880
I heard you voice on the radio.

798
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,980
Who's staying?

799
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,480
Of course you know me.

800
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,000
You were sent here to kill me.

801
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,100
What?

802
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,640
He had a letter from a prisoner.

803
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,560
Prisoner?

804
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,560
A prisoner in Atlanta. Or near to Atlanta.

805
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,440
Actually, his prison address here is in Delaware.

806
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,940
What's he in prison for?

807
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,120
What we have here...

808
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,540
Listen to this letter.

809
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,940
They will send you to Fodacate.

810
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,180
I mean, commuter.

811
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,300
This was sent to us here in Cleveland.

812
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,500
Not to the Dallas headquarters.

813
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,140
He goes,

814
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,780
Almighty Holy Messenger, my name is Noah Hughes,

815
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,180
AKA Pope Nasty.

816
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,540
Noah Count.

817
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,520
I'm a devout subgenius whose rights to slack are being withheld through a local department of corrections.

818
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,300
I'm currently being held in Gander Hill Prison, located in Wilmington, Delaware, on charges of...

819
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,760
Hey! You got that rack of dollars.

820
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,160
Crop possession.

821
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,620
Crop possession.

822
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:55,300
I'm looking at about three more years and they repeatedly had church material refused for no other reason than it's the conspiracy.

823
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,440
I'm asking you to please send any church information or prayer material.

824
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,180
Prisoners always want it free.

825
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,780
They want you to...

826
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:10,620
As well as documentation of any kind to show that our glorious church is recognized by the government as an actual religion.

827
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,920
Well, it's not.

828
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,400
I'm...

829
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,520
Which is too bad for all those people I've married.

830
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:23,700
I'm working on building a case against the prison for isolation of my First Amendment rights.

831
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,780
A violation of them.

832
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,580
So please feel free to forward any and all information pertaining to these taped topics and requests.

833
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,880
My body is totally slack free.

834
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,760
And I'm hurting for some of your old time religion.

835
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,900
Also, please use the church name on a return letter.

836
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,480
So I can receive said slack.

837
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,040
God bless you my fine friend.

838
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,500
Give me slack.

839
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,460
Praise...

840
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,800
Oh, that poor man.

841
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,700
Now to discuss his actual agonizing condition.

842
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,600
Just think at what he must go through every day.

843
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,880
He bangs a tin cup against the cell door.

844
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:03,980
A guy with one of those 1930s King Kong hats comes by and pulls out his old Billy stick.

845
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:11,880
And starts clubbing him ferociously until the guy next door, who is somewhere near 455 feet tall,

846
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,140
with a 5 pounds of solid muscle with a shaved head, has barbecue shavings with him.

847
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,260
Ewww.

848
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,600
That is so disgusting.

849
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,160
And for what?

850
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,200
What did this man do to deserve this?

851
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,060
Lick a black hole of liquor.

852
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,900
All this man did was lick a black hole.

853
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,040
That's all he did.

854
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,940
And did that hurt anybody else?

855
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,560
Well, no, my friend.

856
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,360
You don't understand.

857
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,120
The reason why we are against drugs is because they are against us.

858
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,940
Don't you understand what it is saying?

859
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,260
But yet you can buy heroin down at the supermarket.

860
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,240
I mean beer.

861
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,160
You can buy false hair anywhere, pal.

862
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,040
That doesn't mean you're not going to stay bald.

863
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,620
You can get crack down at the liquor store.

864
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,560
I mean whiskey.

865
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,300
You know, I mean you can get narcotics anywhere.

866
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,720
You could be a narcotic.

867
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,440
All this man did was have some frop and a black hole.

868
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,540
He should have told the judge.

869
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,980
He should have told the judge.

870
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,700
I am drugged like Sean Moore Dolly did.

871
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,300
He's probably got three more years of looking in the black hole.

872
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,480
I guess they better put...

873
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,540
Or bend over.

874
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,320
Bend over a shaving log.

875
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,740
God in prison for growing frop.

876
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,620
The last time I heard, Mr. God was growing marijuana and frop.

877
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:18,360
Both.

878
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,380
By the roadside, my friend.

879
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,320
All over this country and many others.

880
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,580
I guess they better put God in that Gander Hill prison.

881
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,600
That God is in jail right now, Stan.

882
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,700
Well, that's kind of one of the main problems or why we are having so many problems right now.

883
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,700
Hell, they're lowering the coffin of God into the ground.

884
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,380
God is dead.

885
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,460
God is not dead.

886
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,540
He's doing 15 to 25 at a minimum.

887
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,860
Well, not really a minimum.

888
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,740
There is barbed wire, but he can't get out.

889
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,020
For possession.

890
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,620
For growing.

891
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,640
God's in prison for growing.

892
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,360
Well, no, actually just for consorting with an angular object.

893
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,740
I think there were even more of a scourge than that.

894
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,500
I think they're working on throwing the sun in the hoose gow, too.

895
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,380
I thought God was arrested by the four-dimensional sheriff.

896
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,900
Four-dimensional sheriff.

897
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,040
Four-dimensional sheriff.

898
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,180
Four-dimensional sheriff.

899
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,180
Trying to break into the fifth dimension.

900
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,200
Yeah, because we've got only a three-dimensional God.

901
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,040
Yeah.

902
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,000
He was getting so deep for his brits.

903
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:24,560
Well, actually, maybe God's just a four-dimensional critter and every now and then you just see a wavering light in the air and you hear a voice.

904
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,280
So everybody goes, God.

905
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,120
So maybe you're saying God got thrown in jail for doing weird things.

906
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,040
No, God is just an adventurer.

907
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,300
He's like a guy who lives in the four-dimensional world.

908
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,540
It lives in the four-dimensional land.

909
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,040
But he's just out tooling around one day and stuck his head in on Earth.

910
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,220
Oh, man.

911
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,020
What a mistake.

912
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,300
Just like us looking through a microscope at a bunch of microbes.

913
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,800
And the people on Earth.

914
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,680
He looked around at the people and he was just like, you know, dudes, you shouldn't kill.

915
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,420
Don't do that.

916
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,420
And he kind of stuck his finger out when he said that.

917
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,900
But that's what came through to three dimensions.

918
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,960
When he stuck his finger out, it kind of passed through.

919
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,520
And he said, do not kill him.

920
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,520
They wrote it on a stone.

921
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,560
They all said, kill him, kill him.

922
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,380
And then they realized every time they killed him, he kept on coming back every Easter.

923
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,720
So they put his ass in jail and they're not letting him out.

924
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,540
Aren't you mixing up God with Jesus, Dave?

925
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,900
Oh, the idea of the Trinity.

926
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,400
That's his little boy, God Jr.

927
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,640
I beg to differ with myself.

928
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,180
God is not only his only purified self, but he's also an alien vestigal.

929
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,380
He's three in one.

930
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,480
Three great pandies in one.

931
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,500
And may he rest in peace.

932
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:35,980
Yeah.

933
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,420
Or may he get some slack time in the yard.

934
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:38,940
Yeah.

935
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:52,920
Yeah, because not only did he grow the froth, but he grew the humans and gave them these brains whereby they would figure out that if they chewed on the froth and packed it up their eggs, it would have felt kind of good.

936
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,540
And so they did it because they could.

937
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,380
Now, I think God should be thrown in jail for that.

938
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,780
I think jail should probably be his most divine wish.

939
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,400
Because somewhere there's a 15-year-old smoking a cigarette.

940
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,440
And God's God's responsibility.

941
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,900
He brought it around.

942
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,920
He's that kid's father.

943
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,980
We're all children of God.

944
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,820
Wildwood weed.

945
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,140
If a man...

946
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,140
What if God actually did look like divine, though?

947
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:29,120
I mean, wouldn't that be a stunning surprise to walk into the heavenly gates and there's St. Peter and he's all bespectacled, and he looks like he's got, you know, like a foreskin around his neck?

948
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,500
Now, that's how God will look to Jesse Helms.

949
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,820
With a foreskin around his neck, right, and a biting, angry, one-eyed head.

950
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,800
But to me...

951
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,080
That's the way Jesse Helms will die.

952
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,240
God will look like the...

953
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,040
The young kitten Natividad in an early Russ Meyer film.

954
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,240
Kitten Natividad.

955
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,620
God's boy's in the White House now, so we should be seeing a lot more of this.

956
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,460
Bob's boy?

957
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,140
Well, that's the...

958
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,200
I didn't hear they...

959
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,800
That's the two-dimensional God I think you're talking about.

960
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,360
This morning they...

961
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,420
Yeah.

962
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:04,020
This morning they found the Bush daughters passed out in their own puke on the front lawn of the White House.

963
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,500
That could be a well...

964
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,160
That could be true, couldn't it?

965
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,420
It is.

966
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,120
It is.

967
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,180
It is a true thing?

968
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:11,500
Yeah.

969
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,600
You know how you can lie to me in their own puke.

970
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,340
They're passed out on the lawn in their own puke.

971
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,440
That was when I quit.

972
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,940
That was my last drink when I woke up on the White House lawn in a puddle of my own puke.

973
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,300
Wearing that duck suit and a brassiere.

974
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,040
And I could tell I had scratched deep gouges in the door with my fingernail the night before.

975
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,020
And you realized one tooth was missing and they were like, you were wearing lipstick.

976
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,040
I was...

977
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,300
I realized that I better quit drinking.

978
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,220
But you know those secrets?

979
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:38,220


980
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:38,220


981
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:38,220


982
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:38,220


983
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:38,220


984
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,320
Those secret service guys never did quit cause they...

985
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,340
There's still guys scratching at the door...

986
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,980
Those guys don't buy liquor for young broads.

987
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,020
Everybody's drinking on the job.

988
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,560
I'll scrapple.

989
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,360
Scraple.

990
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:51,360


991
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,200
That'll do it.

992
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,840
We should live in cities on our own filth.

993
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,200
Oh, we tried that.

994
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,360
That's so 14th century, Dave.

995
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,880
That's so 1400s.

996
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,040
Man, I'm so pashay.

997
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:26,000
You know, living like back in the 14th, like the 15th century, man.

998
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,520
Yeah, right.

999
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,400
Well, the plane walked out half the humans.

1000
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,160
You had that going for it.

1001
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,780
Cans and pieces of plastic.

1002
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,320
Half the humans.

1003
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,500
This was the sound of it.

1004
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,360
You got it on tape.

1005
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,020
Feel the drill.

1006
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,240
Oh, my God.

1007
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,500
The nose drill.

1008
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,400
It hurts, doesn't it?

1009
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,700
It hurts more.

1010
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:58,880
It just keeps getting louder.

1011
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,580
Oh, my ears.

1012
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,020
My ears.

1013
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,820
Thanks, Bob.

1014
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,020
Oh, my ears.

1015
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:05,620
I'm going to get you all.

1016
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,180
I'm going to see my mom.

1017
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,000
Thanks, Bob.

1018
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,840
Oh, I can't stand it.

1019
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,580
Another second.

1020
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,640
More, more, more.

1021
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,300
Oh, I see it.

1022
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:13,800
It's made up.

1023
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,540
It ruptured.

1024
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,960
Almost done there.

1025
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,620
And it feels so good.

1026
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,040
Now spit out of your ears.

1027
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,280
And you turn it off.

1028
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,820
Let your ears drill in the cup now.

1029
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,840
Just when you get a breath.

1030
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,040
My ears.

1031
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:26,800
I'm leaving.

1032
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,540
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

1033
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,760
Killing me.

1034
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,220
Don't stop, Bob.

1035
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,860
I hate this.

1036
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,780
Don't stop.

1037
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,500
Don't stop.

1038
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:38,940
Oh, I can't.

1039
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,780
I'm losing it.

1040
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,180
I'm losing it.

1041
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,240
I'm losing it.

1042
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:42,840
I've got to do it.

1043
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,120
Ah!

1044
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,760
Don't.

1045
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,480
I'm losing it.

1046
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,040
Stop it.

1047
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:47,380
It's horrible.

1048
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,620
This is the worst thing that's ever happened.

1049
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,200
I've got to say.

1050
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:50,460
Oh.

1051
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,040
God, Bob.

1052
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,500
I want to pay extra for that.

1053
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:59,520
Dear diary, my dearest human asked me where the ball was when it was clearly in plain sight.

1054
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,880
I brought it over and he threw it even farther away.

1055
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,720
Then asked me where it was and was very happy when I brought it again.

1056
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,000
Perhaps a metaphor?

1057
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,180
Dearest human leaves each day and I am happy when he returns

1058
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:17,220
Wait, maybe he is the ball and I am dearest human

1059
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,360
This is too much

1060
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,100
I must be on the bed

1061
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:29,020
The sad dog diary clips there came from Z Frank

1062
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,340
Yanked from YouTube

1063
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,580
Z is spelled Z-E

1064
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,720
Frank is spelled Frank

1065
00:51:43,220 --> 00:52:05,700
Frank is spelled Frank

1066
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,680
B-L-N-D-N-P-G

1067
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,420
That spells blind pig, don't you see?

1068
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,120
Teacher said with some surprise

1069
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,700
Son, you left out both the I and the B

1070
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,340
Now I said, teacher dear

1071
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,000
Won't you please and listen here

1072
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,780
Blind pigs have no eyes, you see

1073
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,580
You're right, the teacher said to me

1074
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,440
Root for that acorn

1075
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,100
Root for that acorn

1076
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,000
Write, sprayed and

1077
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,000
