Ah, it's all coming back to me now.
And now if I do this...
Fast! No time for the stairs. Out through the wall!
No time to find the entrance. I'll just drive straight to it through the solid rock.
No time for opening windows.
Clark Kent may need a plane, but Superman doesn't.
Here's Bob One for A1 Slacks.
Hi, I'm Bob One for A1 Slacks, and I'd like to take a moment of your time.
Thank you.
And I'd like to tell you about the nice folks down at A1 Slacks.
They handle a needle just the way your mother used to,
and the results are racers, capers, tapers, and bummers, such as you've never worn before.
The Action Man's Go-Go Now Generation Happening Slacks
for the Go-Go Now Generation Action Man on campus and off.
And remember, you can get a good education and win valuable prizes, too.
Thank you, Bob.
You're welcome.
And now, back to our movie.
Wherever there is mystery, intrigue, romance,
in all the strange and strange,
dangerous places of the world,
there you will find...
Bob?
It's chaotic.
It's chaotic.
It's chaotic.
Yes, yes, finally, we can do it.
We'll actually have friends.
My microphone broke, and Bob made me come into the station.
He made me keep working, and so we're doing it.
God damn it.
From the very station itself.
As the...
If I push this button, now, theoretically,
this should bring this noise up and...
Yowl Slack.
Yowl Slack.
Bob?
Yowl Slack.

Yowl Slack.







Wee.
Wee.
I'm here to fuck it up.

Slap, slap, slap.
Slap, slap, slap.
Slap, slap, slap.
Slap, slap, slap.
Box dwellers, the Barbies and Kins, the Slack listeners, yeah, the walking...
Yes.
Yes.
Are you stopping from Instagram?
Oh, yes, to friends.
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,520.
Big numbers.
That is a huge number.
And that strange piece of music we just heard was by Reverend Berne Bridges,
who I think is in Berlin, Germany, but I'm not totally sure.
A strange little ditty called Society Makes Me Want to Throw Up.
Before that, Flubber by Artemia Salina from the olden days.
Something called 30 Second Drum Bass Loop by yours truly.
And the titles were by the El Queso.
All stars with the Firesign Theater helping.
And our music in the background tonight is...
Well, it was sent to me by the name of Aeneas.
And it's called Aeneas Subgenius, and it's 56 minutes of techno of some kind,
with the occasional blurt of subgenius talking in the background
that I should probably talk over because there might be some sort of bad words in it.
So I'll just keep talking.
I'll keep talking right now.
And I'll tell you that for a little while, I'm going to read from one of our many out-of-print books.
The Church of the Subgenius has officially produced five, four real books.
That is, four of them were published by Simon & Schuster, and they were all in bookstores.
The last one, the Bobliografon, the Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack,
was published in 2006 by a pretty small publisher,
which almost instantly went out of business right after publishing that and reprinting Revelation X.
And now they're impossible to find, except on eBay, where I believe this book here...
Yes.
The new copies are selling for $300 in Sunfell.
Get out of town.
No, I'm not kidding.
It's a rare book now.
Goodness gracious.
I've got 30 of them in a box secretly in my basement.
And I've got a box of 30 of the Subgenius role-playing game cards from Steve Jackson Games.
I'm saving those for when the artists who helped us do these projects lose their only copy.
So they're not for sale.
And I know that each and every one of our artists will lose their copy.
Um...
This music is dwerpy.
I don't know how else to call it.
It's dwerpy.
Dwerpy?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I was going to read something about dwerpy people in here.
Really?
Yeah.
Um...
Most of the norm worms are as blameless as children.
The lifelong conservative dweeb nerds that we can understand.
The ones that...
Drive us nuts are the sellouts and the posebuckers.
Those who throughout the work week are the most impotent of drones.
Taking the most pay to do the least memorable work.
But then become weird on the weekend.
Once they're out of the office, they're magical beings.
Witches.
Klingons.
Cowboys.
They're artists.
Rock stars.
And biker outlaws.
During the two days when they're not being paid slaves.
Oh, they might have started out as termites.
But they end up part of the woodwork.
Every week, they endure five days of kissing the butts of dominant normals.
And then compress it into two days of putting down the real weirdos.
The ones who are weird full time and can't fake it.
These hip wimps snub the plain garden vermin.
And they're just the ones who are the ones who are the most popular.

And they're the ones who are the most popular.
And they're the ones who are the most popular.
And they can have more trendy clothes.
And hang out posing.
And more trendy sushi bars.
And be more politically correct with more trendy friends who are all trendy artists.
The kind that tattoo their faces.
And hang gold chains from their pierced privates.
So they can give more money to Greenpeace and brag about it.
And feel absolved for the money they're getting from daddy.
Who collects rent from 400 squalid little tenements on the west side.
Or saturates the...
Countrysides with pesticides to grow more vast fields of organic spinach.
Pink doesn't just mean conservative.
Pinkness also permeates the reality challenged bleeding heart liberals.
The self-hating gays.
Environmentalists.
Pop psychologists.
Feminists.
Animal rights activists.
Afrocentrists.
Earth firsters.
All the Hollywood channels.
The big bachelors and amateur communists.
The McClain's and Fonda's.
All those whining dupes of some big daddy or big mama.
Too much false slack is what allows these trust fund rebels to exist.
The hip wimps always seem to know what's best for everybody else.
But stupid do-gooders can be worse than smart evil doers.
Especially if you happen to be evil.
For example.
Anti-smoking.
Bull from hand-wringing ninny.
Sully's world slacked far more than does secondhand smoke.
We tend to fear the world being destroyed by monsters or madmen.
But the smug do-gooder may well be the death of us all after all.
And the worst of it is, it'll be for our own good.
As G. Gordon Gordon said.
We hock up lungers and spit in your name.
Poser weirdo.
You're everything your top 40 rock artists rail against.
You are your own bitterest enemy.
What's hard to do.
No wonder you spend more on shrinks than we do on frop.
You are among the truly lost.
Those who will never find anything.
Because there's no you left.
We, your so-called lowest of the low, laugh at you.
Sure, you laugh at us.
But you haven't had a sincere laugh at us.
We've had a sincere laugh since high school.
Whoa.
Whew.
Other people's business seems to be the natural enclosure for many noses.
Thus, we find companies using pee tests to determine a worker's suitability for a job that has nothing at all to do with urination.
While at the same time, our legitimate pee jobs are outsourced to urinators in foreign countries.
Ha ha ha.
And Uncle Mike, the world's greatest

lazy
And if he hasn't done it, never should
flies.
ığ
Gunpoint if necessary.
Being a real dumbass sure seems to make things a lot easier, though.
Well, well, well.
A little reading there from the subgenius cyclopedia of slack, the Bobliographon.
New revelations from J.R. Bob Dobbs.
2006 from Thunder's Mouth Press.
Edited by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.
I even did the layout.
Can you believe it?
I believe it.
And we're going to go to puzzling evidence in a little while.
In like now.
But Princess Wee, you should remind me when we're talking to Dave to rant about hipsters.
Okay.
I'll write that down so I don't forget.
I'm good for that.
Because I have even more nasty, mean things to say about hipsters.
I've already written it.
Okay.
All right, friends.
We're going to take a little break here from this and go to that, which would be about 15 minutes from the Puzzling Evidence Show.
From KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Hal and Dr. Philo Drummond as guests of Puzzling Evidence as heard here.
Thank you.
There must have been a purpose to all this.
No, sorry.
What was the purpose again?
It's a...
It's a warm-blooded mammal that swims in the ocean.
This island purpose.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
The purpose.
Exactly.
The perfect example.
So, also in the news, they seem to have discovered a new radioactive hamsterness near the former nuclear site of Chernobyl.
Whoa.
Told you.
Sounds like good eating.
Well, you can do it.
You know, don't let me keep you back.
Go ahead.
You prepare.
They still eat vegetables from around Chernobyl, you know.
You betcha.
Yes, they've grown and flourished in the mutant...
I highly recommend the book Dead Hand.
I think...
About that very thing.
The plants have grown pretty good there.
Not only about Chernobyl and the miracle that is Chernobyl, but it's about the Russian machine that was set up with the three humus in it on deep underground so that if the war blew up Russia, if we got there first, the Dead Hand machine would bring its little...
Well, it's a little...
Scissors switch down and that we would be retaliatory out of existence.
All right.
And a couple of times things...
It's a fail-safe system.
Yeah, exactly.
And a couple of times the only fail-safe was confirmed by the humus.
Because they read that missiles were coming toward them and a human stepped into the system and said, somehow I don't think so.
Yeah.
Saved us once again.
The only reason we're all here, the only reason we're all here is luck.
Yeah.
Just total luck.
Read Command and Control by a lot of losses.
Luck and a lot of people having sex with each other.
Well, that...
Command and Control.
Yeah, those two...
Yeah, I meant to bring that up.
The other one first is a lot of people having sex with each other.
Hey, wait, I have another...
And then nobody dropped...
Actually, many people dropped nuclear bombs, but because they were so well designed in this country that they don't go off.
Yeah, I know.
I'm afraid in Russia they did kind of go off.
They did go off over now and then in places.
In Russia.
Only there.
None of our system ever did.
One of mine went off in my backyard once.
But it was just because I was being careful.
I wasn't watching what I was doing.
It was also brought around by the first Jewish admiral in the U.S. Navy.
And if you didn't like having a Jew in the yearbook that the ship may know, the Lucky Bag is the yearbook of the Naval Academy.
They put his page on...
Call us back.
They put him on a perforated page so that you could tear his horrible religious information out of your Lucky Bag.
But that man went on to become why we never had any nuclear accidents in this country.
Ever.
Who was that?
Why?
His name was John Why?
Now his name escapes me.
I knew you were going to add that.
That's not Hyman Rickover.
Thank you.
Hyman Rickover.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because the Naval Academy at that time...
Hyman?
It was Hyman.
Probably the 60s was a southern school.
So, you know, there were no black midshipmen for a long time.
There were very few Jewish midshipmen for a long time.
But these people stepped forward.
I love that perforated page thing.
That's amazing.
Oh, man.
But I already did the story about how Lieutenant Carter joined the nuclear forces.
What's the Carter on Mars movie?
John Carter.
John Carter.
Are they going to do any more of those?
No, I don't think so.
It didn't make that much money, so they don't want to do it.
I thought it was actually pretty well done.
I did too.
I liked the interview.
It was fun to watch.
Yeah.
And I think something about...
I don't know what it is because that actor, I thought he was sort of on the upward...
They were giving him a push too.
Yes.
You know, how they do that back in professional wrestling when they want somebody to be the
new champion, they give him a push, you know, and they give him a bunch of jobbers to beat
up on his way to the rise.
Yeah.
Yeah, in any business.
Except this business.
This business of radio.
Yeah.
This business we're in, this business of radio.
This thing we have.
And we're only 40 seconds away from something that lots of people really like.
That's true.
Something for everyone.
That's what this show has.
That's what KPFA has.
That's what America has.
That's what Earth has.
That's what the universe has.
That's what...
Can I stop there?
I think so.
It's 420, little caller.
Here's this guy again.
Yeah.
He's trying hard to talk to Dr. Howell.











My personal savior, the one who sweetened my day.
Hey, the caller that's calling and just jabbering, I need to know what do you want me to call
you, because when I'm writing up the show description...
To be frank, I'm...
What's your name?
I'm quite sure I crossed the line there, but I don't want to step on any toes or anything.
You don't have to step on toes, but I just want you to tell me what you want me to refer
to you as.
Dr. Howell.
Well, I met you in Bombay in 75, yes.
I was driving around in my Rolls Royce back in those days.
Okay, right.
That makes perfect sense to me, but what am I going to call you?
And when I get ready to write up the show description and there's a big section of you
and people want to know who you are, what do I call you?
You're probably being like two young little eager schoolboys.
We actually were back in those days.
Two young little eager schoolboys.
My mom and my mother used to cook us some nice rice dishes.
Are you listening to me, sir?
We never eat rice.
You're not eating rice.

Dr. Oh, it's just Jabber Babber.
Dr. He's just Jabber Babber.
He's doing his own show.
And what we've got to do here is...
Dr. We're going to have to give him a name.
Bombay Talking.
Bombay Talking?
He was that woman who always calls in the back.
Dr. Talking?
The woman that always calls?
The lady, you know, you're talking to.
Dr. Sarah.
That's Sarah.
She hasn't called and asked a question in a long time.
Spoken to Bob.
Dr. It's an incredible, intense microwave radiation.
You're talking about the supernova.


created these mutant mosquitoes that are distracting me.
Are you saying that the callers are just like mutant mosquitoes buzzing around our heads?
I'm going to go and eat now.
I'm going to call back later.
Okay, tell me what we're going to call you.
What's your name when you call back?
And what are you going to eat?
And what are you going to eat?
Tell us what you ate and what your name is.
His name is...
That guy calls in every week and he jabbers and babbers and says this unbelievable stuff.
And then I never get his name.
He never leaves his name.
Well, they like to be coy, these callers.
So now I can't tell his fans who he is.
He's got thousands of fans on this show.
And they want to know who he is.
And he won't ever tell me.
This is a bit...
That's nice.
Yes, little Tridzee Barnstable.
Are you down there in the caller pool and found out that we drained the water?
His particular contact information.
That's an insistence.
See, I had to describe the scenario for you before it made sense, right?
It didn't...
It was just an analogous...
I mean, a gelatinous...
A heaving gelatinous mass.
A protoplasmic blob.
An amorphous mass of protoplasm.
A horrible oozing heap belching up from the abyss of time's balance.
The blubbery blobber snob monster.
That's awful.
The loathsome, pulsating, expanding bubble bug.
Why can't they be a nice show?
The wretched blob.
Just cover you like a warm blob.
Ectoplasmic extrusion.
A loathsome, flapping, slapping, semi-liquid mass of...
When I told the cop I was high from smelling herbs and spiders...
He just looked at me funny.
Those seven herbs and spices make the colonel's chicken extra finger-lickin'.
Now you know why colonel's chicken was so good all those years.
The trick of picking a chicken is picking what chicken to pick.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
I've got to pull myself together.
Here's a fiddle.
Take this fiddle and diddle it.
Well, every fiddle...
It wasn't supposed to do that.
It wasn't supposed to do that.
It wasn't supposed to do that.
It takes a giant to hold down prices.
This is the part where the paint goes down to the styrofoam.
Giant.
The giant prices were...
At giant value.
Killed by the...
Yes.
Giant styrofoam.
By the giant comet that came and deflated all our store...
But then we were saved by the giant rocket.
The rocket crew that went to deflect the comet.
Yes.
In DeflectCon 6.
That's why the enormous asteroid...
The Hal just called it...
6-7-4-1-2.
SelectCon 6.
Otherwise known as the planet Gazobus,
never struck the Earth amid ships as prophesied by the now forgotten great hardyfarian called in 1272 A.D.
Are they like the Davidsons that you guys were talking about?
The Neanderthals, the humans, and the John Davidsons.
Oh, well, no.
It wasn't John Davidsons.
It was the Denisovians.
The Davidsons.
Yeah.
They were an extinct group of hominids.
Yeah, that's right.
John Davidsons.
Each one of them was named Dennis, and that's why they were called that.
The Denisovians.
The mysterious group.
Neither the Neanderthals or a Cro-Magnon, but the declined to state on the census form.
Oh, on the paperwork.
Yeah, right.
So one doesn't really understand.
But it's one of the mysteries of science.
So, you know, it's funny how these young kids nowadays,
they're finding out that they put a bob head on something,
and all of a sudden they get some attention.
Boy, if I could just...
I'd show them.
You notice that these young children, that they find a bob head and they put it on something,
and they notice they're getting attention.
They don't know why.
They just know that this face, this pipe, these dots...
Where did they get that sticker to begin with?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a power to provide...
Who's enabling this crime against culture, against civilization and decency?
Well, I would have to admit that the Church of the Subgenius has been an enabler of certain,
shall we say, less than desirable...
Are you referring to Stang's War on God?
Is that still going on?
Well, not necessarily God, but let's put gods in there.
Yeah, but...
War on gods.
War on gods.
War on gods.
War on gods.





It was announced several cycles ago.
It's not really going all that well.
But...
It's better to have a war on people.
Everybody does that.
That's because it's popular.
I mean, people go where it's popular, right?
I wish I had a big giant finger on my finger.
It used to be you could buy one.
When I was a kid, we could get a giant finger for your finger for just a nickel.
I remember that, but it was surely after your youth, more like in your young manhood, that these big fake fingers appeared.
Well, remember the big wax fingers you could buy when you were a kid?
Do you remember the toy called Six Finger?
Sure.
I thought that might be what you were referring to.
An extra finger.
Six Finger, Six Finger, man alive.
How did I ever get along with five?
Those wax fingers, I was always amazed at how teeny they were.
Weren't they a nickel?
I'm thinking of the wax Coke bottles.
Six Finger costs a lot more than some Coke bottle, man.
And the tiny Coke bottles are made out of wax, and there was maybe a droplet of something in there.
Maybe you could remind me what else was so good about Six Finger.
You opened it up and it had a special compartment where you could store things inside your finger.
It had a special compartment.
You could put your joint.
You could put your weed in.
Wow, my ballpoint pen is in my huge swollen fake looking finger.
Plus, some Six Fingers could shoot.
It had a little dart you'd put in there.
Spryling.
Now we're getting into James Bond territory.
And, of course, you had some Six Fingers that could scratch and itch.
It appears that you have hurt your finger, Mr. Bond.
I hope the condition is not painful.
You could use your Six Finger to pick your...
...nose at school.
You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's noses.
But your Six Finger can.
Ew, I don't want to touch it now.
Your Six Finger can pick your friend's noses.
It's all contaminated plastic.
How many of those units did they sell?
What an absurd toy.
With everything else you can get, who needs a big fake...
Let me see if the internet has recorded the volume of units of selling it.
Well, does it have...
Yeah, because they say everything.
...have you...
Everything's there.
Have you looked up Six Finger on it?
I'm going to look up number of Six Fingers sold.
Total number of Six Fingers sold.
He's the man.
The man with the finger touch.
Oop, I accidentally typed sucks finger.
Oh, come on.
Well, there, look at all these lucabritious images you've called up.
Boiling up from the benthic bottom of the internet.
And then there are...
Six Finger.
Fingerlings, the six-inch fish.
Fingerlings, the motion picture.
Ah, yes.
I'll never forget the sadness, the pathos, the tragedy.
On Her Majesty's Secret Service,
Mrs. James Bond was assassinated by Bluffold.
That vile villain.
That was so sad.
I quit watching James Bond after that.
Yeah, it was Diana Riggs.
She got killed at the end of the movie.
No one saw that coming except people who'd read the book.
Yeah.
Back when they had some connection, however remote, to the original book.
Oh, yeah.
But that's just the way it is in the future.
Which movie was that?
The Diana Riggs dies?
It's the On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
Right, right, right.
The least popular of all the James Bond movies.
The only one with George.
Right, that's right.


who actually did knew a bad job,
but everybody just hated the movie.
Yeah, true.

And also, I mean, that's like saying,
you know, it's like the guy who
stood in for
Ringo Starr
on the Australian tour.
I mean, imagine the pressure that comes
Somebody wants the real thing
and you're the fake thing.
That's, you know...
He did a good job, too.
But nobody would give him any slack.
Look, man.
From PR News in Washington, I'm best known for intimate, spontaneous film style known as cinema verite.
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon tested positive for the deadly virus.
This is PR News in Washington.
Thank you, Lee Murr, for PR News in Washington.
Wow, Princess Wee, you can hear that.
Yeah, I can hear that. There's quite a bit of bleed over.
I don't suppose there's any reason to put on background music because they'll just fight with each other.
Yes.
We're in an unusual situation here.
Oh, here I'll explain it to Lonesome Cowboy Dave at the same time.
This doesn't have to do with malfeasance in orifice.
This has to do with something much grander.
It has to do with tool-fashioning monkeys and monkey factories.
And what's to make us the top rung of genetic evolution that we think, because monkeys have tools?
Well, we weren't asking you.
We were about to explain to you.
Well, that's better.
I have.
I have a question.
Listen closely over your phone.
Can you hear background music?
No.
Aha.
It's too subtle.
I can definitely hear it in our headphones.
Oh, yes, I can hear it.
I should explain to our listeners and to Dave.
There's a band in the next room in this radio station.
They're setting up.
I guess they're going to play live on the following.
Show or shows.
Right.
That's lovely.
We used to do that.
And I'm glad people are doing that.
Oh, yeah.
Gays.
Gays.
Every five years, it seems like there's a resurrection.
You're doing life.
Yeah.
Well, you guys used to do it every.
I mean, every ESO show.
Swamp radio was.
Have you had your guitar in the station?
We even had you in the station, not just your guitar, even your body, such as it is.
Yes.
It's a.
It's a place.
Sometimes the place is packed with idle tarry.
I mean, he's.
Sometimes.
Miscreant.
Anyway, I've had people occasionally refer to the hour of slack as a podcast.
And we also do that.
But primarily, this is an actual radio show done in an actual radio station, not a podcast
where you pay a company thousands of dollars to put your party.
What does it do?
Iron Rabas?

But it's
not torture financially.
It's not a good thing.
Well, you know, the really cool thing about.
Hz is that each time you disagrees with something for the one one's own advantage, the audio
is in the K cookbook instead of in the Bang
lockbox.
in the background.
Let's see what that does.
Now, I can hear that.
If you just play a little.
Yes, I can hear that in the background.
Whoa.
I think I better be careful
when I play in the background.
Yeah, really.
There's somewhere in that.
Whenever I hear my voice mixed in.
Then you really worry.
Yeah, you have to be ready.
Is the delay dump on?
Uh-oh, what am I going to say next?
Well, that's what sounds like
some kind of hyperbole,
a delay dump if you're slowing down somehow.
Yes, the delay dump is.
So in case some...
There we go.
Now do you hear real music?
I don't want to use a bad word,
but are these the guys
who used to call themselves
the Dwarf Mounties?
Like the Canadian Royal Police?
No.
Okay.
I don't think so.
Sounds like somebody's
gargling with mercury.
You know, Princess,
we're not going to know
what this sounds like
until we get home and play it back.
That is true.
Because we're picking up
that band's bass and drums
through our stomachs
and not our ears.
That's true.
I sure feel the vibrations
quite loudly.
Well, the rest of the listeners...
The rest of the listeners just...
They know more than we do.
That's all I can say.
Well, I don't think
they...
There's this ambience
of some sort of
lugubrious,
tummy, tummy, tummy sounds
like a little gargling baby
in the background
with maybe a huge foreskin
and like a forehead
the size of one of those
mollusk heads
they used to call them.
All macrocephalic.
I don't know that I would have
described it exactly
in those times,
but yeah, sure.
Well, you were the one
who brought up the monkeys
and said you were going
to explain to me
why we think we're so superior
as subgenites,
even regular,
normal,
pinks and so forth
that we actually...
Well, that brings me back
to the question of hipsters.
There was a lad on...
Well, or an old man
or somebody
on the Scrub Genius
members-only forum
on the internet
who posed the question,
what exactly is a hipster anyway?
And I jumped in
and answered it very quickly
off the top of my head.
I said, basically,
that's what dumb normals
call smarter normals.
But the other subgeniuses
were really upset about that
because they did not...
Not identify.
The other subgenius...
Quite a few other subgeniuses
got in to say,
well, a hipster is a person
who does this or does that.
It's a poser.
You know, they...
And the more they described it...
You're like Kerouac now, though.
You're just like Kerouac.
You're like...
Bad beatniks, man.
They're not really as cool as...
No, that wasn't the Kerouac voice.
The Kerouac voice was...
Well...
The hippies are nothing but
a bunch of abnormal people
who think somehow
they're as good as beatniks.
That's close, right?
Well, there were many definitions
of hipster,
and they were all really,
really negative names,
which I eventually read them all,
and I thought,
well, that's funny.
All these people
have just described most of us.
I mean, let's face it, man.
Hipsters are the only people
who even use the word hipster.
If you're calling somebody else a hipster...
Well, what...
Let me put it this way.
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you're wearing a tattoo,
don't call somebody else a hipster to me.
You know what I'm saying?
You know what you're saying?
No, I'm saying...
No, I'm saying...
No, you're saying...
I look down on the hipsters
because I'm more hip than a hipster.
It was basically what they were all saying.
Hey, hipsters are so unhip
compared to myself,
my honorable self.
I'm far different.
I'm not trendy like these hipsters.
I'm much cooler than a hipster.
Yeah, right.
At least they don't have
congenital syphilis of the brain.
I was going to sing it right then.
No, no, you sang it last...
You sang it last week, Dave.
Did I ever sing it a week ago?
You sang it last week.
Oh, yeah.
And you forgot the words.
You forgot the words repeatedly,
just like you always do.
All the world leaders
got one thing in common.
All the world leaders
one thing the same.
All the world leaders got...
All the leaders got...
Leaders got...
Leaders got congenital syphilis of the brain.
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
And you hear,
you hear a little...
Yeah, I already said that, too, didn't I?
Yeah.
Yes, it's quite a catchy little ditty.
Oh, it was another song.
And then I started talking about that song.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Dave, you're just too...
You're too creative for your own good, man.
Your creativity is just smashing
your other creativity.
It gets in the way of your creativity.
You're so creative.
Well, it's two things in a vacuum,
so they're bound to come barred.
That's about it.
Let's test to please law, you know?
The brain of the subgenius...
Two brain atoms colliding inside of a deep void.
Those collisions we call the thoughts of the subgenius.
If only you could read any thoughts.
If anyone could really have any thoughts,
as well as...
Instead of these constant meanderings
of, like, backward notions
and really, really stupid things you don't care about.
Well, that's just...
I thought swag would take care of that for me.
The nature of...
The nature of human thought is
you're kind of thinking of one thing,
but you're also thinking of 40 other things
kind of simultaneously
that may or may not connect
with the main thing you're thinking about.
And if you get real drunk,
you probably shouldn't try to tell everybody
your complicated thoughts.
Because they'll go all over which way.
And then when the subgeniuses go,
hey, you say I'm drunk,
that's when you shouldn't get butthurt.
That's when you should go,
you're right.
I guess I am.
I must have been.
I guess I'm not as big a...
I guess I'm not as big a hipster
as I thought I was.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, gosh.
Oh, golly me.
Oh, golly gee.
Well, you said...
I think that movements are all, like,
created by the media
to try and entertain people
and make them think of, like,
what you said before.
They're better than somebody else
because of some sort of person
who can acrimoniously...
to describe another person's behavior
or looks and stuff like that.
You can kill the chair.
Well, anybody can make fun of anybody else,
but how many people can really
make fun of themselves right?
That's the real...
That's what separates
the monkeys from the chimps,
you might say.
Well, nothing separates any of us
except for our physiques.
Well, the tail is one thing
that separates them.
The monkey from a chimp.
The pail.
I remember the tails of the pail.
You weren't allowed to play the barone
in Dublin in certain days.
I forget if it was 22 or whatever.
No, you're talking about
a different kind of pail, right?
Six-fisted tails of Connie.
I was listening to some of those today.
Dave, do you think you could make it
to the X-Day event this summer,
first week of July?
If we...
If we pay for your gas
and give you some grass?
I'm trying to arrange the vacation time.
I may be able to arrange the vacation time.
Because then you could be...
At least the minor appearance
because of everything I've missed
for so many years.
Well, they didn't miss you.
Like one really exciting day.
Well, you know,
because there's a band
that only exists once a year
at X-Day,
and it's a different band each year,
slightly.
It almost always has
Reverend Angry Larry
and Priestess Pisces
and Suds.
And sometimes it has Philo.
We'll have Philo this time.
And so he'll be the loudest.
And he'll be the only one to listen to.
And he'll let you know that.
But yeah,
and it's always called
Six-Fisted Tails of Connie
or More-Fisted Tails of Connie
or some variation on...
The big question is,
is it tails or tails?
Tails with an I
or tails with an E?
Suds writes it down
as tails with an E,
like stories of Connie.
And I always write it down
as fisted tails
and causing me to envision
Connie with a long tail,
monkey tail with a fist
at the end of it.
That you can spit Bob
upside the head with.
Right.
You know, if he frocks
before breakfast.
And so that's a...
There's one church schism
right there.
Actually,
Suds and I have both been
trying to hammer out
two or three new
Bob song collections.
It's been years
since we collected
the hymns that I play
on this show
every month or two
when a new one comes in.
They've really stacked up
for a long time.
I've been playing
some of the old ones
bit by bit
as my way of deciding
whether I like them or not still.
There are a few
I decided not to play.
Those won't be on the albums.
But then there's others
that I've...
I played too many times
that I didn't know
because I didn't remember.
Like Dave singing
his same song
two weeks in a row.
We're all getting old.
For all I know,
we said every word
we said tonight
last week.
How would we know?
Yeah.
That's quite a common phenomenon.
Did you happen to remember
what we were talking about
before that?
Yeah.
We were talking about
this great movie
called Kung Fury.
Friends,
this movie,
you can't see this movie
Kung Fury.
in theaters yet.
It was a...
It was a crowdfunded
short film.
It's 30 minutes long
and it's been finished.
And if you get on your YouTube
and type in
Kung Fury,
there may be an incomplete
early version,
but the finished
30-minute version...
I know that you all love
that movie Iron Sky,
and this is a lot like
Iron Sky,
but try to
envision this
three times as crazy.
He's not exaggerating either.
No.
It has Nazis.
It has dinosaurs.
It has robots.
It has Kung Fu Nazis.
And honestly,
it's...
It has Kung Fu Nazis?
Yeah.
Kung Fury is the name of it.
Kung Fury.
It's done in the style
of 1980s movies
and TV shows.
Very, very heavily
80s oriented.
And it's...
Hitler is the villain.
He does some Kung Fu,
but he's not as good
as the hero,
Kung Fury.
But by the end
of this movie,
Kung Fury has been...
He's joined up...
I'm going to go ahead
and give a spoiler.
Oh, do you?
He's fighting the...
He has to go back in time
to stop Hitler.
We all do that
at one point or another.
This guy goes back in time
to fight Hitler
and Hitler kills him,
but then his friends come along.
And his friends...
The friends that he's gathered
include two barbarian Vikings
with names like Barbariana
and their friend Thor,
the God of Thunder,
who really is a god.
He's about 100 feet tall
and has a giant magic hammer
and looks kind of...
He doesn't look like
the Marvel Thor.
He looks more like Odin,
his father.
Only he has two eyes.
And...
Sometimes mispronounced
will can.
Oh, and a Tyrannosaurus
becomes his friend.
He rather...
Kung Fury rides a Tyrannosaurus.
And the Tyrannosaurus
is the friend
of his...
Of Kung Fury's cop partner,
Triceratop,
who is a police officer
with a triceratops head.
Yes.
The head of a ceratopsian.
That is very...
See?
That is very 80s-C right there.
That is very...
It's too much.
It's bulldada as heck.
It's bold surrealism.
Absolutely.
It's too crazy for Hollywood,
for any single Hollywood executive
to ever put an okay on.
And it's that much better
than anything you'll be seeing
in theaters all summer long.
Kung Fury, friends.
And thanks to the subgeniuses
who helped crowdsource
this show.
Thank you.
Thank you.




There's a Reverend Brandy online
who brought this to our attention.
That was the person who was...
Well, I think Reverend Brandy said,
I funded that,
but I think they meant
they funded part of it.
Well, not the original urinator,
the first one.
The urinator.
I'll be back.
Again.
Urinator two.
I have to come back soon.
Sooner than that.
Oh, well.
Well, I don't want to go there.
You do remember the subgenius anthem,
don't you?
Huh? What?
You understand the subgenius anthem.
That also happened in a past
that doesn't exist anymore.
Well, I did,
but it's still on the thread.
You're talking about the song
called Subgenius Anthem
by Lonesome Cowboy Dave, right?
See, see, swineyard.
Well, people can hear that song
if they look at subgenius.com
and look for the downloadable songs.
Or if they have eardrums.
Yeah.
Yeah, if both.
Well, you actually have to have both.
You can now download
all of our more recent albums
from the last 10 years.
We're working on releasing
to the internet
the previous 20 years
of cassette albums.
Some called egregious.
Yeah, the subgenius anthem
by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
You know, we've never gotten
the perfect version of it,
but there's a pretty good version
on Songs of X Day.
And one of those box songs.
Like a well-thought-out salad.
No, actually, it was recorded
at the Beachland,
but I think it was recorded by Regis,
so it doesn't sound as bad
as the ones that were recorded
just by me.
Oh, man, that cat was the worst
Canadian actor in the world.
Regis?
No, this is a different Regis.
A different Regis.
I thought it did, you know,
the cartoon, you know,
cartoons of Hamill and so forth.
And then he got in trouble,
somehow, I guess, in Texas
because you're supposed to do that
or something.
Well, they were going to have
another one of those
Mohammed cartoon festivals
in Phoenix this weekend.
Did anybody get killed?
Freedom of the press
and they have, like,
poo-poo on them.
No, they must not have
because I looked at the news
and they would have been
gloating on that.
They were hoping, you know,
whenever you have a
Draw Mohammed contest,
you're hoping there's going
to be bloodshed.
That's the whole reason
to have one.
Of course, that's the whole reason
to have it.
But you can say it's
for the First Amendment
if you have one.
You can have a pair of teeth.
Right.
Or if you don't have
a good deviator
or a septum,
sometimes you don't
think of how they get.
And if you don't like
the bloodshed,
that means that you're
following Sharia law.
Mm-hmm.
If you don't like
the bloodshed
that comes with
the Draw Mohammed
cartoon contest,
then you're Sharia.
You better not go to Oklahoma
because they've got a law
against Sharia law
in Oklahoma.
That's right.
And Kansas, Texas.
Because they're afraid.
They are definitely afraid
that Muslims,
academics are going to come
and take over Oklahoma,
the most beautiful land
in the world,
the most valuable.
How can the ISIS people
resist conquering Oklahoma
and such beautiful cities?
Shining Tulsa,
renowned Oklahoma City,
Norman, home of the normals.
You know, I mean,
it's like a heavenly,
heavenly place,
a has that in the law.
Now, you know,
there's 솔직히 no Mitte,
or ebony is,

And I mean,
there are in dose,
sadly,


to put a lot of ie
into their health care,
but for you,
after Rihanna's death
to Henry Frank,



sh 싶idity that.?
well um the armpits of america the savage mind of the country's interior as puzzling evidence
called it is where we come from man that's where the truest subgeniuses are bred if you're the
only goth in glenrose texas if you're the only punk in mccrory arkansas and i know both of those
people you are the subgenius that's where that's where it is forged in the crucible of redneckery
the redneck subgenius is the truest subject doctors for bob from little rock arkansas
they almost single-handedly destroyed the church they were so so smart alecky but they
that's the real subgeniuses now most of them have sold out and gone pink now you know they wouldn't
play in a bob
you know they wouldn't play in a bob

i think one of them would uh gordon x would probably love to do a doctor subgenius band
again but most of the other ones but they look at that's what that was kids stuff you know childish
stuff they're big now mr television yeah they're big oh they're on tv now huh television even the
i mean the guy with the expanding breast syndrome like you like to sit down and interview and all
the sudden he gets a big huge pair of d-cups he's just like what's going on i tell you i don't know
what's going on i honestly cannot tell if what we're hearing in the background princess we
is the band setting up in the other room or the cd in the background it's a chaotic miasma
there are gargoyles in the basement there are gargoyles in your mind
there's footery of foot and things of other kinds
oh yeah man
that's not you i mean those liquid evacuations are you doing that i'm not doing that i'm yes
anius or anias subgenius that's hard to say without making it sound dirty
what was that great movie where the science fiction writer told his his class to give you
add anus to the end of the name like you would be princess we anus and i would be ivan anus
uh yeah gentlemen broncos
gentlemen broncos
oh that's another good movie i would fit this one good guys
of those shows where we i really had no idea whether it was good bad indifferent
i can't i don't even know where the people here i've got the headphones turned up all the way
it's gonna be tough that will burn out again


deaf and Dr. Sinister.
That happens a lot.
He comes in and puts headphones on.
He yanks them off real fast.
So he doesn't end up like me.
Yep.
Parachomonias and full of overtures.
Huh?
Well, you know, in my case, it's...
Oh, yeah.
Malthusian. What does that mean?
Old.
It's Malthusian, right?
No, I didn't say that.
Old man.
Is that what Malthusian is in this?
Or is that a form of...
What is that?
I forgot.
I'll let you look that one up
on your Wikipedia on your smartphone
real quick. That's what Filer would do.
Well, when you used to
fall into a slumber in the arms of
Morpheus, that used to mean you were
taking a nap.
Now it just means, you know, you're drinking too much
rotten juices and you're over, you know,
overage or overweight, whichever
one comes first.
And that's why, you know,
I think...
You're blowing up the trains right now.
Not here, anyway. But somewhere in Antarctica.
I know what's going on, man.
Because, you know,
I know what's going on
out there.
We know an old shut-in.
She's a relative of Princess Wee's.
She has
no other friend besides
Princess Wee
because she's a hateful, old
Christian nut.
And none of her
other relatives will...
can listen to her rambling.
Princess Wee is so full of the power of good
that she listens.
And I got to overhear this lady explain to Princess Wee.
I'm not ever going to get on one of them trains
because there's people that throws rocks
right through the windshields of the trains
and kills everybody.
And I won't get on an airplane because
there's boys that sit on the ground
and point green lasers into the eyes
of the jet plane pilots
and it makes all the planes crash.
So I'm no idiot.
I'm not going to get on no plane or no train.
The sad thing is
this lady is never going...
She wasn't going to get on a plane or a train anyway.
She's never going to leave that horrible little
town she lives in.
She's never...
She doesn't even know how to drive.
She doesn't know how to work.
She knows how to pray.
And she's not going to get on that plane
and she's not going to get on that train
but she's going to pray.
And that's going to fix everything.
Sooner or later.
Well, that's why it's positive.
Are you upset, Princess Wee,
because this might get back to her?
Oh, no, I actually wasn't.
I was going to tell you all about Malthusianism.
Oh.
Yes, it's a school of ideas
derived from the political-economic
thought of the Reverend
Thomas Robert Malthus
as laid out in his 1798
writings, an essay on
the principle of population.
It has to do with unchecked population
growth, its exponential,
while the growth of the food supply
was expected to be arithmetical.
And so you see,
Malthus believed that there would be
two types of checks that could then
reduce the population,
returning it to a more sustainable level.
Isn't that interesting?
I've turned off
all the background music.
Oh, so now we have
the pure bleed.
The pure bleed from the next-door studio.
Yes.
You see, luckily, I don't think
any of the consumers out there,
even the vast wasteland, can smell it.
It's just not in their
pure nostril.
Well, in that case, when
the next show comes on, we can go
in that room and scream as loud as we can
for an hour, right?
Then it won't make any difference.
Anyway, it doesn't make any difference
because this is the end of our
Slack number 1,520.
Oh, it's too bad.
I just thought.
I was trying to monitor the show
in the other room as loud as you could.
I can't seem to get anyone out.

I'm trying to keep them out in their space.
Right.
In October, around Halloween,
will be the 30th anniversary
of the Hour of Slack.
We first started broadcasting
at a station in Dallas
that's not really there anymore
in October
of 1985.
Before most of you were born,
before most of you were
even a glint, before your daddies
were a glint in their granddaddy's eyes
because...
Because I was your granddaddy.
How about that?
Yeah.
Well, anyway, so if you need to know more about the Church of the Subgenius and our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, the high avatar of Slack and sales, you can go to subgenius.com.
Or you can write to us for free information, but you won't get very much.
Not for free.
Right.
P.O. Box.
And now I'm going to fade Dave out and me out and everyone out.
Fade Dave?
Like in a previous formula, like in a guy's trap, like these three of our basis hitlers from the future.
We can definitely hear that band in the background.
Can you hear it majorly?
Well, anyway.
Yeah.
Friends, here's another long lost tune by Reverend Max Slack of merry old England, I believe.
And, uh, yes.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I would have met you off the train.
I didn't come on the train.
Off the bus then.
I didn't come on the bus either.
So how did you get here then?
Basically, there was this little dot, right?
And the dot went bang.
And the bang expanded.
So I was getting retREAMED.
lemons
orange

that's not a fowl in here, the detail on that animation is not the same anymore.
That's it.
It's the end of the world
It's okay
It's the end of the world
Celebrate
It's the end of the world
We can all escape into outer space
And start again
It's the end of the world
It's okay
It's the end of the world
Celebrate
It's the end of the world
We can all escape into outer space
And start again
It's the end of the world
It's okay
It's the end of the world
Celebrate
It's the end of the world
We can all escape into outer space
And start again
It's the end of the world
It's okay
It's the end of the world
Celebrate
It's the end of the world
We can all escape into outer space
And start again
It's the end of the world
It's okay
It's the end of the world
Celebrate
It's the end of the world
It's okay
Celebrate
It's the end of the world
It's the end of the world
It's the end of the world
We can all escape into outer space and start again
Anyway.
Friends, here's another long-lost tune by Reverend Max Slack of merry old England, I believe.
And, uh, yes.
Well, that was just a completely ruinous attempt.
And now, is it dead air, or what's happening?
Yeah, um, no.
It's just dead air.
No, it's not dead because of that band in the other room.
Oh, well, uh, but it is WCSB 89.3.
Right.
In Cleveland.
I know that.
I know that.
That is a thing that I know.
Well, that's what they all say.
Yes, well.
Well, my question is, where is track seven on this CD?
That's the strangest thing I ever saw.
I'm gonna stop this whole thing.
I'm gonna pop this little booger out.
This is, again, the visible show.
That is hour of Slack number 15 to 1520 background.
And it says it only has...
S...
Six tracks on it.
And a six track would be...
Let's just see if it is...
From PR News in Washington, best known...
Yeah, we already played that.
Well, that's just the strangest...
...more intimate, spontaneous film style known as cinema verite.
Yeah, there we go.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon tested positive for the deadly virus.
This is PR News in Washington.
And then that's it.
They're supposed to be...
You see, like...
Oh.
This whole song that follows there.
Well, that's okay.
I can cut that into the internet version.
You sure can.
Cleveland audiences here at WCSB Cleveland,
you got to hear another one of those screw-ups on the hour of Slack
that by the time the internet listeners,
which outnumber you by the billions...
It'll sound just slick as snot on a door handle.
How about that?
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Well, I'm moving out of the way.
I don't have anything to play.
Well, yeah, I do.
I'll just turn this guy's background music up.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.

I can't believe this is what it is.
I can't believe this is what it is.
I can't believe this is what it is.
