1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
PR news in Washington. Unclutching pillows loaded on buses.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,380
Lance Armstrong has been charged in connection with the killings of Shiite Muslims in Mexico.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,680
Hundreds of Jewish settlers in Cancun alone were ordered to evacuate hotels and other residences.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,200
Many were hanged, others were shot.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,140
The BBC's bad.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,180
Saddam Hussein has added more than a minute to his overall Tour de France lead during a difficult mountain stage in southern Niger.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,100
He says children in Niger died before reaching PR news.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,380
There's just a week to go in the race and Saddam now leads his nearest rival by two minutes and 46 seconds.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,960
A criminal case has been filed against PR news, Washington.

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,800
You can kill a man by shoving an ice pick into the base of his...

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,880
Now, break it up.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,100
I've been afraid a lot of times in my life.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,900
Good, but I didn't know the real meaning of fear.

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,480
Until...

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,480
Until I kissed...

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,040
The self-genius.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,820
Power of...

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:03,580
What?

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,440
Oh, no.

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,880
The hospice of St. Bernard stands beat up on the Alpine Italy.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,020
Famed for their keen monastery, St. Bernard dogs lose their way through the path.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,280
Sheriff, come on.

23
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,940
Opie!

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,460
You wouldn't chew my paw?

25
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,880
Oh, don't worry, Opie.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,520
I don't need any other...

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,140
Welcome to Monsanto's plastic future.

28
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,020
Constructed entirely of plastic.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,740
Made of plastic.

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,520
Hardly unnatural material appears in anything.

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,080
The future.

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,760
Financed by Monsanto.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,180
The almost unlimited flexibility of plastic.

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,120
Gracious living and convenience.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,640
And convenience.

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,880
The future.

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,920
Welcome to Thot.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,320
Thot.

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,720
Thot.

40
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,080
Thot.

41
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:04,900
Thought at www.thought.org. I'm a young shepherd, a charmer, and a warrior, a scheming, vengeful

42
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,820
murderer. Welcome to Thought. My pleasure. And the rest is history. I want the whole world listening

43
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,400
to a grinning imbecile that comes at you and will say anything and do anything and smile anything to

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,700
get your money. And I talk about money. Maybe you can understand people that don't get it. People

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,900
that don't get it. Idiots out there with your mentality that's been sucked on. And I'm not

46
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,220
gonna bother to say it again. You're an expert. I didn't do a PhD at Stanford University. I'm

47
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,340
addressing my remarks and have a worldwide network to talk to morons. Now all you that love me get

48
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,400
on love me love me love me love me. Ladies and gentlemen, here is something you should know if

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,920
you ever suffer from the sudden pain of pain. Don't miss out on a big turd full of flavor.

50
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,900
An exciting treat to eat every morning.

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,120
In 1953,

52
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,880
while working on amateur experimental television of building yourself a TV,

53
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,600
he stepped into a puddle of water and suddenly was transported into a spiritual realm.

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,020
what we call his immaculation, The divine immaculation of Bob.

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:24,600
At which point the spirit of this alien space god, millions of years old, calling himself Jehovah 1,

56
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,880
entered Bob and took him on as his own descendant.

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,880
and informed Bob as his new prophet that for thousands of years,

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,360
this monster alien had been masquerading as the one true God,

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,400
causing people to do all kinds of ridiculous things

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,680
just to win a bet with some other God it was dealing with.

61
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,800
And it was time to really cash in on all this.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,360
And he told Bob that since time began, there has been a conspiracy,

63
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,140
a conspiracy not of clever, manipulating rich guys,

64
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,940
although there are enough of those as well,

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,160
but a conspiracy of the plain, ordinary, garden-variety, normal people

66
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,100
against all weirdos.

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,680
And I don't mean just the weirdos that wear antlers on their heads at Starwood.

68
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm talking about anybody who's slightly weird

69
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,740
is facing a conspiracy of the normals.

70
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,660
And the sad thing about that is, it's not even a clever,

71
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,900
if it was a clever conspiracy, maybe we could fight it.

72
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,120
But it doesn't even matter.

73
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,320
No, it is a conspiracy.

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,760
Dear Mother, I am writing you this letter on the 5th of May.

75
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,040
I know that you're so confused with every habit.

76
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,140
Please do not heart to surviving.

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,180
Mama, America is a trash or nothing.

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,980
For besides homomikas, they also mass-produce automobiles and radios and your son, Bob.

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
The drive and the dream has become a reality.

80
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,120
He has turned plastic into concert homikas and claritinas.

81
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,840
And though it sounds unbelievable,

82
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,700
Bob

83
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,560
makes almost half the harmonic mangas in the world.

84
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,340
Ah, yes, dear friends, and praise that man Bob and his great harmonikies.

85
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,780
This is Hour of Slack, number 1059.

86
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,220
With a lot of...

87
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,780
This is one of those shows that...

88
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,100
We've been really busy, and I gotta admit, I just threw it together.

89
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,960
And often, those are the best.

90
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,940
There's a lot of Fernanda Nende-Lee-Murr, which we have already just heard.

91
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,560
And a lot of Reverend Norell Preff's cut-ups.

92
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,780
Those two cut-ups.

93
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,380
There's some recordings from Starwood Festival of 2005,

94
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,380
and I think Winterstar of this year.

95
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,600
And a little bit of Radio Synesthesia, but mostly...

96
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:54,940
Oh!

97
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,640
Oh, and some puzzling evidence radio show from KPFA in San Francisco.

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,940
Praise Bob.

99
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,420
And, oh, also we have a little bit of music from an ancient subgenius album

100
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,380
called The Hairs in Bob's Ears.

101
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,000
And I think we'll start off with this song called Slack Talk by Cud.

102
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,200
Cud.

103
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,300
Cud.

104
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,400
Cud.

105
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,740
Cud.

106
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,700
Cud.

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,800
Cud.

108
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:24,900
Cud.

109
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


110
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


111
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


112
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


113
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


114
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


115
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


116
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


117
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


118
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


119
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


120
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


121
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


122
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


123
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


124
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


125
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


126
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


127
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


128
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


129
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


130
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,900


131
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,380
Cud.

132
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,660
Cud.

133
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,220
Cud. Cud.

134
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,180
Cud.

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,560
Cud.

136
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:34,680
Cud.

137
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,260
Cud.

138
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,620
Cud.

139
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,700
Cud.

140
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:40,820
Cud.

141
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,160
Cud.

142
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,860
Cud.

143
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,320
Cud.

144
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,340
Cud.

145
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,380
Cud.

146
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,380


147
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,380


148
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,980
Cud.

149
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,600
Cud.

150
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:48,760
Cud.

151
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,620
Cud.

152
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,440
Cud.

153
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,000
People say slack and I guess that's true

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,880
The best thing probably isn't just this good news

155
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,440
If all my eyes are just my eyes

156
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't mean I'm meaning a snuggly

157
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,480
I'm not a snuggly

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,960
Slack time

159
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,000
Slack time

160
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,600
Slack time

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,320
There's a time to be tight

162
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,700
There's a time to be slack

163
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,820
And that's the time tonight

164
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,980
There's a time to be tight

165
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,320
There's a time to be slack

166
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,500
And that's the time tonight

167
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,780
Slack time

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,540
Slack time

169
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,500
Slack time

170
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,200
Slack time

171
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,040
Let him in, Archie

172
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,380
Would you like some beer?

173
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,880
Well, I had planned to wait until the morning

174
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,600
But if you insist

175
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,800
Here you are

176
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,280
You know, the most significant

177
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,660
Proposed national legislation

178
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,180
Is representative Rush Holt

179
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,040
Who is a Democrat from New Jersey

180
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,480
His voter confidence

181
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,380
And his accessibility

182
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
Bill HR 550

183
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,460
Would require the use

184
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,920
Of voter verified paper records

185
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,640
And audits

186
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,480
Would also prohibit

187
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,380
The use of under-

188
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,180
Or dance like a chick

189
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,360
Software, flatware, and tableware

190
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
And wireless communication devices

191
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,400
Used in today's high-tech

192
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,200
Republican-hacked voting system

193
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,080
What was that?

194
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,460
Working for Satan

195
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,740
Working for Satan again?

196
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,440
What?

197
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,020
What?

198
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,740
Satan?

199
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,980
No

200
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, no

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,260
Not working for Satan

202
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,100
Yeah, what happened is

203
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,700
You've invoked the spirit of Aunt Bertha

204
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,400
Who will always be around

205
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,580
If Satan is around

206
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,800
She's right behind him

207
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,220
With a rolling pin

208
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,300
Running after him

209
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,140
When you play with Satan

210
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,700
You play with fire

211
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,180
Man, shut up, you old bag

212
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,280
Oh, Billy

213
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,520
How can you say that?

214
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,460
It makes Jesus' heart

215
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,840
Weep tears of blood

216
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,800
Grandma, slow it

217
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,200
Can't get up when you can't get up

218
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,140
Jesus' heart

219
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,760
I ripped Jesus' heart

220
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,340
Out of his bloody chest

221
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,180
It was only a harmless seance

222
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,100
You say

223
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,060
A fun game at the Ouija board

224
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,260
Or a harmless party

225
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,440
That's what it starts at

226
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,780
It's just a fun Ouija board

227
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,100
Game

228
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,520
And then all of a sudden

229
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,300
Somebody loses an eye

230
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,740
And

231
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,860
Billy

232
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,140
Thousands of people

233
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,260
Innocently play

234
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,600
With occult fire

235
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Having no idea

236
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,980
How badly

237
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,060
They can

238
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,340
Wait, I had to work hard

239
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,040
For that eye

240
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,240
Nine months of preparation

241
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,300
Now I want you

242
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,200
To sit down on the porch

243
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,420
And learn the multiplication table

244
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,600
While I rummage

245
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,700
Through my retina

246
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,100
And I'm insecure

247
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,420
For those

248
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,100
One Jesus

249
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,800
One Jesus

250
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,860
Three Jesus

251
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,340
Three Jesus

252
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,400
Four Jesus

253
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,060
Four Jesus

254
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,220
Help me Jesus

255
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,980
Help me soff through this wooden leg

256
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,340
Jesus

257
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,360
Help me Jesus

258
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,940
I gotta leg by leg

259
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,860
I gotta burn it

260
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,080
Cause it's not on fire

261
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,840
My petal of contagious

262
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,140
And you gotta saw this leg right off Jesus

263
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,580
Saw the leg

264
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,600
Suffering the state of combustion

265
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,420
Saw the leg Jesus

266
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,480
Someone give me assistance

267
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,100
Hey, this sounds like geek love

268
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,100
Jesus is sawing assistance right now

269
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,040
He's sawing logs

270
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,940
Jesus, get up off the couch

271
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,760
Which dog is this?

272
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:23,760


273
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:23,760


274
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:23,760


275
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:23,760


276
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
I'm a bee

277
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,340
I've got it

278
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:42,660
Just throw thevid

279
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:42,660


280
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,520
This, this is no us

281
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,540
I've got no

282
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,940
Batch several

283
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,180
Gogos

284
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,180


285
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,520
V night

286
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,320
The cadets with the animals back.

287
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,000
What's happening?

288
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,660
That's right, gonna hit them.

289
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,280
That's, that's a huge hole.

290
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,080
Transcendent is the word I'm looking for, yes.

291
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,400
I'm going to make you a proposition.

292
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,880
You'll be fed, clothed, and housed.

293
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,360
A show to gratify your curiosity.

294
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,660
Ladies and gentlemen, look at Baltimore.

295
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,100
Baltimore, the eighth wonder of the world.

296
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,080
Okay, we do have to go with the first one we heard, which was a letter that was called.

297
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,940
Sorry, Connie.

298
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,220
Congratulations, Connie, you're a winner.

299
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,880
You have 24 hours from now to play your incredible creamery.

300
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,500
Connie, experience Ireland, Connie, you're a winner.

301
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,580
Yeah, 4,550.

302
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,800
No, we're not sending you there.

303
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,620
We're sending you to this beautiful dead kelp.

304
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,000
Kelp Beach.

305
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,240
Yeah, you're welcome.

306
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,360
Spin, Connie.

307
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,540
Well, you got a bankrupt, so.

308
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,900
We're paying no attention to what you're saying either.

309
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,180
Sorry.

310
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,900
Oh, sorry.

311
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,920
Sorry, Connie.

312
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,420
Friends, that was a little cut-up there by Reverend Maynard Brainard.

313
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,300
Before that, we heard lots of cut-ups by Fernanda Nandy-Lemur.

314
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
And some show from Puzzling Evidence.

315
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,000
At KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philo Drummond.

316
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,720
Going on there about Aunt Bertha versus Jesus.

317
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,040
A little bit more of that coming up.

318
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:40,080
I wanted to mention, however, that there is a new subgenius magazine out.

319
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,360
I wanted to do a quick review.

320
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,440
It's from the Cuigibo Adult Library.

321
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,800
Actually, you could say this was the 30th issue of Cuigibo.

322
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,640
The Great Subgenius.

323
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,060
The Great Subgenius zine.

324
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,800
An actual printed zine.

325
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,220
Although this issue, which came out just for X-Day.

326
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,060
It was a nine X-Day memorial issue.

327
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:08,340
This has the title of The Southpaw Self-Pleasure.

328
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,080
Now, Princess Wee, settle down there.

329
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,320
Editor Chris Lee put this thing together with the help of the other Cuigibians.

330
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:20,920
Michael.

331
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:21,620
Michael.

332
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:21,760
Michael.

333
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,800
The Dark Angel and so forth.

334
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,440
It has a preview of our new book, The Bobliographon.

335
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,480
Page 3 Girl is always featured.

336
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,980
This issue, Page 3 Girl, is Priestess Pisces.

337
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,700
We got a lot of attention on Hour of Slack number 1057.

338
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,340
And rightfully so.

339
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,780
There was this one spoilsport who just thought she was terrible.

340
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,460
Because she wasn't exactly on.

341
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,880
On key, I guess.

342
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,380
Sometimes with the musicians.

343
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,660
They were all guessing each other's key.

344
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,740
Considering that they were improvising.

345
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,140
It was great.

346
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,980
Anyway, friends.

347
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,740
There's some news about the devotionals.

348
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,180
X-Day eyewitness materials here.

349
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,720
A lot of photos.

350
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,180
And for people who are interested in the behind the scenes.

351
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,720
Not just the dogma of the subgenius church.

352
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,360
Which is described in our books and online.

353
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,740
But this is more like the gossip mag.

354
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,880
And there's even some poetry in here.

355
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,340
Poetry about X-Day by Reverend Magdalene.

356
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,060
Reverend Magdalene, by the way, is in financial straits.

357
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,760
And you might want to look at the information on subgenius.com.

358
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,480
About Reverend Magdalene's ongoing custody case problems.

359
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,880
If you look at the news part.

360
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,180
Or my old.

361
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,200
News.

362
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,220
Blog thing.

363
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,720
Anyway.

364
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,240
Let's.

365
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,680
Enough.

366
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,840
I should.

367
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,260
I should give the address.

368
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,960
I suppose.

369
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,540
If one needed to.

370
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,140
Get more information about the South.

371
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,060
How would I get one?

372
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,540
The South.

373
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,400
Self.

374
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,760
Self.

375
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,320
Reverend Stang.

376
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,060
Pleasure.

377
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,880
You would.

378
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,380
Would be to check out.

379
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,260
Cuijibo Cartel.

380
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,840
At.

381
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,580
This is a short address.

382
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,460
18 West Main.

383
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:20,980
Greenfield.

384
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,780
Indiana.

385
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,060
That's 18 West Main.

386
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,620
Greenfield.

387
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,700
Indiana.

388
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,640
I've been there.

389
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,460
And the zip is 46140.

390
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,680
That is the address friends of one of the coolest subgenius bachelor pads.

391
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,460
That I've ever been.

392
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,860
Has its own brewery.

393
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,360
And the world's largest collection of Simpsons toys and memorabilia.

394
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,560
Just close your eyes.

395
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,260
And imagine.

396
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,500
Being.

397
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,560
In the coolest geek out.

398
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,300
Bachelor pad.

399
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,280
You can imagine.

400
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,400
That's the Cuijibo Cartel Clinch.

401
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
They're in beautiful Greenfield.

402
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,840
Indiana.

403
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,780
Oh yes.

404
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:04,520


405
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,160
Well anyway.

406
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,720
Back to.

407
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,920
Did you have anything to add about that?

408
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,700
No.

409
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,100
I think you really covered it very, very well.

410
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,820
Reverend Stang.

411
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,360
Friends.

412
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,100
We're still recovering from Starwood and the big pagan festival.

413
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,140
That.

414
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,240
That.

415
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,240


416
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,240


417
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,240


418
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,240


419
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,240


420
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,240


421
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,240


422
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,240


423
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,240


424
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,580
That happens around here.

425
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,800
And also X-Day.

426
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,660
We'll have more X-Day shows coming up.

427
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:33,140
But we thought we'd take a break with this particular divine madness.

428
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,660
Oh yes.

429
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,220
Yeah.

430
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,400
Yes, I said.

431
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,180
Yes.

432
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,440
Oh yes.

433
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,560
You know Robert Philpin has a weird Bible.

434
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,020
Yeah.

435
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,780
He's making fun.

436
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,780
Ever known of that?

437
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,800
Does it sit by the Bible?

438
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,400
It's kind of a weird looking Bible.

439
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,360
Yeah, it's got a zipper around it.

440
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,600
And apparently he's editing it.

441
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,020
Yeah.

442
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,440
Like he's been through the process of editing the Bible since his show started.

443
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,780
Bob's Bible.

444
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,360
Bob's Bible.

445
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,340
Bitch.

446
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:09,420
Let me say right here that it is even dangerous to ask a Holy Spirit filled person to prophesy over you.

447
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,340
It is?

448
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,020
But why?

449
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,040
Because this reduces the gifts of the Spirit to private fortune telling.

450
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:26,920
And however sincere the child of God may be, they may attract to themselves another spirit if they disobey God in the proper use of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.

451
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,560
The church is here.

452
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,780
I want to show you the way.

453
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,260
Here comes a train load of the Holy Spirit into our giant depot.

454
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,800
What holy alliances.

455
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,000
The elders of Mary.

456
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,200
Moab and Midian approached Balaam with the reward of the divination.

457
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,560
A likely story.

458
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,520
And that can be found in Numbers 22.

459
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,620
Chapter 22.

460
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,860
Wasn't Balaam the prophet who spoke with his ass?

461
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,420
Balaam's ass was the most prolific of all speaking asses.

462
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,740
The Lord allowed the ass of Balaam to speak.

463
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,660
As it were.

464
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,540
They were not.

465
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,840
But Balaam was the most prolific of all speaking asses.

466
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,180
And the same way that Little Big Man's horse spoke to him on the morning of the Custer Massacre.

467
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,080
I am the prophet.

468
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:19,960
I am the prophet.

469
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,120
The anti-massacre by Arlo Guthrie?

470
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:34,700
No, this was the Washtenaw River Massacre of the Indians by the 7th Cavalry under General Custer.

471
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,160
Well, this fellow said that his horse turned around and spoke to him and said,

472
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,580
Get the hell out of here.

473
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,260
And he rode out.

474
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,420
And he was not massacred with the rest.

475
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,000
That horse got wise at the right moment.

476
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,460
Well, if it happens to the Christian Balaam and his ass, why can't it happen to an Injun with his gods and a horse?

477
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,560
Yes, why not?

478
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,300
That's what I want to know.

479
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,080
Why not an African Yoruba cult?

480
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,840
Well, you see, because Jesus is the one true Lord.

481
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,860
That's not the only incident of animals talking to people in times of stress.

482
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,660
Their heathen gods are sacrilegious enemies.

483
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,060
During World War I.

484
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,760
Whichcraft.

485
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,880
There was a similar incident.

486
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,720
Power of the Devil.

487
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,360
Where animals spoke to soldiers before a parade.

488
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,280
And all of his enemies were hurt.

489
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,580
Lay it on down.

490
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,340
Yeah.

491
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,040
But why go into it?

492
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's just say that Fido sitting by the doggy door is smarter than you think.

493
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,920
Is Puzzler intentionally only taunting me with his antipodes?

494
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,240
Did you say Filo was sitting by the doggy door?

495
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,180
No, Fido, not Filo.

496
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,320
Filo means love.

497
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,120
Is there even a guy in that room?

498
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,020
But Fido means faithfulness.

499
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,280
Yes.

500
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,040
Sometimes I wonder if all this election is just a joke.

501
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,040


502
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,040


503
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,420
You know what, do you think that these electronic equipment doesn't, like, cause our humanity

504
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,040
to deteriorate?

505
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,060
Too late?

506
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,580
Or are we done?

507
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,920
Yeah, it is too late.

508
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,960
But, I mean, you know, it's still something to wonder about.

509
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,740
Not that I'm going to quit, but, you know, it does make you think, well maybe I should

510
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,680
go out and take a walk.

511
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,500
I remember trees.

512
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,740
It's actually psic...

513
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,540
Dirt and trees are psychedelic enough.

514
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,020
If you've either developed this proto-awareness or if you've developed this psychological

515
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,080
killed enough brain cells.

516
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,720
Either one. Hardly any

517
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,200
difference really at that level.

518
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,120
Give thanks to Bob

519
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,940
our eternal

520
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,780
hope and praise me

521
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,460
to Irwin, New Jersey's

522
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,160
Pope. We're fickle

523
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,720
and free and we

524
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,420
don't make no fuss

525
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,160
at the Church of the

526
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,680
Subgenius.

527
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,000
Bob, hear our plea.

528
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,020
We beseech

529
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,980
thee, help us

530
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,400
be free from

531
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,800
normalcy. We're

532
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,180
dumb, devoted

533
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,580
and dumb, talk back.

534
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,520
Please give us an

535
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,000
hour of slack.

536
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,940
J.R.

537
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,400
Bob Dobbs never

538
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,840
fails. He's the living

539
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,580
slack master of

540
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,660
mystic sales.

541
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,500
All you conspiracy doofs,

542
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,720
just you wait

543
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,160
till July the 5th

544
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,000
19...

545
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,660
1998.

546
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,440
Invaders will come

547
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,940
from Planet X

548
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,160
bringing gifts of money,

549
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,260
time control and great sex.

550
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,480
A new age will dawn

551
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,900
and we'll never look back.

552
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,260
We'll be busy

553
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,440
enjoying our slack.

554
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,920
Everybody now.

555
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,500
Bob, hear our plea.

556
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,020
We beseech thee,

557
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,260
help us be free

558
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,520
from normalcy.

559
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,440
We're dumb, devoted

560
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,120
and dumb, talk back.

561
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,700
Please give us an hour

562
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,580
of slack.

563
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,360
He's the bridge between

564
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,040
heaven and earth

565
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,100
and hell.

566
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,660
He's the Patriot

567
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,500
Saint of Sales.

568
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,240
Yeah, he's doing well.

569
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,940
Mediareten's are normal,

570
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,980
send things beware.

571
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,800
The slack master

572
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,440
sells everywhere.

573
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,640
Give thanks to Bob.

574
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,900
Give thanks to Bob.

575
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,320
Our eternal hope.

576
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,540
And praise me to her

577
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,740
when you jersey's go.

578
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,860
We're fickle and free

579
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,380
and we don't make no fuss

580
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,960
at the church of the subgenius.

581
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,060
Everybody now.

582
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,080
Give thanks to Bob.

583
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,540
Our eternal hope.

584
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,700
And praise me to her

585
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,980
when you jersey's go.

586
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,220
We're fickle and free

587
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,780
and we don't make no fuss.

588
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,400
At the church of the subgenius.

589
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,580
Give thanks to Bob.

590
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,280
Our eternal hope.

591
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,600
And praise me to her

592
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,920
when you jersey's go.

593
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,160
We're fickle and free

594
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,200
and we don't make no fuss

595
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,860
at the church of the subgenius.

596
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,360
Give thanks to Bob.

597
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,300
Our eternal hope.

598
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,120
And praise me to her

599
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,200
when you jersey's go.

600
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
We're fickle and free

601
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,800
and we don't make no fuss.

602
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,860
At the church of the subgenius.

603
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:12,860


604
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:12,940
It's Peki modify

605
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


606
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


607
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


608
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


609
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


610
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


611
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


612
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


613
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


614
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


615
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:12,940


616
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,460
Don't doubt on me

617
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,800
Down on me

618
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,200
Down on me

619
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,500
On me

620
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,880
Going down on me

621
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,020
On me

622
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,060
Going down on me

623
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,200
On me

624
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,320
Go down on me

625
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,920
Down on me

626
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:34,620


627
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,960
To make every day more enjoyable, make every day more enjoyable.

628
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,100
To make every day refreshing, delicious, lively, and long-lasting,

629
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,920
make every day full-bodied, healthful, refreshing, and delicious.

630
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,600
Dysfunctional homes.

631
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,820
Loss of dysfunctional homes.

632
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,460
Loss of our dysfunctional homes.

633
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,660
Let me give you a hyphen, hyphen, hyphen, hyphen, hyphen, hyphen, hyphen sample.

634
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,000
Let me below you, below you.

635
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,840
Coming down.

636
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,940
And you feel the earth shake.

637
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,840
And you see the body parts vibrating, vibrating.

638
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,360
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

639
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,500
Caverns open up and body parts open up.

640
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,020
What's going on here, brother?

641
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,300
I don't mind, actually.

642
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,320
Idiot.

643
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,440
Yeah, Albert E. Moove-o.

644
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,920
I'll be back, I'll be back.

645
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:31,260
Typical subgenius behavior is defined as anything other than typical subgenius behavior.

646
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,540
Pinkness.

647
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,080
Normality, however, reveals.

648
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,660
It reveals itself.

649
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,300
Like a scorpion under a black light.

650
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,640
Whereas subgenius genes tend to remain hidden.

651
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,760
They have to remain hidden.

652
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,480
Because of centuries of oppression.

653
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,140
Real oppression by real normals.

654
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:57,820
And there are those subgeniuses who could, number one, acknowledge that they are an endangered species.

655
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,880
And number two, recognize that discretion is the better part of valor.

656
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,000
And hiding is smart.

657
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,760
And the ones who didn't hide their subgenitals simply were killed or died.

658
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,540
And my subgenius friends out here, you do not have to be on all the time.

659
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,200
You do not have to be a weirdo and expressing your abnormality every minute.

660
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,100
In fact, the ones that are doing that may not be subgeniuses at all.

661
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,520
You have to get into the upper secret hierarchy where we have the good drugs.

662
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,660
You have to be able to shut up.

663
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,020
You don't have to be able to talk real good, Bob.

664
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,060
You have to be able to shut up and do the non-glamorous stuff.

665
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,300
Not as an act of submission to the chosen ones like me who would really appreciate it anyway.

666
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,280
But as proof that when the hammer comes down, you won't blab.

667
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,320
Like the subgenius who wants to be weird and do like, be a good proud subgenius or pagan or whatever.

668
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,220
And goes up to the cop and goes,

669
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:04,980
Officer, I'm not a good subgenius.

670
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,660
No, sir, I'm in a mail-order mind-control sex UFO cult.

671
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,740
Would you like to smoke some Tibetan Habifrock Zimpilops with me?

672
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:21,560
Well, that officer might be a fellow subgenius, but he'll probably arrest you anyway to protect the church.

673
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,520
Constipation can be a problem for anyone, even doctors.

674
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,520
Well, a majority of the doctors we heard from had this to say.

675
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,940
Have a real cigarette.

676
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,440
Have a real cigarette

677
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,100
Have a real cigarette

678
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,620
Have a real cigarette

679
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,240
a real cigarette

680
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,760
a real cigarette

681
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,720
All right.

682
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,380
Hi.

683
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:29,760
What?

684
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,060
Ever have some monkeys?

685
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,440
Yeah.

686
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:31,920
I did.

687
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,740
That's right.

688
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,520
Pardon me.

689
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,680
What is it, please?

690
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,920
There was a dead monkey.

691
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,640
Thank you.

692
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,880
So long.

693
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,620
Yeah.

694
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,760
Thanks.

695
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,680
Are we, then, but parasites on the skin of the...

696
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,680
Is the human race a virus?

697
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,940
A lot of people think maybe we should just quit reproducing this.

698
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:56,040
The human race is an infestation of the planet Earth.

699
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,260
Well, will our host soon be dipped?

700
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,680
That is exactly what we think is coming.

701
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:09,200
But I have hope, friends, along with the sacred hate of the church.

702
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,820
I don't trust the conspiracy or the conspiracy theorists.

703
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,840
I only trust Bob and his revealed truth, no matter how stupid it is.

704
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:25,880
If you see a red light and Bob says it's green, thwart, man.

705
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,260
Don't trust yourself.

706
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,140
Trust Bob.

707
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:35,600
Now, the way we've dealt with this political problem, you know, we really don't want to...

708
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,180
We want the Republicans' money, too.

709
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,520
It's that simple.

710
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,620
And they...

711
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,000
As Bob said...

712
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,260
They may be pink, but their money is green.

713
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,080
Actually, L. Ron Hubbard said that to Bob, but Bob took credit for it.

714
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,960
Bob hates the silly pink scissors.

715
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:06,680
But what Bob created was a political party, so to speak, called patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism.

716
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,480
Which is summed up in that every yard is a kingdom.

717
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,720
Every child and dog a serf.

718
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,440
Every checkbook a queendom.

719
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:20,060
And the idea is that you rise above the conspiracy's news.

720
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,440
That's one thing you can do is quit watching the news.

721
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,300
You inflate.

722
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,160
Rise up.

723
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,360
Blow yourself up and float high above the middle of the road so you can look down on all of them

724
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,380
and see how silly they all look.

725
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:39,500
If you study chimpanzees or teach kindergarten for a week, suddenly politics will all make sense.

726
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:44,740
お願いします

727
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:52,780
You're gonna make those kids do Hmph.

728
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:02,880
You're gonna make those kids do Hmph behind closed doors without people's permission.

729
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:02,880


730
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:02,880


731
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:02,880


732
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:02,920
That's what the police do, right?

733
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,780
We're doing that right now.

734
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:03,800
That's why I said this.

735
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:03,800


736
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:03,800


737
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,700
You still don't understand?

738
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:04,740


739
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,280
I already ended up with fouricia in 2014.

740
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,220
I think I play with my Skills squirrels.

741
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,220


742
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,480
I care about what the hell I sing.

743
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,920
I love singing.

744
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,200
Doing what?

745
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,820
don't i i i i i i i i i would not argue for the pro-life position

746
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,280
because you don't know i mean because you freaking don't know

747
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,000
i mean it freaking freaking freaking don't know well

748
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,280
well well there's just too much that you don't that you don't know there's just

749
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,460
too much that you don't don't know don't know don't know don't know

750
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,740
abort every black baby in this country abort every black baby in this country

751
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,580
abort every black baby and morally reprehensible tricky tricky tricky

752
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,420
tricky abort the national media

753
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:57,680
The blackness comes forward.

754
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,420
It stares straight into my face.

755
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,180
It smothers me with its ugliness.

756
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,400
It blinds my whole white maze.

757
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:28,800
And then it goes away, and it's just another day.

758
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,460
And I smile at everyone.

759
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,400
But I have to go.

760
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,040
I have little to say.

761
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,860
The blackness is powerful.

762
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,020
It cannot be stopped.

763
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,520
More slow.

764
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,560
As the futility.

765
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,140
Because born.

766
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,180
More evident.

767
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,320
My will to resist.

768
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,060
The tact of the road.

769
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,260
But no one seems to know.

770
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,140
And no one seems to care.

771
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,280
And I want to tell them all.

772
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,320
But I know I mustn't dare.

773
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,420
I know I just have to say it once.

774
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,760
I know of the times.

775
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,600
That have come and gone.

776
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:00,600


777
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,400
As the conditioning Charles Mama starts.

778
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,400


779
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,400


780
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,400


781
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,400


782
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,400


783
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,380
And it's coffee break at ten

784
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,320
And the Broncos got lucky again

785
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,380
And Elway should know the ball more

786
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,460
But it's really all such a bore

787
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,420
The blackness is honest

788
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,920
And as sure as the statist

789
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:46,140
It takes my pristine illusions

790
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,240
Leaves them tarnished, stale, and dull

791
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,580
I know the arguments are good and long

792
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,340
Showing how all it is

793
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,500
I do is wrong

794
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,520
I want to put them out of my mind

795
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,620
For I know what I will find

796
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,660
And every one of your goodness

797
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,560
Is until date

798
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,400
And it's just not stuff

799
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:38,520
You would put on

800
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,860
And it's just not stuff

801
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,760
You would put on

802
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,660
Well, it was possible

803
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,960
That this wall had something

804
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,920
Between my eyes

805
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,500
So let me tell you

806
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,620
The blackness takes over

807
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:16,760
It embeds itself deep in my soul

808
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,880
There's nothing left for me to do

809
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,960
Except acknowledge its complete control

810
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,640
And the hospital bed is flat

811
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,680
And I see the world from my back

812
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,160
And I smile at everyone

813
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,460
At last I finally can laugh

814
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,040
At last I finally can laugh

815
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:54,820
At last I finally can laugh

816
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:09,880
At last I finally can laugh

817
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,840
At last I finally can laugh

818
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,920
At last I finally can laugh

819
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:38,540
At last I finally can laugh

820
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:08,640
At last I finally can laugh

821
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:55,860
At last I finally can laugh

822
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:05,580
At last I finally can laugh

823
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:41,500
At last I finally can laugh

824
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:25,520
At last I finally can laugh

825
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:39,140
At last I finally can laugh

826
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:25,400
At last I finally can laugh

827
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,160
At last I finally can laugh

828
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,360
At last I finally can bet

829
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,240
At last I finally can clean

830
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,220
At last I finally can Axx

831
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:42,720
At last I finally can play

832
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:42,720


833
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:42,720


834
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:42,720


835
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,080
I rejoin the spirit of family

836
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:53,680
I go home a tattoo fromband

837
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:53,880
beaches

838
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,100
How was that ether fraught, Dr. Drummond?

839
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,180
It was like the void of Moab.

840
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,440
Were you linked to the 80 million tribes of the blood of the Lamb of Moab?

841
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,160
Yes, I was spiritually and psychically linked.

842
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,160
Did you forthwith launch that Especial Head?

843
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,280
That Especilene. The head Especilene.

844
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,780
Was it coated with Especilene before you launched it?

845
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,220
It was coated with Vaseline to give it that quick lift off.

846
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,220
Well, I don't know about you, but I use Especilene.

847
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,700
Should I answer this line?

848
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,520
Go right ahead.

849
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:46,420
We have another call. Hopefully they're calling to apply for the free Eternal Salvation Certificates we have to offer you tonight.

850
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,120
Tonight only?

851
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,840
Here on KNO-IN. Tonight only. Just call us here at KNO-IN.

852
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,820
Or if you don't happen to be listening to KNO-IN, if you happen to be watching television,

853
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,200
it's the same thing.

854
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:01,080
If you happen to be driving in your car and you don't have a radio, then please stop.

855
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,800
...of the church of the wretched excess.

856
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,280
Does that have to do with... that doesn't have anything to do with retching, does it?

857
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,760
Good. Could well.

858
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,980
I hate to retch. If you've ever done it, it's really...

859
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,560
It's sort of like squirting upside down.

860
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,100
It's kind of a Shakespearean wretched, he said.

861
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,020
I feel that way sometimes myself.

862
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,940
So, kind of wretched.

863
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,440
That's the hour of slack. We listen to one side of the phone conversation.

864
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,560
I can understand why retching was derived. You know retching was derived from wretched, right?

865
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:39,460
So anyway, the fourth caller will receive, free, at no additional charge, the Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer Disco Soccer Kit,

866
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,020
the Certificate of Absolution from the Church of the Subgenius.

867
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:49,420
This caller makes an excellent point, is that redneck, jello-headed, limey...

868
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,540
Bleep!

869
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,980
I guess, can we say bastard?

870
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,820
Sure, we can say bastard on the phone.

871
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,460
That redneck, low-liming, limey bastard.

872
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:00,680
Low-liming?

873
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,940
Low-liming, yeah. He's not even a full-blown limey.

874
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,060
And what did you say? What was your excellent point?

875
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,920
He has no yet to send DNA or RNA...

876
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,720
He doesn't have Hello Kitty in his heart.

877
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,400
Yeah.

878
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,240
I'm gonna cry. I'm gonna cry right here on the air.

879
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,880
Somebody who doesn't have Hello Kitty in his heart...

880
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,380
I don't know if I can go on.

881
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,720
I don't know if I can go on.

882
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,700
That was an excellent point, though.

883
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,340
I'm gonna let you go now.

884
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:26,820
Thank you.

885
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,320
Thanks for your excellent point.

886
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,700
And, uh...

887
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,440
We have another caller.

888
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,720
Call you later. Bye.

889
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,060
That's right, dear friend.

890
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,900
And, uh, Sterno will take this call.

891
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,660
Uh, unfortunately, we can't, uh, tap the phone callers in.

892
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,660
Most of them are so foul-mouthed that it would be against the law to have them tapped in, so...

893
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,240
That's why we don't take our callers.

894
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,260
But, uh, some of them are... have some grain of humanity and...

895
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,360
Oh, they do. Yeah.

896
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:57,180
Not humanity. Not in the... not in the negative sense. Only in the... in the philosophical sense.

897
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,020
Yes.

898
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,760
And, uh, we... we wouldn't like to imply that any of our listeners were human.

899
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,300
Nor should it be inferred.

900
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,600
That's right. Or... or implicated in any...

901
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,380
So, Dr. Drummond...

902
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,080
Yes... yes, sir.

903
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,800
You would know better than any man here. What... what was Dobbs like before his immaculation?

904
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:19,000
We had a caller ask me that last week, and I... not knowing you were going to be here...

905
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,920
Well, like, in what context? Uh, what was he like?

906
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,840
I mean, that's a fairly broad topic.

907
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:30,540
He was like, uh, like, uh... like a man, and yet like a bear.

908
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,520
Or a bear slapping fish in a stream.

909
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,500
So that was... that was Dobbs.

910
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,400
In the winter, or in the summer.

911
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,340
He was sort of a sea... a man for all seasons. A bear for all seasons.

912
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,800
And... but... but that's a really, uh, uh, philosophical bent on...

913
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,980
...on what Dobbs was like.

914
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,560
...on what Dobbs was like.

915
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,100
Not anything like...

916
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,420
...that the Limey interpreter...

917
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,380
Another... another comment on the Limey interpreters.

918
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,600
...that he can put his lips on her buttocks.

919
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:04,800
Okay.

920
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,220
And she gives him permission to do that.

921
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,140
And makes smooching sounds.

922
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,180
And makes smooching sounds.

923
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,360
And makes smacking... smooching sounds.

924
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,800
While... while the entire Church of the Subgenius hierarchy stands around...

925
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,400
...gawking and laughing...

926
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,300
...having their way with deep... deep-deep-deep prairie squids...

927
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:17,700
...pointing their fingers...

928
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,820
...gawking and laughing...

929
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,100
...and pointing their fingers...

930
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,600
...and laughing...

931
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:21,760
...and gawking...

932
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:21,780
...and gawking...

933
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,420
...and gawking...

934
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:22,940
...and gawking...

935
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,160
...well, it's...

936
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,100
...Englishter.

937
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,400
Well, he's got a lot of gall in him...

938
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,400


939
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,980
...in that letter...

940
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,100
GALL.

941
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,620
...in that company.

942
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,300
This country...

943
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:30,720
Yeah.

944
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,960
This company...

945
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,580
We were hoping that...

946
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,760
This company of countries...

947
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,520
This grand, very bad...

948
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,460
This grand, very bad boy...

949
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,320
...can, uh...

950
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,060
...can deliver...

951
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,840
That was Karen, who lives in Dallas.

952
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,960
And Karen says that he can plant his limey lips right on her buttocks...

953
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:44,960


954
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,960
...for sending us that despicable, childish, puerile, adolescent...

955
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,600
...for sending us that despicable, childish, puerile, adolescent...

956
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,360
Lettuce letters.

957
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,740
But I hope that he wipes his lips off since that lime juice may sting a little.

958
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:06,300
I was hoping that when you hear Dr. Drummond, we could talk about a certain amount of butt kissing.

959
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,040
Because there's no...

960
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,560
That is one of the most requested cuts that we play on.

961
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,160
Is that a normal butt kissing?

962
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:14,740
Yep.

963
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,340
It's a very difficult art to master.

964
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:24,720
One that I've spent years and years to find just the exact distance.

965
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:32,180
The approved distance that would allow you to manifest that butt kissing viewpoint.

966
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,480
Which is so strongly required of American management.

967
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,640
We'll interrupt this diatribe for another comment on the limey bastard.

968
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,900
That the limey bastard has already paid his $20 for salvation and is receiving the material.

969
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,180
Our caller.

970
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:52,720
Wants to know what the cost will be so that we won't send him any more material.

971
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:53,920
We'll save money.

972
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,160
Just think.

973
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,020
Think of what a wonderful thing he's done.

974
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,120
But it's not just money.

975
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,400
I mean it's the cost.

976
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,280
It's the cost.

977
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,440
It's the cost of his slack.

978
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,100
Yeah.

979
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,080
That too.

980
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,600
And so we put a little bit more slack back in the cosmic slack pool.

981
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,120
You know as far as I'm concerned.

982
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,400
We gave it to him.

983
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,200
He rejected it.

984
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,500
And so now he's taunting us.

985
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,180
Instead of giving us the benefit of the doubt.

986
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,400
And realizing up front.

987
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,760
That there was no possible way.

988
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,400
In heck.

989
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:21,020
That we would ever publish such a horrible.

990
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:24,660
Infantile.

991
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,520
That's the word I'm looking for.

992
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,240
Pure isle.

993
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,860
Horrible adolescent.

994
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,240
Sexually fantastic.

995
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,620
Whatever those other things are.

996
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,900
We wouldn't be doing those.

997
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,860
These bestial.

998
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,620
The bestial.

999
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,980
It's a bestial damn magazine.

1000
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,020
It's the best you'll get around here.

1001
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,960
I'll tell you.

1002
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:46,680
You'd better.

1003
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,120
I'm there, but.

1004
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,040
That's the Pauwbucker.

1005
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,980
That's the Pauwbucker coming out in me.

1006
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,860
Because you know I'm an ascended Pauwbucker.

1007
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,360
And that what should give all you Pauwbuckers part.

1008
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,400
That even you two.

1009
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,260
Could possibly become an overman.

1010
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,260
From your lowly status of Pauwbucker.

1011
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,300
Inside the foot of every Pauwbucker.

1012
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,660
Beats the gland of a subgenius.

1013
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,680
Only weighting to be.

1014
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,480
Stifle that radiating.

1015
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:11,980
Massage.

1016
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,400
Overman aura there.

1017
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,000
Follow it.

1018
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,560
Burning me.

1019
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:15,860
Huh.

1020
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,100
Uh huh.

1021
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:16,520
Oh, yes.

1022
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,720
It could be a headache.

1023
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,520
Oh, thanks, Dr. Drummond.

1024
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,960
Anybody got any aspirin?

1025
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,180
A beer?

1026
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,040
A pill?

1027
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:22,580
A pill?

1028
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,200
We were looking for pills all the way up here.

1029
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,900
How much is a bucket of pills in Dallas, anyway?

1030
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,140
They're pretty high in Little Rock.

1031
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:36,440
Well, if you get the kind that have the stuff inside, it's a little bit more than the kind

1032
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,700
that don't have any of the stuff inside.

1033
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:44,220
Oh, the claw-legged, ball-peen, anti-bathtub is full of pills that used to sell down on

1034
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,500
Greenville Avenue, I believe.

1035
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:45,740
Yeah.

1036
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,380
I like Greenville Avenue.

1037
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:46,380


1038
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:46,380


1039
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:46,380


1040
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:46,380


1041
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:46,380


1042
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:46,380


1043
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,340
I like the burlap sign.

1044
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,840
They were cheap several years ago.

1045
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,780
On the north side of the south part of East End there.

1046
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,340
It's kind of on the back side of the west side of that grocery store.

1047
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:07,480
They closed it down now because it got out of hand, especially when they started pushing

1048
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,240
those wigs.

1049
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,500
You know who came in to buy the wigs?

1050
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:16,360
Those insidious gasket wigs that tighten down.

1051
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1052
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1053
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1054
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1055
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1056
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1057
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1058
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1059
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1060
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1061
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1062
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1063
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1064
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,360


1065
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,720
I got it.

1066
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,060
I killed it.

1067
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,020
Killed it with my breath.

1068
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,820
That's why I don't brush my teeth.

1069
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,960
A lot of people have asked me,

1070
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,500
Fido, why don't you brush your teeth?

1071
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,260
It's those wigs.

1072
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,420
You never know.

1073
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,040
They're going to come crawling across a floor, a desk, or whatever,

1074
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,360
and you've got this built-in power that you can utilize.

1075
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,980
It works.

1076
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,220
There's living, dead proof of it right there.

1077
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,340
Living, dead proof.

1078
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,060
Blackboard.

1079
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,280
Blackboard.

1080
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,840
There's a pool of it right there in my hair.

1081
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,400
Adults in hand.

1082
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,420
You'd like that.

1083
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,680
If you're like Bill Clinton, you won't engage in life.

1084
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,460
You'd like to receive something.

1085
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,040
I never engage.

1086
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,580
Laugh, work, vomit.

1087
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,960
I don't even hang on what I breathe.

1088
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,580
I'll sum up.

1089
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,140
Certified pure by the Church of the Subgenius.

1090
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,560
Just send 1295 to Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1091
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,540
People tell me, how's it going?

1092
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,940
7-5-2-1-4.

1093
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:12,900
I say, what?

1094
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,940
How's what going?

1095
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,540
What is it?

1096
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,300
You know, what is the it?

1097
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,660
People say, how you doing?

1098
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,020
Well, I never really thought about how I did it.

1099
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,120
How am I doing it?

1100
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,100
You know, I just did it.

1101
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,280
It just came kind of natural.

1102
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,580
Lightning erupted.

1103
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,080
Dobstown shut down for a weekend when Philo did it.

1104
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,760
Let me tell you a little bit about what happens when Philo does it.

1105
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,720
People say, Philo, how are you?

1106
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,960
You're free by the millions when Philo does it.

1107
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,360
Vinyl melts by the time when Philo does it.

1108
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,360
People say, speakers crackle.

1109
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,260
Old women's beehives melt.

1110
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:52,340
Checked out.

1111
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,580
Checked out.

1112
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,220
You just left.

1113
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,060
Grocery stores.

1114
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:55,580
Cut out.

1115
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,820
You hit the road.

1116
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,560
You just beat feet.

1117
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,800
You just packed it on down the highway.

1118
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,600
You packed it up.

1119
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,980
Rolled it down and shoved it on down the road.

1120
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,340
Rolling the long.

1121
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,060
Kitten natividad squirm.

1122
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,160
Philo does that.

1123
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,300
Yeah, I do a little kitty.

1124
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,780
Yeah, I called her kitty.

1125
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,680
She just knocked P. Wadden out of me one time.

1126
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,820
Now, as we go back to the phone, we find that we have a caller who's ready to pledge.

1127
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,080
She'd like to pledge.

1128
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,020
She'd like to do phylo.

1129
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,980
I can understand that.

1130
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,040
I like to do phylo.

1131
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,840
And I am phylo.

1132
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,940
But it's a hard thing.

1133
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,560
It's a very hard thing to do phylo the right way.

1134
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,500
I've tried it myself.

1135
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,900
I've done it.

1136
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,460
I've done it.

1137
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,440
And I've been there.

1138
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,440
And when I got there, I didn't know what the heck was happening.

1139
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,400
And we're speaking literally, friends.

1140
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,920
So geniuses and geniuses are not innuendo or spouting.

1141
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,020
Dear friends, you may be wondering, what the hell?

1142
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,320
What the hell was all that?

1143
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,880
That was old, old, old stuff from the old, old show.

1144
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,360
Will you play any?

1145
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,760
Will you play any?

1146
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,400
What was that?

1147
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,860
Eventually, we will.

1148
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,500
Increase 31% by just 20%.

1149
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:22,640
What?

1150
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:22,960
What?

1151
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,280
What?

1152
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,560
What?

1153
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,520
Happy birthday, Joe.

1154
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,560
Yes, friends.

1155
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:36,860
What we were hearing there was from the old, old, old hour slack in the olden days on the K&ON station in Dallas.

1156
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,480
Apparently, that was some weekend when I was...

1157
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:51,020
I was out of town and Will O'Dobbs, who handled the phone and the mail order back then, took over as host.

1158
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:57,380
And Dr. Philo Drummond and Sterno Keekhaver were around for some reason.

1159
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,680
And that was a pretty good example of old doctor, the old doctor talking.

1160
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:06,220
Who says the Church of the Subgenius isn't totally relevant to important issues today?

1161
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,680
If that wasn't it, that wasn't it.

1162
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,160
And this, friends, is it.

1163
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,180
The Hour of Slack.

1164
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:22,020
If you want more information about the Church of the Subgenius, the religion of which this program is one of the outreaches,

We'll send you a little booklet or a catalog or something, maybe.

1171
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:56,360
Friends, this show has featured a lot of editing by Norel Preff.

1172
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:00,540
You can get more of his at norelpreff.com.

1173
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,940
That's N-O-R-E-L-P-R-E-F.

1174
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,940
And other editing, a lot of other editing was by...

1175
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,100
Fernande Limar.

1176
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,940
The great...

1177
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,480
cut-up of Idaho Springs, Colorado.

1178
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,340
And so, friends, stay tuned for more.

1179
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,660
And possibly better.

1180
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,880
As Dr. Sinister or somebody...

1181
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,980
More. Better.

1182
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:29,880
Comes in and...

1183
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,940
More. Better.

1184
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,460
Takes over.

1185
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,720
Price Bob.

1186
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,780
Swipe, wipe, wipe out.

1187
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,080
Swipe, wipe, wipe out.

1188
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,740
Swipe, wipe, wipe out.

1189
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,980
Swipe, wipe, wipe out.

1190
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,760
Swipe, wipe, wipe out.

1191
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,120
What?

1192
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,040
Oh, it's...

1193
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,800
Oh, oh, oh.

1194
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,940
Those were...

1195
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,420
Neat.

1196
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:45,700
Guy.

1197
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:45,960
Of.

1198
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,240
No.

1199
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,180
What?

1200
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:47,580
What?

1201
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:47,820
What?

1202
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:47,940
What?

1203
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,340
No.

1204
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,500
Increased 20% by just 31%.

1205
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,960
Hey, toss the phone.

1206
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,760
I want to order a pizza.

1207
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,460
You're high.

1208
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:55,940
Yeah.

1209
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,200
You're high 24 hours a day.

1210
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:58,620
Nice.

1211
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,540
All the time.

1212
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,040
Really?

1213
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:00,920
Yep.

1214
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,260
Yep.

1215
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:03,540


1216
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:03,540


1217
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:03,540


1218
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:03,740


1219
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:03,900
Yep.

1220
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,140
Yep.

1221
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:04,600
Yep.

1222
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:04,780
Yep.

1223
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:04,800
Yep.

1224
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,600
Yeah, you poor jockster.

1225
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,620
Sit down.

1226
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,320
I'll tell you about it.

1227
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,540
Yeah, I got six.

1228
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,180
It's pork chops.

1229
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,420
Hmm, that's funny.

1230
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,220
Oh, seven pork chops.

1231
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,000
Hey, where's that pork chop?

1232
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,520
That's what I came up here to look at.

1233
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,720
Yeah, back there on the bench.

1234
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,300
Well, I'll have a look at it.

1235
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,300
Well...

1236
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,240
Well...

1237
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,380
I'm just gonna look at it.

1238
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:26,780
Boy.

1239
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,220
Funny about that pork chop.

1240
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,060
Okay, here goes the doorbell.

1241
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,020
Better begin to look shy.

1242
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:38,880
Shut up.

1243
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,140
What?

1244
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:39,580
Nothing.

1245
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,220
Not the greatest show on earth.

1246
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,780
Will you play any sound?
