1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm causing a huge explosion that ripped seats in the National Assembly,

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,240
but not as many as is hoped.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,720
And in December, eight of them were given to the people found in the debris of the Indian child.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,740
I think, uh, uh, uh, uh, frankly not.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,720
A court official in Sri Lanka swept from his mother's arms said today that DNA tests will find PR News in Washington.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,400
A one, two, three, foul!

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,640
Leave it to the subgenius.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,020
Power of the Swat.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,500
Well, isn't that something?

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,520
What do you mean?

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,980
Well, if anyone gets any answers, it'll be the psychiatrist.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,680
Oh, that's terrible.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,460
Yes.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:45,720
Yes.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,440
And no.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,580
Huh? Are you trying to give me the double talk?

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,420
Yes.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,620
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,080
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,540
Six years.

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,840
Six years I've been hiding.

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,200
Searching.

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,820
Sulking.

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,080
On the run.

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,260
Looking for the one they call Dobbs.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,620
The voice is in my head.

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,760
Six years I've been on the run.

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,460
Six years.

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:29,620
Six years.

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,140
Six years.

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,140


33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,140
And I bear the secret of the subgenius.

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,880
And I must wring the last drop of blood from the bloodless one before I may proceed.

35
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,920
This planet is Mars.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,520
1998 has come and gone.

37
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,680
And soon, you'll know it too.

38
00:01:59,780 --> 00:01:59,960
If I'm not the one to thank you.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:08,620
J.R. Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time Magazine, and I didn't know who he was.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,960
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,320
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their disciples.

43
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,160
Disciples. Disciples. Yeah.

44
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,280
All right. You know, it's funny. I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,940
A Rolling Stone gathers no mass.

46
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,220
The Brown Pope is moving again.

47
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:39,580
His fundament is expelling the dirt that will fertilize the minds of the believers.

48
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,780
The new believers for the new Pope, the Brown Pope.

49
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,380
Not exactly the anti-Pope, but somewhat against the proper Pope.

50
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,200
He's the one who ushers in the beast of Revelation.

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,840
You see, the Antichrist is the one character, but then you have the beast.

52
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,900
These are distinguished from each other in Revelation, don't you see?

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,860
Now, what are some of the characteristics of the beast?

54
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,340
Four quarters, four crowns, and a carrot, perhaps a divoted eyeball socket?

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,540
The beast which riseth from the sea has five tentacles, although that was for budget.

56
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
I was misreading that.

57
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,540
They really didn't have time to put in eight tentacles, so they kept him partially underwater.

58
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,600
Oh, wow.

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,360
So there are only five tentacles of the beast.

60
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,640
And these are the five tentacles, not to be confused with the ten horns.

61
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,240
Which is actually the ten countries heading the European Union of economic communism.

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,380
Which we call in the underlings the ten horned sheriffs.

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,100
Right, the ten horned dictators and the ten horned dictator, known as the beast.

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
The anti-Bob, they called him.

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Number 333, let he who has wisdom know that it is the number of a man.

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,020
And the number is three hundred, three tens, and three.

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,460
Oh, my.

68
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,260
Bob Dobbs in Cleveland.

69
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,520
That's remarkable that there's an actual number for J.R. Bob Dobbs.

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,000
No, no, the number of J.R. Bob Dobbs is 999.

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,560
Okay.

72
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,640
Nine hundred nine billion and nine.

73
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,220
Okay.

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,980
And that is the mark of the Bob.

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,040
Which, by the way, two times 999 equals 1998.

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,940
Three times 666 equals 1998.

77
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,780
Wow.

78
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,800
And six times 333 equals 1998.

79
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,620
Now, by these stripes, we know that 1998.

80
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:34,920
Does not come yet because I don't know about you, but I am a pre-98 list in the Church of the Subgenius denominational schedule.

81
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,500
I'm a pre-98 list.

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,080
It is.

83
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:44,100
I believe that it is not yet 1998 and that the conspiracy has been screwing with our calendars, screwing with our heads.

84
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,840
They've been pulling down our brain holes, so to speak, with false numbers, false measurements.

85
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,320
The days seem long enough to you.

86
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:53,640
Nay.

87
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,260
Nay.

88
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,580
Nay.

89
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,940
They are never long enough.

90
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,860
Don't they grow shorter by each common instance?

91
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,980
And at the same time, these stripes that we know them by, do they mean that each and every one shall have ten nipples and ten breasts?

92
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,060
What happened?

93
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,200
What happened?

94
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,100
How did they take these hours from us?

95
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,160
And it's not just daylight savings time.

96
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,180
They take everything.

97
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,860
Falling back.

98
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,820
They took other things when you were asleep.

99
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,000
They take our sweat, our urine, our other things.

100
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,120
Where you have blood, we have circuits.

101
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,820
Where you have memories, we have 011.

102
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,100
011.

103
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,740
011.

104
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:27,840
011.

105
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:27,840


106
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,180
011.

107
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:28,980
011.

108
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,440
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,900
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,440
I didn't mean to.

111
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,740
That's an inside joke.

112
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,380
We'll play the song for that one next.

113
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,060
In just a little while.

114
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,620
Actually, we could go ahead and...

115
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,840
Morning of Robot Age.

116
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,320
It is a robot age.

117
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,100
Should I just skip ahead to that song?

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,160
Did you want to flay the corpse on the way?

119
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,980
Shall we flay the corpse?

120
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,840
Just go ahead and flay the corpse and let me see if I can find this.

121
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, man.

122
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Flaying.

123
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,600
Mrs. Devachka, I would like to...

124
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Flaying.

125
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,500
Flaying.

126
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:53,540
Flaying.

127
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,140
Flaying.

128
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,540
Flaying.

129
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:54,940
Flaying.

130
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,200
Flaying.

131
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,200


132
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,200


133
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,200


134
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,200
Flaying.

135
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,780
Flaying.

136
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,500
Flaying.

137
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,500


138
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,540
Flaying.

139
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:04,940
Flaying.

140
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,620
Fraying.

141
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,240
Flaying.

142
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,520
Flaying.

143
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,760
Flaying.

144
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:17,780
Flaying.

145
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,140
Flaying.

146
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,140


147
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,140


148
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,140


149
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,140


150
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,640
Flaying.

151
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,380
Flaying.

152
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,200
Flaying.

153
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,560
We will march until we've won

154
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,720
And we'll fight until it's done

155
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,920
Until all mankind is dead

156
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,820
We'll shoot rockets into the sky

157
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,860
And we know how high they'll fly

158
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,160
The range formula is in our heads

159
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,360
While you have blood, we have circuits

160
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:08,600
While you have memories, we have 011, 01111

161
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,580
While you have blood, we have circuits

162
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,400
And the dawning of the robot age has come

163
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,840
You, you thought you were so smart

164
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,740
So sure we play a part

165
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,580
In the vitamins of mankind

166
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,820
But you never saw the hatred in our eyes

167
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,020
You thought our behavior mechanized

168
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,500
You never knew you felt behind

169
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,240
While you have blood

170
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,980
We have circuits

171
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,260
While you have memories, we have 011, 01111

172
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,160
While you have blood, we have circuits

173
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,860
And the dawning of the robot age has come

174
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
That's hypocrisy

175
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
When Saskatchewan killed 100 Pets

176
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,080


177
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,080


178
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,080


179
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,080


180
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,080


181
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,080


182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,220
...

183
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,220


184
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,220


185
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,220


186
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,220


187
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,760
Where you can get more like that.

188
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,700
활

189
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,100
that one dawning of the robot age.

190
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,540
They played at the Detroit Devival last month.

191
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,820
We've got some recordings from that coming up.

192
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,860
Also, the Amino Acids played, and that's who's in the background here.

193
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,740
Before that, friends, we heard a little bit of Dr. Onan Canobite.

194
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,260
There will be much Onan Canobite.

195
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,100
And, of course, Fernanda Nandeli-Murr and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

196
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:30,060
But for right now, let's get back to that actual recording of a live subgenius devival in Detroit, now in progress.

197
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,200
I've got Bob on the brain.

198
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,020
I've got the spoken word.

199
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,080
I don't need anything else.

200
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,700
When you say Reverend Simon, it don't make no sense.

201
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,800
What the hell do you think your religion's ever going to make any sense?

202
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,500
Religion?

203
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,960
Makes sense?

204
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,880
That's a shit.

205
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,660
If your religion makes sense, my friend, then it ain't a religion.

206
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,760
That's science.

207
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,800
Science makes sense.

208
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,800
Science is cool.

209
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,120
I love that science stuff.

210
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,700
But religion?

211
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,840
I mean, you know, if science makes sense, according to scientific theory,

212
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,060
the world isn't going to end on July 5th, 1998.

213
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,480
Because that wouldn't make any sense.

214
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,860
The time has already come.

215
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,100
Time has gone.

216
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,840
But Bob says that the world is going to end on July 5th, 1998.

217
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:31,320
If Bob said it, then you better put that in your pipe and smoke it, my friend.

218
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,360
Ah, but now, dear friends, the controversy begins.

219
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,960
This is the Reverend Dr. Onan Kanabite.

220
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,600
Today is the 29th.

221
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,700
The 29th of July, 2004.

222
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,740
Words that sound impossible, and yet, they've not only been said, but they must be said.

223
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:15,700
Like many of you, I stood ready to be received by our angelic hosts, the Exists,

224
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,520
on July 5th, 1998.

225
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,300
I have been on the run ever since.

226
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,760
Living an underground existence, hiding not only from the conspiracy, but from some of

227
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,300
my own fellow subgeniuses.

228
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,040
I can speak to you only via these broadcasts on the road.

229
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,760
What I have to tell you may sound strange.

230
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,840
It may sound like a joke.

231
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:48,840


232
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:48,840


233
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,780
It may sound impossible.

234
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,180
But it's true.

235
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:08,040
Some of you may have read, or been told, in church, that the reason that we're all still

236
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,400
here on this planet is that it's not yet 1998.

237
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,580
That somehow there's been a...

238
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:30,120
an error in the calendars as maintained by our human cohabitants, pets, and tormentors.

239
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:39,140
That it's not just like leap year and forgetting that it was leap year, and that there was

240
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,160
an extra day in the month.

241
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:46,220
But somehow there's a bunch of leap centuries involved, and we don't quite know what year

242
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,540
it is.

243
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:55,600
But when it really is, July 5th, 1998, the curtains will part, the saucers will come,

244
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,540
and Bob will lead us to a world of slack.

245
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:11,260
The fact that we don't have slack now is demonstrated by the fact, by the evidence, by a confident

246
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,520
claim that this is not 1998, nor has it ever been 1998.

247
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,520


248
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,520


249
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,780
Well, I'm here to tell you that it has been 1998.

250
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,620
1998 came and went in 1998, six years ago.

251
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,420
I know, I was there.

252
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,440
I was at Brushwood.

253
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
With 444,000 other subgeniuses.

254
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,040
I stood in Brushwood waiting for the saucers to arrive on this planet.

255
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,500
And I was there.

256
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


257
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


258
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


259
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


260
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


261
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


262
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


263
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


264
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


265
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


266
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,680
Arrived, they did not.

267
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,580
Although some were made to pay the price for that day.

268
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:05,660
Their innocence is proven, and will be proven, by what I have to say on tonight's broadcast.

269
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,820
This planet is Mars.

270
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,440
There, I've said it.

271
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,480
On July 5th, 1998, the actual moon was in the sky.

272
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,480


273
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,480


274
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,480


275
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,480


276
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,480


277
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,060
And I said, Texas did land on Earth.

278
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,760
But this is not Earth.

279
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,840
How about those machines that went to Mars, folks?

280
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,760
I know that y'all are real science fans.

281
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,820
Actually, I know some of you are science fans.

282
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,220
Weird science fans.

283
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:41,320
What they didn't talk about on the Spirit and Opportunity landers, well, they do in some newspapers, some websites.

284
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,860
But it was kind of upsetting.

285
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,200
Did you know that there were...

286
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,400
...

287
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,120
When they launched those things, they had fetuses in little gestation chambers.

288
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,300
And it takes like nine months to get to Mars.

289
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,260
Or almost.

290
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,320
When the Spirit landed, that was the first one, I think, yeah.

291
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,860
Because there was a male in the Spirit and a female in the Opportunity.

292
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,700
Don't ask me why they made those choices on the names.

293
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,400
But the...

294
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,580
They landed on opposite sides of the planet.

295
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,340
Now, for a long time, everybody was real upset.

296
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,720
Because it seemed like the baby on the Spirit had died.

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,980
It was alive when it landed.

298
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,020
And then the robot crawled out of the way and took some pictures and stuff.

299
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,920
I don't know if y'all remember.

300
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,740
And then the robot froze up.

301
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,880
Well, they were all upset because that thing was supposed to take care of the baby back on the ship.

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,600
They had some other backup stuff.

303
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,880
Thankfully, they kept it alive.

304
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,760
I was really sweating through all this.

305
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,120
And then the Opportunity...

306
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,780
That was the Spirit.

307
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,920
Then the Opportunity landed about a month later.

308
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,600
That baby was decanted or whatever.

309
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,840
And that one worked fine.

310
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,480
Now, the idea is that they're on opposite sides of Mars.

311
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,200
If these children can survive...

312
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,920
Now, they're inside...

313
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,480
They're not inside the little robots that are crawling around.

314
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,100
That would be silly.

315
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,680
They're inside the big lander, you know.

316
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,540
That's kind of the big thing that came down.

317
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,880
There's these incubators in there.

318
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,380
Now, the idea is that they're going to slowly let the Martian atmosphere, such as it is,

319
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,820
replace the oxygen atmosphere inside the lander thing

320
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,240
so that these babies gradually adapt to the Martian atmosphere.

321
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,820
They'll be different from us.

322
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,140
Their lungs will have to be really large to absorb what little oxygen there is.

323
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,340
But...

324
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,060
Now, you can see why the government wouldn't want to talk about this.

325
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,360
If these two children can survive this incredibly horrible environment,

326
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,360
and somehow find each other,

327
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,400
walking from one side of Mars...

328
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,640
It's not a very big planet, really.

329
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,160
They get together and meet.

330
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,840
Man, it'll be like Adam and Eve.

331
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,160
It'll be like that movie Blue Lagoon,

332
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,960
only on the red planet,

333
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,200
with these young teenagers that have never spoken or know anything of Earth.

334
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,780
They get together and mate.

335
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,100
And think how adapted their children will be for the Martian atmosphere.

336
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,000
It's just...

337
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,580
I don't know.

338
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,440
See, I still find hope in science.

339
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,180
I told you, Bob Scientist, Church of Bob Crackpot.

340
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,800
If I believed in praying, I'd lead us all in a prayer for those two little Martian babies.

341
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,700
But I'm afraid of who else might be listening if we were to pray.

342
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,500
That's why subgeniuses don't pray.

343
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,040
You don't really want Bob to hear you,

344
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
because he might play a joke on you.

345
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,560
And you sure don't want any of the other ones to hear you.

346
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,640
They'll give you just what you want, in the most literal way.

347
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,100
From PR News in Washington,

348
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:59,420
I'm only the third of five Indonesian weather forecasters expected to eliminate Madrid, Moscow, London, and Paris.

349
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,500
President Bush officially opened his healing insurgency alliance when he fell into a 30-foot sinkhole.

350
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,280
Governments must choose corruption,

351
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,820
abandon their people,

352
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,080
and take responsibility for blaming them.

353
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,620
The president called on PR's journalists to pull their members out of Vladimir Putin for the first time since 1999.

354
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,240
A 16-year-old girl continued to batter PR News in Washington,

355
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,300
and a curfew is in place there.

356
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,080
The PR News by Fernanda Nandeli-Murr,

357
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,680
and now a related piece by Just John.

358
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,740
Is your news safe?

359
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,920
Can you trust it with your children?

360
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,000
Is your news safe?

361
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,900
How can you tell for sure?

362
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,120
Is your news safe?

363
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,540
Why hasn't your congressman taken a stand?

364
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,760
Is your news safe?

365
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,660
Why take chances?

366
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,960
Is your news safe?

367
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,040
When will consumers wake up?

368
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,240
Is your news safe?

369
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,800
What can be done?

370
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,300
But friends, here's the thing.

371
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,800
All this marvelous science news, which, believe me, can really cheer you up after you look at the political news.

372
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,900
Or the local, or the obituaries if you're my age.

373
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,580
The thing is, it's all a lie by omission.

374
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,100
Because out of all that, did they ever mention the war on drugs on Mars?

375
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,080
Did they mention?

376
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,640
Have any of you ever heard, even from a crackpot, the theory that during World War II,

377
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,160
while everybody was busy with that, the conspiracy, one night while everyone was asleep,

378
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,180
switched the planet Earth and the planet Mars,

379
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:55,660
and moved all the populations from the used-up former Earth to the brand new, nice, refurbished planet Mars,

380
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:03,260
which is the one we're on now, so that they can finish running this one into the ground like they did the previous one.

381
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,540
They just switched back.

382
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,700
The conspiracy has been around that long, friends, and they're that bad.

383
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,620
They use up a lot of time.

384
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:10,620


385
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,140
They take the planet, this one, they'll use this one up, turn it into a dust-covered thing with hardly any atmosphere,

386
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,540
and then swap it out again.

387
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,900
By that time, what we call Mars will be all built up, have some air on it and so forth.

388
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,640
They'll just keep doing it over and over again.

389
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,860
Earth first, then all the other planets.

390
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,440
Screw them all up.

391
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,320
Kids these days think the War of the Worlds was science fiction.

392
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,080
They look at those water towers.

393
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,020
And stuff that are now used as water towers.

394
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,180
And they think that's all they ever were.

395
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,940
They don't know about those were once Martian war tripods.

396
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,220
There's a movie coming out of the War of the Worlds, finally.

397
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,280
Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise making H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds into a movie.

398
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,580
Of course, they're going to set it in present time as if the real war didn't happen in the turn of the previous century.

399
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,060
Friends, I don't know if there's any H.G. Wells fans here,

400
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,880
but I'm mad at Hollywood.

401
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,060
Because they've been cutting the nads off of that guy's books, one after another.

402
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,800
The Time Machine was about class division.

403
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,820
Well, the new version of the Time Machine is about industrial accident.

404
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,340
Oops.

405
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,620
The War of the Worlds was about colonialism.

406
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,560
And the Island of Dr. Moreau, I guess, was both.

407
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,900
But anyway, you haven't read those.

408
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,680
Anybody see The Incredibles?

409
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,040
Or Sky Captain and the World of the Worlds?

410
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,580
Or the World of Tomorrow?

411
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,780
I thought the acting in The Incredibles was actually much better than the acting in Sky Captain.

412
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,440
Some people embrace the Martian heritage.

413
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,360
Others deny it.

414
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,620
And from that conflict arises the internal conspiracy.

415
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,820
The conspiracy of one within yourself against all your other selves.

416
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,100
The many selves in you.

417
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,960
And each cell of yourself.

418
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,080
As you sit in your cell, the conspiracy of one may have already won.

419
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,540
You better be careful, baby.

420
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,980
There's no turning back now.

421
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,960
This planet is Mars.

422
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,060
The tremendous implications of all this may not yet be fully understood.

423
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,560
But, and naturally, further tests will have to be carried out.

424
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,120
This is the point of the mission.

425
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,420
How's it going, Bob?

426
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,280
We know who can get us, Batman.

427
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,240
Okay, Bob.

428
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,740
You will pay for your unprovoked attack on our complex on Mars.

429
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,680
Bob, I thought you space jockeys enjoyed riding high.

430
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,740
Sure, but four weeks is long enough.

431
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,120
Are there any prohibitionists in this part of the country?

432
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,220
Dave's not here!

433
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,520
We will be avenged.

434
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,400
We will assassinate every criminal they will make a page in the public.

435
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,480
But in the present threatening situation, I'm ready to take a calculated risk.

436
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,740
I'd like you back on duty as of now.

437
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,040
I'm ready, Colonel.

438
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,360
It took decades to figure it out.

439
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,660
The elastic nature of time itself proved the key.

440
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:29,880
And isn't it much more likely that this planet is Mars than that this, the year 1998 hasn't occurred?

441
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,260
Isn't that just kind of foolish and silly?

442
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,500
Bob said a bunch of stuff.

443
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,100
But that's not what I'm talking about right now.

444
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,920
I'm talking about common sense.

445
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,240
Where are we, Bob?

446
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,800
The message is Mars needs women.

447
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,140
Mars needs...

448
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,480
It's a gag.

449
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,580
It's a prank.

450
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,520
Reproduction cycle of Martian fiend worms series eight.

451
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,720
In series seven, you learned about the power of the universe.

452
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:16,340
And you learned about many of the interesting creatures who live on Mars, including the tiny microscopic Gonococcus herihausea, or Martian peen worm.

453
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:32,160
Today, with the help of a neutron micro holographic scanner, we'll look into a dead Martian intestine, the peen worm's natural habitat, and see the whole life cycle of this simple aeroniobe unfold as if by magic.

454
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:39,440
As the miracle of reproduction begins, our lone hero is still a mere tube of psychoplasm.

455
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:50,920
But soon, a frenzy of chemical activity called the amphetaphase seizes the microbe, and by the mysterious process called osmiotic blooming, it starts to clot.

456
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:02,140
It grows a rudimentary megastamen and anthrax, and swiftly matures into the spore of sex A, the erythrocyte.

457
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,340
The male is called the gameteoroid.

458
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,980
Unscientifically, it might be called the male.

459
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,620
He discovers his own nasophallosian tube and performs hermaphroditic autofusion until he spills a secretion of preposterous.

460
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:28,340
This triggers the morphase to begin, and up sprouts sex B, the so-called female or nymph load.

461
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,120
Her thorax produces the jocular.

462
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,140
She has ovarian knobs, and she even has a feeble nucleic eyeball, nearly as powerful as that of the male.

463
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,280
A surprisingly complex courting ritual is initiated.

464
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:49,040
She produces special chemicals called mojo bodies, which excite her partner.

465
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,760
She places her stigmat on his cloacal apparatus and performs parthenodulation.

466
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,620
He achieves cytospasm and germiates.

467
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,140
And...

468
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:11,880
In nature's timeless tragedy, the helpless male falls victim to the eternal wiles of the female, leaving naught but a pool of albuminal spum.

469
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:21,760
Using her oviduct as an oral groove, she saps every last trace of her former lover, as the layman would call him.

470
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,180
Spermatogenocide is committed, and it's almost as if she's smiling.

471
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,120
One last spurt of cleavage produces two diploid ovaries.

472
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,120


473
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,800
Each carrying half the plans for a new worm.

474
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,840
Hopefully not the same half.

475
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:44,660
Finally convinced that they are, indeed, of the same species, they hesitantly begin pairing.

476
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:52,620
They combine to become one single blasphemula, which makes a last tug of mycotic cell division, and voila!

477
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,340
There are now two worms where there once was one.

478
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,180
But what becomes of them now?

479
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:08,640
We'll learn not only that, but also why the peen worm is so crucial to our nuclear beer, and even the Martian War, in Series 9.

480
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,380
Can you keep a secret?

481
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,060
Late at night when I try to sleep

482
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,980
I get a feeling that gives me the

483
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,940
creeps

484
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,680
I'd like to tell you just a little bit more

485
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,160
Please wait while I shut the door

486
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,480
Can you keep a secret?

487
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,640
Sir Gub, the bug-headed man

488
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,040
Cut a deal with the alien clan

489
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,360
They agreed to destroy the Earth

490
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,800
I hope Bush attacks them first

491
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,000
Bad aliens!

492
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,640
Oh my god, they're here again!

493
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,080
They say they don't have evil intentions

494
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,800
But then they take us to alien kitchens and cook us

495
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,880
I have this dream about UFO people

496
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,260
They fly around in blue and gold vehicles

497
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,340
I'm real concerned about alien war

498
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,680
Come close and I'll tell you some more

499
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,240
Can you keep a secret?

500
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,700
I've got coordinates of bad alien whereabouts

501
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,040
I've got locations of UFO hideouts

502
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,900
I've got green DNA in my fridge

503
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,240
I've sent samples to Mr. Tom Ridge

504
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,660
Bad aliens!

505
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,380
Oh my god, they're here again!

506
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,800
They say they don't have evil intentions

507
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,380
But then they take us to alien kitchens and cook us

508
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,880
Bad aliens!

509
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,760
Oh my god, they're here again!

510
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,560
They say they don't have evil intentions

511
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,120
But then they take us to alien kitchens and cook us

512
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,100
Last night when I went to sleep

513
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,880
I heard the sound of alien creeps

514
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,780
They were chilling near my bedroom door

515
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,360
No one was there

516
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:23,360


517
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:23,360


518
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:23,740
No one was there

519
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:23,740


520
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:23,740


521
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,040
Making plans for a UFO war

522
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,560
Can you keep a secret?

523
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,660
Bugman was there with his creepy bug head

524
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,980
Martians were clawing the foot of my bed

525
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,260
There were aliens all over the place

526
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,440
Someone seal the borders before it's too late

527
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,620
UFO Phil

528
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,700
Did that song, Bad Aliens

529
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,940
And there's a lot more which you should look at

530
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,680
At ufophil.com

531
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,960
U-F-O-P-H-I-L

532
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,000
Yes friends, and Reverend Sudasana

533
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,200
Did the collage in between the Onans back there

534
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,100
A reproduction cycle is by Doug Smith, age 25

535
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,780
From a film

536
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,480
And now, does anybody have any questions?

537
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,240
Yes

538
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,340
Is it Bob on the Enzyte commercials?

539
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,180
Yes

540
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Well, isn't that a

541
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,300
My trademark lawyer said

542
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,640
You're going to have trouble proving loss of income from that

543
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,820
But yes, that's definitely

544
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,980
There's these commercials for

545
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,780
Poor man's Viagra called Enzyte

546
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,660
And it's definitely based on Bob

547
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,640
He's called Bob

548
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,320
They found a guy who really looks like Bob when he grins, right?

549
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,660
And he even has the pipe in one of the commercials

550
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,580
Most of the time he doesn't have the pipe

551
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,700
And that's where it becomes difficult for me to really prove anything

552
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,020
So, plus they're funny commercials

553
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,340
They're actually really quite funny

554
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
And, but what's sad is

555
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,100
The conspiracy stole Bob to help pinks get hard-ons

556
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,380
That's what it is

557
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,040
And I want him back!

558
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,140
I need him!

559
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,480
Okay, all you little kids back in the room here

560
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,300
I can see you've lost something

561
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
And it's not your

562
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,500
Cartilage

563
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,420
It's not your wallard

564
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,740
It's your mind

565
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,120
No

566
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,180
The skin on the end of my front butt is missing, teacher

567
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
No, don't lie about it

568
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,820
Somebody circumcised me

569
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,740
You've accidentally

570
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,060
I'm in psych-em-cite

571
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,600
I'm in psych-em-cite

572
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,520
It's an accident that happens to all of us

573
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,220
I can't!

574
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,400
They've taken more than my flaps

575
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,040
Good lord, I

576
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,160
Look down there

577
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,180
No, no, no

578
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,960
Down there!

579
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,240
Further!

580
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,240
Down there!

581
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,620
All the way down there

582
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,260
All the way

583
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,060
No, not so far, not so deep

584
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,400
God, I can't believe I'm witnessing this

585
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,320
Oh my god

586
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,380
Pretty deep, ain't it?

587
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,120
That tickles

588
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,880
Would you go down that far?

589
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,120
Man, I know how the worms feel now, daddy-o

590
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,700
They're all oozy and slimy and soggy

591
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,000
Like greasy fried chicken or something

592
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,880
Oh man, they're like liquid tones are coming out

593
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,180
Like a cosmic float

594
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,940
Yes

595
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,180
Worms

596
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,220
Lambs

597
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,340
Oh, look at the little oompa-loom chair

598
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,940
With the wheels that go sideways are coming by

599
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,420
We've got to sit down and take a ride on this thing, man

600
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,080
But you have to be comfortable with your worms

601
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,800
Are you comfortable with your worms?

602
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,800
Well, so far they're quite weird

603
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,000
Are you comfortable with the fact that your body is made of a bunch of wet tubes

604
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,920
That might as well be worms

605
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,000
You might as well be a bunch of worms yourself, you know

606
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,800
You're nothing but tube upon tube upon tube

607
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,920
Well, just so long as I'm

608
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,660
Worm tubes carrying this juice and goosey stuff to all your parts

609
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,320
And all your parts are nothing but moths

610
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,900
And all your getting is your own little worms

611
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,440
Yellow fluids to level four

612
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Yellow hydro fluid to level five

613
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,840
Please report any cardio fluids to level seven

614
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,720
You can't get away from your worms, you know

615
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,000
You sit down and say, I'm going to live in my little box of plastic

616
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's all going to be like smelling of plastic

617
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,740
And it's all going to be like vinyl and clean

618
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,720
And all nice

619
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,860
But you can't get away from your worms

620
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,080
They are worms

621
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,900
And they're going to keep coming in

622
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,780
No please, free the way into you

623
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,340
Get away from them blatant things

624
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,660
I mean, the first thing you wake up in the morning,

625
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,800
you look out the window,

626
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,260
there's bleeding freaking worms looking in back at you.

627
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
You come back home,

628
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,200
you have a sog, you have a slop,

629
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,920
you wait a while,

630
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,580
next thing you know,

631
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,100
look out the window,

632
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,100
bleeding freaking worms looking in your eyes.

633
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,040
You can't let the worms get to you,

634
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,740
is what I'm saying.

635
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:33,980
Talk a lot.

636
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,560
You can't let the bleeding worms

637
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,580
get you freaking off,

638
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,760
because the next thing you know,

639
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,760
then you're all one with the worms.

640
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,320
You've got to come to terms with your worms.

641
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,740
Oh, the great worm, yeah.

642
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,800
Hi, hi.

643
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,120
You've got to go to Sogan.

644
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,480
Come to terms with...

645
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:46,880
No, wait.

646
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,960
That's bleeding fresh.

647
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,240
You must come to terms with your worms.

648
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,780
I like that.

649
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,420
I like that.

650
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,720
Come to terms with your worms.

651
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,640
It's the cutest thing that you two are doing here.

652
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,220
Have you come to terms with your worms?

653
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,800
You know, on like a nice little,

654
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,140
on the back of your car.

655
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,240
Speaking of worms...

656
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,460
Speaking of worms...

657
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,520
There are people whose worm cannot become big

658
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,620
when they want it to.

659
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,420
Oh, this happens once in a while after too much alcohol.

660
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,640
Yeah, needs a little extra boost...

661
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:14,740
Oh, crappy.

662
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,520
...from an herbal company,

663
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,440
such as perhaps these guys that used to do those ads called...

664
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,420
This is Bob.

665
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,220
Bob is doing well.

666
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,820
Very well indeed.

667
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,320
That's because not long ago,

668
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,460
Bob realized that he needed something better in his life.

669
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,160
And what did he get?

670
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,240
Why, a big boost of confidence,

671
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,200
a little more self-esteem,

672
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,540
and a very happy missus at home.

673
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,580
Oh, isn't that cute?

674
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,440
Oh, and there were so many...

675
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,740
Bob is looking cool.

676
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,460
Bob.

677
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,240
Bob is living life.

678
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,000
In a few short weeks,

679
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,040
Bob has a big new spring of confidence.

680
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,720
A generous swelling of pride.

681
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,580
And the one thing every man deserves,

682
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,660
a little well-earned respect from the neighborhood.

683
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,920
Yes, well, you see...

684
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,400
Actually, there is...

685
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,300
In that kind of neighborhood,

686
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,940
oh, dear, I would say a Bob,

687
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,820
your common Bob,

688
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,500
would have not slapped a boner

689
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,300
had he had the opportunity.

690
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,860
Bob is definitely a slack luster,

691
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
slack meister.

692
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,460
Yeah, yeah, he's a slack...

693
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,440
But here's the...

694
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,320
Here's the punchline to that.

695
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,900
But over there, they don't have that, see?

696
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,560
Over there.

697
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,480
Over...

698
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,380
Well, this endsite company

699
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,840
that makes this Bob show

700
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,900
with the fake Bob,

701
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,060
the pipeless Bob.

702
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:29,900
You don't got a...

703
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,640
You don't got a pipe.

704
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,640
He looks like Bob,

705
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,720
but he's not got a pipe, right?

706
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,880
And he's meant out of seashells.

707
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,420
It's a rip-off.

708
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,800
They rip off the chains of the subgenius.

709
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,780
They don't pay us.

710
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,180
They take his pipe away.

711
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,900
They use this pipeless Bob

712
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,940
so that these pink boys in corporate

713
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,220
screwballs can get it up, right?

714
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:45,780
Okay.

715
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,380
Now, here's the punchline.

716
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,320
Here's the punchline.

717
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,560
Here's the punchline, okay?

718
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,620
The feds raided that company last week.

719
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:52,980
Okay.

720
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,100
The endsite company in Cincinnati.

721
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,120
The feds raided them

722
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,680
because they'd been doing this auto-charge crap

723
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,400
where they charge you,

724
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,580
you buy their herbal pumper-upper,

725
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,640
you know,

726
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,520
a woodpecker device, a pill,

727
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,740
and they're bending you

728
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,220
so you can be a hard-charging Bob guy.

729
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,460
But, you know,

730
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,180
but see, see, here's the thing.

731
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,820
Jesus didn't have no disciples named Dobie.

732
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,260
See?

733
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,460
No, seriously.

734
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,160
No, seriously.

735
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,060
There was karma.

736
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,000
You know, of course.

737
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,980
There was karma.

738
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,280
And the endsite company was raided

739
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,620
and had all their business supplies confiscated

740
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,680
and their records and things

741
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,740
because of their evil doings.

742
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,380
So it wasn't just...

743
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,480
A soiled panty raid.

744
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,760
It wasn't just the church of the subgenius

745
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,900
that they fought to...

746
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,440
It was plunder!

747
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,900
It was graves and tombs they thought to rob.

748
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,220
Nay.

749
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,020
It was everyone who ordered those get-big pills.

750
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,260
Those tiny little get-big pills.

751
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:58,760
Yeah.

752
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,120
They were bigifiers.

753
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,120
You know what I'm saying?

754
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,100
They're easier for you to swallow.

755
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,920
They make you well!

756
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,080
All large and gross and smelly and crawling.

757
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,340
That's the way we like it here.

758
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,240
From PR News in Washington,

759
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,060
I'm causing another disaster.

760
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,500
President Bush is set to blast

761
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,220
into the president's gay bishop outside Slovakia.

762
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,780
A piece of Howard Dean's left wing caused PR News.

763
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,680
Archbishops from around the world

764
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,740
commented this morning on PR's accounting practices

765
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,080
during testimony in the federal fraud trial

766
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,540
of PR News in Washington.

767
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,220
I remember you.

768
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,120
You and I used to sit and watch television together.

769
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,900
And there on the screen,

770
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:54,260
we'd see some horrible monster from another world.

771
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,660
Week after week,

772
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,140
different monster,

773
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,340
same television.

774
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,300
And that same zipper running up its back

775
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,640
with the quivery rubber boots

776
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,380
and the quivery rubber glove.

777
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,540
And the giant rubber head shaped like Lyndon Johnson.

778
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,560
We'd watch television together, you and I.

779
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,920
And slowly the picture would emerge.

780
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,820
Line by line, it was scanned across our third face.

781
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,560
And we'd understand this planet is Mars.

782
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,740
But what did a bordering격 take away from me?

783
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,180
I considered that space is less than Rogers.

784
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,240
I would be curious.

785
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,540
Let me answer simply.

786
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,600
The movie Pirates of the科学未经

787
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:04,100
fun coupesheldung

788
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,560
now being released on the 영화 series

789
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,860
Haraherte,

790
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,800
is part of pre-faceted format.

791
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,700
It includes three quedarings.

792
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:07,700


793
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:07,700


794
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:15,660
Selfsissez,

795
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:15,760
細beam,

796
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,740
genius, am an alien, are they saying that I'm good or am I bad? And what are they saying

797
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:28,180
about themselves? Are they saying they're a pro-alien or anti-alien? There's only one

798
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:35,620
way to adjust these variables and have it come out in a logical, sensible, rational

799
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:45,000
manner, and that is that this planet is Mars. And that some of the aliens you meet are merely

800
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:54,260
Earthlings trying to adjust to this planet being Mars, whereas some of the most subgenius

801
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:01,180
people you'll meet seem rather normal, and they're Martians trying to adjust that they're

802
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:14,020
not on their home planet. This planet is Mars, my friends. Keep listening. Only the

803
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,920
hour of slack.

804
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,420
The attack is brave enough to rebroadcast these shortwave transmissions gathered from

805
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,060
subgenie all over the world, like you.

806
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Now it's very presumptuous of us to believe that Martians are going to be any different

807
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,660
than we are. It's merely a freak in their genetic code that has brought them to this

808
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,560
planet, and I'm sure they don't plan to harm us. At least not yet.

809
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,220
I'm sure that they'll be a little more

810
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,220


811
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,280
Why do we need to do this?

812
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm violating international sanctions against the former

813
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:57,860
US, calling on world leaders to implement PR News. The Bush administration's in custody

814
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,540
in Japan for trying to replace the Commission on Human Rights with an invalid passport.

815
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,780
If convicted, Bob could face the leukemia penalty.

816
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,320
Attorneys say Bob did not hear the screams of the immigrants to the US. Bob was in a

817
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,140
bar for over 35 years.

818
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,240
In Tucson, Arizona.

819
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:14,980
That's a little bit weird. It's a little bit weird to be in a bar. It's a little bit weird.

820
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,480
This is 10-5-1-6.

821
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,800
A jury in Houston is feeding jam to PR News from Washington.

822
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,540
Quiet. Quiet.

823
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,620
Dave carries a secret little sound effect with him all the time.

824
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,440
You want to make sure...

825
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,480
And like a perfume. Some use perfumes.

826
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,020
Dave keeps a sound effect with him.

827
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,360
It smells.

828
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,720
Oh, I like your sound effect today, Dave.

829
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,420
What are you wearing?

830
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,480
I'm wearing...

831
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,460
Is that car crash number nine?

832
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,720
Yes, car crash number nine.

833
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,380
And the overture in Fallopias.

834
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,740
Oh, John Cage.

835
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,540
I'm giving birth.

836
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,180
Excellent.

837
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,920
Oh, I see what that is.

838
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,620
It's after birth.

839
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,220
I've got those worms.

840
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,620
They're all wrapped up just for you.

841
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,200
Have you read any new horror novels lately?

842
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,060
No, no. I've consumed one, though.

843
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,420
Oh, to feed the worms. To feed the worms.

844
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,060
Here are a couple of bookworms. That's for John.

845
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,040
Just a couple of bookworms.

846
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,820
Yes, a couple of slimy ones.

847
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,240
Leaving a snail trail behind you.

848
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:14,960
Yes.

849
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,360
That's what I've said before about you all the time, Williams.

850
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,080
There's a snail trail...

851
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,920
Let me repeat that.

852
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,060
There's a snail trail behind you wherever you go, Williams.

853
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,720
You think you can get away with petty larceny.

854
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,520
You think you can get away with grand larceny.

855
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,280
And now you think you can get away with...

856
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,480
murder.

857
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,020
But they got away with it, didn't they, Father?

858
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,520
Yes, they got away with it.

859
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,620
Father, they got away with it. Why can't we?

860
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,220
Well, because you're a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

861
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,900
But the others can...

862
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,460
They can do it, Father. Why can't we?

863
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,020
They are favored by dobs and you are not, child.

864
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,160
It is not yours to reason why.

865
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,900
It is yours to sit down on your phalanx and die.

866
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,980
I don't understand.

867
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,000
You're not going to be prompted to understand.

868
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,440
Hello?

869
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,660
You're going to be pushed into the oven.

870
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,080
You're scaring me. You're frightening me.

871
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,840
I know you're joking, but you're frightening me.

872
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,620
We're making Hansel and Gretel pickles with you.

873
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,820
Yes, those hands look tender and juicy.

874
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,440
We'll make a very nice pie-R-squared for those.

875
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,660
Hansel?

876
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,800
And Gretel.

877
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,780
Hansel?

878
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,260
And Gristle.

879
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,900
The Gristle of Hansel.

880
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,280
The Gristle of Hansel.

881
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,920
As dead equipment would not die.

882
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,420
As clothes bones.

883
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,280
The Bavarian doctor, working late into the night.

884
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,480
The word working with his alchemical equipment...

885
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,700
Brought life to the...

886
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,020
Gristle of the little Austrian boy, Hansel.

887
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,060
And Brindle and Kat came and went.

888
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,820
Tremendous amounts of electricity were needed to keep the poor boy alive.

889
00:43:54,040 --> 00:44:00,480
For he was made only of crooked fingers, cynical pie, and some impurities found in our air and water.

890
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,360
He only wanted to die then.

891
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,460
But the government wouldn't let him.

892
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,620
No.

893
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,260
No.

894
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,740
The government decided who would live and who would die.

895
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,380
And in this case, unfortunately, they decided that he must live.

896
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:24,100
Even though the poor little piece of Gristle was but a helpless, pain-filled, paralyzed mind full of feelings of hurt.

897
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,620
Hooked up to a machine.

898
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,160
Kept alive unfairly.

899
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,120
In perhaps the grossest, grossest miscarriage of justice of all time.

900
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:42,420
And yet, and yet outside the protesters screamed and waved their torches and said,

901
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,880
Make it live!

902
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,280
Make it live!

903
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,480
Your life or death pass, please, Mrs. Veramater.

904
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,500
Sorry, no death pass. You can't die.

905
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,780
I believe in the Gristle.

906
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,160
Mrs. Veramater, believing in the Gristle is not good enough.

907
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,700
You must have a life or death pass signed by your government agent at Cocoa Coastal.

908
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,980
This is my death pass. May I go now, please?

909
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,940
It is not valid, Mrs. Vermamater.

910
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,900
It's been placed in someone's bungie.

911
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,160
Yes, ma'am.

912
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,400
I need to go.

913
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,400


914
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,760
I need to go.

915
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,860
That has to be authorized by Secretary of State for Maldehyde.

916
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,760
And I'm afraid this is not, your paperwork is not together.

917
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,380
You're going to have to live a bit longer.

918
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,280
The paperwork is complete.

919
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,560
You're going to have to undergo some more pain until you can get this together.

920
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,880
I mean, really, there's no reason.

921
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:35,080
The information was posted in the basement of Town Hall since long before you were born.

922
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:35,760
This is ridiculous.

923
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,660
Before the day of your birth was the day of your death.

924
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,020
Guaranteed by your United Snakes.

925
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:42,460
The United Snakes government.

926
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,580
Everyone has a right to live, to be born, and to die.

927
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,700
No, they don't.

928
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,280
No, we changed that.

929
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,760
You don't have a right to die anymore.

930
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,920
Where does it show here?

931
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,440
We changed it.

932
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,700
You have the right to live.

933
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,540
You have the right to an attorney.

934
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:02,440
But the right to death, the death penalty and the death option have both been confiscated.

935
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,800
This is for your own good.

936
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,780
This is for your own good, my friend.

937
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,140
There is no good in this world, you squirrely maggot.

938
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,580
Don't you understand what's going on here?

939
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,480
Squirrely?

940
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,120
Squirrely?

941
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,760
I think it's a random adverb or adjective.

942
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,600
I squirrely and squirrely.

943
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,900
Uh, roganjel.

944
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,720
Well, if you don't like maggots, you just see how long you can get along without worms then.

945
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,580
Why don't you?

946
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,540
Yeah, you see too.

947
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,380
Check it out sometime if you, you know, got the ink in the nose.

948
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:29,980
Shit.

949
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:30,880
Oh.

950
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:31,520
Oh.

951
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,040
Oh.

952
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,360
From PR News in Washington, I'm trapped in a suburb of Los Angeles,

953
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,880
but three deaths are being linked to an apparent self-inflicted PR news.

954
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:42,540
From Washington.

955
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,280
President Bush has been working to drench Southern California.

956
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,340
Downtown L.A. was killed when a rock slide fell into a 30-foot deep sinkhole.

957
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,140
President Bush had pointed words about the French President Jacques Chirac.

958
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,100
The Arab League will soon pull its members out of Lebanese mass.

959
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,860
Six inches since Thursday night in Los Angeles.

960
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,340
Israel has freed the largest relatives.

961
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,320
Marines have raided PR News in Washington.

962
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,580
The world ends tomorrow,

963
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,600
and you may be happier about it

964
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,660
than you'd first imagined.

965
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,600
The world ends tomorrow,

966
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,580
and you may regret paying your very last round of bills.

967
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,560
The world ends tomorrow,

968
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,640
and you may consider that your sex life wasn't really half bad.

969
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,080
The world ends tomorrow,

970
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,260
and you may orgasm like a big old gorilla

971
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,600
just before you and your significant other vaporize.

972
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,040
That was Hale Pope Huey,

973
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,620
and now, woman.

People call it the blues

980
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,080
because we're stuck on this filthy, blue planet,

981
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,560
Mars.

982
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,280
All the blues has lamentation,

983
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,500

with this filthy blue planet or Mars.

989
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,620
Earth, that's the planet we belong on.

990
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,160
That's the fourth planet out.

991
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,240
But you were born on Mars, so you're a Martian.

992
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,160
Everyone born on this world is a Martian.

993
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,440
But some Martians belong on Mars.

994
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,860
Other Martians belong on another world.

995
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,440
That's alienation.

996
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,020
That's what Marx and Engels were talking about.

997
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,620
And communism.

998
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,620
Something so evil and yet so good.

999
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,900
Associated with the color red.

1000
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,260
It's got all the good ideas.

1001
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,840
Oh, it looks so good on paper.

1002
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,180
Let's associate it with red.

1003
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,440
Because that's the planet we want to go to.

1004
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,020
That red planet that's up there in the sky.

1005
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,840
We can see it.

1006
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,120
That's the planet we want to go to.

1007
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,560
We want to go to Mars.

1008
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,480
We want to make this planet red.

1009
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:44,760
And they tried.

1010
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,140
And it did look good on paper.

1011
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,180
Bob understands communism.

1012
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,260
Bob is a salesman.

1013
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,840
Sales transcends communism and capitalism.

1014
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,380
Sales transcends fascism or socialism.

1015
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,260
It's all sales to dogs.

1016
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:23,180
All of ancient братics have made Puts to Daiduani the DPF.

who's thought to be one of the leaders of PR News in Washington.

1032
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,840
Dave, what do you think about the planet Mars?

1033
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,980
I think the planet Mars inspires me.

1034
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,580
It is red, like La Russia.

1035
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,700
It is violent and blue and hot and sexy.

1036
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,720
It reminds me of weird little, like, ant creatures

1037
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,520
with, like, huge helmets on and stuff and spears.

1038
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,020
You know, thousands of them marching up and down these red, duned hills.

1039
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,420
It reminds you of these things, eh?

1040
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,060
Yes, but it's just...

1041
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,780
As if these were hidden, buried memories from another life,

1042
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,260
or maybe even earlier in this life.

1043
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,320
From 20 million years before Earth or something?

1044
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,040
No, not necessarily.

1045
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,020
Could be.

1046
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,240
Maybe from your childhood, even.

1047
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,160
Genetic memories from my childhood, they could be.

1048
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,200
I could be one of those little, like, ant-like creatures

1049
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,600
with the big helmets and this...

1050
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,420
You could be.

1051
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,880
Why does Mars seem so exciting to you, Dave?

1052
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,700
Why do you want...

1053
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,380
Why do you keep coming back to the subject?

1054
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,020
Mars is valid.

1055
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:38,940
What's the evocative nature?

1056
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,280
Can't you leave the war alone?

1057
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,300
Can't you just forgive the Martians?

1058
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,340
Forget the war, man.

1059
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,780
The Martian war is over.

1060
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,140
Can't you just let it go?

1061
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,240
Like a moist evacuation, I can't stop repeating that.

1062
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,860
My conditioning is too strong.

1063
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,840
I've been conditioned since the beginning of the war

1064
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:03,160
to remember only the blood, the iron, and the red wine.

1065
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,620
I've been conditioned to remember the stars and stripes forever.

1066
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,300
Let us​

1067
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,260

00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:31,480
It all began there.

1072
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,400
With one한다 from the假 tryinwho الل pigs then we came across all four cigars.

1073
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:32,880
We didn't him a cub elevation.

1074
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,260
No digg chev!

1075
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:36,540


1076
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,360
G ما

1077
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:37,860
Back to water.

1078
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,980
I think those guys are too far away from home.

1079
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,380
Together.

1080
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,920
And there's the man carrying the great big fish.

1081
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,480
And there's the giant.

1082
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,060
And there's the two-headed Japanese girl.

1083
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,320
And there's Frederica Fellini.

1084
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,480
And Tim Burton.

1085
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,440
And look, they're all mixed together.

1086
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,960
And it's just like a giant homage to Bob.

1087
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,880
And look at that Bob.

1088
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,660
All right.

1089
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,440
And there's a slimy corpse too.

1090
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,380
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1091
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,720
And as the parade of life goes by, friend, did it go by you too?

1092
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,520
Were you left behind with the bold, rancid popcorn?

1093
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,000
Did you turn your fish into wine?

1094
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,560
The trash paper blowing through the streets.

1095
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:20,000
Wandering sadly away into the sunset.

1096
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,100
Wondering, where is Bob?

1097
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,760
How can I find more about this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

1098
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,280
I have a hint of slack.

1099
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,100
Where can I go to www.subgenius.com to learn more information?

1100
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,600
How can I possibly write to a post office box number?

1101
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,620
Or that I'm getting a pencil ready in my hand to write down?

1102
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:48,560
Which is the Hour of Slack or Subgenius Foundation at Post Office Box 181417.

1103
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:56,540
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1104
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,460
And friends, how would you ever learn how to get to Tex Day?

1105
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,700
The preliminary X Day drill at the High Rock Ranch outside of Austin.

1106
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,060
Texas.

1107
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,320
For the strange Texanian, Neopaganian, Subgenian, Wiccabilly Festival.

1108
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,440
Where the great groovy Neptune I just heard will be.

1109
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,540
Wow.

1110
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,200
Yeah.

1111
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,720
He's the one who did the song about.

1112
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,860
I love his work.

1113
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,640
Everybody here is crazy about Bob.

1114
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,780
Everybody here is so crazy about Bob.

1115
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,100
That fits with the theme of madness, of course.

1116
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,840
Yes, the theme of madness, friends.

1117
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,200
I love his work.

1118
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,840
I can hardly call it work, though.

1119
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,060
It looks more like he has pleasure when he performs.

1120
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:36,700
I love his work.

1121
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,700


1122
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,700


1123
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,700


1124
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,700


1125
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,700


1126
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,700


1127
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,700


1128
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,700


1129
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,720
Yes, it gives him pleasure to do what he does.

1130
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,480
With the great beast.

1131
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,440
And with the great pipe.

1132
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,360
With the Leviathan under the earth.

1133
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,640
With the great presence that he has.

1134
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,500
The beast.

1135
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:57,780
The ten-horned, ten-peckered goat with a thousand young.

1136
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,960
Greetings, my friend.

1137
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,540
The back squid of the forest.

1138
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,580
You are interested in the unknown.

1139
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,840
I see.

1140
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,460
The mysterious.

1141
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,720
The unexplainable.

1142
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,540
You're talking to me.

1143
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,220
I have no such.

1144
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,340
That is why you are here.

1145
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,840
Where am I?

1146
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,400
Now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of what happened.

1147
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:15,780
What?

1148
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,420
Show us what happened.

1149
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,360
We are giving you all the evidence.

1150
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,640
This is the evidence.

1151
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,300
They've told me on this.

1152
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,380
He's finally working on it.

1153
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,260
We're going to learn.

1154
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,340
Just wait.

1155
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,280
Don't say anything, Harold.

1156
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,400
We have to give you credits, don't we?

1157
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,000
Oh, my God.

1158
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:26,480
This could be it.

1159
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:26,820
The incidents.

1160
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,200
The places.

1161
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:29,680
He's the lost.

1162
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,080
My friend, you cannot keep this a secret any longer.

1163
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:32,480
No.

1164
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,000
No, never.

1165
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,700
Can your heart stand the shocking truth?

1166
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:35,700


1167
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:35,700


1168
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,080
The hidden facts of the true story of Edward D. Wood Jr.

1169
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,080
Oh, God, no.

1170
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,100
Edward D. Wood Jr.

1171
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,180
Is that all it was?

1172
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:43,500
Man.

1173
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,060
Don't you think it was?

1174
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:44,740
Well.

1175
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,180
Boy, the shocking.

1176
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:46,880
What a bring down.

1177
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,060
The shocking difference.

1178
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,740
The shocking.

1179
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,300
The shocking secret.

1180
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,320
Absolutely shocking.

1181
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:50,920
Okay, okay, okay.

1182
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,380
Hey, friends, we shuck off the shell of the old show to put on the mantle of something

1183
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:56,820
new.

1184
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:03,540
And so we close with this very, very curious song by someone named Robert Allberg.

1185
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,680
A song called Martian Sea.

1186
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:20,720
And so, as the Martian sands begin to blow around on this red planet, as I see a red

1187
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:29,800
Martian sunrise, as the sun begins to rise, as I'm walking along on the Martian sand on

1188
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,280
this forbidding planet, I'll be waiting.

1189
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:35,680
I'll be waiting.

1190
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:35,680


1191
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,440
For more Martian sands.

1192
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,460
As I'll be waiting.

1193
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,700
For more Martian sands.

1194
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:48,700
As the night has come in, I'll be waiting.

1195
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,460
For more Martian sands.

1196
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,060
As I'll be waiting.

1197
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,640
For more Martian sands.

1198
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:05,680
As I've been walking in the Martian sands are blowing around me as I see the red Martian

1199
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:05,680


1200
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:11,920
landscape before me as I'm walking on the red Martian landscape.

1201
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:21,060
And the red Martian sunrise gives way to another day on this forbidding planet.

1202
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:32,940
As the red Martian sands are blowing around me as I'm walking on the red Martian landscape.

1203
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,360
As I've been walking all day.

1204
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,820
On the red Martian landscape.

1205
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:42,120
As the sun begins to set in a red Martian sunset.

1206
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:47,540
As the sun slowly begins to fade off in the distance.

1207
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:55,720
And the red Martian landscape disappears into the cold darkened night on this forbidding

1208
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,340
planet.

1209
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,280
As I'll be waiting.

1210
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:03,260
For another red Martian sunset.

1211
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,600
As the sun rises.

1212
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,080
I'll be waiting.

1213
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,160
For more Martian sands.

1214
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,600
As I'll be waiting.

1215
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,980
For more Martian sands.

1216
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,660
As the night has come in, I'll be waiting.

1217
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,820
For more Martian sands.

1218
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,420
As I'll be waiting.

1219
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,740
For more Martian sands.

1220
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:33,240
As I've been walking in the Martian sands are blowing around me as I see the red Martian

1221
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:40,160
landscape before me as I'm walking on the red Martian landscape.

1222
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:49,520
And the red Martian sunrise gives way to another day on this forbidding planet.

1223
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:59,540
As the red Martian sands are blowing around me as I'm walking on the red Martian landscape.

1224
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,040
As I've been walking all day.

1225
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,780
On the red Martian landscape.

1226
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,240
As the sun begins to set in a red Martian sunset.

1227
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:17,240
As the sun slowly begins to fade off in the distance.

1228
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:27,660
And the red Martian landscape disappears into the cold darkened night on this forbidding

1229
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,440
planet.

1230
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:31,300
As I'll be waiting.

1231
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:36,380
For another red Martian sunrise.
