Three stained drapes.
When I knew I was still in Marty's hotel room,
I knew that hours had been thrown out of my life and thrown away.
Then the light screamed again, and this time there were words.
Big thousand-watt words that said,
Delicious dancing girls.
And in between there was the creaking sound of a rocking chair.
Then the rocking chair made words, too.
You're not thirsty.
You don't want a drink.
You don't want a drink.
His face, it's shaking!
And his hand, he's a monster!
Run, Horst! Run!
You can't get away, John! You can't get away!
It's my horse!
Where are you?

Yes, dear friends,
and thanks to Fernanda and Andy Leamer,
as always, for our opening credits.
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang,
and this would be
our
Hour of Slack number
1072
B
And it's a
rerun of somebody else's
subgenius show.
Yes, the great station
WREK in Atlanta
has a weekly show
called Bob's Slack Time
Fun House.
Every other week is done by the great
Reverend Susie the Floozy.
And
every other other week
is done by the Lymphnode Institute.
And this show is a wonderful example
of their work.
Unlike me, they're not barraged by
submissions
from subgeniuses
all over the world.
They just collect
things from their immediate environment.
So they have
more known music
running on their show, and they
do, well, you'll see.
They put a lot of work into writing
their show.
And this particular show is a great one.
At the end,
they'll give you more information
on where you can get podcasts
of their show,
which is via WREK.org.
And also,
if you poke around where you get the podcast
for Hour of Slack,
you will also find
Bob's Slack Time Fun House, and for that matter,
the Puzzling Evidence Show,
and links to all kinds of other
sublimiously audio
things. And so now, friends,
let us join
the mighty
Lymphnode Institute.
Yetis and simpletons,
poison ghouls.
Tonight, we once
again don the stiff, sticky
trappings of the faux
medicinal arts,
lace our boots
tight, and
duct tape our waders to our
waists as we wade
into the postmodern
moral quagmire
of torture.
We will titter with glee
as we watch our simian
cousins attempt to retain
their Judeo-Christian
ethics as they attempt
to survive in this
meaningless world that
Dobbs has sold them.
Of course, while this may be a great deal
of fun, it is
very, very, very
bad news for us, yetensany.
But,
we'll get to that
later.
No problem.
Ah!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
I was sitting there on Sunday morning in the chief of police's office at a large table.
Torture.
He was listening to a football game.
Let's be upfront about it.
A football game.
Torture.
T-O-R-T-U-R-E.
On the small transistor radio.
That's the bottom line these days.
And I had it very low.
It's replaced death.
Even teenagers kill themselves.
These days.
Along with the depressed.
And terminally ill.
And I began to hear.
Deaths are released from pain and anxiety and humiliation.
This very low.
Valued.
Reward.
Very low.
Wailing sound.
But the threat of death just isn't enough to control people.
So the ante's been raised.
Coming through the walls.
Now, it's torture.
Then it got louder.
And high tech torture at that.
Then it got louder.
And it was a low sound.
As the technocrats say, it's functional.
The chief of police told the colonel to turn up the radio.
That's why everyone who's intelligent and unanesthetized enough to care.
Then.
Has sort of put their life on hold.
Then the sound got louder.
Louder.
Underneath all the defensive layers of denial.
Return to.
We're all afraid of being tortured.
Anger.
Or homosexually gang raped.
Or having it happen to someone we care about.
Screaming.
And we're all self-consciously living a lie.
And I knew what it was.
We're all happy joes.
And I knew that this man was being tortured with.
How did it happen here in the land of the free?
In the home of the brave?
Tortured with electricity.
I mean in some banana republic.
Well it kept getting louder.
Some distant past.
Like the Spanish inquisition.
And more horrible.
World War II.
The Nazis.
The fanatical Japs.
And each time.
But not us Americans.
And each time.
G.I.
Joe.
And each time.
Frank Sinatra.
And each time.
Jerry Lewis.
Autumn in New York.
The chief would tell the colonel.
Baseball.
To turn up the radio.
College football.
Glenn Miller.
Pretty soon.
Some distant past.



Somehow it doesn't fit with torture.
Pretty soon the radio was very very loud.
But it does.
Of course it does.
But I could still hear those sounds.
Because it was always a facade.
The image of America.
And now the facade has finally failed.
Anguish.
Like a burned out clutch.
Screaming.
Screaming.
Or a decayed tooth that breaks open.
Horrible.
Horrible.
They both smell bad.
Strange.
Ominous.
Going back to the office in the embassy.
Naturally I was speculating who that possibly could have been.
But the motive that I had in everything that I did.
Was to save the lives of Americans.
Who in some cases were being tortured to death.
That's what I did.
That's what I did.
That's what I did.

Definitely.
For the last time everybody continues to ball gr Formula Bl infringement.

Christianity, like most religions, seeks to suppress normal human mental function with pain and humiliation.
Christianity is, at its core, a death cult organized around the sacrifice of their own God.
The highest grossing independent film ever made in the United States, graphically, almost pornographically, catalogs the many potential and supposed tortures of their God.
Torture is a natural extension of the fears and desires of pink humanity, and furthermore, a natural extension,
of the beliefs of Christianity, of self-sacrifice taken too literally.
It's entirely reasonable that if one's own God was made to torture and die terribly, then why not a heathen, a Mohammedan, a Buddhist, or whatever?
Well, a subgenius.
You don't really believe that they are walling the Mexicans out, do you?
Oh, you poor, sad, dead, dead, dead little monkey.
What do you think the commander in chimp meant when he spoke recently of a third religious awakening?
Which bird?
A burning, of course.
Which burning?
You burning.
But, we've gone into all that before.
You should be well prepared for your terrible, terrible, terribly funny death.
I expect you to be laughing.
And so the Institute is beyond asking the mere simple questions as to why monkeys can't recognize their parents.
And why do they have their own reflection?
And why they are surprised when adherents of the state death cult attempt to put their real beliefs into practice.
One cannot read the Gospels without getting the distinct impression that Jesus came to die.
Mark 8, 31 and he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things,
And they will mock him and scourge him and spit on him and kill him.
Much of the gospel narratives focus upon the death of Christ.
And those incidents surrounding the death of Christ sometimes called the passion narratives.
Now normally scourging was a precursor to the crucifixion.
And it was a brutal affair.
In fact, one could even die from it.
How do we, as we consider ourselves civilized people, how do we react to things like this?
With horror, with sorrow, and with determination,
it reveals the face of an implacable enemy who's willing to violate any norm of civilized behavior.
And it should stiffen our resolve to eliminate them.
And it should also make us understand how tough,
how tough this struggle is going to be.
The scourge itself was made out of wood.
It had a wooden handle with leather thongs.
And each, on each end of those leather strips was a sharp piece of bone or lead.
And it would lash the flesh, it would tear it into threads, it would look like tattered toilet paper.
Our dog sometimes goes after our toilet rolls.
He pulls them down and he tears them up.
And that's what it would have looked, his back raked with this scourge.
Sometimes, apparently, gaping wounds were of such size that you could peer in and actually see the vital organ or the end grain.
This body, no doubt, was covered with horrible bruises and cuts and wounds.
And don't forget that he had been beaten black and blue.
Black and blue prior to this.
Then they began to spit on him and to blindfold him and to beat him.
And when I saw the prisoners, the Iraqi prisoners being captured and being blindfolded by the USA Army, I knew it.
And the officers struck him with the palms of their hands.
Well, these are just a few bad apples.
It was verbatim.
What they said.

What they said about, you know, the torture manuals and those who killed the Jesuits and the church women and El Masote.
And the list simply went on and on.
And that really angered me.
But, you know, I must say they're consistent in telling the lies, you know, trying to downplay the evil and the seriousness of all of this.
But it's obvious here when you read through what they do here,
they are beginning to mock him like a cat playing with a cat.
They're bashing him with a half-dead mouth.
Bashing him back and forth like it were a ball of string.
It's that sadistic kind of cruelty that gets pleasure out of seeing people hurt and wince when you hit them.
I really wish that some one of these, you know, right-wing pundits would just let themselves be waterboarded once.
You know, just on national TV and tell us how that feels.
And then they can call that not torture.
How long it went on, we don't know.
But it must have gone on for a while.
Then they struck him or kept on striking him, kept on striking him, kept on striking him.
We could read it this way.
They kept on spitting on him.
They kept on spitting, spitting, spitting, spitting on him.
But don't we see, brethren, how depraved?
How depraved are the hearts of men?
Don't we see here how depraved are the hearts of men?
Very few people in the world, especially in modern Western culture, are willing to face who they are.
Well, it is tough, and I think we've been seeing that.
But where do we go from here?
Don't react in a way that makes us behave in the way they do.
Most people view themselves quite positively.
Most people have a view of man that is quite flattering.
Man is good, or basically good.
And they believe the longer we live on planet Earth, the better we get.
But how do you explain the Jewish Holocaust?
How do you explain September 9-11?
How do you explain the millions of babies unborn that are aborted every year?
How do you explain all of the sex crimes?
How do you explain all of the murders?
How do you explain the serial killers?
Man does terrible things.
Man has always done terrible things.
And man will always do terrible things.
And if you want simply to look back in history,

and time, and see how terrible man is,
look here.
Abuses are inherent to the world.
You cannot have a clean world.
You have to have rapings, killings, torture.
It's impossible. That's the world.
That is the meaning of world.
Is God somehow caught off guard?
No, he sits in the heavens and laughs.
There is no God.
All the loudspeakers walk up and say
There is no God.
All the loudspeakers walk up and say
There is no God.
The loudspeakers walk up and say
Christianity is stupid.
Christianity is stupid.
Christianity is stupid.
Christianity is stupid.

Christianity is stupid.
I am learning to live each day.
It's just one at a time.
I'm trusting in the Lord to make it ever sublime.
I will not put God first in my life.
I will trust in all that I do by accepting his Son, Jesus, to carry me through.
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
This he has promised, this he will do.
And for Jesus alone can make all things new.
I now trust in Jesus to show me the way to happiness and love throughout the day.
With him at my side and his love in my heart, my life is beginning to have a new start.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
I am now learning how to love and forgive my fellow man as I am learning to live.
Learning to live means to accept the Lord by following his powerful dictates and full accord.
This I can do with Jesus at my side.
We now have a love that will never subside.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Rock over London, Rock on Chicago.
The heart of the world is in your hands.
The heartbeat of America.
That's today's Chevrolet.
Yes, with all that Christian love and charity,
it's not hard to understand why some people,
having been told for their entire lifetimes that they were born bad,
and that in all likelihood they will spend all of eternity writhing in pain,
doled out by a loving God.
Well, some of these people get a little cuffed in the head.
And these rebels, as it were,
adopt the binary opposition.
No, no, not of actually enjoying pleasure,
which is a lot harder than it sounds,
and incidentally, recent studies indicate that this may only be possible for yetis.
No, these poor, sad, mere human apes.
Adopt the binary opposition.
The binary opposition of enjoying pain.
If we carry this thought to its illogical conclusion,
it suggests an afterlife in Christian hell of back rubs, foot rubs, oral sex,
that sort of thing.
Sadism, of course, is nothing without masochism.
And so we wind up in a world of young Baptist human ashtrays
and lots of cutters.
Yes.
Surely this is exactly what Jesus had in mind.
Cut me up.
My mind's on fire.
You cannot choose between lust.
Desire between love.
Hate.
Screw up my brain.
Your words mean nothing.
And I suffer the pain.
Cut me up.
My mind's on fire.
You cannot choose between lust.
Desire between love.
Hate.
Screw up my brain.
Your words mean nothing.
And I suffer the pain.
Cut me up.
Why couldn't I see?
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy.

Crucify me, why couldn't I see
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy

Crucify me, why couldn't I see
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure
Eternal torture lasts forever
Crucify me, why couldn't I see
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy
He tortures me with sadistic pleasure
It's just another
Another memory to treasure your lust for blood
Eternal pain, my mutilation that puts you to shame
Crucify me, why couldn't I see?
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure
Eternal torture lasts forever
Crucify me, why couldn't I see?

My dog's singing, sharing travel
No work number, referee said
Won't you blow it, since you built it
Try to keep clean, cause the rent is due
And the water keeps tapping my head
The water keeps tapping my head
Since it's never your turn
I'll speak for you
Keep my hangnail, bloody brother
Wearing, tearing, sold I'm bare
If I don't make it, what's the use?
The water keeps tapping my head
The water keeps tapping my head


The water keeps tapping my head
Well, at least I lived through Chinese torture
At least I lived through Chinese torture
Without your hand, all right
With someone I didn't trust
Without your hand, without your blood



Could you finally understand?

After you left for work, where did you go?
At least I lived through Chinese torture
Things got mixed up under the bridge
And remember
Sound was used for centuries as a method of torture
Place someone's head inside of a bell
And ring it
And eventually
They'll go insane
And eventually
They'll go insane
They'll go insane
They'll go insane
And eventually
You're tired
You're beaten down
You're irritable
Your mental and physical health
Are suffering
You're a failure
You're a failure
You're a failure
You're a failure
You're a failure

A man who knew

And then Negative Land
Will do something terrible
To a monkey
Because we don't just torture each other
We now stand
Ten years past the midpoint of a century
That has witnessed
Four major wars among great nations
Three of these
Involved our own country
And the world
Despite these holocausts
America is today
The strongest
The most influential
And most productive nation in the world
Understandably proud of this preeminence
We yet realize
That America's leadership and prestige depend
Not merely upon our unmatched material progress
Riches and military strength
But on how we use our power
In the interest of world peace
Thank you for watching!
And human betterment
And human betterment
Christ sees there will continue to be
In meeting them
Whether foreign or domestic
Great or small
There is a recurring temptation
To feel that some spectacular and costly action
Could become the miraculous solution
To all current difficulties
A huge increase in newer elements
Of our defenses
Development of unrealistic programs
To cure every ill in agriculture
And to create a new world










A dramatic expansion in basic and applied research
These and many other possibilities
Each possibly promising in itself
May be suggested as the only way
To the road we wish to travel
But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration
The need to maintain balance
In and among national programs
A vital element in keeping the world safe and sound
Does not make it it even more salvageable
One may warn and the other must maybe wait
So our military assistance
offerings innumerable
With this type of means
The possibility of modern military intelligence

Is to take over






Through the command of the mandarin
Using weapon technology
At Ai-N firms
Under dunking
no armaments industry.
American makers of plowshares could,
with time and as required,
make swords as weapons.
But we can no longer risk
emergency improvisation
of national defense.
We have been compelled to create
a permanent armaments industry
of vast proportions.
Added to this,
three and a half million men and women
are directly engaged
in the defense establishment.
We annually spend
on military security alone
more than the net income
of all United States corporations.
Now this conjunction
of an immense military establishment
and a large arms industry
is new in the American experience.
The total influence,
economic, political,
even spiritual,
is felt in every city,
every state house,
every office of the federal government.
We recognize the imperative need
for this development.
Yet we must not fail to comprehend
its grave implications.
Our toil, resources, and livelihood
are all involved.
So is the very structure of our society.
In the councils of government,
we must guard against
the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought,
by the military-industrial complex.
The potential for the disaster
is the disastrous rise
of misplaced power to exist
and will persist.
We must never let the weight
of this combination
endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.
Today the solitary inventor,
tinkering in his shop,
has been overshadowed
by task forces of science,
in laboratories,
and testing fields.
In the same fashion,
the free university
of diversity,
historically the fountainhead
of the world's









most prestigious university,





free ideas and scientific discovery,
has experienced a revolution
in the conduct of research,
partly because of the huge costs
involved,
a government contract
has become virtually
a substitute
for intellectual curiosity.
For every old blackboard,
there are now hundreds
of new electronic computers.
The prospect of domination
of the nation's scholars
drives federal employment
to the brink of a crisis.







The power of money
is ever present
and is gravely
to be regarded.
Yet in holding scientific research
and discovery in respect,
as we should,
we must also be alert
to the equal and opposite danger
that public policy
could itself
become the capital
of the scientific,
technological elite.
As we peer into society's future,
we must be aware














that we,
you and I,
and our government,
must avoid the impulse
to live only for today,
plundering for our own ease
and convenience
the precious resources
of tomorrow.
We cannot mortgage
the material assets
of our grandchildren
without risking the loss
also of their political
and spiritual heritage.
We want democracy
to survive
for all generations
to come,
not to become
a burden









on the insolvent phantom
of tomorrow.
And now once again
it's time for
Wildlife Tonight.
Dr. Oslo Norway here
with a shocking remote
from Wildlife Tonight.
Right now we are going live
to Wildlife Tonight's
Buck Logic
over at the San Francisco Zoo
where Buck is going to

demonstrate why there never
was any Adam or Eve.
Buck, are you there?
Yes, thank you, Oslo.
This is Buck Logic
with Wildlife Tonight.
And where could you find
more wildlife tonight
than the San Francisco Zoo?
We're here in the zoo's
new Stinky Monkey House,
a generous endowment
from the Simien M.
Stinky Estate,
makers of stinky
shoe stretchers.
And here with me is Chuck,
the night shift monkey man
at the San Francisco Zoo.
Is that right, Buck?
Yes, something like that.
Well, we appreciate you
letting us in after hours
to do this, Chuck.
And if you're ready now,
please bring in the monkey.
Are you sure about that?
That's my last question.
Yes, it's quite all right.
And here he comes
through the ironclad door
with a chimpanzee.
We'll do it right on the table
there, Chuck.
Careful.
Get him up against
the armature.
Tie those straps securely.
They can take your place.
And he's got his face right off.
He's doing the best he can.
Yeah, I'm getting it.
And so what we're going to do
right here on Wow Life tonight
is shave all the hair off this
chimp from face to feet.
Now Chuck is going to spray
the restrained chimp all over
with Gillette's New Tough Guy
shaving gel.
And we're going to begin
shaving this chimpanzee's
entire body clean of all hair.
And I believe this is another
exclusive for Wow Life tonight.
And it's all in your head, FM.
Although I must confess,
I don't see why no one
has done this before.
And now Chuck...
Ow, not too fast there, Chuck.
That's really good.
This is not an easy job.
Chuck is rapidly shaving
the chimp's body now.
And there seems to be
a little discomfort.
But come on, we've all been shaved.
It doesn't actually hurt that much.
Now we're seeing some real skin here.
We're doing this full body monkey makeover
for the first time anywhere
because I'll bet none of you listening out there
have ever seen a shaved monkey
before in your life.
Think about it.
I'll bet never before.
And you know what?
There's an important reason
why you've never seen
a shaved monkey before.
And it does not include
protecting the dignity of the animal.
That's just an excuse.
And it's not just a



It's a real shame.
And it's a real shame
that you're not allowed to see it.
No, no, you have never been allowed
to see it because it's a shocking,
almost unbearable testament
to our own intimate link
with animal evolution.
You know, I could lose my top over this.
Oh, chimp appears very angry.
The chimp is strapped in a skinny position
to a sort of a crucifix-style armature
on the table.
Trembling a little under the restraints.
Be gentle, Chuck.
I'm having a little bit of a





I'm having a little trouble with this.
Poor thing.
I think I'm going to have to
switch to something else here.
And now Chuck is struggling
to shave the feet and toes.
What's his name, Chuck?
This is a girl.
We call her Cherry.
Cherry.
Wow.
Cute breasts.
Be sure to get all around
her private parts, too.
I want a completely shaved monkey.
I'm done doing it.
Wow.
That makes her very angry.
Yeah.
She doesn't like that at all.
You know, we're sorry we have to put this innocent chimp through this,
but it's simply necessary to create a greater good for all of us.
Sort of like testing cosmetics on them.
Chuck is using a Jumbo Gillette Pro-Tech Tough Guy razor system on Cherry.
And perhaps it should have been a Lady Pro-Tech,
but it seems to be working just great anyway.
From first shave to last,
always a smooth shave with Gillette.
And come to think of it,
in Cherry's case,
this probably is her first and last shave.
But when this chimp is entirely shaved,
everyone will see for the first time
why we are truly all brothers
to this sister under the skin.
And now Chuck is finishing off her face and neck.
Just leave a head of hair like us, that's all.
No mustache, it's a girl.
Great, great, that's it.
And, uh,
here comes the hose.
Rinsing her all off now.
And there.
There you have it.
Look at that.
Release the straps, Chuck.
Amazing.
Creepy, but amazing.
Turn her around, Chuck.
Turn her around.
Keep turning her, Chuck.
That's it.
She looks just like my kid.
Now, I was gonna say,
I realized this in rehearsal.
Once you see a monkey's full frontal bare skin anatomy,
something we have never been allowed to see before.
It's so strangely like our own bodies,
just different proportions in the parts,
but all the same skeletal and muscular structures.
It's like an organic revelation.
All right, Chuck, you can go.


















And remove the shaved chimp.
A wonderfully telling demonstration.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chuck.
And, uh,
don't worry about Cherry, folks.
We have a little skirt and sweater for her.
And, uh,
uh,
Cherry,
here's a banana for being so good.
Well,
what can anyone say?
Seeing is truly believing.
A wildlife tonight,
revered by the world,












a revelation.
And, for God's sakes,
what more need we be?
So, that's it.
Nature's clock is ticking.
Thanks to Cherry the Chimp,
Chuck the Monkey Man,
and the Gillette Shaving Corporation.
Now, on your face with the Pro-Tech Maximus II Jet Shave System.
I'm Buck Logic.
Now, back to Oslo, Norway's brain,
at It's All in Your Head FM.
That's it for wildlife tonight.
Thank you, Buck and Chuck,
and good luck.
Wildlife tonight.
