1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
I'm a little too tight, I'm getting out of sight

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:14,680
I've got a fucking curtain, I'm barely alive

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,300
Oh, ugly, ugly, ugly music

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,880
More to come, dear friend

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:31,060
This is KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,340
Dallas, Texas, dear friends

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,360
And we've just switched over to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,960
And this is going to be a really strange hour of slack

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,860
I mean, I know you expect hours of slack

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,180
To be strange, but this one's even strange within our framework

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:02,220
In that half of it's going to be music all by one band

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,520
And the other half is all original ranting

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,340
For better or worse

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,000
Before I get into that, I have some good news for the subgenius fans

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,220
I'm going to go through this real quick

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,060
The book of the subgenius just went into its third printing, dear friends

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,380
Third printing, that means it's popular, popular

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,860
At least it's popular

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:21,860


20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,740
It's popular enough

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,780
Nothing like what they think of as popular

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,380
The High Weirdness by Mail, the second subgenius book

23
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,140
Will be out in April

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,700
And Tales of Bob, three-fisted Tales of Bob

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,000
Will be paid for in June

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,320
Can't say when it'll come out

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,620
These aren't advertisements

28
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,560
You shouldn't buy them, and I have to say that

29
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,020
Oh, yes, friends

30
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,800
We know for the last...

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,560
Oh, this is Nino Rota

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,240
In the background

33
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,540
With a theme from Eight and a Half

34
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,520
The hat size held in common by many subgeniuses

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,140
Including Federico Fellini, myself, and other big heads

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,500
Anyway, last week

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,800
The last two weeks, we did some real back-to-basics subgenius shows

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,960
We talked about Bob, our guru, and Slack, our goal

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,800
And we're still on the basics now

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,240
But...

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,960
But this time, it's the...

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,120
The really personal basics

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,740
I mean, severely personal

44
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,660
This is like...

45
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,140
The, uh...

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,640
The emotional side of the church of the subgenius

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,080
A show, dear friends

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,380
For subgeniuses to feel sorry for themselves over

49
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,880
But not to feel alone, nay nay

50
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,480
So, if you want our usual

51
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,260
A wacky humor-filled

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,060
Dobsfull

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
Worship, uh...

54
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,380
Uh...

55
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,900
Then tune in next week

56
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,600
This one's an experiment

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,220
And to many of you, this show is...

58
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,260
Is...

59
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,520
Is usually just a sh...

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,380
A shot of weird yucks

61
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,520
And to others, well, I wouldn't go so far as to call it a suicide prevention show

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,420
I mean, we've only gotten three letters from people who decided against suicide

63
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,340
Strictly on the basis of the church of the subgenius

64
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,680
But it...

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,960
But I think it is, in a way, a depression-preventing show

66
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,040
In a strange way

67
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,000
In that it's for certain people

68
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,820
Uh...

69
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,040
Some people, I'm sure, we drive into depression

70
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,040
But for the people who constantly must battle despair with sick humor

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,120
Well, uh...

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,740
You know, we've almost fallen into a formula

73
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,640
And I...

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,000
I...

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,380
I'm sorry

76
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,040
I just decided to take on a new tack this time

77
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,760
And I hope Bob will forgive me

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,440
Frankly, I do not care in the least

79
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,880
Whether you do or not

80
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,460
Ah...

81
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,100
Yeah

82
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,220
Well, see, I just...

83
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,060
Just got this wild hair up my lower colonic organs

84
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,400
And, uh...

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,420
I hope I can get all of this onto one hour

86
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,260
I doubt if I can

87
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,400
See, it's gonna be serious

88
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,040
Now, we don't have much serious

89
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,140
Quote, serious tapes from subgeniuses

90
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,100
Because that goes against our tradition, generally

91
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,140
Now, the book gets serious

92
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,540
So I can use stuff like that

93
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,040
And there's...

94
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,340
But there is a band which

95
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,400
And now, some of you may be tired of this

96
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,900
But it's about the only band that's been consistently

97
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,220
Sinking up with the...

98
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,800
The true subgenius sensibilities about real life

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,020
As I see it

100
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,820
And I'm talking about Oingo Boingo

101
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,360
And now, usually we're pretty nepotistic

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,200
And, uh...

103
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,180
Stick to bands whose members we know personally

104
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
Ironically, Oingo Boingo's music

105
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,460
Is about as close to subgenius as you can get

106
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,940
But we don't know them

107
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
On the other hand, they're great

108
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,880
I mean, you can understand most of the lyrics

109
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,500
Uh...

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:46,740
They...

111
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,300
There's actual arrangements

112
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,020
So it's not as repetitive as most...

113
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,900
Rock and roll

114
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,160
There's a lot of surprises and little flourishes

115
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Almost like show music

116
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,520
But mainly, it's the mood, dear friends

117
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,300
Uh...

118
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:03,740
I...

119
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,160
I...

120
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,480
I identify with Danny Elfman

121
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,080
Who writes most of the songs

122
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,040
Because he...

123
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,340
He likes to look and sound like the devil

124
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
I'm into that

125
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,960
And also...

126
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,940
And also he does straight dramatic film work

127
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,720
He scores films on the side

128
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,760
Another thing I can identify...

129
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,000
Now...

130
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,140
I love the Swingin' Love Corpses

131
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,220
And Doctors for Bob

132
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,800
But...

133
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey...

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,620
Oingo Boingo's still one of my favorite bands

135
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,920
Even if you can buy their stuff in the record store

136
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,740
And even though...

137
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,080
I don't know them

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,840
So this is sort of like a combination of, uh...

139
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,380
Hero worship

140
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,220
And zero worship

141
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,440
If you know what I mean

142
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:41,880
I think...

143
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,320
I think these guys...

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,780
And this is the subject of tonight's show

145
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,880
I think they know what it feels like

146
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,660
To be a subgenius

147
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,000
Which...

148
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,780
Frankly is more than I can say

149
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,860
For a whole lot of the bobbies out there

150
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,660
The songs I'm gonna play

151
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,780
Seem to pinpoint exactly the elements

152
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,380
Often...

153
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,460
That often combine in a person's life

154
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,440
Which leave you no alternative but

155
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius

156
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,880
In some ways...

157
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,600
Also...

158
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,620
Music is...

159
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,140
You know, a lot better than words

160
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,120
At expressing the...

161
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,900
The emotional...

162
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,340
The emotional side of all this, dear friends

163
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,980
But what we can do to bring light

164
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:45,080
From every place among these treebr

165
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,180
I hope you...

166
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,200
Have you ever felt that somehow you were not yourself?

167
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,320
That your body was the same but everything around you wasn't right

168
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,640
That image is so strange and foreign, flooded in like raging water

169
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,060
Have you ever been in love with someone you hardly knew?

170
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,940
Whereas every time you closed your eyes, you saw this person come alive

171
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,200
It kept you wide awake at night, you felt like you were burning up

172
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,480
It made you want to scream

173
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,280
Then you passed out

174
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,460
Memories

175
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,800
Just once or twice is good for your soul

176
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,040
Just once or twice is good for your soul

177
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,020
If you don't stop, you lose control

178
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,300
Just once or twice is good for your soul

179
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,360
Just once or twice is good for your soul

180
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,720
Just once or twice is good for your soul

181
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,500
Ever lay there half asleep all hours of the night

182
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:24,440
With some maggoty man tugging at that tiny bell inside your mind

183
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,260
And suddenly that strange idea bursts into an inspiration

184
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,860
You grapple with that man

185
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,220
You grapple with that man

186
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,660
You grapple with that man

187
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,620
The whole thing slips right in your mind

188
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:35,620


189
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:35,620


190
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,180
You really think you're own

191
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,180


192
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,680
You're

193
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:39,880
your

194
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:39,880


195
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,560
you

196
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,380
You've

197
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,600
ever been so

198
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,420
afraid

199
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,640
Maybe this is it

200
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:43,640


201
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:43,720
The

202
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,940
More

203
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,140
I

204
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,720
Have

205
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,580
Ter primitive

206
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,100
You feel

207
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,960
more

208
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,740
ceremony

209
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:58,920
Like

210
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,020
ordinary

211
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,220
I

212
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,220


213
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,220


214
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,360
Now, you see, friends, those of you who are already Oingo Boingo fans,

215
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,980
you might as well just turn your recorders off.

216
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,300
But I think this is important.

217
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,080
And what got me on this was, believe it or not, a dream.

218
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,700
I don't have lucid dreams very often, but when I do, they seem to count somehow.

219
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,980
And in this particular dream, you'll like this.

220
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,300
This was a sexy dream.

221
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,640
In the dream, I was at a true Hollywood orgy with my wife.

222
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,680
And I've never actually been to one of those,

223
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,140
but I've heard firsthand stories from some of my more swinging-type buddies in L.A.

224
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,820
And so I had some idea.

225
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,480
I read about that kind of thing.

226
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,720
I kind of had an idea.

227
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,360
Anyway, in the dream, we walked in the door, and everybody was swapping and getting into it.

228
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,660
And it all seemed very natural, you know, naked.

229
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,120
People all over the place.

230
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,400
It seemed sort of healthy, you know, almost.

231
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,220
Of course, it kind of freaked me out, I think, a little bit.

232
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:52,180
But, hey, you know, and of course, there's a certain amount of worry about diseases there.

233
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,780
But this is where the dream got a little ugly.

234
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,700
It was like every time I approached a woman,

235
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:04,960
and I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to die.

236
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,420
And these were all free women.

237
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,800
She'd seem to find some excuse to gravitate off to some other guy.

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,280
And pretty soon, I'm standing there realizing that everybody else has a partner.

239
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,420
And I'm the odd man out, standing alone.

240
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,120
Even my wife's having a ball, so to speak, off of some stud.

241
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,740
Even the ugly guys and girls are sharing this wonderful, sexy time.

242
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,480
Nothing really sleazy about it.

243
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,300
It's all very natural.

244
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,880
But there I...

245
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,840
I stand alone.

246
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,440
And I woke up feeling horrible.

247
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,060
Of course, I always wake up feeling horrible.

248
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,740
But this was...

249
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,980
This time, it was somehow very familiar.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,820
And I realized what the dream was really about.

251
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,880
And it was about high school.

252
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,600
Now, my...

253
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,800
Rom...

254
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,180
Yeah, I'm getting personal, folks.

255
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,420
I'm sticking my neck out here.

256
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,740
But, see, my romantic life is fine.

257
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,220
Now.

258
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,780
And has been, actually, for just about 20 years.

259
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,880
But high school, man.

260
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,940
High school.

261
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,440
Oh, the hell of it, friends.

262
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,600
The sheer hell.

263
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,580
It made me what I am today.

264
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,760
You know, that's for sure.

265
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
A professional hater.

266
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,960
But I think the true subgeniuses among you can perceive that it isn't really your average pink kind of hate.

267
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,580
I think you can tell that.

268
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,500
It's...

269
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,680
In a way, it's a hate disguise.

270
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,500
Because the true horror is easier discussed...

271
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,760
...through exaggeration and bulldada.

272
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,440
And it's almost too awful to put into words seriously.

273
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,780
And that horror, dear friends...

274
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,040
That horror is not the hate.

275
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,560
But...

276
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,780
For the subgenius, in a way, the loneliness.

277
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,640
You've all never found me.

278
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,700
But of course you will, because I am.

279
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:27,700


280
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,700
It's the most

281
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:30,700


282
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:30,700


283
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:30,700


284
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,020
but my love is there.

285
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Yep, that's it.

286
00:13:47,700 --> 00:14:03,940
These are my private things.

287
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,140
They're there against the wall.

288
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,620
The dirty pictures, religious objects.

289
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,700
These are my private things.

290
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,220
They're there without a clue.

291
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
This is my private bed.

292
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,360
This is where I lie at night.

293
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,820
Staring at a light bulb hanging on the ceiling.

294
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,320
Waiting for dreams to call me.

295
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,560
They're there without a clue.

296
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,120
I'm in my humble room at night.

297
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,060
I've been wondering what goes on up there.

298
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,660
What makes the world so scared?

299
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,140
I hold a stare at the people passing by.

300
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,080
But they can see this room high with no shades.

301
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,440
It's like a mountain high.

302
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,280
I cry, I...

303
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,080
This is my private bed.

304
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,820
This is my private life.

305
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,180
This is my private life.

306
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,680
This important and dangerous life.

307
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,540
This is my private life.

308
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
And this is my private life.

309
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,200
This is my private life.

310
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,560
This is my private life.

311
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,820
All my problems and goals.

312
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,480
And I really want to know

313
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,680
how can I not lose control.

314
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,600
This is my private life.

315
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,180
This is my private life.

316
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,840
This is my private life.

317
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,200
Don't look back, please.

318
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,960
This is my private life.

319
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,600
This is my private life.

320
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,060
This is my private life.

321
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,080
This is my private life.

322
00:15:42,640 --> 00:16:02,200
This is my private life

323
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,660
This is my private life

324
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,080
This is my private life

325
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:34,080
This is my private life

326
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:59,920
This is my private life

327
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:32,780
This is my private life

328
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:47,780
This is my private life

329
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:34,040
This is my private life

330
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:02,280
This is my private life

331
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:34,080
This is my private life

332
00:20:34,100 --> 00:21:03,740
This is my private life

333
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:33,820
This is my private life

334
00:21:34,100 --> 00:22:01,660
This is my private life

335
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:33,000
This is my private life

336
00:22:47,020 --> 00:23:03,560
This is my private life

337
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:32,760
This is my private life

338
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,540
This is my private life

339
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:34,080
This is my private life

340
00:24:50,240 --> 00:25:01,420
This is my private life

341
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,080
This is my private life

342
00:25:46,520 --> 00:26:00,000
This is my private life

343
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,080
This is my private life

344
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,040
This is my private life

345
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,280
This is my private life

346
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,520
Just call me

347
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:43,640
Always

348
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,420
Always

349
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,180
Always

350
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,720
And so

351
00:26:49,720 --> 00:27:01,280
And so

352
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,280
You know, there may be parties and friends and so on,

353
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,280
but you can still feel isolated amidst all that,

354
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,540
and it has a tendency to harden you,

355
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,700
not just to your own problems, but also to everybody else's.

356
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,760
You start getting numb, numb to the woes of the world.

357
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,760
In fact, even to immediate disasters

358
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,080
and there are accidents happening right in front of you.

359
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,240
You and 50 other people can watch from your apartment window

360
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,580
while some woman's being raped outside

361
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,700
and not one of you calls the police

362
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,600
or a purse snatcher grabs an old lady's purse

363
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,540
and nobody chases them because it's not their job.

364
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,120
Because we only do our jobs.

365
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,040
Because that's all we're taught to care about.

366
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,720
I thought I heard somebody cry

367
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,920
I thought I heard somebody

368
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,680
Oh, what's the truth I can find

369
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,260
Like troubles in the dead of night

370
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,740
Like shadows in the moonlight

371
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,580
I thought I heard somebody cry

372
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,260
A choir with a single voice

373
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,300
A click on a clip

374
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,380
And it's hitting me like an insect

375
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,720
To pick up on your thoughts

376
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,260
It isn't true

377
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,780
I am not a ghost

378
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,780
Without a soul

379
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,120
Go, listen to my heart

380
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,060
You feel the beat

381
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:07,460
Stop, listen to the sound

382
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,340
Of moving feet

383
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,560
Walk through the holes of night

384
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,300
When I'm asleep I'm not feeling

385
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,380
I don't believe

386
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,480
I don't believe

387
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,200
Get out of my mind

388
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:39,980
Bring a bottle of pop And bet your head on the button

389
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,840
And don't let go

390
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,320
If you got me falling

391
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,160
I'm an angel

392
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,440
I'm take that 거야

393
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:44,620
I'm taking you from here

394
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:44,860
You got me growing

395
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm taking you down

396
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,820
I'm taking you down

397
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,660
Why he depression

398
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:47,740
Another hole in my brain

399
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:47,740


400
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:47,740


401
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:47,740


402
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,860
I'm not the one that's feeling it

403
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,540
Hey, girl, sometimes it's too much

404
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:49,540


405
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:49,540


406
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,940
For a little while away from me By the dawn ó 0 ó On the hill over the K button of my club

407
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,360
I got a real

408
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:50,080
I am not

409
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,200
Listen to my heart

410
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,160
You feel the beat

411
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,660
Stop

412
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,580
Listen to the sound

413
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,440
A moving beat

414
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,980
Walk

415
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,740
Through the halls at night

416
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,540
When I'm asleep

417
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,460
I don't believe

418
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,500
I don't believe

419
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,760
I don't believe

420
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,920
It isn't true

421
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,480
Listen to my heart

422
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,440
You feel the beat

423
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,880
Stop

424
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,720
Listen to the sound

425
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,660
A moving beat

426
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,360
I don't believe

427
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,380
I don't believe

428
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,680
You wonder with a single voice

429
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,820
I'm thinking you're the cliff

430
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,060
I don't believe

431
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,060


432
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,660
I can't allow the inside

433
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,840
To be the bulletproof

434
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,800
I'm moving and moving

435
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,540
Like rivers from your eyes

436
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,480
I thought I heard somebody cry

437
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,680
Somebody might be lost

438
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,800
I thought I heard somebody cry

439
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,900
I thought I'd go and see

440
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,060
I thought I heard somebody cry

441
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,260
Somebody might be me

442
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,320
Somebody might be me

443
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,560
I probably should have played

444
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,200
Nothing Bad Ever Happens to Me

445
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,440
but they run that one on MTV too much

446
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,800
In junior high

447
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,540
is when most of us first learned

448
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,060
just how to play music

449
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,420
where being fair and decent will get you.

450
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:07,000
You find out that popularity is largely based on your skill at cruelty, mainly psychological

451
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,480
cruelty, banding together against the loners and geeks, or else the rival cliques.

452
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,500
Not all subgeniuses were the lone weirdos, either.

453
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,780
I was sort of a popular kind of weirdo, believe it or not.

454
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:29,480
But I was a romantic, and that was my secret vice and my downfall.

455
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,280
I couldn't act too nice or too sensitive, too vulnerable.

456
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,700
I couldn't admit that.

457
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,240
Even more than wanting to bed them girls, I just wanted true love.

458
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,940
And having to hide that, to maintain the coolness, is what makes you feel alone.

459
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,060
My life in high school was an unending hell.

460
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,380
And I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that.

461
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,060
I'm not...

462
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,180
I don't think I'll be embarrassed later to say it, either.

463
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,660
In a way, it was a lot like that movie Less Than Zero, if you've seen that.

464
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,400
Only without the sex.

465
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,600
You know, in high school, it's pretty hard to get laid if you let on that you care.

466
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:19,040
And the impenetrable shell that I built to hide that fact has lasted to this day.

467
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,400
Now, I've been married for 13 years, happily.

468
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,920
I lucked out just before I was about to kill myself from loneliness.

469
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:30,100
But when I had that dream I mentioned earlier about rejection,

470
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:37,040
I realized that that pain and misery was still deep down in there to this day.

471
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,180
And that shell has only been...

472
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,720
It's been modified and focused, actually, I think.

473
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,880
Focused into the host of this show.

474
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:54,920
And...

475
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,900
It's not a cult or something like that.

476
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,480
I love your music, levels.

477
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,480


478
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,480


479
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,480


480
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,680
M-No.

481
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,640
It's just the opinion I heard of your one song again.

482
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,040
You mean...

483
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,220
None?

484
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,220


485
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,220


486
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,440
Probably?

487
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,760
You were going to pretend deal only by those delicious notes, didn't you?

488
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:21,760


489
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:21,760


490
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,640
No emotion, no emotion

491
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,480
Islands on the land

492
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,640
Fly like feathers down

493
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,060
Islands in the city

494
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,240
All alone in such a city

495
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,020
Islands in the city

496
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,480
What's come over me?

497
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,280
We are both surrounded by water

498
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,900
And the water

499
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,400
Is it a limit? Sorry

500
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,040
I am the biggest thing

501
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,240
Anything at all

502
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,080
To break us up

503
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,180
I'm not a dream

504
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,460
I'm not a dream

505
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,440
I'm not a dream

506
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,220
I'm not a dream

507
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm not a dream

508
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,020
I'm not a dream

509
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,900
I'm not a dream

510
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,120
I'm not a dream

511
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,900
I'm not a dream

512
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
I'm not a dream

513
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,240
I'm not a dream

514
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,960
I'm not a dream

515
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,640
ặ�

516
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,060
I'm not a dream

517
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,880
I'm not a dream

518
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,060
I'm not a dream

519
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,540
I'm not a dream

520
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,640
My life hasn't changed

521
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,220
And I am wandering

522
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,220


523
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,700
guitar solo

524
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Oh, so much like me

525
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,040
Ignorance and shame

526
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,560
No emotion, no emotion

527
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,160
I love sparkle and

528
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,280
I like desert sand

529
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,920
I love to love city

530
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,060
All the other sides of the city

531
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,960
I love to love city

532
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,200
I love to love city

533
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,340
I love to love city

534
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,580
To the world and free

535
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,440
I love to love city

536
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,880
I love desert sand

537
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,700
I love to love city

538
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,160
I love to love city

539
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,060
I love desert sand

540
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:34,020
Oh, so much like me

541
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,220
Ignorance and shame

542
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,840
We're all friends.

543
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:53,500
You know, a lot of things can contribute to that feeling of alienation.

544
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,420
All kinds of things.

545
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,500
Being a minority.

546
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,500
That's probably a pretty popular one.

547
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,500
Wearing glasses or being fat.

548
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,100
I've had both of those.

549
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,640
Being Jewish or whatever.

550
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Being an abused child.

551
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,500
Having alcoholic parents.

552
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,680
Having neurotic compulsions.

553
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,660
Homosexuality or whatever.

554
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,740
Being handicapped.

555
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,280
Being ugly or thinking you're ugly.

556
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,660
In school, see, I thought I was hideous.

557
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:32,700
Because that seemed like the only possible explanation for my lousy luck with girls in those days.

558
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,380
It couldn't have been a lack of status or coolness.

559
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,280
But I heard the same thing every time.

560
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,860
But it would ruin our friendship.

561
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,260
I just want to be your friend.

562
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,780
Geez, I thought, you mean you can only make out with people who aren't your friends?

563
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,280
So, you know, I just assumed that I was like the hunchback of Notre Dame or the Phantom of the Opera or something.

564
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:05,680
But the weird thing is, since then, I mean years, years later, I talked to some of those women on whom I had these spectacularly unrecognizable,

565
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,740
unquieted crushes.

566
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:12,480
And much to my surprise, it turned out that they mostly actually thought I was cute.

567
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,040
But they were scared of me.

568
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,280
Because I was too intense.

569
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
Too remote.

570
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,820
Too mysterious.

571
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,980
See, it was my own damn fault, friends.

572
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:30,860
It was all within arm's reach if I just hadn't swallowed the conspiracy line about what it is that girls liked.

573
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,520
Putting up that shell.

574
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,660
But you see, I'm sorry.

575
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:35,660


576
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,840
Fortunately, most of the girls swallowed the conspiracy line, too, about what girls like.

577
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,280
And they made it true.

578
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:52,320
The guys that treated them like dirt and really honestly didn't consider them human, they scored all the time, my friends.

579
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:19,260
I think that the dude that did it was a very����

580
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:19,260


581
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,440
a loved one and they wanted to be better than him, because today the girl who was Salvador

582
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:24,920
didn't like him.

583
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,600
And I think that's so easy, right?

584
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:32,920


585
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:32,940

T

593
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:48,980
When the office things get rough as action, his demeanor's staring at a paper he has lost inside his head.

594
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:58,420
Dreaming of a battlefield with guns and ammunition all around the bodies of the wounded and the dead.

595
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,480
And the dead.

596
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:24,580
And the dead.

597
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,700
And the dead.

598
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,240
He was dead.

599
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,500
He was dead.

600
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,440
He's not dead.

601
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,900
He's not dead.

602
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,220
He's not dead.

603
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,460
He's not dead.

604
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:23,140
Walking round and round in circles, waking up in a cold sweat, falling down the stairway at the GDD.

605
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,620
He's not dead yet.

606
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,400
Well, friends, you know, the funny thing is,

607
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,840
about all that stuff, I did get the last laugh, I must say.

608
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:40,200
You know, when it came to that particular aspect, I beat out the cool guys.

609
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,000
I really did.

610
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,240
The nerd triumphant can be the coolest.

611
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,660
He can also be the stupidest.

612
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,400
I'm not, you know.

613
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,980
But see, at the time, it just about drove me to madness.

614
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,940
It drove me to make weird movies.

615
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,200
I made weird movies that were really sick.

616
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,600
It drove me to try to be a bonafide hippie, which was a little bit late.

617
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,320
I mean, this was like the early 70s.

618
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,600
Because that seemed like the only way I could, the only clique I could fit into well enough to maybe score.

619
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,200
And, man, I knew every lead guitarist of every band that nobody's ever heard of anymore.

620
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,960
Oh, hip, hip dude.

621
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,160
And eventually I scored the woman of my dreams.

622
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,480
And gradually I realized, though, that the 60s were being sold.

623
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,040
And...

624
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,760
And, uh...

625
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:35,640
And most of those hippies were most just fake copycat jargon mouther's like everybody else.

626
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,000
People so flattened out by the conspiracy that, uh...

627
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,860
And the thinking that it gives you that they ended up having to adapt prefabricated personalities, if you know what I mean.

628
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,900
And now, you know what?

629
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,820
I'm noturoistan.

630
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,400
The dangerous acts...

631
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,760
And just, you know...

632
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:17,760


633
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:17,780
Did you have friends from the same year on?

634
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:17,780


635
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:17,780


636
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:17,780


637
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,040


638
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,200

00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,860
I'm privilegeeuss,

642
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,520
SC3nn u parmi gej r games?

643
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,900
I can't remember them all and I say

644
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,800
Who do you want to be today?

645
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,620
Who do you want to be?

646
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,360
Who do you want to be today?

647
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,280
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

648
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,240
Just like somebody on TV

649
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,560
I think I'll be a teddy boy

650
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,440
I think I'll be a hunk

651
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,880
I think I'll be a tough guy

652
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,920
And I think I'll be a punk

653
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,700
I might just be a fashion star

654
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,680
All dressed in curly rags

655
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,400
With my hands across the other side

656
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,080
And walk around and say

657
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,740
Who do you want to be today?

658
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,660
Who do you want to be?

659
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,340
Who do you want to be today?

660
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,200
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

661
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,100
Just like somebody on TV

662
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,860
Do you like to live just like a rock

663
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,480
In the middle of the sea?

664
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,260
Do you want to suffer by yourself

665
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,980
In a pool of less than three?

666
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,900
Do you feel like a saint in artist clothes

667
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,680
With a rosary in your hand?

668
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,480
Do you want to be crazy like Bando

669
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,900
Like a stranger in a strange, strange land?

670
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,640
Would you rather push the buttons

671
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,500
And be a fear-bought artist?

672
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:28,940
Can humanity

673
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,640
Or perhaps you like to be our boss

674
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,940
Do you want to be stupid just like me?

675
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,980
Who do you want to be today?

676
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,820
Who do you want to be?

677
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,580
Who do you want to be today?

678
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,540
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

679
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,660
Just like somebody on TV

680
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,660
Who do you want to be today?

681
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,280
Who do you want to be today?

682
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,500
Who do you want to be today?

683
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:58,840
today

684
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,020
And well, you know friends when you when you can't seem to get

685
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,800
real feelings out of people out of real people

686
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:30,300
You end up trying to make do with manufactured feelings from oh say religion or

687
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,680
meaningless job

688
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,940
Ambitions or from drugs naturally I chose the drugs

689
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:42,740
I mean I wasn't stupid but by the time I was 21 I'd perm I had to permanently withdraw from serious teen

690
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,940
alcoholism that I'd originally gotten into

691
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:52,140
Because it cured the nightmarish flashbacks. I suffered from bad acid trips

692
00:48:53,800 --> 00:49:00,280
So I mean kids, you know, you don't you don't need to do that. I had to deal with some pretty serious symptoms of the

693
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,280
subgenius loneliness and it occasionally turned into rage

694
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,080
but that could be controlled either by

695
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,300
writing and such like or joking around with my buddies who were all

696
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,100
incredibly funny guys at the time or

697
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,720
Fropping or whatever, but then we all grew up

698
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:18,880
and suddenly

699
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,500
When we grew up the fakery and the deceit

700
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,380
Became even more necessary to get by

701
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:34,080
And the paradoxes and the total absurdities of the world situation

702
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,560
The social prejudices and especially work dear friends

703
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,180
You find out the conspiracy is so much worse and yet so much more tempting

704
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:49,840
Than you thought when you were an idealistic student that it becomes almost impossible to pursue real slack

705
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,160
but almost

706
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,140
mandatory to accumulate

707
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,160
All slack, you know what choices we have dear friends cults

708
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,200
political groups

709
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,220
half-assed environmental causes

710
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,140
rock and roll stars drugs you

711
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:07,480
know

712
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,600
People raise a voice

713
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,280
Don't get caught in that mess

714
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,620
Like the fly in the spike in the well

715
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,800
Is it true more is less

716
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,060
Heard it like the happy flock

717
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,120
To the big TV slaughter

718
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,720
Why don't you break that leash

719
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,240
Set the habit to rest

720
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,300
It's a new generation

721
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,920
It's a hallucination

722
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,640
It's a mystic vibration

723
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,720
It's just interesting

724
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:53,780
It's a new generation

725
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:53,780


726
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,380
It's the will of the people

727
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,280
It's the church with the steeple

728
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,660
It's the sacred devotion

729
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,620
To unbind the denotion

730
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,700
People raise a voice

731
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,380
Don't fall into that trap

732
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,740
When your friends and your neighbors push

733
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,780
Why don't you break that leash

734
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:23,780


735
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:23,780


736
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:23,780


737
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:23,780


738
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:23,780


739
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:23,780


740
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:23,780


741
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,780
Don't you push them back

742
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,120

00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,200
Which eludes him and incompetence

This is not common sense

775
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,900
And it makes you feel just like a babe

776
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,820

And that is his religion to cosmology

783
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,780
