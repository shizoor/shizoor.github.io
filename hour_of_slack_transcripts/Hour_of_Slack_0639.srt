1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:14,180
The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,380
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,980
is intended only as humor and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,440
Atlanta, its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

5
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,180
Hit it.

6
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,940
Here we go.

7
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:58,960
Here we go.

8
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Here we go.

9
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,720
Here we go.

10
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,520
Here we go.

11
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:47,680
Here we go.

12
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,560
Here we go.

13
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,560
Here we go.

14
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,100
It's a man, it's a man, it's a man

15
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,500
It's a man, it's a man, it's a man

16
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,760
Better think about the future

17
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,940
Yeah, it's time we planned it

18
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,120
Better think about our future

19
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,140
It's time to get off this planet

20
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,380
So, pack your suit bags and grab that track

21
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,560
It's a desk for it

22
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,740
Guys, get to it

23
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,040
It's a man, it's a man, it's a man

24
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,480
It's a man, it's a man, it's a man

25
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,400
Yeah, it's time to stop nowadays

26
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,980
Not produced, done, gorgeous

27
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,660
Whoa, damn.

28
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,700
Damn, look at this place.

29
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,340
Oh, I ain't cleaning up after this mess, baby.

30
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,560
Earth looks just like Keith Moon's hotel room.

31
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,560
The X's aren't even here yet.

32
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,240
Boy, is it ever time for Bob to run this planetary Titanic

33
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,340
smack into the X's iceberg.

34
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,880
Oh, yes, Seekers.

35
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,380
The hour of our glorious subgenius Shagnarok is at hand.

36
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,460
Ooh, and I've got packing to do.

37
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,800
Oh, let's check it off here and see.

38
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,140
Ruby slippers, black pajamas, roll of quarters, pudding.

39
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,740
Ah, screw the Nikes.

40
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,440
They don't make a stiletto pump.

41
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,640
Oh, boy, am I ever ready to set sail over the rainbow

42
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,980
with my precious subgenius cult

43
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,300
on that mellow slack road through space and time.

44
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,600
Oh, I only hope I can hold out.

45
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,460
Oh, damn.

46
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,180
But June has been a rough month for the flues here.

47
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,400
Oh, I've been seriously preparing for this event for two months

48
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,860
and, oh, I'm nowhere near ready for it.

49
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,620
Oh, I've still got pasties to sew and props to gather

50
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,060
and tapes to make and rants to write.

51
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,240
Oh, plus Stank Hall asking me to make the giant clock for the pavilion.

52
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,420
The most important clock ever created

53
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,420
for the most important hour in all of subgenius history.

54
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,520
Oh, my God.

55
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:55,640
Oh, my God.

56
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,640


57
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,640


58
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,640


59
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,640


60
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,920
The clock that will strike out the last hour

61
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,400
of human existence on planet Earth.

62
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,800
Ooh, not too much pressure there now, is it?

63
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,260
Oh, but hey, yeah, I can do it.

64
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,080
I can do it, yeah.

65
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,980
I'm the biggest clock tease I know.

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,200
Oh, yes, let me make a final introduction of myself here.

67
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,980
I'm your sinister minister, the Reverend Susie the Fluesian.

68
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,760
And this?

69
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,900
This is my last episode ever of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

70
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,480
The last episode before final total global apocalypse.

71
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,660
Ooh, and don't think that doesn't give me

72
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,840
just a little performance anxiety.

73
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,980
Oh, because I never thought I'd make it to this day, Seekers,

74
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,720
but now it's time for us to party like it's 1998.

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,660
Oh, and I'm frazzled to a frayed thread.

76
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,740
Thanks for watching.

77
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,840
Special thanks to the end times of vicious scheduling.

78
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,680
I've had to turn in three shows this month.

79
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,460
When the crappy equipment here

80
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,340
screwed up the last two Stan copies,

81
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,140
I had to go back in and do some cells-style reengineering

82
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,340
so it's been to ata one of five shows

83
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,160
for me on top of everything else.

84
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,220
If only all this added weight on my shoulders

85
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,420
were extra boobs.

86
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,160
Oh, So, please forgive me for being .

87
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:29,180
out. Oh, it's nothing compared to the way they're going to get birds in just one short week.

88
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:44,380
Oh, well. I may be going way over to my seekers because, oh, you wouldn't believe how much I have

89
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,260
to cram into this show. But I owe it to you lovely seekers out there to do this right.

90
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,640
Because this is my last chance to pluck the unsaved subgeniuses out of this planetary swill.

91
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:05,540
This is the final opportunity for redemption before the exes whip hand comes down. And, oh,

92
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,920
I can't let you down now. I have a sacred obligation to my ministry and to the true

93
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:20,620
yeti stock among us. Because, children, our heritage awaits us in the stars. And soon,

94
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:31,400
oh, yes, soon, as Bob is my witness, we'll never be slackless again.

95
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,540
Let the judgment begin. I'll get the ball rolling.

96
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,420
The end of the world? How near is it? We hear a great deal today about the end of the world.

97
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,000
When is it going to come? Some have been so presumptuous as to set dates. As a result,

98
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,920
people have sold their worldly goods, gone to a mountaintop somewhere, and waited for the end of

99
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,460
the world to come.

100
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,600
Others have taught and preached that there will be no end, that everything will go on as it is.

101
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,500
And both parties are wrong.

102
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:07,400
And I alluded to the fact that certain traditions of men teach that when a planet goes through,

103
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:18,600
or a comet goes through a certain field, was it the great hunter? I think it was. That means the

104
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,580
earth is coming to an end.

105
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,120
And I made the statement that it would be impossible for Hailey Bopp to hit the states unless of the

106
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,780
Americas unless a chunk broke off. And this lady thought I said a chunk was going to break off of

107
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,880
Hailey Bopp and me and the world. I didn't say that, all right. That would be an impossibility

108
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,900
is what I was actually saying. There's nothing out there that's going to run into Hailey Bopp.

109
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,060
But I had fun doing that. I hope you all enjoyed it. But no dates were mentioned other than

110
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,140
astronomical signs, and they had to go through. And I made the statement that it would be impossible

111
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,920
were taking place at those times.

112
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,500
The Church of the Subgenius is surely the church of the future,

113
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,820
or at least what's left of it.

114
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,360
The world as we know it will end in 1998.

115
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,860
1998.

116
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,660
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

117
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,780
Subgeniuses come from a better world and they're going to a better world.

118
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,220
They descended from abominable snowmen and will evolve overnight

119
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,160
on some evening in late 1998 into overmen and overwomen.

120
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,420
It is an unbroken line of continuous change as opposed to that of pinks

121
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,000
who are an evolutionary dead end and have been spinning their wheels

122
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,940
as mere humans for the last million years or so.

123
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,740
Part of that involves freeing the, let's call them the normals,

124
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,140
pinks, the pink boys, the mediocrities from the depression

125
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,100
that the conspiracy is laying on them.

126
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,140
What am I doing?

127
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,080
Hurry, we've got no time to lose.

128
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,020
Going to the zoo?

129
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,040
I wouldn't hear of it.

130
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,120
Why, my little party's just beginning.

131
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,380
Not like mice, rats.

132
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,940
That's right.

133
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,940
Don't hurt them.

134
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,120
Don't hurt them.

135
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,380
Right away.

136
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,140
We'll let them think about it a little first.

137
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,260
It's time to pray, America.

138
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,380
There's a new sitcom coming, folks.

139
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,880
It's called Armegadon for Armageddon.

140
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,120
That's what it's called, Armageddon.

141
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
The greatest war of all wars will be fought.

142
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,940
The Battle of Armageddon will be fought.

143
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,900
The blood will flow in the streets up to the brattles of the horses for 200 miles.

144
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,460
Oh, this is a gap.

145
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,360
Ah!

146
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,860
Ah!

147
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,280
Looking forward to it, Mr. Stanton.

148
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,880
You are the basic truth in us.

149
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,900
You are the reality.

150
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,600
We will never let you down.

151
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,020
And we will always be grateful.

152
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,100
I'll tell you what.

153
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,320
Bob Dobs came to town to set you free.

154
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,600
Surely, I come quickly.

155
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,360
Amen.

156
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:40,400
man. My, people come and go so quickly here. In both instances, he's coming literally, visibly,

157
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,720
and bodily. Brother, every time I see another spaceship going to the moon in the exploration

158
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,320
of the moon and soon driving the new automobiles they're making for the moon, I say, my heart,

159
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,660
he must be coming soon now. Let each one who hears them say the same. Come. Let the thirsty one come.

160
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:01,560
Anyone who wants to, without charge. He who has said all things declares, yes, I am coming.

161
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,100
So, that's a taste of seed. Just try it for yourself.

162
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,740
You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Frightening him like that when he came to you for help.

163
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:23,760
Silence, whippersnapper. The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.

164
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,100
Yes, sir. What did he say? What did he say?

165
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,340
At first, you must prove yourselves worthy by performing a very...

166
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,580
small task.

167
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,860
He didn't tell us to clean up the fish pond. He said to fish in it.

168
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,980
We're in a world full of action. Something is happening.

169
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,160
We're in the race for the young generation. We're on the go. We want to tell all the nation.

170
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,100
Something is happening. Something is happening now.

171
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,740
Now.

172
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,720
Watch out for us. We're in a tonic reaction. Something is happening.

173
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,620
We've got the pressure of a new motivation. We're gonna live at first the chain of formation.

174
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,960
Something is happening. Something is happening now.

175
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,520
Now.

176
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,800
And now we are on the verge of the greatest and the final war.

177
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,540
If we have an all-out war now, let me tell you something. It will be the last.

178
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:31,300
And a blue-ribbon panel of experts from MIT and Harvard University were asked to do a study.

179
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,340
Using the...

180
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,620
Using all of the computers, the military experts and everything else to study and see what is the possibility of a nuclear war in this century.

181
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:47,460
They came back and they said, we expect a limited nuclear war before 1984 and an all-out nuclear holocaust before 1999.

182
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,140
And they said that we see it as inevitable.

183
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,440
And there's good reason for that.

184
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,240
Because of the wonderful things he does.

185
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,460
Those awful days that are still ahead for you and me.

186
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,320
Beginning in chapter...

187
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,400
Chapter 3 of 2 Peter, verses 10 through 14.

188
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,040
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise.

189
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,240
Some have thought this means perhaps a nuclear blast.

190
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,580
And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.

191
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,220
That's tremendous heat, isn't it?

192
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,940
The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up, seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved.

193
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,620
What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?

194
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
I suppose I could put on...

195
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,780
My black costume and fly over the Emerald City a few times on my flaming broomstick.

196
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,980
Double, double toil and trouble.

197
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,520
Fire burns and cauldrons bubble.

198
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,900
This is a potent wind through.

199
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,300
This is a potent wind through.

200
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,300


201
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,500
And we've cooked up just for you.

202
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,940
Just look inside our pot.

203
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,640
And see what it is we've got.

204
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,420
It's made of uranium.

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,120
Uranium.

206
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,180
And it's called the atomic bomb.

207
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,740
Or uranium.

208
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,280
Uranium超аков geography.

209
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,280


210
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,280


211
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,280


212
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,280


213
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,720
exceedederten 잠재력.

214
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,100


215
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,100


216
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,500
All the way up your collarbone.

217
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:57,880
Not am confuse in the dark.

218
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:57,880


219
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,200


220
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,280


221
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,280


222
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,940
What a bugger is he.

223
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:58,940


224
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,120
And he shouldn't use only half a thousand times at a time in a loop.

225
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,600
If you're bolted, you'll watch, wait for credit.

226
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,060
Until the end of the world we gets outraged why we had to goный марini first.

227
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:11,020
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.

228
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,420
They destroyed the world.

229
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,900
The entire Los Angeles area.

230
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,340
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain.

231
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,680
And civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same across the entire country.

232
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,260
Martial law is now nationwide.

233
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:34,640
Major cities in all parts of the country, New York, Los Angeles, report plague victims falling dead in the streets, in their homes, at their work.

234
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,300
The first symptom appears to be severe choking, followed by immediate unconsciousness.

235
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,060
Death occurs within minutes.

236
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,940
Whether a state of war between China and Russia still exists is not important any longer.

237
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,000
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

238
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:54,860
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror, long feared, germ warfare.

239
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,240
Carlo Red, champion.

240
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,980
This is a Class 1 emergency.

241
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,880
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

242
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,060
Stay in your homes.

243
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,260
Stay in your homes.

244
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,340
Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution.

245
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,660
Stay in your homes.

246
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,080
Repeat, Carlo Red channel.

247
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,800
This is a Class 1 emergency.

248
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,560
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

249
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,320
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved, you folks listening by radio, you folks listening by record,

250
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,840
who know not Jesus Christ, once the church is gone, there's going to be a cataclysmic judgment.

251
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,500
And millions will die in those next few years.

252
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,760
Watch World War III on pay TV.

253
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,520
Television can be quite a thrill.

254
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,740
Sitting home in your chair, watch the boys over there.

255
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,560
Charging across your TV screen, being blown to smithereens.

256
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,320
Watch World War III on pay TV.

257
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,600
If you want to keep the kids at home, they'll be glued to their sets.

258
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,240
Watching rockets and jets, blowing up schools and factories.

259
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,120
Putting an end to the birds and bees.

260
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,880
It's worth every penny to tune in and see.

261
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,500
Who wins the Emmy at the root of the academy?

262
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,260
Watch World War III on pay TV before your television melts away.

263
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,980
See the hydrogen bombs explode.

264
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,380
And some mushrooms appear.

265
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,100
You'll be sipping your beer.

266
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,340
Zooming in with a zoomer lens.

267
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,080
Watching while the whole world ends.

268
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,680
It's worth every penny to tune in and see.

269
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,240
Who wins the Emmy at the root of the academy?

270
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,000
Watch World War III on pay TV before your television melts away.

271
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,940
La la la la.

272
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,340
Before your television melts away.

273
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,440
I think they're clear now.

274
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,180
Check the instruments, please Flash.

275
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,980
Yes, we're at about the 250 mile perimeter.

276
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,640
Does Ming's sensing equipment check position beyond here?

277
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,120
Only for approaching objects.

278
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,160
It's safe.

279
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,440
We have to set our course for Earth now.

280
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,100
Since we've made it, we're really free and on our way to Earth.

281
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,580
Yes, dear, and you must admit Aura kept her word to us.

282
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,180
I told you we'd make it.

283
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,540
My ship doesn't get radar challenged leaving Mongrel.

284
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,620
You know that my father's rocket attack is planned for 8 a.m. tomorrow, Earth time.

285
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,460
Yes, I know.

286
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,500
But what you probably don't know is that Ming is sending two waves of attacking rockets.

287
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,460
Two waves?

288
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,140
Why?

289
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,560
The first wave are merely dummy rockets.

290
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,060
Oh, I knew that.

291
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,520
Decoys with remote control and no warning.

292
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,600
They're designed to draw all of Earth's counter rockets and anti-missile fire.

293
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,280
That way Ming hopes to beat the second wave of attack.

294
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,040
We'll catch us on Earth, only our secondary line of defense.

295
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,760
Yes, it's a clever plan.

296
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,460
Our secondary offenses are only for small localized rockets.

297
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,680
It'd never be enough to stop Ming's interplanetary cruisers.

298
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,920
Precisely right.

299
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,440
My father isn't exactly a fool.

300
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,500
How many ships in each wave?

301
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,200
150 in the first wave, the decoy, and 200 in the second.

302
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,200
But Ming may change his plans now that you've helped us escape.

303
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,540
No.

304
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,720
The attack countdown has already started and he doesn't know that I learned of the attack plan.

305
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,280
He'll attack on schedule.

306
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,300
But you'll be able to warn Earth in time.

307
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,600
Flash, what about contacting Earth now?

308
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,300
Let them know right away.

309
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,180
Oh, yeah, baby.

310
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,160
Danger.

311
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,580
You better stop it.

312
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,760
You better stop it.

313
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,140
Danger.

314
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,100
You better stop it.

315
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,860
Danger.

316
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,440
You better stop it.

317
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,580
There's something happening right before our eyes that's more clear than the face of the sky.

318
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,280
And yet many are overlooking what's happening.

319
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,120
Long ago the prophets of Israel predicted a very precise pattern of events that would all come together and so forth.

320
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,720
Now there would be general signs in the weather and in physical phenomena.

321
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,100
Dorothy saw a cloud on the horizon even.

322
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,540
It was big and black.

323
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,700
And from the north she heard something loud.

324
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,860
Wind, storm.

325
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,180
Heaven sent her like a tide.

326
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,340
That sound could mean only one thing.

327
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,840
Bob.

328
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,580
Bob.

329
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,400
Bob.

330
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:08,940
Bob.

331
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,020
Bob will protect you.

332
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,420
Who?

333
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Who's Bob?

334
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,080
If you don't know that, I can't tell you.

335
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,320
It's gonna be just like this.

336
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,060
33 years old, I don't know.

337
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,500
Nobody else really knows.

338
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,200
All I know is our body will be just like his.

339
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,980
No death, no sickness, no sorrow, no need of rest.

340
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,700
You won't have to go to bed at night.

341
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,140
Lock your door.

342
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,300
An eternal glorified body just like his.

343
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,700
Now Bob, I think I got a little problem.

344
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,780
When I asked you if there's something going on because Bob, I didn't have to hear it from your daughter.

345
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,760
I should have heard it from your mouth.

346
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,320
Not his.

347
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,740
I should have heard it from yours and Bob.

348
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,860
He slept with you.

349
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,300
On July 4th weekend.

350
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,420
And the fate you've made rather a bad enemy of the wicked witch of the west.

351
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,000
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

352
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,100
I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether.

353
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,580
But which is the way back to Kansas?

354
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,440
I can't go the way I came.

355
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
No, that's true.

356
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,800
The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of Oz himself.

357
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,000
One day you'll find yourself up to your neck.

358
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,860
In false drugs, false sex, false jobs, false money.

359
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,880
And you'll say, but where's Bob?

360
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,060
Where's Bob?

361
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,420
You mean, you mean there really is a conspiracy?

362
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,680
You mean there really was a Bob?

363
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,100
You mean, you mean I could have had slack and I would have?

364
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,300
Ah!

365
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,700
What's the matter, Bob?

366
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,680
I'm up.

367
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:46,680


368
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,520
Is he good or is he wicked?

369
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,280
Oh, very good, and very mysterious!

370
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,180
He lives in the Emerald City and that's a long journey from here.

371
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,020
But how do I start from here?

372
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
It's always best to start at the beginning.

373
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,220
And all you do is follow the yellow brick road.

374
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,140
Follow the yellow brick road?

375
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,120
Follow the yellow brick road?

376
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:08,980
I can't get off.

377
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,780
Follow the yellow brick road.

378
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,720
Follow the yellow brick road.

379
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,660
Follow the yellow brick road.

380
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,340
Follow the yellow brick road.

381
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,220
Follow the yellow brick road.

382
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,520
There is a fabled land,

383
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,580
A strange and chatted land,

384
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,360
Where munchkins live and laugh and play.

385
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,300
This wondrous fairyland,

386
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,960
With jewels and flowers,

387
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,320
To a city's brand,

388
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,900
Is a place far, far away.

389
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,260
We all should spend some time,

390
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,260
Where living is sublime,

391
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,620
And troubles seem to melt away.

392
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,800
A thousand magic tricks,

393
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,700
And a road of yellow bricks,

394
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,400
Takes us to this land so gay.

395
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,900
Of course people do go both ways.

396
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,660
A new dimension opens up.

397
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,240
And I want to get back there so badly,

398
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,580
I'm going all the way to Emerald City,

399
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,980
To get the Wizard of Oz to help me.

400
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,560
You're going to see a wizard?

401
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,240
Do you think if I went with you,

402
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,320
This wizard would give me some brains?

403
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
I couldn't say.

404
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,100
Won't you take me with you?

405
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,320
Why of course I will.

406
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,020
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!

407
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,060
You're not starting out very well.

408
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,080
Oh I'll try. Really I will.

409
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,980
To us? To us.

410
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,160
This strange enchanted land,

411
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,820
Where trouble and strife are left behind.

412
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,860
This wondrous fairy land,

413
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,780
Where life is always grand.

414
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,440
This land of ours,

415
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,620
Is in your mind.

416
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,740
Is in your mind.

417
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,640
Is in your mind.

418
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,620
There's no place like home.

419
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,320
There's no place like home.

420
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,200
There's no place like home.

421
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,320
There's no place like home.

422
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,700
There's no place like home.

423
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:24,840
There's no place like home.

424
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,420
Wake up, honeymoon.

425
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,860
There's no place like...

426
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,620
World leaders are looking for something Phillipp's

427
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,520
drastic to happen soon.

428
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,460
Some call it the end of the world.

429
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,940
others the world's greatest war, and still others the coming again of the Lord Jesus Christ.

430
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,520
Teller, the father of the atomic bomb, tells us that Russia will be able to destroy us soon.

431
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,960
Yuri, the atomic scientist, has a doomsday clock, which is now set at 11.58,

432
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,500
two minutes before midnight.

433
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,820
And this, of course, has to do with a nuclear helicast.

434
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,480
Here is the instrument of cleansing, my brethren.

435
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,800
And nothing quite cleanses like fire.

436
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,380
Lord, Lord!

437
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:08,820
Lord!

438
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,660
To go into hell's fire, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

439
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,600
The fire is not quenched.

440
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,440
The fire is not quenched.

441
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,820
In Isaiah 33, 14, who among us shall dwell with devouring fire?

442
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,640
Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burning?

443
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,960
See the bomb, the door is open.

444
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,700
A bomb drop, big enough for you to carry if you're strong enough,

445
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,300
and this is the target by 200 yards.

446
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,300
When that bomb burst, 100,000 Japanese people died.

447
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,420
Some didn't because it burst out in fingers and behind hills and mountains.

448
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,940
Some of those homes even were protected.

449
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,680
One man who lived behind a great hill, a great bridge out in front of him,

450
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,820
stood on his foot and was shot.

451
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,160
He could move not a muscle except his eyes.

452
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,080
He said something and he stood there for many hours.

453
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,320
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.

454
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,640
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.

455
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,560
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.

456
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,920
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.

457
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,760
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.

458
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,780
And he looked up, over the top of the hill came 100 colored people.

459
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,040
He said, not only am I, am I in shock, but I've lost my mind.

460
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,880
There are no colored people in Japan.

461
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,700
Down the hill they come.

462
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,380
Some would fall and others would travel them to death.

463
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,960
Some got to the bridge and stood on the bridge and cursed

464
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,520
and jumped in the water committing suicide.

465
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,940
Oh, he said, it's when they cursed that I came out of my shock.

466
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,540
These weren't black people.

467
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,820
These were my old Japanese people, charred black by that terrible bomb.

468
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,720
They push this one button and in the middle of the night your radio and TV comes on.

469
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,240
They hope that it'll stall the next few years.

470
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,920
And they will say, Red China has just declared war.

471
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,000
You have 11 minutes to prepare.

472
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,060
Then it said you can either get up and look out the window and watch it happen or lay in bed and wait.

473
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,480
I didn't think it was very funny.

474
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,300
That's the way the world's talking.

475
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,900
I looked through a Gideon Bible one time for tales of great destruction.

476
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,780
The sun was risen upon the earth.

477
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,500
When Lot entered unto Zoar, I read.

478
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,040
Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.

479
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,840
And he overthrew these cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities

480
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,600
and that which grew upon the ground.

481
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,280
So it goes.

482
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,640
Those were vile people in both those cities.

483
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,260
It is well known the world was better off without them.

484
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,380
And Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back.

485
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,460
She was told to look back where all those people in their homes had been.

486
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,400
But she did look back.

487
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,380
And I'd love her for that because it was so human.

488
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,420
So she was turned to a pillar of salt.

489
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,860
So it goes.

490
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,240
People aren't supposed to look back.

491
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,580
I'm certainly not going to do it anymore.

492
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,360
Red alert! Red alert!

493
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,180
Sensing the danger is report.

494
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,640
Nuclear war ends on the East.

495
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,160
Prepare for nuclear attack.

496
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,460
They are armed.

497
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,320
You fools!

498
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,660
Did you think my father and I would give up so easily?

499
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,140
Our nuclear attack force is now inside your defense perimeter without a shot being...

500
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,760
Look! Here come the flying monkeys!

501
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,620
Quick! Everybody down on the ground!

502
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,480
They're spitting peanut fat at us!

503
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,060
Oh, boy!

504
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,820
I thought they were supposed to be peaceful.

505
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,440
They usually are.

506
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,920
I can't understand it.

507
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,920
Careful now.

508
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,000
Get behind me.

509
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,620
Oh, here comes their leader.

510
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,220
It's going to be up to you.

511
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,700
It's going to be up to you.

512
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,560
What are you going to let happen to this planet?

513
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,480
What are you going to do about it?

514
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,180
Bob's going to let you decide what to do about it.

515
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,420
Is that what you're going to...

516
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,600
Are you just going to sit there?

517
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,720
They won't even have to do it.

518
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,860
Bob won't even have to see that the end of the world happens properly.

519
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,900
It'll happen by accident.

520
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,400
The spirits speak it expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,

521
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,920
giving heed to seducing spirits.

522
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,080
Doctrines of demons.

523
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,100
Demonism's on the march.

524
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,660
Demonism is a growing phenomena.

525
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,760
An aerial disease is doubling and tripling all over the nation.

526
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,100
Love cults, hippies, shippies are shouting out their filthy four-letter vocabularies in mixed audiences.

527
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,180
Homosexuals now have organized into the Mattachine Society of America.

528
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,720
With Dick Leach as its president, and he claims 17 million involved in Sodom USA.

529
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,500
God help us.

530
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,520
If this continues, God will have to judge our nation.

531
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,100
Ah!

532
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,580
Ah!

533
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,000
Ah!

534
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:27,980
Ah!

535
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,400
Ah!

536
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,720
Ah!

537
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:28,720


538
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,240
Ah!

539
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,740
Be not deceived, God is not mocked.

540
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,160
All the time mocking

541
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,220
mocking mockies Bob, not too mock, and then have a whole��혹cent, and to will it be burned

542
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,340
up.

543
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,960
Here is evil.

544
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,160
Evil, evil.

545
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,400
Evil.

546
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,760
Is this not the place where all the dead

547
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,260
will burn?

548
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,120
Yes.

549
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,080
And this is the last of the dead.

550
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,160
And what shall we do with him?

551
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,020
My brethren?

552
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,700
Kill him.

553
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:58,700


554
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,900
Burn! Burn!

555
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,300
Burn!

556
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,600
Yes, sir.

557
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,640
Burn!

558
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,920
Give me a time check.

559
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,700
Time, 7 a.m.

560
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,000
Attack power, standby.

561
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,440
Report.

562
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,900
Enemy attack fleet, area 44, position 12.

563
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,560
Approaching 1,000 miles per minute.

564
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,740
Put them on the viewing screen as soon as they're in range.

565
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,200
Viewing screen ready.

566
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:27,960
Report.

567
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,240
Type a number of enemy ships.

568
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,120
Attack force, approximately 300 rocket ships.

569
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,820
300?

570
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Type ASC-7.

571
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,500
Now the question is survival.

572
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,200
Is this the end of technological man?

573
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,720
Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays?

574
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,820
The boasts of our fabled science?

575
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,560
The superhuman conquests of space and time?

576
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,280
The age of the wheel?

577
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,060
We were warned of judgment.

578
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,540
Well.

579
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,440
Here it is.

580
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,320
Here.

581
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:01,860
Now.

582
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,640
This is the end.

583
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,160
Paddy, you and the viewers will be interested in noting that the world ended.

584
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,520
As we know it, Hugh.

585
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,900
You're darn tootin', Paddy.

586
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,480
I sure am.

587
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,420
Just imagine this.

588
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,360
Four or five of their own fighting machines suddenly start off.

589
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,060
Heat rays right and left.

590
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,120
Not a Martian in them.

591
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,680
Not a Martian in them, see?

592
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,720
But men.

593
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,820
Men who've learned the way how.

594
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,440
May even be in our time.

595
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,600
Yes.

596
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:28,720


597
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,800
Imagine having one of them lovely things with a heat ray wide and free.

598
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,440
We'd turn it on Martians.

599
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,360
We'd turn it on men.

600
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,900
We'd bring everybody down on their knees.

601
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,860
That's your plan?

602
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,260
Yeah.

603
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,480
You.

604
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,620
Me.

605
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,960
You and more of us.

606
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,140
We'd own the world.

607
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,520
I see.

608
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,320
Fuck you.

609
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,820
I hear stately Holmas.

610
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,700
I hear it.

611
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:28,700


612
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:28,700


613
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,560
I hate to dismiss, could I have a beautiful smile?

614
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,920
Don't turn off sound down now, nothing else to do

615
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,520
Living life in jungle, not for some of you

616
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,140
I'm not letting you go

617
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,620
You don't deserve here in small

618
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,500
I'm not letting you go

619
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,180
You don't deserve here in small

620
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,980
I'm telling you

621
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,460
You don't deserve here in small

622
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,560
Thank you for the answers, we don't turn our eyes

623
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,020
We can take you anywhere, seven different heights

624
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,520
Don't turn off sound down now, nothing else to do

625
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,040
Living in jungle, not for some of you

626
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,900
I'm not letting you go

627
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,220
You don't deserve here in small

628
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,840
I'm not letting you go

629
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,680
You don't deserve here in small

630
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,820
I'm telling you

631
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,500
Living in jungle

632
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,720
Nice to meet you

633
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:04,800
In jungle

634
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:04,800


635
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,960
Be a Cross-H屍

636
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Nice minute for a one-night stand

637
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,240
Inbase and open

638
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,680
NTM

639
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Generally we are to one side

640
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,980
I'm at the ICS

653
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,340
Look, here's someone who can help you.

654
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,560
You got no business being sick! You got no business being in bondage!

655
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,540
You got no business living out of sin! You got no business living without sight!

656
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,120
This fire-cannon tether sets you free!

657
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:49,560
The Church of the Subgenius is probably the single most important organization in the 20th century.

658
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,660
Oh, Lizard, I have missed you, sweet talk.

659
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,080
There's just one way.

660
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,140
Stay right here. I'll be back in a jiffy.

661
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,160
The witch went into the castle and came out in a few moments carrying a bottle of large, green pills.

662
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,540
I guess Cian's believin', child, he said.

663
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,520
Yes, sir, Cian's believin'. And by golly, it's I.

664
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,920
I'll see you in the rapture.

665
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,560
See you in the rapture.

666
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:27,440
See you at that meeting in the air.

667
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,620
There we'll have lost each savior.

668
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,600
We'll live and reign forever.

669
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,860
I'll see you in the rapture.

670
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,060
Some sweet prayer.

671
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,780
There'll be no excuses. I didn't know.

672
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,200
There'll certainly not be any excuses for you because I just told you.

673
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,260
He said, recognize when you see all these prophecies coming together like the leaves of the fig tree, first and foremost.

674
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,520
He said, recognize I am at the door, ready to return.

675
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,900
And then he gives the...

676
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,300
It ends like this.

677
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,760
Booty wheat?

678
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
There's the big city!

679
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,240
Oh, we're almost there, at last, at last!

680
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,080
It's beautiful, isn't it? Just like I knew it would be.

681
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,820
He really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that.

682
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,220
Oh, come on, Ann, what are we waiting for?

683
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,420
Yuppie, let's hurry.

684
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,480
Yes, let's run!

685
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,720
We're having a wood-journ-u-the-duck-jour-u-the-nock!

686
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,780
Oh, dear.

687
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,480
Oh, dear.

688
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:37,480


689
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,260
Oh, dear.

690
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:41,260


691
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:41,800
Oh, dear.

692
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,780
Oh, dear.

693
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,120
Oh, dear.

694
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:45,560
Oh, dear.

695
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,220
Oh, dear.

696
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:46,860
Oh, dear.

697
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,440
Oh, dear.

698
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


699
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


700
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


701
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


702
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


703
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


704
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


705
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


706
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


708
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,440


709
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,560
You see, none of this was real.

710
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,820
It was illusion.

711
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,080
Your art, your science, it was all a nightmare.

712
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,720
And now it's done.

713
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:55,900
Finished.

714
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:03,340
My brethren, our task is nearly complete.

715
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,360
He was the last of those who brought the punishment to us.

716
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,160
We have cleansed and purged this world.

717
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,180
Now we must build.

718
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,520
Build coffins.

719
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,460
That's all you need.

720
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,200
No, no, no.

721
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:17,980
Bring him.

722
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,900
I hope my strength holds out.

723
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,520
I hope your tail holds out.

724
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,240
We're not that far gone, but we're on the road.

725
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,020
The yellow brick road.

726
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,360
We're off to see the wizard.

727
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,780
Heavenly Father, we ask you in these last moments to speak to our hearts.

728
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,460
Hold a sign to the kind shocking signs all around us and their people who need Bob.

729
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,200
Bob.

730
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:39,880
Bob.

731
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,420
Bob.

732
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:51,260
And it's the nearest thing to true giggling that I should hope to see.

733
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:05,380
When I'm up in the sky, I hardly have to try.

734
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,940
My love keeps one bright star for me.

735
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:23,000
And it's the shining light on a singular flight that I should hope to see.

736
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:31,340
We return to Transylvania to prepare the transit team.

737
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,620
The bad dream is over, friend Neville.

738
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,420
Now we can sleep in peace.

739
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:50,620
Lisa!

740
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,960
Watch yourself, Dad.

741
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,400
You're the highly suggestible type.

742
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,820
Just try it for yourself.

743
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,300
And I know many who say this book is not true, and they've never read it.

744
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,800
There are some who say these things cannot be proven.

745
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,960
They cannot be substantiated, and yet not once have they walked into the laboratory of fate.

746
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,400
Which is the...

747
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,200
The key that unlocks the mystery of this life and this book.

748
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,780
They have never taken the test tube of the soul.

749
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:25,620
And mixed human indignity, human pride, human lust, human selfishness, human knowledge,

750
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,920
with the wisdom of Bob.

751
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,460
Bob.

752
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:28,580
Bob.

753
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,720
Bob.

754
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:30,960
Bob.

755
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,400
Bob.

756
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,120
Bob.

757
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,600
Bob.

758
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,220
Bob.

759
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,380
Bob.

760
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:34,640
Bob.

761
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:34,740


762
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:34,940
Bob.

763
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:34,980
Bob.

764
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,000
Bob.

765
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,580
Bob.

766
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:35,580


767
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:35,580


768
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,120
Bob.

769
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,120


770
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,120


771
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,120


772
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,120


773
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:37,840
Bob.

774
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:39,880
Bob.

775
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,960
Bob.

776
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,240
Bob.

777
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,080
Bob.

778
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,680
Bob.

779
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,120
木 Gutவ

780
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,360
Oh, you'll see it in a night of love

781
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,640
My love

782
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:45,860
Oh, you'll see it in a night of love

783
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,160
Under the mountain, a golden mountain

784
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,680
Where you pray that the lark is right

785
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,420
Oh, oh, you'll see it in a night of love

786
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,300
My love

787
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:07,220
Oh, oh, you'll see it in a night of love

788
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,960
My love

789
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,540
We found it hiding, we found it lying

790
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,080
Showing on the dirt and sand

791
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,320
Your former glory and all the stories

792
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,900
Like the walls within your hands

793
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,260
But oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

794
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

795
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,780
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

796
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

797
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

798
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,480
Oh, oh

799
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,620
Mm.

800
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,180
Mm.

Mm.

Mm.

Thank you.

Thank you.

812
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:54,840
Thank you.

813
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,000
Ready?

814
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,240
Ready.

815
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,920
R for ruminant.

816
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,700
Ready for last minute cockpit check.

817
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,260
Yes, okay.

818
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,300
Logactyl, 5 milligrams.

819
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,180

00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,900
Valium, 10, check.

822
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:15,700
Halo.

825
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,140
Which one, Greg?

826
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
The little white ones.

827
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,240
Wuh, wuh, wuh for white.

828
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,820
Wuh, white, uh, the white ones.

Glass of water.

Check.

839
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,320
Our father.

840
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,020
Which are his hands?

841
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,560
Mayor Culper.

842
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,020
Mayor Culper.

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,120
Mayor Maxime Culper.

We'll be right back.
