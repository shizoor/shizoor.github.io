1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,820
Too bad all shows can't be so wonderful

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,420
But some have to be religious shows

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
And that's what we're doing now

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,500
Where is that?

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,360
Friends

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,320
I have a message for you from Bob

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,620
Bob Taft

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,900
And the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,980
Ah yes

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,440
Because with warmer months approaching

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,080
The Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,600
Would like to remind Ohioans

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,580
That motor scooters are illegal

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,880
On Ohio's roadways

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,300
Unless titled, registered, covered by the proper financial responsibility

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,000
And the individual operating the motor scooter

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,420
Has a driver's license

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:55,600
And has a driver's license

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:55,600


20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,760
And motorcycle endorsement

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,000
Many of the small electric and gas powered motor scooters

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,900
Which are sold in cruddy sporting and department stores

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,020
Through the internet

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,860
And on unsavory street corners

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,060
Do not fit the criteria to be titled or registered

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,460
Therefore the scooters are not to be permitted

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,260
On Ohio's roadways

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,600
For roadway travel the motor scooter must have a standard

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,340
Seat and be designed to travel

30
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,660
On not more than three wheels in contact with the ground

31
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,960
The scooters must have proper brake lights

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,400
Turn signals, a horn and rear view mirrors

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,600
If the scooter fits the criteria to be ridden on the roadways

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,060
An individual must have the motor scooter inspected

35
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,600
By the Ohio State Highway Patrol

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,820
Heard here?

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,660
If the scooter passes the inspection

38
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,540
The scooter may be titled and then registered

39
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,920
The owner must carry financial responsibility coverage on the scooter

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,800
Also the rider must be 16 years old

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,660
We are looking out for the children's safety

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,860
Says registrar Frank Couchrider

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,460
It's important that the drivers know Ohio's road laws and signs

44
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,100
Before the attempt to operate a vehicle of any type on Ohio's roadways

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,760
Parents and grandparents are buying these small scooters

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,980
Assuming they can be legally operated

47
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,080
Which often turns out not to be true

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,660
Individuals should contact local law enforcement

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,500
With questions about how the laws that govern the use of motor scooters

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,200
Will be enforced in a particular jurisdiction

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,700
And thank you to Governor Bob Taft for that message

52
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,660
I hope you all appreciated the special way I read that

53
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,060
I carefully inspected that public service announcement

54
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,680
And marked up the script so that I could read it with the proper dramatic enhancements

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
This music in the background

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,620
Which is actually pretty good

57
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,380
Music is from a CD called Legacy

58
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,900
By Reverend Jimmy Ryan

59
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,420
The Flyin' Ryan Brothers is the name of it

60
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,660
The Flyin' Ryan Brothers got a Grammy nomination for this thing

61
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,200
These subgeniuses did

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,840
But there's got to be someone

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,880
Now I've got to start this subgenius show

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,200
Dammit

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,640
I don't know how to work half these boards here

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,740
Dammit, dammit, dammit

67
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,820
It's, it's, it's

68
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,660
I know!!!

69
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,080
Damn it, damn it

70
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm having this try.

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,260
If only I could get this thing to...

72
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,920
It's just...

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,840
What's so funny?

74
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,760
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,000
The band is starting.

76
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,120
The band is starting.

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,900
That's not the cut that I wanted.

78
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,740
Knowing that I could stop them at any point in time...

79
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,200
I could stop.

80
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,900
Sure, I could stop any time.

81
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
I could stop any time.

83
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,360
In denial.

84
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,340
Listen to that guy.

85
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:22,720
Totally.

86
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,020
I don't have a hang-up about it.

87
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh, no.

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,400
Not at all.

89
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,420
Just keep talking about it over and over again.

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,540
Okay, get ready.

91
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,320
Show's coming up.

92
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,120
Show's starting up.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay.

94
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,780
It's Bob.

95
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,620
Okay, this is Bob, and we'll be translating.

96
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:22,700
I don't have a hang-up about it.

97
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,580
It's Bob.

98
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,820
I don't have a hang-up about it.

99
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:50,400
It's the end times, and for some reason, some people find that depressing.

100
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,460
It's the end times.

101
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,680
It's the end times.

102
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,680


103
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,680


104
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,820
And some people, they don't find that an excuse to party.

105
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,560
Maybe they're not that cynical or they're not that high or something.

106
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,620
And there's been a lot of this disease going around called suicide.

107
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,380
Or, you know, people that maybe they haven't caught it yet, but they kind of wish they would.

108
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:21,320
And I'm in the position, believe it or not, even a subgenius minister has to counsel people.

109
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,880
Because, I mean, who else are they going to go to in some cases?

110
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,220
Now, have you ever had a friend come to you and say he was going to kill himself and you tried to put yourself in his shoes?

111
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,620
That's not a good idea.

112
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,460
You don't try to put yourself in the shoes of a suicidal person.

113
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,980
It might be contagious, like that Penn and Teller movie.

114
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,260
But, see, the thing is, when you're not depressed and you're just looking at somebody who is depressed,

115
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,740
you think to yourself, well, I could never do that because of the kids or somebody, you know.

116
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,280
But when you're depressed, you go, yeah, I want to do that because of the kids.

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,940
And to them, it makes perfect sense.

118
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,260
Now, you cannot beat sense into the head of a depressed person.

119
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,480
What are you going to threaten them with? Death?

120
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,540
You know, how do you threaten a suicidal person?

121
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,820
As our friend, Reverend Phineas Narco said,

122
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,640
some people want to kill themselves, but they know it would kill their mom.

123
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,880
So they wish their mom would hurry up and die.

124
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
And that makes them more depressed.

125
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,640
And then they just want to kill.

126
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,160
Or they're so depressed they want to kill themselves, but they're afraid it would kill their boss.

127
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,380
Or they're afraid it would kill Bob.

128
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,260
Well, friends, you don't have to worry about Bob.

129
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,440
Because he doesn't care about you.

130
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,480
He only cares about your slack.

131
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,620
Now, somebody said to me, you know, it's weird.

132
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,400
Animals aren't smart enough to kill themselves.

133
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,840
Think about that.

134
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,740
Animals aren't smart enough to kill themselves.

135
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,280
Friends, what is the god damn hurry?

136
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:18,680
Bob or God are going to get you sooner or later, no matter what.

137
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,240
If you try to do it.

138
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,360
You might well muff the job.

139
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,820
Because by definition, you're an amateur.

140
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,260
You're certainly not a professional at suicide.

141
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,960
So friends, if you're going to kill yourself, let the professionals do it.

142
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,480
Leave it to Bob.

143
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,320
Let Bob do it for you.

144
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,720
Now here's the thing.

145
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,860
He might take his sweet time about it.

146
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,120
You might even get impatient for Bob to hurry and kill you.

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,300
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.

148
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,580
I'm afraid that, I'm afraid my mom is kind of in that position.

149
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,180
But really, do you really think you can do a better job than J.R. Bob Dobbs?

150
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,100
I think not.

151
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,980
But as Bob said, just as suicide is the most sincere form of self-loathing,

152
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:16,600
by the same token, the church of the subgenius is the most sincere form of send one dollar.

153
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,600
Now, God works in mysterious ways.

154
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,200
It's true.

155
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,060
And Bob plays in mysterious ways.

156
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,180
So maybe we can hope.

157
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,060
Maybe there is hope.

158
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,600
Maybe we can hope for not just survival.

159
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,080
Maybe we can hope for even revenge.

160
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,240
Ah, yes.

161
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,060
When you're not looking for them, they're in your face.

162
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,540
When you're seeking them, they flee.

163
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,640
That's the way Bob is, you know.

164
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,800
Friends, we're listening to some recordings from the Beachland Ballroom Divival,

165
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,600
just fairly recently like.

166
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,360
Actually, this is the third bunch of recordings I have of that.

167
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,720
I have put together another hour of, two previous hours of Slack,

168
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,920
which only the Cleveland audiences will hear after this one.

169
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,740
The rest of you heard them already.

170
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,040
Strange but true.

171
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,960
Friends, and we'll go back to those live Divival recordings.

172
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,620
I do want to mention that as we record this show,

173
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,680
former President Ronald Reagan went, was called home, I guess.

174
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,720
Some angel needed Reagan's special talents that he had developed in the last few years.

175
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,300
And they called him home.

176
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,040
And we'll be reading some.

177
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,860
Reading some from the secret history of Ronald Reagan.

178
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,540
I don't want to, but I have to because Reagan's dead.

179
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,060
And we will be called upon to grapple with this important news.

180
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:07,080
Meanwhile, we'll just quickly go back to that subgenius Divival in progress.

181
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,560
People fear Bob. People want Bob. They want to meet Bob.

182
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,020
They go, oh, is Bob going to be at that Divival? I want to meet Bob.

183
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,840
Oh, you think you want to meet Bob.

184
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,040
Where do you think he gets his Slack?

185
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,380
Where do you think Bob gets his Slack?

186
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,800
Why do you think he wants you to have Slack?

187
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,700
You just think about that.

188
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,960
Next time you go looking for a guru.

189
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,620
Or such like.

190
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, I'm just going to, I'm just going to turn the,

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,680
how about if we look at another one of those lovely videos.

192
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,020
Oh, is that Reverend Bleepo?

193
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,240
You ought to come up here and at least say, it's the hour of Slack.

194
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,040
See if you recognize this voice.

195
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,760
The subgenius hour of Slack.

196
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,140
Slack.

197
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,740
I just want to testify that Bob did,

198
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,960
Bob has gotten me through so much lately.

199
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,920
And coming here, we came all the way from New York City

200
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,860
just because of Bob's face.

201
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,780
I think not enough people remember the face.

202
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,800
We have to always come back to the face.

203
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,060
And we get involved with all this computer art

204
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,220
and all of this other stuff.

205
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:46,600
And, you know, we live 2.5 miles from ground zero in Brooklyn.

206
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,140
And when the towers came down, the smoke came up over the river

207
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,180
and right down into our neighborhood.

208
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,760
And even then, I remembered the face.

209
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,780
I just want you to know that even in the day,

210
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,720
in the direst moments,

211
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,680
Bob gives you strength.

212
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,540
And we were going through thunderous sheets

213
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,160
of Cecil B. DeMille-like rain

214
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,620
on the Pennsylvania, on Route 80 going west.

215
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,280
And all through it, I just kept seeing the face.

216
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,680
And I kept saying, no, go forward.

217
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,020
And the Reverend Lili Benini,

218
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,320
I should say Professor Lili Benini,

219
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,960
newly indoctrinated,

220
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,880
professor, one of the few professors

221
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,520
in the Church of the Subgenius,

222
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,440
but fully ordained nevertheless,

223
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,600
Reverend Lili Benini pressed on,

224
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,920
even with her eyes closed,

225
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,560
through pouring sheets of rain,

226
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,920
by keeping the face in her mind.

227
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,720
So just, that's just what I want to say to y'all,

228
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,020
is no matter what happens,

229
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,960
if kids in a motel parking lot seem threatening,

230
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,040
just remember the face.

231
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,760
If you're surrounded by people,

232
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,080
by guys who think that your long hair's real purdy

233
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,720
and they want to do bad stuff to you,

234
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,560
you will still roll by,

235
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,480
roll through the situation,

236
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,660
whatever happens to you then,

237
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,680
with the face.

238
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,740
So, and I see your face.

239
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,240
I have not seen your face in a long time.

240
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,520
But, but, but, yeah,

241
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,780
the face and the dots, don't forget.

242
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,500
That's all.

243
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,980
That's my message tonight.

244
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,500
Thank you.

245
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,180
Bleepo Abernathy, dear friends.

246
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,940
That's Doctors for Bob in the background,

247
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,740
playing there at the Beachland Ballroom.

248
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,600
Friends, Bleepo Abernathy.

249
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,440
Yes, we heard.

250
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,540
And he is right.

251
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,800
It is those dots of that face.

252
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,200
You can say, oh, I love what Bob says.

253
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,600
I love everything else about Slack and Subgenius.

254
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,800
No, it's that face is the basis of all reality.

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,740
That trademark face.

256
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,520
That doted face.

257
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,800
It's the living God.

258
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,880
The God.

259
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,700
God.

260
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,920
And now man, man incorporated.

261
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,720
Man.

262
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,260
Excuse me.

263
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,660
Does anyone have a job?

264
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:58,720
Does anyone have a job?

265
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,600
Is it a job?

266
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,600


267
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,600


268
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,600


269
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,600


270
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,600


271
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,600


272
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,620
No.

273
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:02,660
No.

274
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:02,700
No.

275
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,940
I think it's this.

276
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,900
Oh, hey.

277
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,340
I have a job through the army.

278
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,020
Would you like it?

279
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,420
You know I have a job, занимado por la ciencia.

280
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:19,640
Another job?

281
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:19,660
Thank you bro, bro.

282
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,340
Shabbat shalom everyone.

283
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,940
Shabbat shalom.

284
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,000
Down your ass in the gas in your car.

285
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,740
And you think you deserve a raise?

286
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,640
You're fired.

287
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,100
And you think you deserve a raise?

288
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,080
You're fired.

289
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,660
Fired.

290
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,820
Man.

291
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,500
More on man from...

292
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,440
Thank you.

293
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,900
www.beerforman.com

294
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,320
No matter how complicated your conspiracy theory gets,

295
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,200
it still can't touch the...

296
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,680
Oh, it's the amino acids.

297
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,880
The amino acids were the headlining band

298
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,820
at the last defival in Cleveland.

299
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,380
And you hear them starting up here in the background.

300
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,700
The mean amino acids.

301
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,940
Yeah, they're a mean, mean...

302
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,660
A mean surf thrash machine.

303
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,400
Dangerous.

304
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,320
Dangerous.

305
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,980
Oh, yeah, well, we'll let the aminos

306
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,680
prepare their brew in the background.

307
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,040
Friends, I have to tell you,

308
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,980
I have to reveal now, at this moment,

309
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,060
the secret history of former President Ronald Reagan.

310
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,220
Who, quote, died, unquote, yesterday.

311
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,980
Buckled your seatbelts.

312
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,780
Anything that's keeping you from realizing

313
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,360
that you've got to get right with Bob.

314
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,300
Ronald Reagan was secretly a very heavy pot smoker.

315
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,940
A pot smoker, that's right.

316
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,620
And that's what caused his Alzheimer's.

317
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,200
He and J.R. Bob Dobbs had been friends,

318
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,680
close friends, since 1950.

319
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,840
1951, actually.

320
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Which was before Dobbs' immaculate death.

321
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,580
Immaculation.

322
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,080
When they met on the set of Bedtime for Bonzo.

323
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,060
For which Dobbs is listed as genetics consultant,

324
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,160
for some reason.

325
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,120
After the immaculation,

326
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,920
Dobbs' rising star matched Ron's,

327
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,580
and they both shared a meteoric ascent

328
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,760
through the conspiracy ranks.

329
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,700
Until Dobbs dropped out and went rogue.

330
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,440
Dobbs had never, at any time in his career,

331
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,500
actually understood the concept of money.

332
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,760
And when Reagan,

333
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,820
his new masters,

334
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,560
tried to force such understanding onto him,

335
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,020
he lost interest in the conspiracy entirely

336
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,520
and split off to found Dobbstown

337
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,160
in the fourth counterspiracy, as it is called.

338
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,200
For it wasn't actually Rockefeller

339
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,980
who was calling the shots in those days,

340
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,960
but Onassis.

341
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,320
And Dobbs reputedly looked with uncharacteristic disdain

342
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,020
on, of all things, Onassis' cooking.

343
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,120
In 1982, Reagan had a tumultuous affair

344
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,540
with the mysterious-aged mother of Connie Dobbs

345
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,020
and went amok, as his handlers would have it.

346
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,560
He resigned the presidency and ran off with Connie's mother,

347
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,300
only to have her ultimately reject him as a suitable mate.

348
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,060
During this period on the run,

349
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,380
Reagan sometimes hid out with Dr. Philo Drummond,

350
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,480
wearing a long-haired wig and fake mustache,

351
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,600
and affecting an Australian accent.

352
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,400
He even jammed several times with the swinging love corpses.

353
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,640
Meanwhile, the conspiracy had, needless to say,

354
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,580
kept a clone, or more properly,

355
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,680
a lookalike in seeming power in Washington.

356
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,660
It was even re-elected in 1984.

357
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,400
But then the lookalike went berserk

358
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,560
and raped several newscasters.

359
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,920
This was reported in the conspiracy press

360
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,100
as President Reagan undergoing an operation for colon cancer.

361
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,740
The real Reagan, who by then had been,

362
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,500
ejected from the swinging love corpses,

363
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,160
resumed his duties as acting president.

364
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,440
Onassis apparently forgave him.

365
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,060
Some say his change of heart was due to threats

366
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,640
from the shadowy figures that the conspiracy press

367
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,820
referred to as Nancy's astrologers,

368
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,160
and to whom Hollywood made vague allusions

369
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,080
in the film Donovan's Brain.

370
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,320
Ron had never been more than a figurehead,

371
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,880
a front for Nancy anyway,

372
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,640
so whether it was the real Reagan or a lookalike

373
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,720
made little difference in the day-to-day operation of that party.

374
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:56,820
The conspiracy press was the only party

375
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:56,820


376
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,500
to be a part of the conspiracy.

377
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,560
The conspiracy press was the only party

378
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,940
that had been able to get the lookalike

379
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,660
to be a part of the conspiracy.

380
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,060
One of the other branches of the conspiracy

381
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,720
was behind the Hinckley affair,

382
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,880
the fact that Reverend Court Holland,

383
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,860
co-director of Arise, the subgenius video,

384
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,220
sat behind John Hinckley Jr. in English class

385
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,020
at Highland Park High School in Dallas,

386
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,020
is key to this aspect,

387
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,900
the final results of which we are now seeing

388
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,720
in the whole world.

389
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,840
The world has sailed devastation of brain cells,

390
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,940
both in the Middle East and the United States.

391
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,340
And now back to the amino acids.

392
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,240
...direction to my thoughts,

393
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,000
knowing that I could stop them at any point in time...

394
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,220
The amino acids, dear friends,

395
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,440
at the Beachland Revival,

396
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,640
Subgenius Revival in Cleveland,

397
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:14,700
it has been known that the amino acids

398
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,420
contain a substance called

399
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,200
and I always just wondered about the difference between,

400
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,500
you know, which came first, the chicken or the egg.

401
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,140
And you're telling me now,

402
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,620
that some barnyards have the equivalent, the chicken equivalent,

403
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,820
of Leonardo da Vinci running around the barnyard.

404
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,680
You know, I'm not on duty now, but I'll actually go ahead and answer that famous conundrum

405
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,660
if you really do want to know the answer, which came first, the chicken or the egg?

406
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,700
Well, I think that even though you're not on duty,

407
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,400
in one sense, you're always on duty in another sense.

408
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,180
And you are one of this church of the subgeniuses,

409
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:02,800
most aforementioned, most concise, and yet abbreviated,

410
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:09,060
great sage of ancient lore and forgotten knowledge.

411
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:18,180
Can you expound in a Thomish sort of bombastic, pompous way at infinitum?

412
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,220
Though I lost my career and I...

413
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
...try in my beer, this show is my only real job.

414
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,120
And here he is, radio's...

415
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,860
...brought out a clear statement of what you wish to accomplish...

416
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,700
...and request your subconscious mind...

417
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,400
...Colonel Chickering's famous method of picking them,

418
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,400
the greatest chicken picker in history, Colonel Chickering,

419
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,820
wrote a book and systemized a system known as

420
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,060
Eggs and Chicks in Least Space on Homegrown Food.

421
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,220
Cut, cut, cadoc it, cluck.

422
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,420
Cut, cut, cadoc it, cluck.

423
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,380
Cut, cut, cadoc it, cluck.

424
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,140
When was the last time you tasted a really fresh egg?

425
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,560
It was expense money from the paper for the...

426
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,100
One with a high yolk that was a deep, dark yellow,

427
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,000
bordering on pink, and a white...

428
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,240
I need slack.

429
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,840
An egg white that stayed together in a plump circle

430
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,180
instead of running all over the frying pan.

431
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,140
Please, Mr. Corrigan, would you let me have the money?

432
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,240
Well, if your answer is, I've never eaten an egg like that,

433
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,400
you aren't alone.

434
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,000
When my wife, Louise, and I first made our move from city...

435
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,480
to country, I really believed that the lighter color, the yolk,

436
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,980
would pressure the egg.

437
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,900
It wasn't until our first, uh, pullets began laying, as we call it,

438
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,060
that I learned the fact that the yolk color

439
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,700
is dependent on the pigments in the feed.

440
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,860
You lay your pullets.

441
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,600
We were responsible for those running eggs.

442
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,640
Did you regain your lost yeti power?

443
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,980
You see, an egg, in many respects, is a living thing.

444
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,860
I don't either, but I know that...

445
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,880
Even if it is not fertile,

446
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,980
which is the case,

447
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,360
in the case with store-bought eggs,

448
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,440
a hen will lay a quarter of infertile eggs

449
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,220
without ever setting eyes on a rooster.

450
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,720
I stood there watching it happen,

451
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,160
swearing I would stop when I lost a hundred dollars.

452
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,220
And in the time most commercially produced eggs spend in storage or transit,

453
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:12,540
they slowly lose water through the process of sweating or eggmosis.

454
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,800
You can tell a fresh egg from a stale one easily, just hard-boiled.

455
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,840
Sky King stinks.

456
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,980
If the dent in one end, where the egg is, is the most likely to be a dead egg,

457
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:19,980


458
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,060
the air pocket puts it to a good size when your egg is stale.

459
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,880
Bob isn't so lucky because he's smart.

460
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,720
He's lucky because he's incredibly stupid by normal standards.

461
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,180
We think there's a big difference, too, between poultry raised commercially and raised to toad.

462
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:37,380
If you could be as tenth as dumb as Bob, your mistakes, blunders, follies, and foibles would become as profitable as his.

463
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,840
But I didn't.

464
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,200
Why not? To truly know nothing...

465
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,300
Ah.

466
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,480
Ah.

467
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,380
But, uh, we, uh, could, uh...

468
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,440
Quick, behind these bushes.

469
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,360
We could. Only we could. If only we could.

470
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,880
I kept reaching into the envelope again.

471
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,420
Again and again.

472
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,140
Human nature would improve a billionfold.

473
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,300
What are we gonna do?

474
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,020
If only it wouldn't...

475
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,900
You could eventually be a stooge warrior for Wotan.

476
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,140
Like, like watching a person who couldn't see or hear me.

477
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,720
What can we do? There's hundreds of them.

478
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,940
We'll channel the...

479
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,880
I could go on.

480
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,700
We'll channel them. We'll...

481
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,140
I could...

482
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,480
We'll say, Bob, I hear you.

483
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,140
Describe how to build a chicken coop.

484
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,640
They may not be the same.

485
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,280
Perhaps our listeners would like to know that more.

486
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,800
We'll give some to you today.

487
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,980
Or discuss the various chicken breeds.

488
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,020
We ain't gonna leave out any.

489
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,380
Oh, Bob.

490
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,340
But you've got to remember...

491
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,700
You'll never get a better deal.

492
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,600
The trick of picking chicken is picking what chicken if you still wonder.

493
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,900
And how I wonder...

494
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,480
Your sexy tapes and books are now the most vital part of my life.

495
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,940
Relationships with others are of secondary importance.

496
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,880
A strange propaganda broadcast by the Edmorows.

497
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,520
Yes, warning, warning.

498
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,800
From the sole smudge on your checks, we will be able to tell whether you are one of the chosen.

499
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,780
A pathetic pink that wants to be a subgenius or a conspiracy infiltrator.

500
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:01,780
Even though the color of each tribe's money is exactly equal in greatness, we will sell

501
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,260
to you, but only if we know you.

502
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,420
Now, the easiest way to kill a chicken is to hang it up each foot in a rope with a noose

503
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,080
or slipknot at the end and cut the throat just behind the lower beak.

504
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,140
Then, uh...

505
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,000
Then, get away quickly.

506
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,400
Haha.

507
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,700
The bird will flap, scattering blood all over.

508
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,780
Once it has bled, swish the carcass for 60 to 90 seconds,

509
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,540
depending on the age of the bird, in 130 degrees Fahrenheit water.

510
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,000
Pull out the tail and wing feathers first, and the rest should come off almost in sheets.

511
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,860
An expert chicken plucker can denude his victim in less than 60 seconds.

512
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,060
If they come out hard,

513
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,780
you've scalded the chicken flesh for too short a time.

514
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,860
If the breast skin tears,

515
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,080
you've scalded that chicken too long.

516
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,040
This may sound like coop talk to you, but 30 years from now, your kids' minds will be ours.

517
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,240
You can clean the birds, too, but it's easiest to split them up the back.

518
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,360
So, go ahead, ignore your natural squeamishness.

519
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,540
Get a strong pair of poultry shears.

520
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:11,960
That's right.

521
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,760
Now, go for it.

522
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,800
Cut off their feet.

523
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,440
The head.

524
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,800
The end of the neck.

525
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,160
Now the pointed oil gland at the base of the tail.

526
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,400
Be sure to get out all the oozing yellow,

527
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,660
glagular,

528
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,460
pus-like material.

529
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,360
Then, with a sharp knife,

530
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:36,260
cut around the vent in a funnel shape to avoid cutting into the gut and puncturing the intestines,

531
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,160
causing the foul gas to rush out, destroying the flavor of the meat.

532
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,140
Head.

533
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,780
Cut up the spine.

534
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,900
One hand has been jerking many times.

535
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,720
And as you can see, the bird will open the mouth like a book.

536
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:48,780
Ah.

537
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,220
Could that be Dave?

538
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,080
We'll find out.

539
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
Is that Dave?

540
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,600
Might it be?

541
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,820
Could it be?

542
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,640
Hello?

543
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,400
Hello?

544
00:28:59,420 --> 00:28:59,740
Hello?

545
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,180
Hello?

546
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,680
The phone is ringing.

547
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,500
It's a nasal sound, isn't it?

548
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:03,920
Yes.

549
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,200
That's why they call it Reagan's polyp.

550
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,760
Don't forget.

551
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,920
The nasal polyp?

552
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,600
I thought it was a different sort of polyp.

553
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:10,860
Can you hear anything?

554
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,500
I can't.

555
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,800
That was a great band.

556
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,780
It was a greater Nordic American band.

557
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:14,780


558
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:14,780


559
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:20,940
I remember in 1942, Ronald Reagan was wearing a swastika and one of the perpendicular hats,

560
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,060
you know, with the big, I guess it was some sort of German sausage.

561
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,880
He was trying to pretend it was like a spike.

562
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,260
Remember the spike helmets they had?

563
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:28,960
Yeah.

564
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,660
Swastika?

565
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,100
He just, you know, he just stooned himself with a leader crunch or something like that

566
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,020
and was parading around.

567
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,360
There's photos of it.

568
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,280
The FBI has those.

569
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,940
And Dobbs is with him.

570
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,400
But, you know, Dobbs was playing off sides of the fence.

571
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,940
He's always done that.

572
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,540
Well, don't we all, in a way?

573
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,540
Even Reagan, you know, God, Satan, in between.

574
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,160
God and Satan is one word, isn't it?

575
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,160
In our religion.

576
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,900
Natas dog, you know.

577
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,100
That was a great old dog, too.

578
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,920
Natas.

579
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,860
Natas dog.

580
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,120
I remember him well.

581
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,160
He had power of the universe and didn't know it.

582
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,320
Instead, anyway.

583
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,580
Yeah, anyway.

584
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,320
He sounds pretty resolute.

585
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:13,840
I don't know.

586
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,860
That's the correct word.

587
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,340
I think it's, no, that's not.

588
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,460
Oh, I'm not, actually.

589
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,120
That's, I'm shaking, shaking to the core.

590
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,660
My confidence in.

591
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,020
Well, you knew he was going to go.

592
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,100
You know, in fact, he's been going everywhere for the last 10 years.

593
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,480
Oh, for 30 years, Bob has been saying it was all going to go.

594
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,020
It was all going to literally come apart at the seams, he said.

595
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,880
But he meant that figuratively, since, you know, the world doesn't have seams.

596
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:37,780
No.

597
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,700
As Nenslow pointed out, it seems.

598
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,800
It has torn pockets with the fluffy on the inside, you know.

599
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,900
So, like, what are those longitude little things?

600
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,420
Those are imaginary lines drawn by men to make nature make sense.

601
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:01,960
A vain attempt to control God's great creation by means of knowledge and machinery.

602
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,080
So, you really, you think that God created this universe, even though you are a 100%

603
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,600
Dobbsian, Coneye, born in the freaking wool subgenius.

604
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,000
And you believe in God?

605
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:20,980
Well, that depends on what you mean by God, what you mean by believe, what you mean by is, and what you mean by, what was the other?

606
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,560
Mean.

607
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,080
What?

608
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,600
Oh, yeah.

609
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,180
Mean.

610
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:24,740
Mean.

611
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:25,940
Okay.

612
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,700
And what?

613
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,400
I want to start with what?

614
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,400
Oh, no, let's not start with what.

615
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,480
See, and again, you come back to the chicken and the egg, God and the devil, the eternal mysteries.

616
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,580
And should we be doing current affair humor, or should we be doing eternal veritas?

617
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,480
What's going to sell in the long run?

618
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,500
You really, I don't know, I've never had my pre-funnel lobes pecked out by an egg, though, Stang.

619
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,540
You know what I mean?

620
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,180
We're not really.

621
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:51,520
No.

622
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,320
I mean, we got to start somewhere.

623
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,660
I don't know where that.

624
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:55,940
Why?

625
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,020
Well, I guess we don't have to start anywhere.

626
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,380
I agree with whatever you say.

627
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:08,760
That's why we want to just tear down all of that which history has built up, and without any plan at all for starting over.

628
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,340
Anarchism to us is way too organized, too.

629
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,140
And fascistic.

630
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:22,320
Yes, in Dobbs' new world, stealing will be legal, and money will not be.

631
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,660
Well, better days are coming.

632
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,960
Ah, yes.

633
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,140
Well, I hope so.

634
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,460
I hope X Day is tomorrow.

635
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,320
It'd be great if X Day was tomorrow, or even if X Day was this July 5th.

636
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,240
Well, Stang, you're going to get it right anyway, because you're so close to the Mayan calendar that I can't hear a wee.

637
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,860
Well, I wish you would leave off this Mayan calendar.

638
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,180
No, I mean, I know I sound like one of the midnight talk show guys.

639
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:46,720
Yeah.

640
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:53,700
But it seems like, you know, now you're even reading these little articles in the Plain Dealer and other fake news sources, you know?

641
00:32:53,780 --> 00:33:03,600
Why is the Mayan prediction for the end of the world any better than Edgar Cayce's, which was 1998, or Nostradamus's, which was July 5th?

642
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,600
Well, the Mayans, I guess, they're just the same as the Hoopers.

643
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,000
1999.

644
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,040
You know, the Hoppy people down there that live in the Pueblo.

645
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,220
No, they're not the same.

646
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,900
No, I mean, their end times predictions are very, very close.

647
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:23,200
Well, everybody's end times predictions are very, very close, and they're all true, as that movie that I'm not going to go see proves.

648
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:34,960
They're all happening all at once, the global warming and the global ice age simultaneously, like taking coffee and downers at the same time.

649
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,460
That's exactly what it is.

650
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:36,840
That's...

651
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,500
People think we're going one way or the other.

652
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,160
We're going both.

653
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,200
Hey, haven't you ever done that, you know?

654
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,940
What makes you think Mother Earth is not as big a dope head as the rest of us?

655
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:50,880
She's on too many lewds, quackers, ding-dongs, any kind of down-type thing you can imagine, smacky and everything.

656
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,000
And she just put a bunch of, uh...

657
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,780
What's that other stuff?

658
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,000
I guess that's what you mean by a guy-a-rea.

659
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,360
Yeah.

660
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,320
Guy-a-rea.

661
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,580
That's what we've got.

662
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,660
We've got too much closeness to the...

663
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,460
The world is too much with us, great and small.

664
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:06,660
Yeah.

665
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,500
Getting and spending, coming and going and...if you can even come.

666
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,740
Or spend, as some wags like prefer to put it.

667
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,060
Stend?

668
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,540
Spend, yes.

669
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,260
Spend, oh yes.

670
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,100
Spend.

671
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,680
Spendy juices, yeah.

672
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,200
Oh, Nan Canobite used to talk about spending too much.

673
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,160
Well, with a name like that, you...

674
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,900
Yup.

675
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,000
With a...

676
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,360
It's kind of a one-track mind, his name.

677
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,820
Why didn't he think to perhaps change his name on a week?

678
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,660
Well, never mind, I never did, so...

679
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:33,960
Right.

680
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,480
Right.

681
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,720
I'm still Lonesome Cowboy Dave, he's still Onan.

682
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,960
What if Onan and Lonesome got together?

683
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,440
They could have little fanny babies.

684
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,280
I don't want any fanny babies.

685
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,060
Either out of my fanny or anybody else's.

686
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,180
Lonesome Onan babies.

687
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,400
And if I did, I'd certainly raise them right.

688
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,660
Butt babies.

689
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,440
I don't know...oh, is that a song that we've sung before?

690
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,300
I wouldn't...I don't remember any better than you do, Dave.

691
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,560
That was the spin-off guy, who I'm falsely accusing of being a spin-off guy.

692
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,380
A caller in was going,

693
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,380
My mother didn't want me.

694
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,760
Oh, yeah, you said you...

695
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,180
I flushed into the can.

696
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,340
I'm a backyard backdoor baby.

697
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,460
And a big old fashioned man.

698
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,140
I don't know, something like that.

699
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,120
I mean, I had the other part, you know.

700
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,960
Man, that was messed up.

701
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,980
Knockwist?

702
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:46,300
Dave, now you say you heard someone on a shortwave feed of somebody else's college radio show that you said sounded uncannily like an hour of slack...inspiratee, let us say, rather than rip-off.

703
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I said that.

704
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,140
And not only did I say that, I can back it up with worms.

705
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,980
Do you think they owe us an apology or a lawsuit or anything that we could, you know, exploit?

706
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:00,960
No.

707
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,380
They owe us an apology or something.

708
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,240
Bacha culats, that's what they say.

709
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,940
Should we be recording...should we be recording stuff off of their show and then replaying it on our show and saying it's ours?

710
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,060
Mmmmm, that sounds better.

711
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,760
That sounds better.

712
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,360
No, much better.

713
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,540
Well, then turn your recorder on.

714
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:14,880
It's Peter.

715
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,800
Okay, let's not be silly here.

716
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,640
What about this?

717
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,600
What is happening to the world?

718
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:30,800
How can we...how can a great man like Ronald Reagan die and a dick still be around...in chains of Eve?

719
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,320
Well, Stan, you don't understand the true nature of the world.

720
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,660
I sure don't.

721
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:41,540
There are wonderful old saps like Ronald Reagan, former butt boys of Robert, um, Bob Dobbs.

722
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,360
J.R. Bob Dobbs, not Robert, excuse me.

723
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,240
But for people like this, the world is a sour pickle that we have to all consume.

724
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:57,380
But for those whose oysters are, let's say they were born with a silver spoon stuck up their derriere.

725
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,100
Yeah.

726
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,420
The lucky guys, the rich guys.

727
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,500
The lucky guys.

728
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:01,880
Yeah.

729
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,280
The tall guys.

730
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,440
The small guys.

731
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:04,920
Like you.

732
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,300
The popular.

733
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,280
You know, all the rest of it.

734
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,520
So us have-nots should always hate the haves forever just because they have?

735
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,000
Or is it because they took it away from us?

736
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,220
Well, that's why I thought.

737
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,100
I never had any to begin with, did I?

738
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,780
What's that?

739
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:21,980
Slack.

740
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,720
No, you never did, Stan.

741
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,380
I thought you knew that.

742
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,480
It's kind of a joke.

743
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,060
No, actually, you know.

744
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,540
That you have less than anybody.

745
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,440
Well, no.

746
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,300
No, the funny thing is, I do have Slack now.

747
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,500
I have something, in fact, even better than Slack.

748
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,960
Heard here on microphone, too.

749
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,200
Princess, we are dope.

750
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:44,200
In the meantime, you know, you were born with original Slack.

751
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,420
That's the shame of it.

752
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,240
We hold to the original Slack doctrine.

753
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:59,560
We were born with original Slack, but the conspiracy has been taking it away from the time that doctor first whacked you on the butt to force you to cry and take that first breath when you would have anyway.

754
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:00,960
Yes.

755
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:09,360
I think this should be flat should be the opposite of slack because when you take flack, you're taking too much critical evaluation.

756
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,520
And when you have slack, you are taking none.

757
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,520
You know what I'm saying?

758
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,100
Slack, flack.

759
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,040
It's like the yin and yang of the.

760
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,540
Well, anyway, I'm sorry.

761
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,520
I retract that.

762
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,460
I think you took the other half.

763
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,840
It's a pretty good flip flop in my mind.

764
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,220
That was the half that wasn't marked.

765
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,580
Marked up.

766
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,000
Well, let's see what this fellow here has to say.

767
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,420
Oh, you're right.

768
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:30,420


769
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,760
Oh, Brad Williams.

770
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,340
Brad Williams.

771
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:33,340


772
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,760
Is we on the air?

773
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,460
I'm on the air.

774
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,340
Dave, you can't hear me?

775
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:38,480
Can you hear the background music?

776
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,120
You sound like you're talking through one of those toilet paper tubes and you're like you're in a garbage can.

777
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,840
But I'm not talking through a toilet paper tube at all.

778
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,820
I'm talking directly into the microphone.

779
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,840
Are you wearing that huge aluminum derby that picks up signals from the inside from deep in the core of the earth?

780
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,700
How did you know?

781
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,400
Because if you are right now, you're in danger of making some airplanes go to launch.

782
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:00,940
You're in the wrong way.

783
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,680
Oh, maybe I should take it off.

784
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,820
Are you steering?

785
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,660
Yes.

786
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,060
Or are you just surfing along?

787
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,800
No steering.

788
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,660
I'm steering.

789
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,060
Huh?

790
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:10,940
Steering.

791
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:11,860
Huh?

792
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,720
Steering.

793
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,300
You see, he can't hear me at all.

794
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,940
Reference tank.

795
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,540
He cannot hear me.

796
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,500
Well, I don't know what to how to.

797
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,060
Sounds like a little.

798
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,900
Dave, is it true that you can't hear Princess?

799
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,280
You can't hear Princess Weave while she breathes heavily?

800
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,920
Well, no.

801
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,680
She sounds like a mouse having a fit.

802
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,220
Well, she always sounds sort of.

803
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,980
I am a mouse having a fit.

804
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,140
What's the big deal?

805
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,300
Did you ever try and raise rabbits and then like bite off their heads when they thought you were friends with them and stuff?

806
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,200
Only if they were chocolate rabbits.

807
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,440
Chocolate rabbits.

808
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,920
Well, of course.

809
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,140
Yeah.

810
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,480
But when you raise them, you can't expect an awful lot of respect.

811
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,240
They just sit there and they stare at you and give you strange commands.

812
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,460
So why raise chocolate rabbits if they're just going to mind control you?

813
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,900
And speaking of mind control.

814
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,280
Reagan.

815
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,100
Yeah.

816
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,220
What about Reagan?

817
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,140
Was not under mind control.

818
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,620
He was not.

819
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,460
Well, that's like saying Salvador Dali was on drugs.

820
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,060
Salvador Dali was drugs.

821
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,260
Right.

822
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,800
Reagan was mind control.

823
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,920
Just looking at Reagan was mind control.

824
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,700
It had a softening experience.

825
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,840
I mean, a softening effect.

826
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,780
Why do you think those Aero Shirts people hired him as a spokesman?

827
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,700
And Borax, 20 Mule Team Borax.

828
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,960
They knew the power.

829
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,940
The power.

830
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,000
The presence of this great man.

831
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,680
He was a hyper aware man.

832
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,000
He was close to an over man.

833
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,640
He was almost an over man.

834
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,340
But you know, he fell a few pubic hairs short because the anachronism, or not the anachronism,

835
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,920
the acrocontinism, the machinism.

836
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,100
The incontinentism.

837
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,180
The incontinentism.

838
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:49,600
The incontinental drift that Reagan was trying to get at was to reveal the secret of the

839
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,660
horror of his so-called wife, Nancy.

840
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,100
A creature, not a human.

841
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,380
Right.

842
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,120
Not even a decent actress.

843
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,240
But a thing.

844
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,680
A creeping repellent thing from beneath the hollow earth.

845
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,600
Repellent.

846
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,120
You said the right word because we're getting close to the real word.

847
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,200
Was he married to one of the lizard ladies?

848
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,540
Was she reptilian in nature?

849
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,480
We see the slanted inside eye, or what do they call it?

850
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,140
The slanted Irish?

851
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,980
The slanted nether eye.

852
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,580
Yeah, the nether eye.

853
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,240
From which came Patty and other grotesque.

854
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,420
Which was collected.

855
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,240
Which had gangly, were connected grossly to her pineal gland and gave her the power of

856
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:33,270
subliminal ejaculation, proofreading in the dark, and also making Reagan levitate without

857
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,390
any other misunderstandings with the furniture.

858
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,550
Well, in that respect though, he was way ahead of Carter.

859
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,350
Yeah.

860
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:45,430
Who couldn't do any of that but just be a simpering nice guy remembered for nothing

861
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,750
more than no terrible disasters.

862
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,670
Well.

863
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,470
How sad.

864
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,830
How sad that we.

865
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,450
To be remembered for nothing ungodly horrible happening under your watch.

866
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,290
Except that alone to some people was horrible enough.

867
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:05,850
The nothingness under Carter was to them.

868
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,930
They wanted another Reagan back in there.

869
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,510
Well, if you go back in the days like us old fellers do, and think of the times when you

870
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,010
actually could.

871
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,350
Carter killed rabbits.

872
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:21,530
There were wild rabbits attacked Carter and he wanted how he dispatched them with dispatch

873
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,310
with an oar as he stroked his oar.

874
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,150
They died.

875
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,930
I know.

876
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,410
Well, that's that's an ancient history though.

877
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,290
I guess kids probably wouldn't remember the time Jimmy Carter was attacked by a wild rabbit.

878
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,430
Well, Jimmy Carter was also accused of having.

879
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,150
A swimming rabbit.

880
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:41,430
Lust in his heart all the time, which is an awfully painful place to have it.

881
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:47,150
You have to have either, you know, centered in the groin area or you can have, well, you

882
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,550
know, I suppose you could have it in your feet too, but you cannot have it in your heart

883
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,790
because you're not going to be able to eat any spicy foods.

884
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,130
You're not going to be able to run or whistle.

885
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,110
It's it's hell on earth.

886
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,510
And this is where we're all now.

887
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:00,290
We're all in hell.

888
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,910
We're well, and they're trying to make it make us feel like it's all a big amusement

889
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,750
park ride.

890
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:06,410
Yeah.

891
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,470
Oh, it's just a ride.

892
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,750
Oh, it's supposed to be this way.

893
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:09,770
Yeah.

894
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:10,970
Oh, just accept it.

895
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,270
This is the way life is.

896
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,250
Step aboard the genocide.

897
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:15,790
Take a ride.

898
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,690
Take a ride.

899
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,450
It's a ride.

900
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:20,850
Yeah.

901
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:21,870
Yeah.

902
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,150
Just like pirates of the Caribbean.

903
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,110
You go by each scene of over the last hundred years.

904
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,110


905
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,110


906
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,510
Of man's in cruelty to other humans and so forth.

907
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,670
And you know, it's like a old two sides wax museum.

908
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,230
Only everybody gets whacked.

909
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,570
It's I like that idea, but I don't remember what it is.

910
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:40,650
Hello?

911
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:47,910
I thought you guys were sleeping again because I'm remotely viewing now.

912
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:53,690
I have my my practice manual and uh, geez, I don't know some of this stuff.

913
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:54,550
I don't really understand.

914
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,110
What's the nebulous?

915
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:56,110


916
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:01,790
I've heard of war goes or got me do somebody like looks like he's holding his ears with

917
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,490
his whole fist.

918
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:13,110
Could that be from the government or people down the street?

919
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:13,950
Huh?

920
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,370
I don't know, man.

921
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,030
I don't know.

922
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,610
I've been getting strange commands from the appliances again.

923
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,110
I mean, I told it like go to the bathroom.

924
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,110


925
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,110


926
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,110


927
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,110


928
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,110


929
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,110


930
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,110


931
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,110


932
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,110


933
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:32,150
I put joy and I want it to create a normal life.

934
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,270
But how can I do this?

935
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:36,270


936
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,690
It's like going into the bathroom together very, very up in the

937
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:45,610
don't like you're in about the same boat as most bad about three quarters of the Americans.

938
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,090
They're calling this show and starving.

939
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,070
And I gave me a rodent.

940
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:56,090
Why I mean, okay, I say some of them by choice, but other ones are, you know, forces on me.

941
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:56,090


942
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:56,090


943
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:56,090


944
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,890
Hey, look, this is not

945
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,630
Yeah, you are sorry

946
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,650
You have-nots make me sick

947
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:11,230
We have-littles are so much better than you have-nots

948
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,070
And have-littles, very-littles

949
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,830
We have some

950
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:18,610
Why, we're almost as much as those who have a fair amount

951
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,110
Now, you better watch how you use that term, we

952
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,650
I think you ought to have a political wing in your church

953
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:29,950
We do, patro-psychotic-anarcho-materialism

954
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,590
Every yard of kingdom

955
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,610
Of course, I think it should be

956
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:37,890
It should spring forth like a thousand purple flowers

957
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,950
So, are you going to run for office now?

958
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,010
Is that what you're saying, Dave?

959
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,410
No, I'm going to run officially for officer

960
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah

961
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,770
You're like all the other griping protesters and have-nots

962
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:52,070
Yeah

963
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,330
Yeah, you just want to tear things down

964
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,610
When you don't have anything to put in its place

965
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:57,430
Praise Bob

966
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,510
Tear down the world

967
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,410
Oh, we're going to Eden, brothers

968
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,310
A world without care

969
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,070
Where slack is everywhere

970
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,310
Yeah, I don't believe it

971
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,130
I don't believe you're offering mankind

972
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,430
Or womankind or anybody

973
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:15,590
Anything

974
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,190
We're offering them eternal salvation, Dave

975
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,510
Yeah, you don't say that

976
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,570
We're offering them slack

977
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,750
We're offering them a promise

978
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,410
And a bunch of highfaluting, high-sounding words

979
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,930
Lofty words, lofty thoughts

980
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,630
Feelings

981
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,570
We help them build up a feeling

982
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,210
That there's meaning in the world

983
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,530
That life is worth living

984
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,910
Yeah, it is

985
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:37,990
Uh, no

986
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,810
We are offering a bunch of

987
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:41,370
A lie

988
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:42,130
A lie

989
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,230
A lie

990
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:50,370
Yes, but you see

991
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,730
Because we admit that we're not living in the world

992
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:51,730


993
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:51,730


994
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,290
That it is all bogus and lies

995
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,470
That makes us the one true truth tellers

996
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:57,470
Well, unfortunately

997
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:58,930
That we're the only ones you can trust

998
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,010
That's kind of true, unfortunately

999
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,570
They tell you the truth about all the lies

1000
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,870
It's not our fault

1001
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:08,370
That we're the most honest liars in the world

1002
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,610
It's like we didn't ask for this

1003
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:11,510
It's not our

1004
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,790
It was

1005
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,630
Bob held a gun to our heads

1006
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,430
And said get out there and start selling and lying

1007
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,310
But isn't it like being the handsomest, squeakiest, singing pig

1008
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:21,930
On the block

1009
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,350
I mean, who cares

1010
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,570
So you've dispensed truth from the vial of lies

1011
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,990
And you've dispensed lies from the vial of truth

1012
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,330
Come on, folks

1013
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:30,790
I mean

1014
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,610
I mean

1015
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,050
I'm confused by it

1016
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,770
It's not heartless, Randy

1017
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,090
I know there's some heart there

1018
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,570
And I know there's a great deal of some sort of

1019
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:45,970
Twisted mind

1020
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,170
But I'm

1021
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,890
The core leaves me

1022
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:50,770
Still not understanding

1023
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,010
After all these years

1024
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,890
How many years has it been now?

1025
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,230
Oh, it doesn't matter

1026
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:58,950
I know

1027
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,450
Of two minutes, a thousand years

1028
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:04,670
What's the difference as Bob measures time?

1029
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:06,630
We are but moats

1030
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,890
In Bob's eye

1031
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:14,090
We are as hangnails in his fingers

1032
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,370
We are as tiny bamboo shoots

1033
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,210
Nailed up under his toenails

1034
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,570
To make him confess

1035
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,210
We are but hand lighters

1036
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,590
On his tiny evacuating chair

1037
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,510
Next to the precipice

1038
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,530
That's got all the bad currents there

1039
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,270
It's a bummer, man

1040
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,570
It's gonna be a bummer, man

1041
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,610
That's what Bob said

1042
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,070
He said it was gonna be a bummer

1043
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:35,770
Was he right?

1044
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,030
Or what, man?

1045
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,210
We are like Icarus

1046
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,750
Without wings of wax

1047
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,830
When we fly too close to the sun

1048
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:42,450
The wings

1049
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,350
But aren't we forgetting something, Dave?

1050
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,710
Aren't we forgetting the promise?

1051
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,170
The promise Bob holds out for us of X-Day?

1052
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,210
The escape vessels and the end of the world

1053
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,710
Of the others and so forth

1054
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,710
Or at least a big party out at Brushwood

1055
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,810
On July 5th

1056
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,030
Yeah, man

1057
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,870
Well, not all the things

1058
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,090
But, you know

1059
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:05,570
When the lawnmower goes across the carpet of the earth

1060
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:06,790
I, I, I, you know

1061
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,010
When the lawnmower goes across the carpet of the earth

1062
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,990
I'm hoping that

1063
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,650
Well, that should be in about a month, right?

1064
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:16,210
If Bob's prophecy doesn't hold

1065
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,730
If you got it right once, you know

1066
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,910
If for one time

1067
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,510
You know, of all these times

1068
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:21,650
How many times has it been?

1069
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,030
It was 95, was it the first?

1070
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:24,950
No, no, 1990

1071
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,390
Those were drills, Dave

1072
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,670
Conspiracy calendar 1998

1073
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,130
Yeah, we had some drills

1074
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,250
And then it turned out

1075
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,290
All the other subsequent ends of the world

1076
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,850
Were just end of the world drills

1077
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:34,690
But

1078
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:38,790
So, the Jehovah's Witnesses do that

1079
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,710
And they've got a huge kingdom hall

1080
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,070
Right down the street from here

1081
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,450
These, all kinds of

1082
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,950
The Hindus have predicted the end of the world

1083
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:47,990
And they've got

1084
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,870
They've got those

1085
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:53,410
Yeah, they've got those teams of singers out there

1086
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,170
Tapping those little bells

1087
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:57,830
And boy, lots of religions predict the end of the world

1088
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,990
And the coming of a great messiah and all that

1089
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,730
And then, you know, everybody's let down

1090
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:04,370
But does that stop the believers from believing?

1091
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,590
Does it stop people from giving money?

1092
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,110
Does it stop the government from

1093
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:11,570
You know, from not taxing?

1094
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:12,110
Does it?

1095
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:12,570
No

1096
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:14,950
These religions, all they get that

1097
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,150
They keep getting on

1098
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,330
That, they get that great break

1099
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:20,670
From all the governments

1100
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,570
As if they were doing some sort of service

1101
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,750
Predicting the world

1102
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,590
Ending over and over and over and over again

1103
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:26,550
Yeah

1104
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,090
How are we any different?

1105
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,990
Actually, I guess we're not that different

1106
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,410
You know, you convinced me

1107
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,270
We should have raised

1108
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,170
You convinced yourself

1109
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,710
But you just convinced me

1110
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,650
I did?

1111
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:38,210
Yes

1112
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:39,370
Because

1113
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,910
All of a sudden I saw Dobbs

1114
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,370
The, the immaculate salesman

1115
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,210
As

1116
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,150
I mean, look

1117
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,530
Any of these churches

1118
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,690
And these other religious groups

1119
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:49,590
You know, I mean

1120
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:50,930
Jesus Christ is just a salesman

1121
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:51,870
And he's taking your money

1122
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:52,570
You know what I'm saying?

1123
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:53,970
Well, but no

1124
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,910
Jesus is the son of God

1125
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:57,510
And can give you eternal salvation

1126
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,830
Bob can, is not the son of anybody important

1127
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,750
And can give you eternal salvation

1128
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,330
Or maybe he can't

1129
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,010
But if he doesn't

1130
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:08,010
He'll give you 90 bucks

1131
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,530
As a recompense

1132
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,390
Well, anarcho-patriarchal psycho

1133
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:15,730
Soon as you go to the subgenius office in hell

1134
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,850
And apply for that triple money back thing

1135
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:19,570
And you're not going to get any money back

1136
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:20,910
In no time at all

1137
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:21,770
There'll be some delay

1138
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,290
As they process the paperwork

1139
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:23,950
It is hell

1140
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,050
Well, yeah, there's usually a minor

1141
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,350
Three-week delay

1142
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,150
In at least getting the paperwork across

1143
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,870
You know, some of the other desks

1144
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,570
Right, and a week in hell

1145
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,770
Is a little different from a week on

1146
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,070
Or on, well, on earth

1147
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,150
The hell plane one

1148
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,790
Or earth as we call it

1149
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:39,450
It's a scourge

1150
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:40,190
A little longer

1151
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:40,650
Yeah

1152
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,410
A little longer there

1153
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,470
But, you know, it's not something

1154
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,770
That a human should worry about

1155
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,910
Or fret their pretty little heads over

1156
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:49,570
That time goes on

1157
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:50,190
As it goes

1158
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,510
And you will receive your money back

1159
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,390
Yeah, that's what

1160
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,630
That's where the faith comes in

1161
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,270
You just have to keep having faith

1162
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:01,410
That's the miracle that happens

1163
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,770
Every single day

1164
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,010
Someone somewhere has faith

1165
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,270
And that itself is the miracle

1166
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:10,110
Yes, and they have a thousand faces

1167
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,290
All painted differently

1168
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,810
With funny bird nostrils

1169
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,990
And the big, big, big, big

1170
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:18,670
Tiny yellow mite that's growing

1171
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,510
From their head

1172
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,610
Well, you know, folks who have

1173
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,870
No faith at all

1174
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,670
Should check out www.subgenius.com

1175
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:28,250
On the internet

1176
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,930
If they're interested in finding out

1177
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:32,790
More about it

1178
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:35,690
I can't encourage you to do that

1179
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:36,770
For any other reason

1180
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,390
Than just to further your knowledge

1181
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,630
Of these curious things

1182
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:45,670
Anyway, Dave, the show is coming

1183
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,470
Is shuffling

1184
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,230
To an end

1185
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,050
It's kind of

1186
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,970
You know, it's crawling

1187
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,470
It's puffing and puffing

1188
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:59,450
Its way to Bethlehem

1189
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,930
To be reborn

1190
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,370
I get so excited

1191
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,770
When I hear the

1192
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,290
Subgenius website

1193
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,870
Now you're talking about slouch?

1194
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,730
Yes, the hour of slouch

1195
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,110
Slouches its way

1196
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,430
It's sloughing off

1197
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,270
Westwardly to Bethlehem

1198
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,910
They're sloughing off into the sunshine

1199
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:20,970
To the distant heavens

1200
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,690
And the best

1201
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:23,870
The three wise acres

1202
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,930
Pulled their little tiny muckies

1203
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:29,910
Down the road in a donkey shoe

1204
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:30,450
I'm sorry

1205
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,410
Smurde-lacking down the road

1206
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,230
As far as I've ever heard before

1207
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,910
The best laid plans

1208
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,510
Of mice and men to get laid

1209
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,210
Go off the gangplank

1210
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,450
Of stray all the time

1211
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,550
The finest plans of moose and booboos

1212
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,630
As always, don't remember to forget

1213
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,450
Which came first?

1214
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,670
The chicken or the egg?

1215
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,710
Tell them this

1216
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:52,730
Just tell them

1217
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,250
I never had my eyes

1218
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,330
Or my prefrontal lobes

1219
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,830
Poked out by egg

1220
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:57,970
Well, we'll

1221
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:58,950
And on that note

1222
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,870
We'll go back to Dr. Howell's discussion

1223
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,110
He actually answers the question

1224
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,230
Of which came first

1225
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,630
The chicken or the egg

1226
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,250
Thank you, lonesome cowboy

1227
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:07,990
Thank you

1228
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:09,170
Thank you very much, Reverend Day

1229
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,230
Thank you, Day

1230
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,970
Thank you, Princess Weedy and Carnation

1231
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,110
Yellow inner lining

1232
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,710
Dispose of the rest of the inner

1233
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,850
Including these two

1234
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,950
In the necks and the crop

1235
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,250
A sack that may be empty

1236
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,250
Or full of food

1237
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:25,750
Located under the skin

1238
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,450
Just at the base of the neck

1239
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,710
You could give it a little snip here

1240
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,510
And there you go

1241
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:31,190
Oh yes

1242
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:33,010
Keep the egg-making machinery

1243
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,130
Of any old hen

1244
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,290
Including the rope

1245
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:37,330
That developed the eels

1246
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:38,590
Delicious

1247
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:40,830
And proof that the bird

1248
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,390
That went into the stool

1249
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:43,190
Was home grown

1250
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:44,430
And the next thing you knew

1251
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,190
I'm sure the bird itself

1252
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:46,890
Would have grew

1253
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,190
Eee!

1254
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,690
Some kind of power option

1255
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:52,450
Now don't worry much

1256
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,750
About chicken disease

1257
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,770
Just clean out the litter and the run

1258
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,410
And disinfect the house and furniture

1259
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:59,290
Twice a year

1260
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,630
And you should be largely problem-free

1261
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,490
Or yourself and your family

1262
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,670
Dispose of any bird that looks ill

1263
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,730
If it's plump, you might as well eat it

1264
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,410
If it's scrawny and wasted

1265
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:13,870
The bird could kill you

1266
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,330
At a varied, unsaid agreement

1267
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,170
As just to how much

1268
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:20,230
It's worth

1269
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,230


1270
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,390
With a stake through its heart

1271
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,790
And a sprig of garlic in its beak

1272
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:25,730
Before we all

1273
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:26,650
Well

1274
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,130
People, you know

1275
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,950
You know

1276
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,410
There are people you know

1277
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,770
That are relatively normal on the surface

1278
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,490
But they still have this kind of

1279
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,770
Anti-establishment thing of theirs

1280
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,930
Have to understand

1281
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:43,770
They stand by just in case

1282
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:44,830
The simple truth

1283
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:46,090
Just in case our continent

1284
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,670
Got to one of those places

1285
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:49,230
But anyway you do it

1286
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:49,450
Where you can't get out

1287
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:49,450


1288
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:49,450


1289
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:49,450


1290
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:49,450


1291
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:49,450


1292
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:49,450


1293
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:49,450


1294
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:49,450


1295
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:49,450


1296
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,030
Whether you buy a starter bullet

1297
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,770
Or if you make your own eggs

1298
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,490
You can look forward to eggs and poultry

1299
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:56,610
With a flavor

1300
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,730
Or certain force

1301
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,570
Of sheep-like behavior pattern

1302
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,410
In your supermarket

1303
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,950
Peanut, peanut, peanut

1304
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:08,430
Peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut

1305
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,310
Peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut

1306
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:12,170
Peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut

1307
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,670
Peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut

1308
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,170
Oh yes dear friends

1309
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:31,270
This music in the background is by Norrell Preff

1310
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,650
We heard a little cut up there

1311
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,410
Peanut by I.M.B.J.R

1312
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,470
Before that was Dr. Howell

1313
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,530
Puzzling Evidence

1314
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,970
And Don Joyce from Negative Land

1315
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:44,030
Taking over the Puzzling Evidence show

1316
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,490
When Puzzling Evidence was near

1317
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,270
Philo and Hal Blathering

1318
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,530
Friends this is

1319
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,430
The subject of

1320
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,970
The Genius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

1321
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,770
Happens to be number nine hundred and forty seven

1322
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,050
Huh

1323
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,390
And uh

1324
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:58,850
Uh who?

1325
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,710
A-ra-ra-ra

1326
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:02,750
Oh baby you're mad at me

1327
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,190
If we wish to have positive experiences in our lives

1328
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,350
We have to keep our conscious mind focused

1329
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,530
On positive things

1330
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,570
Positive events

1331
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:10,490
Positive circumstances

1332
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:30,190
You are even trying to push your own normal

1333
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:36,030
Actually sunny клиíll

1334
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:39,910
Bye bye

1335
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,170
So sorry Romeo

1336
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:42,470
album Legacy.

1337
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:44,970
Reverend Jim Ryan

1338
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,150
on that. They were

1339
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:49,010
got a Grammy nomination

1340
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,290
for that album.

1341
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:51,630
Oh.

1342
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:53,970
We have to change.

1343
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:54,570
Right.

1344
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:55,250
Right.

1345
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:56,270
Right.

1346
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,270
Right.

1347
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:41,430
Right.

1348
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:42,430
Right.

1349
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:43,310
Right.

1350
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:43,850


1351
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:44,250


1352
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:44,290


1353
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:47,970
Right.

1354
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:22,750
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1355
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:25,530
Looney Tune by Noral Pratt and the Viet.

1356
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:28,890
A brief, uh, respite.

1357
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:30,950
And now, uh...

1358
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,150
Ready, one, two, ready, go.

1359
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,550
Thank you.

1360
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,850
Bob loves you.

1361
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,770
Bob loves you.

1362
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,010
Bob loves you.

1363
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:58,730
Bob loves you.

1364
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,590
Bob loves you.

1365
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:08,530
Bob loves you.
