Being played on a digital audio system.
A flash, a flash, a flash.
What's wrong with this thing? Come on, man, tune in.
Tune in for...
I'd like to buy the world of...
And tonight the stars will be out.
Don't you know that goddess Pooh Bear?
Goddess Pooh Bear?
Goddess Pooh Bear?
That's what we people call ourselves.
Idiots.
Yeah.
This is the end of the society.
The Slinkys, the Slinkys.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Little más goko's again.
It's a ride.
That's a efendim.
about. If you touch me, try to stop me, I'll throw the switch. How long is it? That's a rather...
How long is it? How long is it? Why, it's... The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.
Are you one of the frightened? Science is but an organized system of ignorance.
Nothing's accomplished by this. Nothing that makes sense.
You realize there's a government directive stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer.
Friends.
Friendly people getting to know one another.
I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass.
Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
As you sow evil, so shall you reap evil.
Praise God.
Nobody will stop me, because I am the true underground messiah.
When you come to my show, you're going to a war.
And I'm out for violence, chaos, lawlessness, all the way.
I don't care about anybody or anything except for myself and my mission.
And your kids out there, if you've got kids out there, they're gonna be my kids.
I'm gonna own those kids. They're gonna do anything that I say.
I'm the king, and they can identify with me, because the real true nonconformist children in this country
are sick and tired of their parents, their schools, their people force-feeding them what to do.
I am the answer. When they listen to my lyrics, and they listen to my words, they're gonna be the king.
They're gonna listen to my songs. They're listening to the way that it really should be.
And you know that, and I know that. So don't bring...
You know...
Get a ball. Go! Go, man!
Keeping him out could make him worse. After all, he is crazy.
You know... and... and you can't get through to him, because...
Thank you.
We trust, my listening and viewing friend, that today's broadcast has brought comfort as well as conviction.
Maybe you have a prayer request that you...
would like to give to our church, and we can pray for you as a church body during our Wednesday night prayer service.
Please...
Yes, dear friends, we'll... we'll pray for your church body.
And, uh... where's my... there's that volume control... here's this volume control, and everything's fine!
And we're back to... normal, I guess.
Uh...
And I've got lots of radio...
tapes from my trip out to New York and Cleveland.
W...
MUF and Reverend Ed Strange's show.
And WCSB and the Einstein Secret Orchestra show.
Yes, and... and also these Media Barrage tapes, friends.
I forgot to give credits last time.
The Media Barrage, or Audio Collage, you might say, material that we just heard just a second ago,
was by, uh, our new Reverend Felicia, or Felacia, I like to say.
Um... and, uh... I... I've been looking for the other tape that Reverend Felacia sent
that was just the laughter and rutting sounds of a yeti.
Um... Felacia is a... is a yetinsen of, uh... of... of a... of a gender that is in transit, apparently.
We'll see.
I... you know...
Friends... takes all kinds to make up this old church.
Oh, and the other Media Barrage Audio Collage that I've been playing is, uh, by...
of Chaz Smith of Einstein Secret Orchestra.
Friends at WSFMU, listeners probably are... have heard that some.
And, uh... oh, it's a beautiful barrage.
He... Chaz got himself one of those old-fashioned-y tape decks that has the spring-loading, uh...

sound-coded pause edit button.
So hard to find in today's, uh, gimmick-obsessed world.
But I don't wanna, uh, get lost in the dogma, griping and bitching, as usual, about some technical thing.
Friends! Uh... uh... uh... we've been really busy here at the church,
uh... mainly, uh, producing artwork for this new Steve Jackson game that's getting sort of wrapped up now.
And, uh, I'm fixin' to go to, uh, uh, De Vival in Austin, uh, this weekend, but, uh... by the time you hear about it, it won't be done.

nothing but a bunch of tapes and it's just wonderful it's so wonderful living in the realm
of the church of the subgenius yes it is
anyway um i'm not sure where we go from here friends but i know that subgenius hell
is uh not really all that bad of a fate you know just in case you decide that that eternal
salvation wasn't all it was cracked up to be you'll probably kind of dig the hell part too
anyway enough enough
and there'll be no smoking in the gas chamber
and that's right jimmy and also i have to correct my credits i just gave uh
friends
reverend strange is not on wmuf he's on wmuh in lovely allentown pennsylvania this show uh
that'll be coming up features uh dr legume and myself as well as a lot of music that he picked
that's great and um chaz uh chaz's media barrage would not be familiar to listeners of wfmu
albeit that is a noble
statement
indeed uh but rather wcsb which is the home of einstein's secret orchestra and the swamp
radio of chaz and uh the guests a special guest of which on that show with lonesome cowboy dave
and chaz are myself and princess we are though and uh thank you this in the background is hate
for a pink planet from aram check
in there
yes
so
is
so
in the
allowing
f liv well anyway
Oh, three years in it.
And they put themselves in boxes, and that's not the right way of living.
Because younger people, their minds are a little more keener,
and they can figure this out.
So therefore, since they can't get release and respect from the older people,
then they go into these other things.
And then music gets louder, and it gets rebellious,
because it's starting to form a religion, you know.
Because you're not going to find it in church.
A lot of kids, you know, don't find nothing in church.
I remember when I got thrown out of church
because I had the improper clothes on.
I had tennis shoes and a suit, and they said, well, that's not proper.
So we don't have no money to get anything else.
So I just got thrown out of church anyway,
and it's nothing but an institution, so they don't have to find nothing there.
Well, stick around, have an open mind, listen.
You may hear things you've never heard before.
Germany was having trouble, what a sad, sad story.
It needed a new leader to restore its former glory.
Where, oh, where was he?
Where could that man be?
We looked around, and then we found
The man for you and me.
And now it's
Springtime for Hitler and Germany.
Deutschland is happy and gay.
We're marching to a faster pace.
Look out, here comes the master race.
Springtime for Hitler and Germany.
Winter for Poland and France.
Winter for Poland and France.


Springtime for Hitler and Germany.
Come on, Germans, go into your dance.
I was born in Dusseldorf, and that is why they call me Rolf.
Don't be stupid, be a smarty.
Come and join the Nazi party.
In short.
Your leaders are

Boy, the girls are laughing at that, and you know what?
That's an old Buck Naked routine.
I stole that from Buck Naked, who now hates the church.
He thinks that evil people are in the church now.
Evil.
He has everyone who looks over at Dr. Lequeum, innocent, with his innocent little sweet baby face.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I am not an evil man.
I've got this really bad reputation as being an evil man.
But the fact is, I just do what has to be done.
Yeah, I mean.
He never killed anyone on purpose.
Can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.
It's true.
It's true.
I mean, if you get a flat tire, you've got to change it.
And Lequeum, he's making one damn big omelet for Bob.
That's right.
Man, that omelet's going to feed 40,000 on that escape vessel.
Hey, if I've got to break a few eggs and make me that omelet,
hell, hand me the spatula and the pan full of grease.
I'll be glad to start cooking.
Hand me that pan full of brains.
Brains on drugs, and I'll get to frying.
We're going to need a lot of brains on drugs to make this omelet.
Ah, smell that brain on drugs cooking over there,
sizzling away in that grease.
Let's have some bacon with that.
I had a great mess of brains on drugs at Shoney's the other day
for all-you-can-eat breakfast.
Well, I had my brains on drugs hold the drugs.
I just had the brains.
Oh, if you're not going to eat them drugs, can I have them?
I'll have them in a Texas enchilada with a fried egg on top.
Uh, what?
Hey, kids, you are listening.
This is not a tape.
This is actually happening live in your very ugly face, kids.
Very poor warm-up.
The Prince's We Are Dough.
The Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
Ha, ha, ha.
Yours truly, Chaz Smith and the Reverend Ivan Stang.
Live in your very face, kids.
Only here on ESO Radio.
That's right.
Only in the swamp.
And I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh,
I think Ivan is here on an evangelical sort of quest
to elucidate throughout the world.
About the evening.
The, uh, the final times.
He's hallucinating throughout the evening.
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, we always end up starting to talk about
whatever the latest trendy drugs are that the kids are doing.
And we forget about Bob.
It starts with a candidate.
Forget about Bob.
Hey, it's so easy to forget Bob.
To leave Bob out of your life in today's,
the hustle and bustle of today's modern world.
Backslider.
Sure.
You know, it's like Bob ain't always breathing down your neck
like,
some messiahs I could probably mention.
But sometimes he's licking right up close to the back of your short hairs.
Well, now, yeah, he can kick Bob.
He can leave him behind you.
I've been goosed by the old pipe, pipe man myself.
He's left him straight along the line.
I've been goosed by the pipe.
That thing is hot.
You did go all the way, didn't you?
Uh, I don't like to talk about that.
You do want to talk about it.
No, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I saw your lips quivering.
No, that's because I'm red.
Come on, man.
You want to talk about it.
I'm hearing those voices again on my teeth.
Oh, well, that's because...
Or is that you?
No, that's not me.
Or is that your teeth?
No, that's not my teeth.
These are the new micro-nasal implants.
They go all the way back up beyond the septum right here.
And as they move, they start moving, by the way.
As they start moving, I guess you get more enlightenable.
Or at least get less in the dark.
Now, I saw an ad in Wired that said that those enhance telepathic linking ability.
Well, they're supposed to.
But so far, I can't even pick up...
I can't even pick up a good radio signal on them.
I've been trying to figure out what you guys have been thinking about all night,
but I haven't been able to do it.
Well, we have.
I have a static generator.
You have a static generator?
Well, I have to.
I have to.
You know, it has to be...
Some of us aren't...
It has to be scrambled in case we're caught and interrogated.
Oh, no.
The froth, actually.
That's why Bob forces those of us who work closely with him
to...
to take a lot of the Havifrop, Zipulops medicine stuff.
In case we're interrogated, we can't remember what it was.
What any of it was.
At any point along the way.
It's the subgenius form of the flashy thing.
The flashy thing?
The flashy thing.
It's plausible denial, we call it.
Well, you guys was them guys that busted up all that stuff at Fort Meade
with the D.I.N. and everything.
I heard them remote viewers was all over the place looking.
Looking up everybody's buttholes.
And then along came the big static plongo.
And that was you guys.
You turned them off one night in June.
Some year, 1990, whatever.
Yeah, back in them days, we were pretty anti-establishment.
But now you are the establishment, aren't you?
Well, no, we're the official anti-establishment now.
The establishment is anti-establishment.
Right.
Right, yes, the authorized anti-establishment.
You know, before...
Before us, it was, what, rave, I think.
Before that, it was, what, punk, and then that hippie thing.
There's always some authorized anti-establishment.
Establishment.
Enjoy.
Yes.
Have fun.
It's been great, actually.
They pay us quite well.
Every subgenius address goes to the CIA and MTV
and all of those other federal agencies.
Oh, the big, big monochronos.
NPR.
PPN.
The DIA, once again.
Melantel.
I was there.
I was there.
The DMZ.
I did a bunch of DMZ the other night,
and I would not recommend that to the amateurs.
Yeah, me and Stubblebine was trying to raise spoons with our eyelids.
We had a whole cabal of colonels and some kind of witchcrafts in there,
and we were just moving things around like nothing until that thing went off.
That's that LED, isn't it?
Well, these guys used to do a nightclub act
where they would bend the little spoons with their eyelids.
Yeah, and then we'd bend over.
And that was how they got the job with the CIA.
And that's why I know Dave.
That's where we met, in a little CIA lab.
They were studying him.
Oh, no.
Yeah, we had wild talent.
We loved him.
That's interesting.
That's really interesting.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, the subject, you can see the subject is very pliable, of course.
And it's very easy to control with a microorganism.
Once it's not only a neurotransmitter,
but after a period of time, the brain will begin to degenerate
until it's nothing but a little shh.
A little stinky pile in the back of the cerebral cortex.
Nothing but some rotted dopamine,
which Professor Smith and I usually scrape up off of the operating table.
And smoke, actually.
It's not a bad smoke.
We mix it with Vorkham Rift.
Melititious.
Scrambled, scrambled Vorkham Rift with the little brain left over.
Sprinkled over some scrambled brains on drugs.
It's an exit.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Absolutely excellent.
But it makes your accent float a lot of the place.
It makes you...
So you don't even know what country you're from.
In fact, it takes a long time to figure what country you're from.
It takes...
In fact, sometimes it takes minutes to figure what country you're coming from.
What place you're going to.
Sometimes you never figure out where you're going.
You wander around and around and around.
I'm not sure where I am.
I'm not sure where I am.
How about here?



Ah, hello, my.
You're not here right now.
I can see you, but it's not you.
I am not here.
You are not where you think you are.
You are in the wrong place.
No, no, no, no.
Look at this.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Grown-Up Stumps.
This is the prenuptial agreement,
and it is guaranteed for exactly as long as the implants,
the nasal implants...
Micronasal.
Oh, micronasal implants.
Is that what you're selling?
Top of the line.
You can drop the fake accent and all that stuff now.
Yeah, I'll get down to it already.
Well, okay.
Well, we might as well get down to business.
Micronasal implants.
We're talking nano, too.
We're talking these things will also move laterally, up and down.
They'll reach right out of the old nostril and intertwine,
I've been given to understand.
You can do the Yeti style, nasal hair, intertwining, sex.
I wouldn't want to try, but yes, it is written in.
Yes, and these also have been known to explode.
I ain't never tried it.
Let's put it that way.
Then they will flow all through the body.
What?
They explode, yes.
Yeah, well, some of them do that.
That's true.
It is possible.
Does that come with the squeegee blistex?
Hey!
You think I cannot see?
Like father.
The minute you walked in the joint.
Like sons.
Now he's in trouble.
We refuse to be responsible.
Flop, flop, fizz, fizz.
We have a call back for eight seconds.
Two seconds.
Negative, Kay.
Nothing further.
Just see the cabbie on the corner.
Hey, Nani Nani.
She fell from the sky.
She fell very far.
She fell very far.
You cannot petition!
Send the line with prayer!
When I take out my big tennis.
Howdy.
Future events such as these
will affect you in the future.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
Um, do you want to come upstairs?
Hooray!
Hooray!
In which we're examining the Ten Commandments.
So, what do you think?
There are places in Argentina where they will actually serve the human brain.
They'll actually get a human being with a hole, a table with a hole cut in the middle,
and they'll put the human under the table, just his head sticking up, and he can bash
his head open, crack it.
Well, they have special crackers.
Right.
With a big, like a giant nutcracker.
Kind of like a big Humpty Dumpty ant.
Right, and then he can scoop out the fresh human brain, right, then and there.
While he's alive.
While he's still kicking.
He's still, still, sort of.
He's still a kick.
He kills them pretty quick.
It's more of a twitch.
Yeah, but they're still hot.
Yeah, still warm.
98?
98.6 degrees.
Mm-mm.
Farm fresh, yeah.
They grow them down there special, too.
Oh, humans.
Well, anyway, this is.
This is 98.6.
Oh, this is that radio station that you're listening to and not whichever one they're
talking about right now.
Well, actually it is WMUH.
Oh, no, no, it's not.
It was recorded in Allentown.
You're just.
You're just on WMUH.
What the hell are we doing here on a Sunday night?
We left our.
We sure as hell aren't taking our antidepressants.
No, sir.
We left them home.
No, sir, ma'am.
Not on this show.
Threw those out.
That's right.
Threw those out with the E. coli ridden beef.
That's right.
We had to do it.
Hey, man, the E. coli is the best part.
Well, for some people.
You know, we figured out.
The wimps would get sick.
We figured out who poisoned all those 25 billion head of cattle in Nebraska, and so they're





going to have to wait until the end of the month to get it back.
We saw the banger.





We wanted to make sure that Burger King could not sell burgers for a day and lost $10 million.
The culprit, needless to say, McDonald's.
I was on the.
This is all alleged, right.
This isn't alleged.
No, this is obvious.
This is damned obvious.
I pulled up.
I pulled up.
Wrong.
It was Burger King did it to themselves so they could make it look like McDonald's.
They could make it look like McDonald's.
And they're saying it's all wrong.

Oops, that's where I have to flip that tape.
Oh, no way, man.
Think about it.
I know who it was.
It was all them mom-and-pop hamburger joints all got together,
and they formed a conspiracy of mom-and-pop hamburger joints.
A monopoly of mom-and-pop independent hamburger joints.
They're trying to pit McDonald's against Burger King for the final war.
Or Armageddon.
Gog versus Magog.
I just thought of something.
It's always all about organized labor.
You think it's a coincidence that those UPS workers wore brown shirts?
Well, do you think it's a coincidence that the conspiracy is trying to convince people
that it's good to labor and that it's good to be organized,
and then the organized labor is somehow even better?
And people swallow this.
They go for it.
Oh, yeah, I'd love to go work.
Yep.
For someone else for eight hours a day.
I'd love to do that.
It seems like the most natural thing in the world.
That's what you have to do to pay your rent and be a decent person, right?
I hope not.
Well, we're trying to prove that it's not necessary.
Just a few fools standing up against the Goliath trying to knock him on his ass.
That's why you need Bob.
That's why you need a wife that works in a color TV.
Listeners at home.
Yeah.
Or at least a TV and a colored wife who works.
Listeners at home, don't think that you work.
You don't work.
You only think you work.
I work.
Bob works.
Ivan Stang works.
Dr. Lagoon works.
We work to fight the conspiracy.
What do you do?
Just sit on your fat asses.
And the funny thing is the kind of work we do, it's just like playing.
It's just like playing with ourselves.
Yeah.
We get paid to literally play with ourselves.
To play with our...
Our own brains.
Don't get the wrong idea.
No, this is a family show.
Yeah, our brains are located between our legs.
But that's a...
Until we all get together.
Beside the point.
The anatomy lessons for next week.
Yeah.
Tune in then.
You will learn about these special glands and their proper location.
You sure are a pretty man, Reverend Stang.
Yeah.
He gets real nervous.
I've been saying that to him for a long time now.
He always gets a little nervous when I say that.
I mean, face it.
It's because I know you're serious.
You know he likes it.
You know he loves it.
You think he would dress that way?
He's asking for it.
That's what he's doing.
Wandering around in that little short cocktail dress.
He asked for it, Your Honor.
It was Moses, a king of men.
Moses, children.
But, Your Honor, he enjoyed it too.
I know he was under the influence.
I know.
I've seen him swallow a whole load of Gleet just before I picked him up.
Next thing you know, there he is, all strung out on Gleet and ready to lift his little pink cocktail dress up for anybody with a nickel.
Was that American Gleet or was that German Gleet?
Oh, man.
Nine hits of German Gleet.
Case dismissed.
Twelve hits of Dobstown Gleet.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you don't need twelve hits.

Twelve molecules of Dobstown Gleet.
I think General Ripper found out about your pre-verses.
That's all I have.
We're organizing some kind of mutiny of pre-verts.
A mutiny of pre-verts, friends.
That's the church of the subgenius.
Pre-verts and pre-anticipatory Gleet.
Right.
Go together.
I think there's some kind of deviated pre-vert.
Let them look.
I'm proud of who I am.
Let them look.
I'm proud of who I am.
Let them look.
One hundred percent first quality copper blind beef.
One hundred percent first quality copper blind beef.
One hundred percent first quality copper blind beef.
But then we have that other tape that we can't play because you would be offended.
I was offended.
That's why I play it over and over again.
over again.
But then,
I'm a sub-G.
The sickest part is,
and the saddest part is,
that there are no cuss words in it.
We can play it on the air,
and yet we can't.
That's right.
Funny how that works here in America.
Yeah, here in...
Here in America,
where a man can lose his right
to speak out in public.
That's right.
Hey, Lagoon.
You can lose your right
to speak out in public.
Chill out.
Don't you tell me to chill out,
you bastard.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That cop.
That cop bastard.
I hope he's out there listening.
Oh, for those...
Tells me I gotta chill out.
For those of you who...
When was there a law
that said I had to chill out?
The hell with that bastard.
I hope he gets shot by a crack dealer.
I don't know if you noticed,
but the last time I checked,
the law was,
no sub-genius can do anything it wants.
Get that?
Yeah.
No sub-genius
can do anything it wants.
That is the law
as it stands
in the United States today.
He may not like it.
I sure as hell don't like it,
but you better live with it
or else you better believe
the man will pull a David Koresh on you.
He will...
He will ruby ridge you
before you have time to turn around.
For those of you at home
who've been following along,
just so you know
what we're talking about
recently this week,
Dr. Lagoon was issued
a verbal warning
by an undercover police officer
in a Kmart
for disturbing the peace
by uttering the following words.
Customer service
to the furniture department.
The surviving freaks
who seemed immune to the plague
I decided to receive
as an object lesson
in how far human kicks can go.

I read me.

Okay, when we see, uh, we-
They're like faking my voice.
Yeah, look, see- It's not really me
that's thinking anymore.
Yeah, like he's- he's- he's telling you
the whole thing, man. Like, he- watch him, watch him.
He's going on, he's going on. I've got a right to the-
They're supposed to give me the- the- the-
the bug photography,
uh, micro photography, encephalograms.
So that's the guy? You think that's the guy?
Uh, the, uh, insectoid, uh,
replicant, uh- That's him?
uh, paper, the blotter, the- the 93s,
the llama, the mountain lion.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, uh-huh.
I'm supposed to get a- an oxygen case.
Do you need to talk anymore? Do you need to see him anymore?
I've got a privacy case. I had the, uh-
I left the personal. You're positive.
It's not number two.
You do recognize his voice on the phone,
and that's when he exposed himself.
Yes, it's been terrifying me.
He leaves these messages on and on,
and it's- it's very aggravating.
It's frightening, actually. He's just talking-
Reverend Ivan Strong, Ivan Wang,
uh, Schnig, yes, something like that.
I know the dog, Ivan Wang.
Yes. Well, uh, you'll have to-
we're gonna have to do a complaint, if you wanna do anything
about it, because if not, uh, there's no way I can get
a restraining order or an injunction against him.
I'll be perfectly willing to make out the paperwork for you
if you need that, because it's- it's really been
frightening for me, very, very, very
frightening for me. Alright, ma'am, just calm down, relax,
put your knees together, that's right,
and breathe deeply through your nose.
Put your thumbs,
put your thumbs in your ears.
Oh, that's great.
I will have you say nothing about my thumbs.
My thumbs are not pretty.
Don't talk about my thumbs.
Hey, look, lady,
I see these people every day, you know, like,
you come in here, you're making a couple of guys-
why would a man call you up?
You're a 78-year-old.
I have a right to the privacy of my own thumbs.
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special
news bulletin. All you over
are idiots.
Which is through we made.
Here, you little puke.
And for you, Reverend Stringy.
Yeah, Trugy.
We're waiting
for you, Sting.
We're waiting for you, Sting.
We're waiting for you, Sting.
Leaning,
leaning,
safe and
secure
from all
alarms.
Leaning,
leaning,
leaning,
leaning
on the everlasting
arms.
What a
fellowship,
what a
joy divine.
Leaning
on the everlasting
arms.
What a

blessedness,
what a
peace is mine.
Leaning on
the everlasting
arms.
I thank God,
every day,
for this beautiful
giant arm of
peace.
Cattle flesh,

and

I've

I know what I'd do if I had a pair of moon pants on right now.
We know how to party around here.
Around where I come from, we know how to party.
There's a party in my moon pants.
It's a big old party, doctor, like you have moon pants, and you ain't there, are you?
And I bet you're thanking Bob that you ain't there.
I certainly am.
That's a disgusting sight.
Look at that.
It looks like a bag full of guinea pigs.
Or pants weasels.
I wear my moon pants proudly.
Sure, I know that there are those of you out there who hide in the closet with their moon pants on,
never to bring their moon pants out of the closet and show them to the world.
Why them?
Just walk bust out of that closet wearing them moon pants.
Stride through the mall wearing them moon pants.
Pull those moon pants off and wear them on your head.
Yes.
If you ain't chicken.
Unless you're fried.
Afraid your mom's gonna find out.
Unless you're afraid that you might get in trouble.
Well, maybe you're afraid that everybody around you will not approve of your moon pants.
What's the matter, chicken?
No, you see people all over the TV running around wearing moon pants.
Oh, yeah, nobody makes a big deal about that.
Right.
But there shall come a day.
There shall come a day.
When you will emerge from your cocoon.
And you will stand up.
And you will cry out with pride.
I have moon pants.
But I am still a man.
Damn you.
Damn you.
And you will stand there in your moon pants.
And they shall laugh at you.
And they shall point their bony little fingers at you.
And.
That little bit of dignity that you may have had for a moment will be stripped away as they pointed you in a laugh.
And say.
Hey, there's that moon pants boy.
Oh, yeah.
But don't worry.
Don't despair.
One day others shall come.
And they too shall wear moon pants.
And soon you shall be a mighty moon panted army.
Ready to come down and take your place.
In polite society.
Wow, what a sight.
Doctor.
Like you.
What are moon pants?
They're pants like the astronauts wore to the moon.
I've always worn moon pants.
I've been to the moon.
But I didn't wear any pants.
Oh, you've been to the schoolyard and you didn't wear any pants.
I just let my manhood hang loose and walked up to one of them big dare craters on the moon.
Woohoo!
Oh, yeah.
Well, on a good night with a good telescope, you can see the gleet from here.
Woohoo!
Yeah.
The gleet that stains the front of your moon pants.
With that icicle poking against the front of the moon.
That icicle-like object poking.
Pressing outwards against the front of the moon pants.
That frozen...
Well, of course, that's if you...
Compromise the seam.
Compromise the seam.

The moon pants in a vacuum.
Of course, you're inviting serious trouble.
And, oh, sure, there may be gleet.
But it's going to be tinkly little hard gleets.
The moon is made of green gleet.
Shatter.
That shatter when they hit the ground.
The moon is made of green gleet.
Soon the vacuum shall suck every drop of gleet from your body.
Yes, soon.
Soon the gleet will explode from you.
With tragic results.
With tragic results.
Without compromisation.
It's the latest...
It's the latest form of illicit sex that teens are into.
That's right.
Don't put those moon pants in your mouth, children.
You don't know where they've been.
To compromise and breach the vacuum seal of the moon pants or not.
That's your choice.
Expose yourself to the vacuum.
Just as you would expose yourself to the schoolyard.
Oh.
Oh.
I went to the moon and I didn't wear my moon pants.
Don't be like me.
And don't be like little Timmy.
Don't be like little Timmy with a huge gleet exit wound in the middle of his belly.
Where the gleet was prematurely sucked out by the vacuum.
Yes, as if aborted by Mother Nature herself.
Help me.
As if...
As if you were...
As if you were in a...
In an airplane.
A jet airplane flying at 40,000 feet and it suddenly kicked out the emergency doorway
and unzipped at the same time.
Uh...
Gleet decompression.
Oh, it's a painful thing.
And you can avoid gleet decompression.
Just send $30.
$30.
1403-06 Dallas, Texas 75-1.















Did you ever notice that the sacred post office box number of the Church of the Subgenius 140306
can actually be turned into sort of a sentence in words in that 306 looks sort of like B-O-B.
A big B, an O, and a little b.
Okay?
Now the 140 looks kind of like I-4.
Okay?
I-4-O-Bob.
140306 equals I-4-O-Bob.
I-4-O-Bob.
I-4-O-Bob.
I...
And how much do you owe Bob?
I...
Do you owe him your children?
No.
I-4-O-Bob.
Do you owe him your life?
No.
I-4-O-Bob.
Do you even owe him honesty?
No.
No.
But we do know what you do, O-Bob.
I-4-O-Bob.
I-4-O-Bob.





I-4-O-Bob.
You owe Bob...
$30.
$30.
$30.
A mere 30 clams, dear friends.
Ballons.
But anyway, I'm sorry.
We do have a letter from Mrs. I think it was a...
It was a...
Not a current check.
It was Mrs. Korna Hiltz of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
And she says, once we accept Bob Irvingstang, then will all our troubles and problems go
away.
I happen to be a member of the family of Bob Irvingstang.










I have a severely retarded 13-year-old child who makes a house, a mess of my house every
day and who has beat me three or four times.
If I accept Bob into my heart, will I find some sort of recompense for my earthly problems?
Well, Mrs. Klepski...
Yes.
I think it was...
Your...
Your...
Your...
Bob isn't here to answer your question, but...
No, he isn't.
But...
He could be.
He could be.
And we don't care.
No, we don't.
So why don't you just go away and shove it, Mrs. Klepski.
Klepski.
And deal with your problems yourself.
Bob is not here for you to lean on.
He's not some...
That's right.
This isn't the crutch of the subgenius.
Here, take this.
No, it isn't.
It certainly is not.
Yeah.
Demons hate noises here, Commander.
That's absolutely right.
And some...
I can't...
I can't see you out, foul demon.
I can't see you out, foul demon.



That's absolutely right.
All right, we have another letter.
This one is from a man named Harry Corn of Farmington, Maryland, or MD.
Maybe he's a doctor.
I don't know.
And he says, I have...
I'm severely stricken with the gout and with lesions all over my entire body.
Will Bob...
Can Bob...
I would...
I think he would be saying, can Bob cure me?
Gout?
Love it or leave it, buddy.
Learn to live with it.
Quit complaining.



Quit complaining.
That's...
And that's good advice for anyone, I would think.
Well, do we...
Should we take some more letters now, or should we go on?
What do you think?
Sure.
Go ahead.
Do you have any...
Oh, actually, I'm going to go...
Did you already think you had some questions?
I'm going to go flip the scrambled brains on drugs over in the other room.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Also, we have the Princess We Are Dough.
And while the Reverend Ivan Stang is having his parts washed in the ceremony, we have

the Princess We Are Dough.
And we'll be having the anointments with oils in a little while, and we'll be blessing you
on the air.
I have another question.
Well, a letter from Mr. Stark Pudd.
Mr. Pudd?
Mr. Stark Pudd of Angry Lane, Virginia.
Yes.
And he says, I've taken Bob into my heart.
What the hell do I do now?
I can't get him out of there.
Well, that's a very interesting situation to be in, Mr. Pudd.
I'm going to go flip the scrambled brains on drugs over in the other room.








One of the things that you can do is just let Bob get bigger and bigger and bigger
and bigger inside your heart.
And you see, that way, your heart will continue to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and the
power of the luck plane of Bob will fill and consume your heart.
There you go.
This will be definitely a positive force in your life.
I can see how it would really work.
And you've done so much work for the church yourself.
Now, I do...
We have one more.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dave.
We have one more letter.
We're not going to go too many more letters, because I know that the Reverend Stinky does
not, especially during the ceremonial...
I'm sorry.
I've got a tongue tied.
The washing of parts and the Holy Oils Anointments does not like to read letters, because he
gets the Holy Oils on the letters and can't read them.
Yes.
Yes.
But we will try and see...
Take one more before the break comes up.
And this one is from Firm Hamoose.
Firm Hamoose.
Firm Hamoose.
Firm Hamoose.
Firm Hamoose of Jersey City, New Jersey.
And he says, I am recently an immigrant on your country.
I'm looking for a good new American religion to not only give me all my salvation back,
but some of your money, too.
I really can't read this letter, but would you like to talk to Mr. Hill?
I think you did a fine job interpreting Mr. Firm.
Mr. Firm.
It was.
It was Mr. Firm.
Yes.
I can read it now.
My one eye is better.
Yes, that was just fine.
Well, I think that there's just such a smorgasbord of religions for the Firm.
There is, isn't there?

Some taste better than others, don't they?
Yes.
And some you just want to go, too, too, too, that's not my religion.
Or add a little Tamari or something.
Something to get...
I mean, come on.
It just gets really, really boring.
Boring and bland, I would say.
Yes.
Is that right?
Yes.
I think so.
I think so.
Many delicious religions to taste.
So you're not particularly, or in fact in any way, telling him to join or become a part
of the Church of the Subgenius to stop his problem with his salivation.
Oh, I actually think his salivation would drip perfectly into the Church of the Subgenius.
However, he may want to try dripping into other religions for some period of time until
he gets a little drip or taste of his taste buds dripping.
Oh, that brings us up to our last and final letter.
We won't take any more letters at all.
I have an ocular drip and also my genitalia are shrinking.
Can Bob help me or in any way prevent the moistening of my clothes?
Good Lord.
Goodness.
It's getting awfully blurry.
That's quite a dripping problem you have there, yes, isn't it?
It's the drip pattern.

The drip pattern happens to be overflowing at this very moment, doesn't it?
Yeah, I can just feel that.
It is.
I can feel it too.
The tension of that.
I'm sure the personal question.
It's about ready to flow right over the edge of the drip pan.
It's transcendental.
It's a form of bliss that only comes once in a while, once in a lifetime.
And if you just, if you, well, what's the address again?
If you just...
Well, the address...
Or the phone number.
I believe the address would be...
P.O.
Box.
P.O.
Box.
1-4-0-3-0-7.

And he's back.
But we're not going to answer any more questions.
No.

Princess, we haven't been studying your pre-trials.
Her brain doesn't, is no longer her friend.
That's Bob at Post Office Box 1430.

www.subgenius.com.
Yeah.
And it says here, for big orders like Chalupas, to order at least two hours in advance.
All right.
Moving right along.
Moving along to more significant directions and new religion.
We'd like to talk also about not only Bob himself, or itself, it's not an it, is it?
It's a transcendental being, isn't it?
It's not really a purely personal object, something like I might wear.
Yes.
Yes.
It's sort of an ethereal sort of thing.
Yes.
And can we, is Bob a real savior or perhaps is Bob more of just an icon of our age, of
our times?
Icon.
Icon.
Icon.
Icon.
Icon.
Icon.

Sometimes.
Most of the time.
Icon.
Icon.
Then Icon't.
Icon't any longer.
Icon't at all.
I never could.
Immanuel can't.
You had to read the original Welsh to understand what he was saying to you.
Ah, Immanuel can't.
Immanuel can't.


Immanuel can't.
Immanuel can't.
Immanuel can't.
Immanuel can't.
He is not going to see
the Hur Нет?
Are you worth waiting for, Immanuel?
Immanuel … …
Sit down right here.
And look over here.
Wax ball?
We're going to wax ball.
We're going to loop the loo.
And we're also going to trim the fin-fan-frastics.
Oh, man.
We're going to spit out human hair.
And we're going to sing all night.
We're going to sing rock songs, babe.
You and I.
That's right.
We're going to sing until our...
We're going to just...
You know, we're going to...
I've got to get going home right now.
Oh, man.
Sounds like really lippy, you know?
It's like 4 o'clock or something.
I don't know.
