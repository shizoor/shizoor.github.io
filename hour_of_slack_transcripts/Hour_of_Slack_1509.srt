1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm converging in Cleveland, Ohio, home to Afghanistan.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,980
In January 2010, the Obama administration would be approved for release,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,580
and the Americans wanted violence.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,660
And in this instance, they're coming to raise hell, a fussing fight.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,920
NASA's Orion spacecraft is protesting normalized PR.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,000
Engineers are beginning to examine Amy Green around the Earth.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,560
There had been concerns Amy Green might crack.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,260
Back retailers across the country today.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,260
Today is predicted to be the largest day of the year.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,600
Today will be 3.8% higher than PR News in Washington.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,140
What do we do now?

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,780
The only thing we can do, Robin.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,400
The hour of slur.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,020
Oh, no, sir, not that.

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,540
I'm afraid so, Alfred.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,340
That man would be the first to say so if he were here.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,980
And if you do not believe me, try turning on your water faucets at 2 o'clock this afternoon.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,100
2 o'clock?

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,900
2 o'clock!

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Mama, mama, mama, please.

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:06,880
Thank you.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,120
Cash Award.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,480
Another thing that was prevalent in the olden days,

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,020
it was customary for a sideshow announcer, spieler, or barker in the olden days

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,280
before the advent of loud speaking systems, amplifiers, microphones,

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,320
or even...

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,380
even megaphones.

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,400
That when we came to the circus grounds or the lot,

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,760
immediately following a parade,

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,220
the first announcement would be,

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,220
ladies and gentlemen,

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,480
the management has been advised

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,280
that there is a group of pickpockets trailing off following the circus.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,420
I want to assure you here and now

35
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,360
that the circus has nothing whatsoever to do

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,620
with this gang of thieves.

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,700
And so that everyone can rest easy and be assured

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,580
that we do not have anything to do with it,

39
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,720
please reach and see that your valuables are safe.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,880
And with that warning, everyone would say...

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,940
they'd feel as some of the ladies would look to see where they had the money pinned

42
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,140
if Dad didn't carry it.

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,080
The old men would reach to see where they had the long pocketbooks folded up.

44
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,880
And that was the signal for the gang to really go to work

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,320
because we had to go to work.

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,320


47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,320


48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,200
We had already located where the valuables were held.

49
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,940
And it didn't take long for us to have five or six complaints

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,220
and all we'd say, didn't we warn you?

51
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,260
We warned everyone out here.

52
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,940
And if you were careless, that is your fault and not ours.

53
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,420
Of course, for making that announcement,

54
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,860
if you were a good announcer

55
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,840
and we got good locations of where the valuables were hidden,

56
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,980
our portion of the loot was 10%.

57
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,180
And many a day the takers,

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,920
and very, very good.

59
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,620
The miracle of America.

60
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,880
This, people say, is worth the price of admission alone.

61
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,360
It is.

62
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,880
It's one of my jewelry cases with the anti-tarnish lining inside.

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,020
Love that.

64
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,020
Wealth money.

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,920
Privatization.

66
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,600
Wealth money.

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,280
Free markets.

68
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,140
Monetization.

69
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:11,720
Ownership.

70
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,760
A great deal of money.

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,400
Now, we can afford that.

72
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,940
A lot of his advisors compare the current downturn to the Great Depression.

73
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,740
We don't know his comparison to Herbert Hoover.

74
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,540
I mean, is it possible it can get that bad?

75
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,260
I mean, we're talking...

76
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,660
Let's rest it up.

77
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,480
Let's rest it up.

78
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,840
The Great Depression was more expensive to make something

79
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,340
than you could sell it for.

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,840
That's the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

81
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,600
It's unacceptable.

82
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
Top can make the bad news happen.

83
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,440
And why can't all of us at the bottom get together

84
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,760
and make the good news happen for a change?

85
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,540
I mean, for real.

86
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,180
Now back to Tales of the Texas Rangers.

87
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,520
We'll be right back.

88
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,940
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

89
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,980
Well, my heart is for my honey and my brain is for my job.

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,220
But my wallet belongs to Bob.

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,180
Well, Bobby goes to Brockman every chance that he can get.

92
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,520
He can outperform the biggest without even breaking sweat.

93
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,120
So I gave him all.

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,580
My money reverence.

95
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,940
Thanks that it was right.

96
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,240
And for only $20, he could save my soul tonight.

97
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,720
And now my wallet belongs to Bob.

98
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,340
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

99
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,480
No more can look conspiracy.

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,580
My lonely wages rob.

101
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,540
And my wallet belongs to Bob.

102
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Well, Bobby's got a sweetie.

103
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,080
And Connie is her name.

104
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,300
And her ways could put the sacred whore of Babylon to shame.

105
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,600
She reaches in Bob's pocket, feels around for something hard.

106
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,060
Then pulls her hand out, holding on to his mighty credit card.

107
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,580
And now my wallet belongs to Bob.

108
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

109
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,300
And I never have to fear coming home.

110
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,980
Because I know Connie's on the job.

111
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,120
And my wallet belongs to Bob.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,560
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man, too.

113
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,900
Their existential energy may be what's right for you.

114
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,180
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cubs.

115
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,280
And give away your money to the one that gets rich.

116
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,080
And your wallet will be for Bob.

117
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,660
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob.

118
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,600
And you will be subgenius, not another stupid flop.

119
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,600
And your wallet will be for Bob.

120
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,460
Well, I believe I am much calmer.

121
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,580
Got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

122
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,080
Sitting on the dashboard of my car.

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,400
Praise Bob!

124
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,220
Wee!

125
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,500
Bob!

126
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,900
Ha ha ha!

127
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,140
Praise Bob!

128
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,360
Praise Bob!

129
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,420
Money back!

130
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,520
Bob Bob!

131
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,300
Woo!

132
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:22,800
Woo!

133
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,120
Woo!

134
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,540
Wee!

135
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:28,700
Yeah!

136
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,300
Play ball!

137
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,360
Wee!

138
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,840
Xing!

139
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,120
Noti!

140
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,620
Douchebag!

141
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,440
Ain't nobody heard arrests Feather?

142
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,440


143
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,440


144
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,420
If rabies is a sjÃ¡tos problem in the Netherlands,

145
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,740
why is he all alone?

146
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,620
Ah, yes, dear friends.

147
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,820
Believe it or not, this is not Jimi Hendrix in the background,

148
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,280
but the Cosmic Hoedown Band, Maruga Booker,

149
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,280
and the Cosmic Hoedown Band,

150
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,940
and the ladies we heard singing before that

151
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,060
with the song My Wallet Belongs to Bob,

152
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,720
that was not the Andrews sisters,

153
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,920
but Sister Melodious Chops,

154
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,520
also known as Victoria Ganger and Revelry,

155
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
which is the band that Princess Wee sings in.

156
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,760
And both of them are going to be at the Beachland Ballroom

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,840
this Saturday night performing at a benefit

159
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,260
of the Cosmic Hoedown Band.

160
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,080
A free benefit known as the Winter Star Ball.

161
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,920
I guess the first annual Winter Star Ball

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,560
this Saturday night, March 21st.

163
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,900
It is the premier, first on Earth Winter Star Ball, yes.

164
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,980
The first half of this show will be music

165
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,880
by the bands that are going to be playing at the Winter Star Ball.

166
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,360
Right now in the background we're hearing Mayan Ruins.

167
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Coming up we'll hear Fat Man D,

168
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,660
and Steve English, and Brian Henke, and more.

169
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,180
And then in the second half of the show, Preaching.

170
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,620
But now, Mayan Ruins.

171
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,300
Mayan Ruins.

172
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
Mayan Ruins.

173
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,120
Mayan Ruins.

174
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Maverick and figurehead dislikers

175
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,480
When I was young I joined the circus

176
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,900
I came up with freaks.

177
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,800
It's true, but while I saw the nation I only dreamed of kissing you

178
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,820
I sang to lovely rubber men and full fire breathing bikes

179
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,260
We didn't have no Facebook so you could not count the likes

180
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,160
I got when I ate them light bulbs so when I pounded that spike

181
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,520
Through my tongue and through my heart cause there's no brakes upon these bikes

182
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,200
Hey, fat chick, you got it coming to you

183
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,460
Hey, fat chick, you got it coming to you

184
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,020
Hey, fat chick, you had it coming to you

185
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,380
We left from San Francisco all the way to Brooklyn town

186
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,080
It's amazing how far you travel on the powers of a cloud

187
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,960
Lost some in Minneapolis, gained some more in New Orleans

188
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,240
But me, I hail from Pittsburgh, yeah, you don't know what that means

189
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,180
We got to go to New Orleans, yeah, yeah, yeah

190
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,440
We got lots of freaks and dead queens and burlesques by the score

191
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,920
But our jazz men, they are righteous, they helped to fight this war

192
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,040
We've got Metropolitan

193
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,040


194
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,740
I go around and I get past these moors

195
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:29,880
Moving upÃ¤nder and once they meet me

196
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,420
Working my way up Kinne seconds

197
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:35,580
Lydia, I disagree on your yellings

198
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:35,620
She's still stayed in the cityå¤±ç 

199
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:42,620
I ain't recommend sending her on the road yet She's just my friend Dr. Rous ÑĞ°ÑĞ¾Ğ²

200
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,460
Your town's where commonest, you should lock up them men

201
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,620
Cause this fat chick, she's a-singin' with her band and with her friends

202
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,860
She's got dancers, she's got fire, she's got jazz and she's got freaks

203
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,040
Her poems cut with fierceness that we ain't seen since the beats

204
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,900
She's large and she's lovely, so don't forget to stare

205
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,520
When you laugh, you'll all be wonderin' if you can find what life is there

206
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,140
Hey, fat chick, you got it comin' to you

207
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,260
Hey, fat chick, you got it comin' to you

208
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,840
Hey, fat chick, you had it comin' to you

209
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,980
Hey, fat chick, you got it comin' to you

210
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,140
Hey, fat chick, you got it comin' to you

211
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,520
Hey, fat chick, you had it comin' to you

212
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,920
One day it just came out of the blue, out of somewhere.

213
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,280
And I started playing it at gigs and stuff like that, almost recorded it.

214
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,720
And someone very special in me died, and I realized why I'd been playing it.

215
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,060
It's the natural thing just happen like that.

216
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,140
You just don't plan it, it just happens.

217
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,700
And this is a song that I call the Stone Cold Blues.

218
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,120
It's a song that I call the Stone Cold Blues.

219
00:14:51,480 --> 00:15:11,120
It's a song that I call the Stone Cold Blues.

220
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,120
It's a song that I call the Stone Cold Blues.

221
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,120
It's a song that I call the Stone Cold Blues.

222
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:41,100
It's a song that I call the Stone Cold Blues.

223
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,900
It's a song that I call the Stone Cold Blues.

224
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,440
It's a song that I call the Stone Cold Blues.

225
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,360
Yes dear friends, that's our buddy Steve English on guitar.

226
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,380
He will be performing at the Winter Star Ball this Saturday.

227
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,800
And I'll be there as MC.

228
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,060
I'll be introducing bands.

229
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,740
and probably get a little bit of Bob Preysen in.

230
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,960
But it's not really a subgenius show.

231
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,600
It's mostly music from 7 o'clock to closing.

232
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,560
But at noon, there will be workshops and a psychic fair and all kinds of stuff.

233
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,060
That's at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland.

234
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,500
I know our listeners who aren't near Cleveland may be missing out,

235
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,660
but that's one reason why we're playing this stuff right now.

236
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,320
Right.

237
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,720
And as I said, it's not a subgenius thing.

238
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:53,820
It's actually kind of a fundraiser and a memorial of our late friend Jeff Rosenbaum,

239
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,280
known to subgeniuses as St. Stymie de Bergerac.

240
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,420
He was one of the two guys that started the Starwood Festival,

241
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,020
and the Starwood Festival is what led to all sorts of things,

242
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,460
such as me being...

243
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm being here now.

244
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,400
He introduced me to Princess Wee and, well, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

245
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,120
who, by the way, can't call in tonight.

246
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,640
Nobody can.

247
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,880
The phones are down.

248
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,100
But next week.

249
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,000
Now, in the background, we hear a different guitar player.

250
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,660
This is Brian Henke, spelled H-E-N-K-E, of Cleveland,

251
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,440
from his CD called, I think it's called Seven Magic Spells.

252
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,040
And we'll listen to this for a minute, and then we'll be back.

253
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640

Â¶Â¶

296
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,480
Yes, dear friends, Brian Henke there.

297
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,140
As I said, he'll be performing at the Winterstar

298
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,300
Ball.

299
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,520
Let's see.

300
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,980
All together.

301
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,900
Yeah.

302
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,420
Once again, let me get this straight for those of you in Cleveland.

303
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,620
This is a free benefit, but it's an all-day show with vending workshops and psychic fair

304
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,940
that starts at 12 noon.

305
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,740
Also during the day, there will be door prizes, lots of raffles.

306
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,560
There will be workshops all day.

307
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,360
Hey.

308
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,820
From noon till 7.

309
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,980
Those prizes.

310
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,780
Should we throw some subgenius stuff into it?

311
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,120
Oh, yeah.

312
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,560
Oh, absolutely.

313
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,140
Yeah.

314
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,980
Maybe some of the big posters for the art show with the ... That might be ... Well,

315
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,400
we'll see.

316
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,000
We'll have some kind of subgenius stuff there to benefit ... What we're trying to do, actually,

317
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,500
I'm speaking as a member of Association of Consciousness Exploration, known as ACE for

318
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:58,840
short.

319
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:05,480
They put on great parties like Starwood and the old Winterstar, which was held indoors

320
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,140
at a resort.

321
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,120
And I did some of my best preaching.

322
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,040
I'm preaching at those things, if I do say so.

323
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,300
Once again, in the background here, we have Maruga Booker and the Cosmic Hoedown Band.

324
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,380
I actually recorded this at Starwood, I think two years ago.

325
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,880
And they'll be playing ... They've got two members of the Parliament Funkadelic All-Stars

326
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,540
are in that band.

327
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,280
Yes, sirree.

328
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,340
I'm guessing the guitar player must be one.

329
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,840
Yes, I would imagine so.

330
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,100
But also, the guitar player is a great guitarist.

331
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,100


332
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,440
Well, that's the kind of music that you jump up and down and dance to.

333
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,380
Then there's the music you listen to with your eyes closed, like Mayan ruins, where

334
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,480
your brain and eyes will do a painting.

335
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,360
And Brian Henke.

336
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:52,980
Right.

337
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,540
Yeah.

338
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,900
And Awen and Revelry doing pagan music.

339
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,860
Who knows?

340
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,920
Maybe a little Bob music.

341
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,580
I don't know.

342
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,180
Yes.

343
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,080
I think there's a distinct possibility.

344
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:09,940
Yes.

345
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,080
No?

346
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,780
So, yeah.

347
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,980
That's what's coming up.

348
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,060
And it's cool.

349
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,160
Cool.

350
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,300
Where is the Beachland Ballroom located?

351
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,180
15711 Waterloo, near 156 exit off of 90.

352
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,680
So we will see some of you there, I hope.

353
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,320
Be nice.

354
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,600
As I said ... Princess Wee, did you have anything else to add?

355
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,800
to that that I may have left off I can't oh you can in there on Starwood

356
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,480
festival.com you can read my rant about Jeff Rosenbaum yes and maybe understand

357
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,800
a little bit about why we're going to this much trouble we want to raise money

358
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:05,560
to buy to make a really cool headstone for it that's one reason we're trying to

359
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,860
raise money the other one is for to continue to archive and make available

360
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,120
all the keen recordings that were made in 35 years worth of Starwood festival

361
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,740
some of that stuff's been released on CDs but there's including subgenius CDs

362
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:28,540
but there's a lot more and and we'd like to archive the high-res copies a lot of

363
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:34,840
it was shot by professional video crews in in the about 10 years 10 years worth

364
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,300
uh-huh

365
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,540
10 years worth of stuff and we're going to do a lot of that stuff and we're going to

366
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:35,620
do a lot of that stuff and we're going to do a lot of that stuff and we're going to

367
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:35,620


368
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:43,240
10 years ago before the identity theft cost us so much and that stuff ought to

369
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,620
be on YouTube or someplace yes someday where people can get to it I think just

370
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,840
about the only thing I didn't hear you mention is that there will be vending by

371
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,820
some really unique merchants people that often will be merchants at a Starwood

372
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,820
festival or a winter star yeah if you want your aura pierced if you want your

373
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,040
crystal named if you want your o-ring

374
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:11,400
blown if you want to have handcrafted soaps and lotions by someone that makes

375
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,360
them themselves with nifty herbs yes there will be all kinds of unusual

376
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,720
unique vending hippie stuff a bunch of hip now come on let's say it it's a bunch

377
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,340
of hippie stuff come on yeah it kind of is a bunch of hippie stuff I'll come

378
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,640
right out and say that praise Bob praise Bob

379
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,840
well back to Bob and the church you know I feel kind of

380
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,160
deaf right now because we're having to work out of a different studio, the production

381
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,160
studio. That brand new fancy equipment we got, it's kind of down right now. And this

382
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:51,200
headphone doesn't have a volume control. It's set for normal people's ears. So I can only

383
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,260
half hear what's going on. I can't wait to go home and listen to this show.

384
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,640
I can vouchsafe that it sounds great!

385
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:03,440
Um, in a little while I'm going to... Oh, good, good. I'll take your word for it, Princess

386
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,160
Wee. You're so sweet. I'm gonna, we're gonna, uh, because we don't have Dave, we're gonna

387
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:17,260
let Dr. Howell and Philo Drummond blabber through the last part of the show. But, um,

388
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:24,080
I do have a couple of things I've brought to read. And neither of which is by me. You'll

389
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:32,000
be so glad to hear. But here's one. This was just posted to the subgenius, the members-only

390
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,020
subgenius forum.

391
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,420
Subgenius.

392
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:33,420


393
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:33,420


394
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,960
Not to be confused with all the Facebook pages. Scrubgenius. It was posted by our other

395
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,240
radio buddy, Phineas Narco of National Cynical Radio.

396
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,260
Praise Phineas!

397
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:53,440
And you can find that at, uh, nationalsynical.com. But he did this kind of a poem, uh, which

398
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,600
he calls Rant of the Phineas. Or I could, we could say Brag of the Phineas.

399
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,180
It's great. I love it.

400
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,100
And here goes.

401
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,780
How long is this music gonna run?

402
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,320
Two minutes? That'll do it.

403
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,600
Oh no, no, that won't do it. I'm gonna pull that music out.

404
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,560
Cause they start singing. I just remembered.

405
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, ok.

406
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,500
I'll turn it up for the next thing. Rant of the Phineas.

407
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:31,940
I'm a lazy workaholic. Of the poor, I'm the richest. I'm a god-fearing agnostic and a shy

408
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:40,940
exhibitionist. I'm a coward looking for a fight. I'm guilty as I'm blameless. I hide my problems

409
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:50,260
in plain sight and secretly I'm famous. I'm a modest egomaniac and a real damn fake. I'm good

410
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:58,320
when bad and bad when good and nice for goodness sake. I've accomplished great and wondrous things

411
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:07,900
but haven't gotten far. I do not watch the TV set. I do not own a car. I'm rewardian and emergentile

412
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:16,460
all wrapped up in enigma. I used to play accordion but I couldn't stand the stigma. Sorry about that.

413
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,480
I'm a total teetotaler who struggles with addiction. I'm at odds with who I am sometimes,

414
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,180
a walking contradiction. But I'm not content to be one thing. I'm proud of my

415
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:34,840
humility. To try and pin me down would be an act of pure futility. Some years from now they'll all

416
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,860
look back and say who was that man and what was all that nonsense pouring out of his brain pan.

417
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:49,340
But I'll be in the ground by then and doing time in heaven. My face will be on slurpy cups at your

418
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:57,160
local 7-Eleven. So pay attention now dear friends. I won't come round again. Like you I don't know

419
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,860
where I'm going.

420
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,720
But here is where I've been.

421
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,820
Isn't that sweet?

422
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,220
You can get back on the mic and laugh again now Princess Wee.

423
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,560
She laughed at that thing all through as I was practicing it in the car and I didn't I didn't

424
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:27,680
want you to step on it. Oh now speaking of stepping on it this is in the background now we have Mayan

425
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,020
ruins.

426
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,960
Where do those guys mostly live?

427
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,860
Cincinnati.

428
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,140
Cincinnati?

429
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,240
I believe so yes.

430
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,500
That's what I thought. Yeah we see them at Starwood very frequently. They have one of those lady

431
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,980
violinists. You can't go wrong with a lady violinist. Reminds me of Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

432
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,260
Anyway before I let the Puzzling Evidence show take over this show

433
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,160
which I think is a great show.

434
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,160


435
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,160


436
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,160


437
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,160


438
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,900
is what I'm going to do.

439
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,000
I have an actual sermon.

440
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,320
It's not by me.

441
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,660
It's by the good Reverend Roger.

442
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,020
And I also copied this off of the

443
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,420
internet subgenius forum

444
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,700
known as Scrap Genius,

445
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,780
which you can contribute to

446
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,700
and lurk on

447
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,420
if you're a subgenius minister.

448
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,800
Anyway,

449
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,300
so you may ask yourself,

450
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,080
well, who's on this train anyhow?

451
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,600
And I'm here to tell you,

452
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,440
brothers and sisters,

453
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,160
Elvis is on that train.

454
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
Hank is on that train.

455
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,820
Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash,

456
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,600
Emperor Norton, Smedley Butler,

457
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,640
and Lysander Spooner

458
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,560
are on that train.

459
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,740
I'm on that train

460
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,920
and I hope you're on that train.

461
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,560
Can I get a hallelujah?

462
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,740
Can I get a hell yeah?

463
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,300
And who isn't on that train?

464
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,140
Who's standing

465
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,560
on the tracks with their pants

466
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,540
around their ankles

467
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,160
and a silly grin on their faces?

468
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,520
Why, seven billion monkeys,

469
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,240
that's who.

470
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,800
Seven billion people

471
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,000
who believe the lies

472
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,840
and distortions of the conspiracy,

473
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,800
the con,

474
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
the conspiracy of the normals.

475
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,000
The seven billion people

476
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,480
who worry about the phenords,

477
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,540
who settled for second best,

478
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,160
who traded their godhood

479
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,040
for cheap plastic crap.

480
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,140
Just leave us our iPods,

481
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,120
they say,

482
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,740
just leave us our cable TV

483
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,000
and we'll pretend not to notice

484
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,220
that we're being reamed

485
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,960
by bankers and congressmen

486
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,820
and crooked cops

487
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,980
and the horrible people

488
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,720
down at the Department of Motor Vehicles.

489
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,060
They are damned, my friends,

490
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,160
brothers and sisters,

491
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,160
they are on the road to perdition.

492
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,200
Can I get a witness?

493
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

494
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,160
the late J.R. Bob Dobbs once said,

495
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,160
I don't practice what I preach

496
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,760
because I'm not the kind of person

497
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,640
I'm preaching to

498
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,920
and I hope you aren't either.

499
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,840
Are you the kind of person

500
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,180
he was preaching to?

501
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,060
Do you cling to your trinkets

502
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,260
while sweating the mind-boggling level

503
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,500
of debt you have?

504
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,400
Do you seek out causes to champion,

505
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,380
causes that are guaranteed

506
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,760
to screw you six ways from Sunday

507
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,940
should they ever be realized?

508
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,280
Do you put your faith

509
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,420
in political or economic models

510
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,080
that benefit only the people

511
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,620
that are already screwing you?

512
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,000
I hope not, friends.

513
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,240
I hope that you've seen

514
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,420
through the cheap glitz

515
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
and the shuffling corpses on your TV.

516
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,220
I hope that you remember

517
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,940
that the only spider

518
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,300
is in your head.

519
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,400
I hope you remember

520
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,040
what Curly was trying to tell us,

521
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,760
what Johnny Cash told us,

522
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,120
and what James Brown was screaming

523
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,500
out the car window

524
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,800
as he led cops

525
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,060
on a four-state car chase.

526
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,160
If you haven't,

527
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,280
all I can tell you is this.

528
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,760
The train is about to pull away

529
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,420
from the station,

530
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,200
but the doors are still open.

531
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,340
All you have to do

532
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,620
is let go.

533
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,000
Let go of the rubbish

534
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,020
they sold you.

535
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,200
Let go of the beliefs

536
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,260
you've been told you have to have.

537
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,020
Let go of the crutches

538
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,240
like religion and magic

539
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,080
and myths of the free market trademark.

540
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,080
And screw up with pride,

541
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,840
my friends.

542
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,580
Time may be a little

543
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,200
elastic these days,

544
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,520
but time is short

545
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
and it's getting even shorter.

546
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,580
It's time to decide

547
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,000
whether you're going to be

548
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,920
on the train

549
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,800
or on the tracks.

550
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,340
You don't need

551
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,400
ivory tower economic theory.

552
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,040
You need a job.

553
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,500
You don't need

554
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,800
Keith Olbermann

555
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,840
or Rush Limbaugh

556
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,700
or Ron Paul.

557
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,540
You need that

558
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,460
seven pounds of gray stuff

559
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,060
between your ears.

560
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,080
You don't need sigils

561
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,040
and patchouli

562
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,680
or fake patriotism.

563
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,120
You need common sense.

564
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,360
Hell, you don't even need Bob,

565
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,040
but you still have to send your money.

566
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,480
All you need,

567
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,460
all you need, friends,

568
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,060
is good friends

569
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,260
and Saturday night.

570
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,320
And we can all sip cheap whiskey

571
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,680
and smoke lousy cigars

572
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,320
and laugh at all the poor bastards

573
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,540
who managed to justify

574
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,760
why being on the tracks

575
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,840
is the only sensible option

576
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,020
for right-thinking people.

577
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,080
We here in the Church of the Subgenius say

578
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,880
if they can't take a joke.

579
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,560
And I'm here to tell you

580
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,340
the joke is on them.

581
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Can I get an amen?

582
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,760
Amen!

583
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,140
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

584
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,020
Ah, yes.

585
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,660
Thank you and a good night.

586
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,620
And I'll drop that Mayan ruins down

587
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,640
a little bit.

588
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,980
And, uh, I think we'll, uh...

589
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,260
I think we'll, uh...

590
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,740
I think we'll go to the news.

591
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,280
From PR News in Washington,

592
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,960
I'm throwing rocks at vehicles

593
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,500
at the senior living facility

594
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,320
with dozens currently at the bottom of the sea.

595
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,920
The Israeli army says Australia.

596
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,140
The Israeli military says Australia.

597
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,200
Australia spotted an Australian oil slick

598
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,180
spotted in Borneo.

599
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,820
Also spotted in Indian PR News in Australia.

600
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,360
Australia and Sydney.

601
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,020
PR's from Washington.

602
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,100
On Wall Street 5-6-1860,

603
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,620
five residents say this is PR.

604
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,060
Becoming more simple,

605
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,240
becoming more complex.

606
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,960
Meaning stop, stop.

607
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,800
PR's reports were up almost 7%

608
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,720
over the holidays last year.

609
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,460
PR News absolutely exceeded expectations

610
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,760
through Saturday, the biggest ever.

611
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,060
And, er...

612
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,840
This morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared

613
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,780
I want a day to is deceived.

614
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,120
Should you have what?

615
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,080
His lawyers say they need more PR News from Washington.

616
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,920
Cowboy Ed and his caterpillar

617
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,580
Running out across the plains

618
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,700
Watching from the westward

619
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,420
Clothing up all the aphids

620
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,720
Cowboy Ed can't complain

621
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,460
It's all in a day's work

622
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,320
Cowboy Ed is glad to be of service

623
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,880
Don't squish him, it only makes him nervous

624
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,960
Once upon a time in the west

625
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,380
Ed was a normal sized boy

626
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,520
Who wanted to be a cowboy

627
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,780
Something happened to shrink him

628
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,120
To the size of a bug

629
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,600
He didn't let that stop him

630
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,380
Cowboy Ed is glad to be of service

631
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,980
Don't squish him, it only makes him nervous

632
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,700
Poor Scorn, seven years ago

633
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,120
Our fathers brought forth all this

634
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,560
Clowning a new nation

635
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,100
Considerely, I'm a cowboy. It's all in a day's work.

636
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,500
Liberty and debt are

637
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,960
Hidden to the proposition

638
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,240
All men are created equal

639
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,840
Not so much an honest and what's said

640
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,740
Still ain't true even for Cowboy Ed

641
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,760
Ha ha ha ha Ed

642
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,280
Things change and people control

643
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:13,520
Things change and people slight

644
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,760
CLOWNING A NEW NATION

645
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:16,760


646
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:16,760


647
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:16,760


648
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,680
Men are fastieni

649
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,760
Clowning a new world

650
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:21,760


651
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:21,760


652
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:21,760


653
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,720
They areårzy

654
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,620
guitar solo

655
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,860
guitar solo

656
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,280
guitar solo

657
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,900
Tune in next week, cowboy, and we'll fly

658
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,580
When this evening comes above the line

659
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,460
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

660
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

661
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,860
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

662
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,480
Oh, yes, dear friends, Tommy Amoeba and his band.

663
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,800
Tommy Amoeba will be at the Winter Star Ball,

664
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,120
but not his band.

665
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,140
He may do a duet.

666
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,400
Yes, he might do one number with his wife.

667
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,420
He might do it with his beautiful wife, Fat Mandy,

668
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,060
who is fat in every sense of the word

669
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,780
and as beautiful as her voice,

670
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,900
which is really beautiful.

671
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,240
I was thinking Mandy's voice snakes around you,

672
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,740
especially when it's double-tracked like on these albums.

673
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,260
Mm-hmm.

674
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,680
Anyway, that was...

675
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,880
That was from Tommy Amoeba's CD.

676
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,740
He's got a CD out, and Mandy has a new CD out.

677
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,200
Tommy's...

678
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,260
Tommy Amoeba and his band have played

679
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,280
at several X-Day Drills subgenius shows,

680
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,660
and I especially love that song,

681
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,600
The Legend of Cowboy Ed and His Caterpillar,

682
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,580
because Tommy does a costume change on stage

683
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,300
and metamorphoses into the caterpillar.

684
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,160
Indeed he does.

685
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,680
And then he strips off the caterpillar,

686
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,580
and there he is, a lovely butterfly,

687
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,680
or a pot-bellied middle-aged hippie man.

688
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,560
In a Speedo.

689
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,780
In a Speedo, as the case may be.

690
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,920
It's really, really pretty enthralling.

691
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,420
It is.

692
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,680
When he wraps the whole congregation up,

693
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,240
the entire audience up in American flag ribbon.

694
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,020
Yes.

695
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,340
That creates great togetherness and patriotism.

696
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,880
Yes, he threads us all together with the crepe paper.

697
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,920
It's beautiful.

698
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,060
Beautiful thing.

699
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,600
Yeah, you never know what's going to happen

700
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,420
at one of these subgenius-y type shows,

701
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,140
and we don't know for sure what's going to happen this weekend,

702
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,920
but we'll let you know next week, I guess.

703
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:10,020
Meanwhile, I'm going to let those two jabbering jabberwockies,

704
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,600
Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Hal Robbins,

705
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,200
take us all the way to the end of this show.

706
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,060
I don't know where they're going to take us entirely.

707
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,120
I've only listened to about 20 minutes of this,

708
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,280
so your guess is as good as mine.

709
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,040
Well, but it's one of the three subgenius radio shows

710
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,100
that are real shows.

711
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,800
I mean, real radio broadcast shows and not podcasts.

712
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,980
No offense to our podcasting brethren,

713
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,520
but these are shows where we have to be careful not to cuss

714
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,880
because it really is going out over the airwaves

715
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,100
and there's laws about that kind of thing.

716
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,460
And also, we're concerned about keeping you entertained.

717
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,480
So I'm going to shut up and let these guys go.

718
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,360
This is from the...

719
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,560
Well, one of the...

720
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,320
The other two subgenius shows, just so you know,

721
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,820
one, of course, is Suzy the Flusy's Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

722
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,260
on WREK in Atlanta.

723
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,560
Praise Suzy!

724
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,280
Praise Suzy on WREK.

725
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,020
And the other professional full-time, 20 years,

726
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,460
35 years at it, is the Puzzling Evidence Show,

727
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,660
run by Puzzling Evidence,

728
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,360
with Philo and Hal running their mouths, as heard here.

729
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,340
She's doing it for...

730
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,760
It works.

731
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,820
Yeah.

732
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,440
It works.

733
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,300
Now just put a big, giant Dobbs head statue in the background.

734
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,640
A few of them with their arms raised like this.

735
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,560
See, I have to have some of them like this.

736
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,220
Do that different.

737
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,840
This is actually looking backward.

738
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,380
Next time I'll do it where you're looking at the back row, looking forward,

739
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,460
and then you'd have them with their hands praised in exaltation

740
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,200
as the Dobbs head ran forth.

741
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,000
Prepare for hatch closure and...

742
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,220
The dots themselves start to envelop everyone in the worship circle.

743
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,940
It's not for no reason that Dobbs is manufactured of dots.

744
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,560
Oh, darn.

745
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,420
There goes my...

746
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,320
J-R dot bot.

747
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,200
Oh, you better go get your eggs.

748
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,020
No, it's my...

749
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,740
I'm making some holy bread.

750
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,240
It's hot.

751
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,300
Are you still into that Whole Foods thing?

752
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:21,960
Used to do.

753
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,660
There's that chip to show our wireless transmission.

754
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,280
It's coming from now.

755
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,940
Are you like...

756
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,820
Like, remember when you were into the Whole Foods and you would, like,

757
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,660
eat a whole squirrel?

758
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,380
That's what they mean by Whole Foods.

759
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,240
You have to eat everything.

760
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,400
You had to eat the whole squirrel.

761
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,900
Yes, you have to eat the...

762
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,480
First you had to camp out in the park and catch the squirrel.

763
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,460
Beefalo right down to the hooves and the chimes.

764
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,780
So he was like one of those park trappers, you know,

765
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,560
the guy that lives in the park and traps the varmints that...

766
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,440
try to make...

767
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,260
eek out a living in the park as well.

768
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,740
The rumen, the cud, the tail.

769
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,900
Yeah, he makes a little bit out of everything.

770
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,140
Even anus rings.

771
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,120
Those are, some people say, the best part.

772
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,580
Well, sausages are classically made out...

773
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,920
Takes a lot of squirrels to get a whole batch of those, though.

774
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,040
If you're the Emperor Heliogabalus,

775
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,340
you can just send out the troops to collect them.

776
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,400
Timer ceased.

777
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,380
Seed space up.

778
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,380
I need more hummingbirds.

779
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,300
Man, this is a good...

780
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:21,600
This is a good...

781
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:21,880
This is a good book.

782
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,060
I'm gonna see if it's available.

783
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,100
I wanna get a copy.

784
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,480
Oh, good.

785
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,580
By Jack Hamm, a great cartoonist.

786
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,620
H-A-M-M.

787
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,140
No kidding, man.

788
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,860
He was awesome.

789
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,180
Everybody, every cartoonist should know how to draw Uncle Sam and Mr. H-Bomb

790
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,860
and all these strange characters that only appear...

791
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,640
Oh, yeah. Cowboy on the H-Bomb.

792
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:41,940
Right.

793
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,180
I think, whatever I wanna go with mine is clip art.

794
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,860
Uncle Sam.

795
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,920
The new clip art.

796
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,020
Well, you could do it, I suppose.

797
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,860
It's gonna be retro, though. Retro-new.

798
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,100
Hmm.

799
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,460
Neo-retro.

800
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,860
I guess so. Everything old is new again. Everything borrowed is blue again.

801
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,340
Vanity of vanities. All is vanity.

802
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,640
The interesting thing is nobody really talks about it when it's in...

803
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,180
Like, when it's halfway old.

804
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,280
It's not new and it's not old yet. It's sort of in the middle.

805
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,300
That's the time to get in on the ground floor, when it's only halfway old.

806
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,400
You...

807
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,740
What is it?

808
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,060
You know, but wouldn't you start...

809
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,280
Probably get in on the mezzanine level if you...

810
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,580
If it was halfway old and stuff?

811
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,520
...stood the ground floor?

812
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,840
Well, you have to have some vision.

813
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:25,880
You have to act.

814
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,460
You've got really...

815
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,140
Strike when the iron is hot.

816
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,300
The more vision you have, the closer to the basement you're gonna get when you get in.

817
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,540
That's the important thing to remember. If you can get in it when it's at the basement level...

818
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,820
...you're really gonna cash.

819
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,820
Just, uh, tip the janitor and he'll let you in after hours.

820
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,420
Yeah, tip the janitor and you're gonna really, really break in the cash this time.

821
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,240
It won't be like all those other... all those other hundreds of times.

822
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,500
When you knew you were gonna get rich, you just knew it!

823
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,640
And something... something happened. Somebody else messed it up for you.

824
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,080
Somebody who lacked vision.

825
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,980
Some no-good rotten yellow rat came in and messed up your good thing.

826
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,800
And now you have to deal with that.

827
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,300
Or you had to anyway back then when it happened.

828
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,500
Deal with that rat?

829
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:20,020
I'll show you how to deal with a big fat rat.

830
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,580
No-good rotten yellow rat. I'll show you how to deal with a big fat rat.

831
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,220
I'd like to rip his hide off.

832
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,400
Why, I oughta... just... I'll show you how to deal with a rat.

833
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,880
Take him down a peg or two.

834
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,260
Come here, rat.

835
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,480
You no-good rat bastard.

836
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,120
You dirty rat bastard.

837
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,640
You killed my mother.

838
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:50,360
Those guys that do the good Jagme imitation when they say that and they put their thumbs at their belt...

839
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,560
...and do their shoulders that way.

840
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,780
They look like, oh, that is awesome.

841
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,120
Who does that anymore?

842
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,760
Nobody knows who Jimmy Cagney is anymore.

843
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,840
Exactly. Even if they watch the West Point story.

844
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,620
You gotta watch a few of them and then you see that emerge and it's just awesome to watch them do that though.

845
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,580
I made it, Ma. Top of the world.

846
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,060
And the show, just like the Puzzling Evidence show, at the top of the world.

847
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,480
Right now, for you.

848
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,680
Well, uh, Saint Stupid's Day is coming, so everyone should get ready, uh, for it.

849
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,940
Unless, of course, X-Day happens before Saint Stupid's Day. Then it would be too bad.

850
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,600
Can't happen until July, uh, 5th.

851
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,340
Well, you know, we got... I've been thinking about that. We got the year wrong.

852
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,340
So maybe we got the month wrong, too.

853
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,260
Well, we got everything wrong and we have no idea when it might be.

854
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,800
So we have to hold on to something. July 5th, uh...

855
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,460
We know it's gonna happen on a day in a year.

856
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,320
On one of 365 days in some year, it's going to happen. There's no doubt.

857
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,740
It's an absolute, veritable truth that it will happen. It's just that...

858
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,980
According to the recent theory, the paper was upside down...

859
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:14,320
...where people were saying, uh...

860
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:19,740
Bob wrote it, and it's actually 8,661, not 1998...

861
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,580
Ah, yeah, that makes sense.

862
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,800
...that it was happening in. But upside down, July 5th is just, uh...

863
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,800
...Sel, uh... something, uh...

864
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,960
Well, in the future, we rename the months to, like, it's gonna be Seluj or something like that.

865
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,540
Oh, the month of Philo, the month of Stang...

866
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,320
The month of Dr. Howe.

867
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,780
What do you want them to call your month, Dr. Howe, when we take over?

868
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:43,780
Uh...

869
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:48,360
Do you want to have a special name, like, what, something with ember on the end? You know, like, next timber, or...

870
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,480
Well, that means it's in the winter. Why do you give me a month when it's all cold and everything?

871
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,100
I want to have Froptober, I think.

872
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,500
Months with, uh, cool short names of the summer and spring months.

873
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,160
Yeah, like...

874
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,560
Like Hal, yeah.

875
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,760
A month, the month of Hal. That's a good one.

876
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,120
I'm gonna... But I'm gonna take over the winter, I think. I'm gonna be like Old Man Winter.

877
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,960
And I'm gonna take over, uh...

878
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,760
The wild winter.

879
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,500
But people will want to come to my month because it'll be Froptober.

880
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,280
Or the long winter out.

881
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,140
It'll be Good Froptober.

882
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,900
Often our midnight shout.

883
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,620
We'll probably have, uh... And, you know, during the middle of Good Froptober, we'll have Froptober Week.

884
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,340
Kept the cocks crowing.

885
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:37,340
Or it may be that one biological problem is causing infertility and disease.

886
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,500
You see, up to 15% of a man's genetic makeup is involved in reproduction.

887
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:47,780
And it's likely that those same genes play other important biological roles.

888
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,280
You know, I heard that the United States is in a negative growth mode now.

889
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,440
In other words, we're shrinking.

890
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,520
More people die in this country than are actually born.

891
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,820
We're shrinking. Oh, if that would only continue and we'd get some elbow room.

892
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,360
Yeah, get a little elbow room. Get some of these jerks out of my way.

893
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,520
The problem is we're the ones who are dying. We give more room for the jerks.

894
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,480
Our way. We need to get these jerks out of our way, Doctor.

895
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,480
Put those jerks in labor camps and, uh...

896
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,260
Puzzling is really busy tonight. Have you noticed that? He's just wandering around looking at things and flipping.

897
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,220
Yes, he's operating that complicated machinery that only he even knows the purpose of.

898
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,680
I don't even know how that machine can work.

899
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,340
It's looming here with a million dials and gauges.

900
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,980
It doesn't even sit on its... It levitates.

901
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,780
I never want to touch... It's on springs. You just touch it and it vibrates.

902
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,400
It's almost translucent springs.

903
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,180
See how it kind of flambulates when you touch it?

904
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,720
Some people would think it was levitating.

905
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,920
At about 75%, you know?

906
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:47,560
And what's... What are these red readout circles?

907
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,720
They look ominous, but what the hell are they? What does this mean?

908
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,380
It's a code that you have to... You have to go to a special school that has a lot of pain involved.

909
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:03,420
Or call the toll-free number and mention the number next to each particular component.

910
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:10,860
A recorded message will play and inform you of what you should do next.

911
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,280
I'm gonna give it a light punch.

912
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,780
There's a lot of etiology that could explain what's going on.

913
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,540
In general, things that aren't good for the heart probably aren't good for fertility.

914
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,120
But maybe it's the treatments that are causing fertility problems.

915
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,900
Maybe it's specific medicines people are on.

916
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,140
You know, Rusty Rebar is still working at the sperm bank.

917
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,840
He's got his inside job there.

918
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,480
Ah.

919
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,180
He thought he was gonna lose his job months ago, but they really need him.

920
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:50,460
What does he have to... What do you do at a sperm bank that's really needed?

921
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,620
Well, whatever it is, that's how he...

922
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,640
What kind of activities do you do at a sperm bank?

923
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,520
That's how he makes his living.

924
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,200
Do you have to count the sperm every now and then?

925
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,800
Every last one of those little devils.

926
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,200
You gotta make sure the books balance?

927
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,920
You got all the sperm that you came in with?

928
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,320
It's a job. At least he's employed.

929
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,740
Do you have to go in the vault every now and then?

930
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,700
And, you know, make sure everything is...

931
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,600
Everything is there and it's secure and...

932
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,340
Here's Herman, the squirming spermin.

933
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,720
A tiny little feller swimming in the amniotic fluid.

934
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,320
And suddenly, the huge egg looms in front of him.

935
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,220
But there are a million other little guys also trying to...

936
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,800
Little Spermie is right next to him. There's Sperminstein.

937
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,940
Yeah, I know. Get away from me.

938
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,580
Spermula. There's Spermuloid.

939
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,040
Yes, and...

940
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,500
Spermicula.

941
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,380
Right, yeah.

942
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,700
And Spermhauser and Spermizer.

943
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,160
Sperminstein.

944
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,660
Sperminstein. The whole Sperminstein family over there.

945
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,060
How...

946
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,960
Yeah, it's really a Spermie.

947
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,180
The egg will only accept one to be that magic zygote.

948
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,600
Do you think it's gonna be you, huh?

949
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,180
You think? No, no, some other sperm on the other side.

950
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,240
No, it's gonna be some sperm in this big pile of here.

951
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:57,780
A big...

952
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,320
Big...

953
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:00,680
Big...

954
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,700
Big pile of sperm.

955
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:02,600
Sperm.

956
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,340
Yeah, right.

957
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,800
Big pile of sperm.

958
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,980
It's a spermatic pileup.

959
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,600
Well...

960
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,740
Too many, uh, urethra Franklin records, I guess.

961
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,080
I guess so. They really stimulate that kind of action, apparently.

962
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,820
Yes, the furious furor and the froth of, uh...

963
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,700
And there's a vast difference between that...

964
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,680
Oh, a vast difference, yeah.

965
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,080
Yes.

966
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,340
Somehow or another, we gotta...

967
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,440
We gotta get back on topic here.

968
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,600
I guess so, yeah. We got off the topic.

969
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,260
We just get off the sperm.

970
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,160
No, we don't.

971
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,420
We're just gonna get out of the sperm bank back in the real world.

972
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,420
Well, I'm getting concerned because I make...

973
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,500
I'm doing poorly financially.

974
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,400
I've got a cash flow problem and I can't, uh, get the plastic dinosaurs

975
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,280
that are...

976
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,200
are out now, that are a wonderful new generation of them.

977
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,140
It's so frustrating.

978
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,380
I wish that...

979
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,280
And so I'm gonna...

980
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,680
On my other show, I'm gonna nakedly ask for people to do it...

981
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,400
to send in money and so on.

982
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,760
And I think on your other show you should.

983
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,620
Can't do it on this show.

984
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,080
No, you wouldn't do it on this show.

985
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,740
I would never, ever do it on this show.

986
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,660
But on your other show, I would encourage you to ask for money

987
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,240
and ask for them to...

988
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,640
What you should do is you should publish a list of the dinosaurs that you like.

989
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,380
I describe a different one on every show.

990
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,120
And have people just send it to you at your request.

991
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,340
And you understand, when I say dinosaur, I'm speaking very loosely

992
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,840
because there are many prehistoric animals themselves.

993
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,000
You take archosaurs and other various...

994
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,300
They don't even have to be reptiles.

995
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,940
They're prehistoric.

996
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,980
A dinosaurata?

997
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,020
It's like an arsenotherium.

998
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:52,980
Do you know what that is?

999
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,540
There's a new one of those made by the Colecta people in England.

1000
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:01,320
It's sort of this big, bulky, rhinoceros-like mammal from the Oligocene

1001
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,500
with two simultaneously mounted horns on its snout.

1002
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,080
Not behind.

1003
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,340
Not behind each other, as in the Achelodonta or the living rhinoceros of today,

1004
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,480
but next to each other.

1005
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,640
There was even some kind of rodent that came tunneling out of the ground

1006
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,420
and that little devil had those twin horns on its snout.

1007
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:25,260
Yeah, see, that was back in the time when animals were interesting, I think.

1008
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,680
Much more interesting than today.

1009
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,080
Well, all the interesting ones died out,

1010
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,020
leaving us with the Dullesville ones.

1011
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,620
And those are dying out, too.

1012
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,620
We're killing everything.

1013
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,300
But before we kill...

1014
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,860
This generation, we killed off the giant elephants and ground sloths

1015
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:47,560
and dire wolves and megatheres and giant flesh-eating pigs.

1016
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,240
Those were terrifying things.

1017
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,380
Giant birds, all that stuff.

1018
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,660
Taxi Bob 3 here.

1019
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,240
Well, what do you know?

1020
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,660
I didn't call a taxi.

1021
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,440
Did anyone need a taxi here?

1022
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,380
Oh, you were piquing my interest.

1023
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,900
Oh, oh, I see.

1024
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,620
Talking about...

1025
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,240
Dinosaurs.

1026
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,980
Yes, about the prehistoric reptiles that lived millions of years ago.

1027
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,600
Didn't Freud talk about sauropod envy?

1028
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,120
I don't know why they would have envied, uh...

1029
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,040
What, they envied other sauropods?

1030
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,620
Well, maybe you know this.

1031
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,460
What's a bigger sauropod?

1032
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,620
That new one they discovered, Drednontosaurus?

1033
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,980
Drednontosaurus.

1034
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,540
Or Argentinosaurus.

1035
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,980
Or Argentinosaurus.

1036
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,320
Argentinosaurus, it's a whopping big.

1037
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,260
big sauropod too. Now I'll tell you what the problem is with these remains. They're huge,

1038
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,100
enormous, but they don't have all the bones and they have to extrapolate the possible size.

1039
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,600
You know, one vertebra is 12 feet tall. That's a pretty large animal. But

1040
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:59,180
still, you don't know exactly how large it was. So there are competing theories,

1041
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:05,640
which give you quite a different length, overall length for the animal. But Dreadnoughtosaurus is

1042
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:13,520
listed as being 70 tons. So that's a big one. Wow. 70 tons. I thought it was 53.7 or something

1043
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:20,280
like that. No, because I'm always looking for an 80 tonner and 70 tons is the closest. Wow.

1044
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:27,400
That's amazing. Also, you have to like the name Dreadnoughtosaurus. Oh, I love that name.

1045
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:34,540
It's just a big sauropod, but it has some interesting features. 140,000 pound animal.

1046
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,400
Can you imagine?

1047
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,520
That's a lot of poundage.

1048
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,620
They did some computerized simulations and found that those huge sauropods had to move

1049
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:48,020
very slowly and very daintily because of their huge mass.

1050
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,560
Yes, well, I wouldn't trust everything that the computer says.

1051
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,920
And the atmosphere was a lot different then. And because of those differences,

1052
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:03,560
it helped promote the large size as well, just because the environment.

1053
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,440
Yeah, but sauropods persisted.

1054
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:12,240
They did not die off in the Jurassic. And by the end, the atmosphere was kind of like it is today.

1055
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,940
The triceratops is closer in time to us than it is to, say, an apatosaurus.

1056
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,080
Right.

1057
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,120
It's a long time. They had a long run.

1058
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:31,880
They found that there's some predators that were actually larger and more massive than

1059
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,780
trinosaurus.

1060
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,860
That's correct.

1061
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:34,880
Crocodile.

1062
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,620
And they seem to...

1063
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:35,620


1064
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:35,620


1065
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:35,620


1066
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:35,620


1067
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:35,620


1068
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:41,840
They seem to be enormous allosaurids like Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus carolini.

1069
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,400
Yeah.

1070
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,620
And even spinosaurus.

1071
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,700
But I don't think it was as massive, but it was supposedly it was longer.

1072
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:55,460
What's really bizarre about that is that now they seem to posit that the hind legs were

1073
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,120
shorter than previously thought.

1074
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,320
And the whole thing did come out of the water and walked around on land, but it was kind

1075
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,240
of like an ungainly sloth or something like that.

1076
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:05,620
You can experience that.

1077
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:05,640


1078
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,640
It's like a big quadrupedal.

1079
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,940
That's what happens when we start talking dinosaurs.

1080
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:17,840
Hemi, semi-quadrupedal, but it needed those forepaws for specialized activity.

1081
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,700
It had those huge hook-like hands.

1082
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,620
Exactly.

1083
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,340
Now how are you going to gallop with huge hook-like hands?

1084
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,200
I don't know what I've been up to.

1085
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,620
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry, our subgenius.

1088
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,600
