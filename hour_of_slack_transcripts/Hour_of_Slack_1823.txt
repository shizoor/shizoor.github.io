I'm down in steerage on Fulton's Folly
I stay one step ahead of the melancholy
I lift two doors down from the old man on the corner
There's a window next door, somebody oughta want her
Daddy digs through your trash when the weather gets warmer
I lift two doors down from the old man on the corner
Come a summer, we'll be dancing in the street
Come a summer, down the corner gonna meet you
Come a summer, there's a party on the block
Somebody hit the snooze on the doomsday clock
I'm down in steerage on Fulton's Folly
I'm three floors up from a band on the skills
They practice all night, those goddamn kids
They called the demolition debris and they probably did
They sound like a bus going over a cliff
Come a summer, we'll be dancing in the street
Come a summer, down the corner gonna meet you
Come a summer, there's a party on the block
Somebody hit the snooze on the doomsday clock
Come a summer
I'm four days late from making my rent
My baby gave me the dough but now it's all spent
Born on my bed, had to go to bed, had to go to bed

Laid out the prem, better gibi sost间� depression

Bob Walkenhorst.
A chipper, straight-up rock and roll song there called Come a Summer.
Now, I'm going to keep this happy vibe going with a pretty old song from the famous ancient Broadway musical My Fair Lady.
This is from the movie soundtrack, and it happens to be a perfect subgenius anthem,
specifically a rewardian subgenius anthem, or what we might call classic so-called slacker anthem,
sung by Stanley Holloway.
Listen to the words.
Or at least try to follow the subtitles.
The Lord above gave man an arm of iron, so he could do his job and never shirk.
The Lord above gave man an arm of iron, but with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,
someone else will do the blinking work.
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck,
you'll never be a man again.
Never work.
The Lord above made liquor for temptation, to see if man could turn away from sin.
The Lord above made liquor for temptation, but with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,
when temptation comes, you'll keep riding.
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck, you'll keep riding.
Oh, you can walk.
Just try to narrow, but with a little bit of luck, you'll run amok.
The gentle sex was made for man to marry, to share his nest and see his food is cooked.
The gentle sex was made for man to marry, but with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,
you can have it all and not get hooked.
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck,
with a little bit of luck, you won't get hooked.
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck, you won't get hook,
Or with a little bit, a lucky one get hook,
The Lord was throwing goodness at you, but with a little bit of luck a man can duck.
The Lord above made man to help his neighbour, no matter where on land or sea or foam.
The Lord above made man to help his neighbour,
No matter where on land or sea or foam,
But with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,
you will come around, you won't be home.
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck,
you won't be home.
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of blooming life.
You make a good suffrage, don't you?
It's Rodley to get along.
Get on, get on.
Why, there's the lucky man now, the Honourable Alfie Doolittle.
What are you doing in Eliza's house?
A former residence.
You can buy your own drinks now, Alfie Doolittle.
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.
What are you talking about?
Your daughter, Eliza.
Oh, you're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.
Well, what about Eliza?
Ah, he don't know.
Her own father and he don't know.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.
Left her in a taxi all by herself, smart as paint,
and ain't been home for three days.
Go on.
And this morning I get a message from her.
She wants her things sent over to 27A Wimpole Street,
care of Professor Regans.
Ha, ha, ha.
And what things does she want?
What?
A birdcage and a chocolate.
I mean, it's fair.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
But, she says, never mind about sending any clothes.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I knew she had a career in front of her.
Anyway, we're in for a boozer.
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.
A man was made to help support his children,
which is the right and proper thing to do.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
A man was made to help support his children,
but with a little bit of luck,
with a little bit of luck,
they'll go out and start supporting you.
With a little bit,
with a little bit,
with a little bit of luck,
they'll work for you.
With a little bit,
with a little bit,
with a little bit of blooming luck.
Oh, it's a crime for man to go philandering,
and fill his wife's poor heart with grief and doubt.
Oh, it's a crime for man to go philandering,
but with a little bit of luck,
with a little bit of luck,
you can see the bloodhound don't find out.
With a little bit,
with a little bit,
with a little bit of luck,
she won't find out.
Charlie!
With a little bit,

Hi, Mom.
We had a game this afternoon, but our side lost.
What do you want at the store?
More sugar, son.
Here's the list.
These are the people I want you to turn in,
and here's the family pocketbook.
I need these things in a hurry, too.
Okay.
Okay, Mom.
I'll take my bike.
Hi, Mom.
Say, will you let me trade work tonight?
I was supposed to do the dishes,
but Jane's father is going to show the movies of their trip.
May I get supper?
Well, I think so.
Tonight's the family boon meeting, you know.
I wouldn't want you to be late.
You sure you'll be back in time?
Well, Janie said they were going to have the movies right after supper.
I'll be home by eight.
Well, that's all right then, Heineke.
Suppose you set the table and I'll start making the salad.
I'll dive right in.
Where's the liquor?
Here.
I'll bring you the liquor.
Okay.
Come to order over there.
All right.
Now, the chief, shut up.
The chief thing to talk over is our vacation.
Right, Chief.
But perhaps, Mother, perhaps there are some small things first.
Well, they're small, but they're hard, and, John, I know it's hard to be neat,
but tonight in the living room I stumbled over the stiff fingers of a catcher's mitt.
Oh, God.
I see.
Oh, my.


And I had to take Patty's period back to school before she'd study them, and I could sit down
in the big electric chair.
Oh, Mom.
Well, maybe we could be more careful where we put things.
Yes, I think we, I think they ought to.
Okay, now, young John, John, yes, anything you want to bring up?
Just my dinner, Dad.
Cute kid.
Gee, he's neat, isn't he?
Yeah.
I'd like to bring up our vacation, Dad.
Gee, you should have seen those pictures tonight.
Oh, yeah.
They were in color and everything.
All those colorful pictures.
Well, now, now, now, now, now, last, did it have the dentist in it?
Yes.
I love those.
And the nun.
Yes, the Cary Grant mask.
Yeah, that's a lot.
I love that one.
That's the same trip I went on.
And the nun with the mole.
Yes, I know.
Dad.
That mole is so small you wouldn't expect.
He lives under the yard.
Yes.
Come on, Dad.
What about our vacation?
All right, let's see.
Back to the meeting here.
Yes, well, last time we decided that one of you should go to camp.
And he never came back.
And that the other one would go on vacation.
We decided that he'd go on a trip with us.
Oh, well, gee, let John go to camp this summer.
I went last year and then the rest of us could all take a trip together.
Those pictures sure must have been wonderful.
That mole.
I thought you wanted to go to camp.
I've been camping all morning.
What do you say, John?
Well, gosh, Dad, I'd say I don't know.
Ask Yoko.
Couldn't I do both?
Well, now, the family budget says camp for just one of you.
Now, it wouldn't be fair for one person to do both, would it?
No.
Well, I'm a schizophrenic.
Yeah, and I'm a bisexual.
I'm bored.
Well, now, let's wait until tomorrow and see if that decision is sticky.
Sticks, shall we?
Like the catcher myth.
John, cut it out.
Then we can plan some more.
Well, you see that John and Patty are already full-fledged citizens in their family.
They have a regular share in the family's work.
They help to make the family's plans.
Well, kids, so long now.
Hope you had a good time with the Whisperin' Squash again today.
Remember, bye for now, because you may not have a chance to buy for tomorrow.
So long.
So long.
So long.
Hooray for the Squash!
Yay!
The Firesign Theatre did that, a happy family scene called Family Bund Meeting from the
collection Dope Humor of the Seventies.
See thefiresigntheatre.com, but spell theatre the British way.
Now, I've been playing happy songs.
Well, here's the happiest song of all from the swinginest, lovinest bunch of corpses
you ever heard, the Swingin' Love Corpses, with Dr. Philo Drummond, Colonel Sphinx Drummond,
Ray Hay on guitar, Leif Cowabunga on bass, and Skippy Mojo Butcher on drums.
I think I got that right.
The song, We Are Going to Save the Universe.
Now, is that cheerful or what?
This is a song that I don't know about, because it worked.
It's about the night we saved the universe.
Groupies!
Yeah.
You're the best.




I'm the best.
Yeah.










Yeah.
Yeah.
When we were born
Into this life
We were destined
To make it right
And it's predetermined
And this is our fate
We're singing this song
So you can read later
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
This time
We are full grown
We are grown up men
We are all masters
We pay to reason it
It is our mission
And it is our task
It's all for us
Yet you still ask
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
This time
This time


We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
This time
Maybe when here
Just swang and let gloom
Buy
So long
Third video
it yet, or at least not in 22 years. Let's check some of it out. I've realized in editing that I
need to explain this, the scene that's about to happen on the Puzzling Evidence show.
Philo and his brother were on, and just as Philo went off to go to the bathroom or something,
his dead dog Little Dude called in. Philo had this beloved little dog named Lil Dude,
and every now and then, it was like Little Dude would somehow call the show. Didn't happen often,
but when it did happen Philo missed it.
Philo the Dog?
Dude!
Oh, of course, a new man!
Well, as a person who's a professional telephone pole climber, I must say it is a hazard to
have to battle nails and staples.
They're only at the bottom, aren't they?
Yeah, so if you do fall, you're not going to fall like 30 feet.
That's the good thing.
Just don't hug the pole real tight when you get to that point.
You'll only fall 30, 30, one foot 30 times.
Yeah.
Berlin, Germany, Chicago, Illinois.
Who is this now?
That's a real guy.
Wow, little dude from Chicago.
What's he finally called?
Little dude, are you calling from under the ground in Missouri or something?
No, I'm from a different place.
A better place, I think.
A better place.
Do you have any words of wisdom for us?
Well, I'd like to talk to Philo.
Oh, boy, that's going to be tough, you know?
What do you want to know?
For reasons the callers can only guess at.
I am Philo by proxy.
Oh, can I talk to Philo's brother?
I'm Philo by proxy.
I lost my career and I cry in my beer.
Yeah, that is the famous Philo's brother.
This show is my only real job.
Also known as Hector.
Remember that time I peed on your leg?
Also, Bavoso.
Remember that time I peed on your leg and you kicked me?
Oh, it's little dude's revenge.
This is getting kind of kinky.
No.
I hate you for that.
No.
I do.
I really wasn't kicking you.
What I was trying to do was point you in a direction, in a radical direction.


I was trying to make you feel that I'm not a real person.
You were just trying to pet me with your foot, I know.
Yeah.
Just, you know.
Where's the book that says you can only pet an animal with your hand?
Oh, here it is right here.
Genteel Guide to Animal Husbandry.
Take it apart and see if it works.
Oh, it's still there.












Are you an animal?
All animal products from Edible, Missouri.
Well, we also have an announcement
that the Big Top 23 Circus
will exhibit its Curiosity Cabinet of Wonder and Oddities
on the 22nd.
Philo's Brother.
Don't see me, Dr. Howland.
I'm Philo's Brother.
Aerial acts are performed.
I'm Philo's Brother.
This is at the Cyclone Warehouse,
1842 Illinois Street.
Man, this little dude guy can talk forever
even though his lungs are probably leathery.
This is a benefit.
There's probably worms crawling out of his bones
between his eyes.
Drug rehab.
That was the best tape ever.
The little dude digging up the backyard tape.
That was amazing.
Because about two months later,
the Times Beach story broke.
In the meantime...
And it is a meantime.
Don't be scared, little caller.
When will we hear from the Book of Bob?
Hyperventilation, verse one.
Oh man, you know,
those have gone off in all sorts of directions,
but I'm sure you'll, you could hear from them,
hell, what am I saying,
in June 10th in Portland, right?
At the lawsuit of Bob.
Man, that's one of the best jams.
At the lawsuit of Bob,
which is now a club in LA.
There was so much money made by all the people in lawsuit
that they all got together as friends
and bought a club in LA,
and it's called Lawsuit O' Bob.
You remember doing this one, Philo?
Good Lord.
Hey, I just got back.
What is that?
What is that?
I didn't miss anything, did I?
No, except little dude called.
You didn't miss anything.
Except little dude called?
Oh man.
And you weren't here.
Oh.
You must have been frapping or driving.
No, I was, well, I was actually answering
to nature's most urgent call.
Yeah, frapping, that's what I thought.
It's nature's voice I hear and I obey.
Frapping.
I'm a brother to Joe.
We had to go hiking two miles into the forest today
to do that.
To do that?
To do this.
Oh my.
Now throw that big community-sized towel over it.
That huge towel, yeah.
Yeah, each towel gets larger and larger.
Throw that building, I mean that city-sized towel.
We're just trying to keep it nice and spanking clean here.
Turns into a Richard Bartholomew story.
Yeah, exactly.
Puzzling evidence with Dr. Howland's special guest,
the Drummond brothers, Philo and Sphinx.
And here's something new and slack-imbuing,
the latest Dobbstown Mirror, and it's an eight-pager.
Check this out, friends, from dobs.town.com.
Actually, this doesn't say the dobs.town mirror,
it just says the Dobbstown Mirror,
number 104, volume two, number two, April 1st, 23 A.M.
That's this year.
Uh, $5, boy.
Well, see, it's an eight-pager.
It's got a big picture on the front by Zontar of Dobbstown.
It's a part of Dobbstown.
Here, let's read the first part.
Do you suffer from chronic ringing grin-itis?
Or I suppose you could pronounce that grin-itus.
Can't help but laugh at that.
Can't help but laugh at the horror.
Ready for a religion that considers you equal,
not in your soul or in heaven,
but in that most sacred of all parts of your body,
your wallet?
Us too.
Why must we always wait for future events?
What would it mean to you to wait for now
or wait for the past?
The Church of the Subgenius offers complete satisfaction,
free instructions,
and actions in exchange for money.
The conspiracy is powerful and skilled in deception.
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius moves away from the con,
he or she may move in any direction,
including directions that to other subgeniee look strange or even wrong.
The only wrong way to be a subgenius is to never send in your membership fee
to the Church of the Subgenius,
Subgenius Foundation.
Think of it.
A mind control cult that actively does not care
if you conform to its rules.
Can yours say the same?
Last each day as if you live.
Old Bob will sell just about anything to just about anybody.
What's he sold you today?
The conspiracy has over 10,000 nuclear warheads,
and their arsenals.
The Church of the Subgenius?
Only three.
And yet we dare to challenge them.
The advertisement that all advertisements are based on is
advertising works.
The belief that all beliefs are based on
is the belief that beliefs are real.
The Church of the Subgenius is a sinous sacrilegion
and a society of superior mutants.
Bob said,
You can be what you won't.
Adopt the mask of sanity.
Be so lucky that everything that happens is what you wanted to happen.
And treat that as if it were the most normal thing in the world.
Self-initiate your future self into your present perfected form.
Prescribe your own script.
Well, that was a nice first section there
from the Dobbstown mirror.
There's so many fine features in here.
Oh, my gosh.
Here's an article on optimism.
But I better not read it because I'm not sure whether I read that one already.
But there's a rant in here
by the late Dr. Katyszczo Legim
from 1999
about rain,
and it's really, really touching actually.
Actually, it's super touchy.
Maybe I should read it.
Rain by Dr. Katahdin Leguim.
Man, I'm tuned.
It's rained maybe twice this summer,
and the news said we might have a thunderstorm tonight.
It's been near 100 degrees all weekend.
I'd welcome rain like a brother.
I told Susie, I'm going out, going to do a rain dance.
She, of course, gave me that,
you're nuts, but I knew that when I married you, look.
I stepped out the front door and shook my meaty butt a while
and said to no deity in particular,
come on, fucking rain.
A drop hit me on my T-shirt.
And another.
In about two minutes, I felt myself begin to tune.
The rain was falling in.
I was in my buckets and I was standing all alone in the courtyard
right in the middle of the downpour.
I was seized up in the now,
feeling the cool wind whipping around me,
the air fresh and sweet.
The rain fell hard and cold on my bald head,
running down in rivulets.
From a nearby vacant apartment,
I could hear Stan, the maintenance man's CD player,
blasting out the 10-minute instrumental intro
to Pink Floyd's Shine On, You Crazy Diamond.
I knew that the other tenants in my apartment complex
were staring out their windows at me, thinking me mad.
I didn't give a shit.
The poor fools didn't know what they were missing.
I stood there for the duration of the storm,
lightning crashing violently,
wind ripping leaves from the trees,
and rain like a deluge on me.
A chubby girl about 10 years old
came out of her apartment and walked me out.







She walked over to me grinning.
She knew why I was out there
when all the older and wiser didn't.
Other kids came and stared out their windows,
wanting to come out too,
but their parents wouldn't let them.
Oh, perish forbid.
Only fools don't have the sense to come in out of the rain.
But if that rain makes me a fool,
then hand me the pointed hat.
That wasn't rain that fell from the sky on me this evening.
It was just wet slack.
Wow.

No, I'm good.
Push one and pull the other one at the same time.
Hey, man, you're blowing my FCC qualifications.
Let's quit talking.
Let's not even.
No, we were just kidding about the caller.
Let's not use the word blowing anything of anything you have in any contextual situation, please.

Let's see.
Ima Sumac here.
Buddha's my kind of guy.
This is a song called Akla Taki.
Chant of the Chosen Maidens.
These are your Neanderthal babes, your Yeti girls, your werewomen.
You're going to be taken to the...
A sacrificial rock and rocked by the...
And I suppose the priestly class will have some sort of fun with them
because they were captured and enslaved from a local tribe that lost the big bowling tournament.
Right?
Am I correct?
That's all right.
Yeah, well, that's...
Isn't that the way they used to do it down there in Peru?
Yes, the conspiracy actually echoes down through human history.
Just as today, we suffer under...
It's sometimes subtle jackboot.
So too did the ancient...
Subtle jackboot.
The Lemurians, the Atlanteans also knew of the conspiracy.
But don't you think subtle jackboot would be a delicious name for a band that could perform not one but three songs?
I got a...
No, subtle jackboot is a good name for a band.
Princess, we and I have formed a new band just because we have the name...
Okay, here's the band name.
Okay.
Poo Water Towel.
I already thought of that.
Oh.
That's old, man.
Poo Water Towel.
Come on.
I said, I need poo water.
There probably was a band called Poo Water Towel.
There was Poo Water Dissonance.
It was an old 19...
Early 70s Cleveland band, art band.
Poo Water Dissonance.
Really?
Yes.
And they played in high frequency dog tones mostly.
But they were bursted by the Society for Refurbishment of the Animal Crew.
And...
One man was sent to punishment for, I think, like 40 years.
Poo Water Towel.
But don't let somebody stick your finger in your nose.
Take a imagine.
I don't know how you feel one way or the other
It's an extra happy to wipe it on your brother
He's robbing in your bar
And he's looking at your neighbor
Pining nuggets from his house
He's like a saber in the paper
He's pulling, he's tugging
He's yanking on the stain
It's a long, strabist thing
Still connected to the brain
Pick a booger
Pick a booger
Pick a booger
Pick a booger
Everybody's doing it
Picking it and chewing it
Yeah!

He's rolling in, he's rolling in
Checking in for hair
He's quick to get away
Still looking at the head
He's got some people on his finger
He can make it every day
Pick a booger, booger
It's a new day today
He's jumping out of who he be
Up from deep inside his sinus
He's a slave to the mascot
Of his royal sinus
Kids all wanna have
Days of infestation
Cause a pick a booger, boogie
Is the new sensation
Pick a booger
Pick a booger
Pick a booger
Pick a booger
Pick a booger
Pick a booger
Pick a booger

Pick a booger
Pick a booger
Look at that.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.
More happy music, dear friends.
The happiest ever.
The happiest ever.

Pick a Booger by the Swingin' Love Corpses.
Man, I love that song.
And now this.
The Dobstown Mirror again.
What have we here on the Dobstown Mirror coming up next?
There's nothing so fiery and self-satisfying as a new hatred.
And that's why my advice is to forgive those who do you wrong.
When they do you wrong again, you'll have a brand new hate better than the old one.
Holding a grudge runs the danger of letting a good, honest hatred run cold, get ragged.
Thank you, Dobstown Mirror.
By the way, most of the Dobstown Mirror is written by Uncle Dr. Onan Canabite.
Thank you.

Although he did have a Katahdin Lagoon article in here this time.
And there's a Dr. Philo Drummond story.
Boy, there's a whole bunch of this preaching stuff.
Anyway, friends.
And now this.
I was watching this new, weird, good movie called Vivarium.
And at the end was the spazziest song I've heard in some time.
Turns out that it was by XTC from like 1979.
And I'd never heard it before because that's how hip I wasn't.
But now I get to hear it again.
I asked myself, should I put my finger to the left?
No.
I asked myself, should I put my finger to the right?
No.
No.
It doesn't really matter where I put my finger.
Someone else will come along and I'll pretend it's always been the same.
It's just a complicated game.
Yeah.

Mm.
It's just a complicated game.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.





Mm.

The little girl asked me should she part her hair
On the right

And it's always been the same
It's just a complicated game
Yeah yeah yeah

They wanted Charles
They wanted Joe
To jump him up and stick him out of that shuttle
They were only arrows in a very fair tale
Yeah yeah yeah
It's just a complicated game
Yeah yeah yeah

God has been shown to judge upon us what is love
No, no, no
God has been shown to judge upon us what is love
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
I say, I say the thing that made a man to put you where you were
Just look at the camera and it's always, always the same
It's just a complain, a complain

of this
It's just a complicated game by XTC,
and you are listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.
All information is at subgenius.com.
And this month, the important information is about X Day, 24X Day,
the week of July 2nd through 5th.
It'll be really different this year.
Number one, it won't just be a drill this time,
because we're going to save the universe this time.
Number two, the live in-person event is happening,
but it's grown to two sites.
Our usual campground in Ohio called Wisteria,
but also a new one, new to us, a resort campground in Florida.
And number three, it will also be streamed live,
which is how it happened last year, and it was great.
So this way, Yankees and others who treasure hanging out with old friends at Wisteria
and are too far from Florida can do so just like in the old days.
And those who want to try the Florida one, sign up quick,
because only 50 can attend, and I think 25,
and the Florida one is a little bit more expensive.
Those who will await the saucers at home can attend just like last year, virtually.
Up to 50 people were there last time, and it was really, really fun and crazy.
The Florida event will be live streamed separately,
and Wisteria might be streamed if they improve the Wi-Fi.
Here's how you start.


You find out the details of all this stuff.
Go to subgenius.com, click on events if you're interested,
and there'll be an X-Day listing.
Or if you just scroll on down the homepage of subgenius.com,
you'll come to an X-Day link.
Basically, they go to hypercubego.com slash X-Day 2021,
and it'll tell you about the event.
The other one will tell you about the Wisteria one.
I'm going to go to the Florida one only,
and there'll be a whole bunch of wild bands,
some of which we've heard, some of which we haven't,
including TTN, Rubik's Cube, Sub-G Kids, and Peas.
Anyway, friends, so check it out.
There's also an X-Day Facebook page, and there's links to that on there.
Nobody has stepped up to organize the Wisteria gathering,
because this is the first time we've mentioned it.
But I'm not going to be there to set everything up.
And yeah.
Yep, friends, subgenius.com, and you will then know everything.
Praise Bob.
And here's one reason why you should praise Bob.
This is a little document.
It's kind of a flyer.
It's a flyer from the, from Reverend Zeno Fact and the Church of the Unanswered Question.
It's got some nice clip art on it that wasn't swiped from us.
And it's basically the conspiracy versus Bob.
The conspiracy wants you to hate yourself, whereas Bob wants you to hate the conspiracy.
The conspiracy wants to take your money.
Bob just wants you to give him your money.
Totally different.
The conspiracy wants to take your slack.
Bob wants you to have slack.
The conspiracy wants you to hate sex, whereas Bob wants to have sex with you.
The conspiracy tells you what to think, and Bob wants you to think for yourself.
The conspiracy believes in nothing, but Bob believes in everything.
Bob is a good guy.

The conspiracy wants you to trust no one.
Bob just wants you to trust him.
The conspiracy controls your time.
Bob teaches you to control time.
I keep wanting to say that differently.
Bob teaches you time control.
The conspiracy controls your time.
The conspiracy will kill you.
Bob will be killed by you.
Bob will be killed by you.
If you're being a good subgenius.
And friends, what are you people waiting for?
Did you know that for less than 10 cents a day for a year, that's less than one thin
dime every day for one year, you too can have eternal salvation or triple your money back.
Nothing else to buy.
No need for periodic renewals.
You are saved forever.
Yes, for a one-time payment.
One-time donation of a measly $35.
Could change any minute.
At subgenius.com, you will be saved.
Even better, there's no need to repent any sins or transgressions.
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius, you'll be issued your very own official divine
all-inclusive excuse.
And friends, it's a big document.
Fancy looking.
I mean, it's poster size.
So, why wait?
Hurry to subgenius.com and save yourself today.
I think that ad copy may have come from Reverend Zena Fact also.
So praise Bob and let there be slack.
Thank you, Empire Jazz Orchestra in the background.
They're not too bad, Bob.
But I think they're not to be missed.
So, I think that's OK.

All right.
Thank you very much.
Have a great day.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
