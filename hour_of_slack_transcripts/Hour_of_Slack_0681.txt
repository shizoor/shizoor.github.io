Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Tonight we add another name to the long list of those we have honored.
This truth that I'm about to give you has exploded in power!
Thank you, though, I'm enjoying this.
Buried within the uncharted depths of waters surrounding a group of islands off the 50th parallel
lies man's most formidable challenge.
The awesome awakening of prehistoric monsters longed for extinction.
Savage and deadly, their one hope is to rule our planet as they once had thousands of years back.
And that ain't all!
Science was baffled and powerless.
This is confusing!
A terror-stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.
Well, things are looking up!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
A once proud civilization...
Now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla and his powerful ally...
Bob...
Titan against Titan.
Giant against giant in the most spectacular battle yet.
But things weren't normal.
There were changes.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Your mother bit me!
I never saw him by my bed.
It's a beautiful sight!
Strange, frightful changes.
That night, it all started.
Stop doing that!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
This was the night of the crawling terror.

O Lord of heaven above earth.
Bless our overlords for protecting us from our wretched selves.
May we be blessed with a lust for submission and guidance.
May we think of the Lord and not of pain.
Authority is great.
Ignorance is bliss.
Peace is war with the devil.
This is the word of the Lord.
Amen.

Oh, hi there.
How do you do?
I'm your new neighbor, Herman Munster.
Thank you.
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.
What's up, genius?
What the hell are you doing, Lee?
I'm watching Bob.
You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Crusty used to be.
You backstabber.
You traitor.
You...
Snap out of it, Bart.
Um, I lost my job.
I had a job.
Now I don't have a lot.
I want you to be like me.
I want you to worship me.
I want you to be like I am.
I want you to enjoy the fearlessness that I have.
The courage that I have.
The compassion that I have.
The love that I have.
The all-encompassing...
The mercy that I have.
I want you to be what I am and something greater.
I want you to give you more than I have.
I want you to be greater than I am.
And if you don't want to go this route,
then go to hell where you want to, but don't bother me.
Heal my toe, honey.
Heal my back.
Heal my bottom.
But don't you heal my mind, because my mind is too sick.
Christianity was never based on the idea of an unknown God.
I'm going to cause you to know that you are what Jesus was.
Jesus said that...
Every human being was a God.
It is written that ye are gods.
I'm a God and you're a God.
And I'm a God and I'm going to stay a God until you recognize that you're a God.
And when you recognize you're a God, I shall go back into principle and will not appear as a personality.
You are a God.
But until I see all of you knowing who you are, I'm going to be very much what I am.
God Almighty God!
Call the next defendant.
K. Bridges to the bar.
The next defendant is K. Bridges to the bar.
Silence, K.
Yes, your hands are covered with the blood of the thousands of souls that you have murdered.
Murder?

Yes, that's right.
But I never murdered anyone.
Not with a sword.
But you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell with your malicious tongue.
It would have been a thousand times better had you murdered them with a sword.
Oh, no.
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.
I only spoke the truth.
No, K. You spoke that which you wanted to be true.
But granting that you did only speak the truth.
who gave you license to defame and destroy the character of others.
The serpent with his venom and his ire,
with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,
with his deadly call and fatal fang,
is the only fit emblem of the man or woman
who stabs and kills the character of another.
Let your own words condemn you.
May 10th, 1973.
Linda's been such a good friend in spiritual health.
Well, when you've known her as long as I have,
you'll really get to know her.
What do you mean?
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life as you think.
But I'm not one to say anything.
You just call me when you need advice.
Well, I've got a lot to do. I have to go.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Well, I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that.
I don't believe I want any part of it.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. My God, have mercy on me.
I never realized. Have mercy on me.
You, Kay, with your gossipy tongue,
have driven the babes away.
You have driven the babes away from my church.
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock.
You never knew what it meant to show mercy.
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?
There is no mercy for you.
You are sentenced to hell where you will want to be haunted
forever by the souls you sent there.
Oh, no. I don't want to go to hell.
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know.
I didn't know. I only repeated what I heard.
You didn't know.
You didn't know.
The most beautiful of all crimes is the crime of gossip.
Your record will speak for itself.
But, yes, friends, send in that love offering, that check,
addressed to Tammy Faye Dobbs,
daughter of Connie.
Oh, that felt so good.
I forgot.
Wow, look out!
Cleveland Donut Gun.
Call her!
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
Well, call her right outside the building.
Come on.
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence we had there.
It was almost a half second.
Good.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Come on.
That'll last forever in my memory.
First time ever.
Okay.
Oh, right.
Okay.
Oh, nice.
Oh, we got some more.
Why do I feel it there?
Bergman knew how to use silence.
The silence of the soul.
Sure is nice.
It's nice out here.
I hope the boat comes, though.
Fellini knew how to use silence.
But that horrible boatman with his grizzly hands.
Yeah, I know.
Don't touch him.
A giant flaming oar.
Mr. Boatman.
Please, Mr. Boatman.
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue,
and it's all black and icky.
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.
No, no.
And be prepared to go past my dog,
my three-headed dogs.
Cerebrus.
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.
The triple-brained monster which guards the gates,
the gateway.
Abandon hope all ye who ever hear.
What's he reading from?
It's a B-movie script.
No, it's about the three-headed son of a dog.
Into eternal sorrow.
I am the wage of forsaken people.
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.
It is getting hot in here.
Yeah, I've seen that movie, the Virgil movie.
... beyond me and beyond time myself.
I'm a big guy.
Bob and Virgil went several levels further down into hell.
Suddenly, Bob, shifting his pipe from one hand to the other,
pulled out from his voluminous ditty bag
a sop of cakes with wine and honey,
fermented, which he threw dexterously into the slavering three mouths
of the three-headed monster which guarded the cavernous entrance
to Funworld.
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet
by Satan.
And a mighty belt shook the canine's, uh, bulging stomach.
His three-headed, uh, his three-headed thing
wafted in the air.
That's enough of horrible horticultural facts from the world of mythology.
His gigantic, postulous, scabrous hide quivered unspeakably.
As with canine lust, he scraped his hindquarters across the floor,
howling and gribbling from all three heads simultaneously.
Huge ticks the size of small land crabs leaped from his fur-sparse epidermis.
Suddenly, the dog leaped across the vast expanse of hell
and saddled up to Ivan's leg.
Yes, he was forced to be on the show hour after hour.
Pinot, why did you make me do that horrible thing?
Yes.
Yes, the bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling for you and not for me.
Take my blood.
They bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling and ring eternally.
Yeah, they don't ever stop.
That's from Cerebus the P-Dog. They all go for Ivan's leg.
Ow! Get that you! Get those horrible little poodles off of me!
I hate poodles!
That was Madame Rosonga and her dancing chihuahuas
performing once again on the subgenius hour of mystery and darkness.
That was really a beautiful little dance number, Doctor Howe.
Yeah, you wouldn't think they were pop, they were capable of that.
And when's Michael Jackson gonna be on?
You know, there's a certain song that I mean between every other song that we play.
It's called the tune-up song, you know?
But...
No, that kind of mess, Elvis Presley and stuff.
There baby, you can sit here and sit down.
Look at the rocker there. Yeah.
David Bowie.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
We sold a million records on that one right there.
And all that bull.

I see there's a majority of people in the ghetto
nothing worse than putting somebody in the corner
when they've tried over and over and over

extremely dangerous aren't they i think you can sense the hands of these people
that we are non-violent people but we are extremely dangerous
right
something for nothing

you cannot take my slack away
just remember you don't have anything on

now you get to worry about yourself i don't mind losing my life what about you
i don't mind losing my reputation what about you i don't mind i don't mind being tortured
what about you i'm just no longer afraid and i've lost interest in this old world of capitalist
men racism i've lost interest in it so if somebody wants to make me stay in it by compromising with
filthy minded people that cannot even have respect for somebody that would die for even his enemies
and they want to cause anarchy in our midst i would just as soon bring it all to a gallant

I thought about my answer about being guest speaker

Let me clarify this.
I have been called brave.
What is brave?
Let me clarify this.
Of course, we all know that it is short for brave.

Cleve told me of an incident that happened to him the other day.
He was standing in a nearly deserted sub-Boston subway.
Tell it, brother, tell it.
There was a drunk standing on the other side across from him.
And he said,
What's your name?
And Cleve, not wanting to tell his real name, said, Bob.
That's right, he said Bob, Bob.
And the drunk said,
All the best drunks are named Bob.
In fact, the greatest drunk on earth is named Bob.
And then that man got down on his hands and knees and he licked that third rail.
How many of you licked that third rail?
You listening to radio can lick that third rail.
How many of you have been sitting the way Bob wanted you to, huh?
You've just been sitting on your little fannies, your tokuses.
Yes.
Sitting there praising Bob, singing hymns to Bob, but you're afraid to get out there and whoop P-Dawg for Bob, huh?
Aren't you being a little harsh with these people?
Oh, you Californians are so laid back.
We're into violence and hate in Texas.
I mean, we thought Bob was a nice guru.
We thought he was a good guy. We thought he was like, on our side.
Look, we didn't give you all that ammo just to praise him. Just to praise his sweet name.
I didn't get any ammo. I got some PCP.
Well, Bob, you best be lying.
Well, at least that. There's little kids in China who don't even get any PCP.
Well, none of the sacred PCP of the country.
Oh, the church. Ah, yes.
Many people meet here on the beach to call Sternow.
There's the little Sternow at the bottom of the hall.
Oh, look, I see him now.
He's been poked and prodded awake now by the bad show.
Let's hurt him now.
Except genius corruption.
Uh, Energon crystals.
Our muscles flexing.
Stop snorting those Energon crystals.
Okay, here it comes.
Okay, look out, look out.
Sternow's love muscle is flexing.
Oh, watch out, everybody stand back.
I'm listening. Stand back.
Oh, no!
Excuse me, it bumped into me.
Hey, you thought P-Dawg was ugly.
Don't get any on you. Don't get any on you.
You hadn't seen nothing until Sternow whipped out of bed.
Whoa, he knocked a hole in the wall.
That damn thing's got three heads, Ivan.
Oh, beat that!
They grow big in Arkansas, don't they?
Only one foreskin's infected, though.
Unwholesome about that critter.
Don't look at it too close up, little show.
There's kind of a capacity there for, uh, isolation.
Yeah, we thought we'd get as far away as we could and then give you a call so it's the bad show again.
Well, good. We're gonna take those chromosomes and DNA fragments from...
And mix them all around.
...the genius rood and somehow mediate a recombination between those two types of, uh...
DNA, are they?
Why not? Why not?
Close one.
So we're gonna take the resultant strain and inject it right into that golfer head.
That's the way it goes.
The head pump.
No! No! Don't inject the head!
You'll bring it back to unholy life!
It started to float, nimbus-like, over the golf course, leaving a trail of sizzling bloody...
Hmm, it's like a little snail trail.
...decomposing tissues to interact with the microorganisms of the soil.
As the head floated and levitated along it, uttering the word,
Why?
Why?
And it realized its tragic loss and the tragedy that it had invented for itself and sunk into a depression.
Oh.
Mumbling and muttering, mindlessly champing with its jaws and its...
But listen. Please listen.
Once upon a time, long, long ago, a lovely queen sat by her window sewing.
Dreaming, she pricked her finger with her needle.
Some time later, a little daughter was born to the queen.
And she was just as beautiful as the queen had hoped she might be.
Is that a boy or a girl?
Is it a spaghet?
It's a dyke.
No, it's a hippie.
A communist?
Practicant.
Drag queen.
Or a watch-rag queen.
Probably a speed freak.
Or a pothead.
Or a mutton queen.
Look at her. It's just a whore.
Or maybe a gold digger.
Or she's a hustler.
Or some sort of intellectual.
The happy mother decided to call her baby Snow White.
It could be a bag-hag.
Or maybe it's a bee girl.
Snow White dreamed beautiful daydreams about a handsome prince.
Someday, she knew he would come and carry her off to his castle in the clouds.
Oh.
And I often imagine that a girl is actually a boy and use her accordingly.
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who is the fairest of us all?
She said.
And the mirror replied.
Message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.
Interesting.
Thanks, Dad.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

True es BRUHyah.
You just have time to wash.
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who is the fairest of us all?
You sure as hell.
Take the princess into the forest and bring me back her heart in this jewel box.
Alone in the forest, Snow White wept with fright.
But she was not really alone, she found.
All the little woodland animals were her friends.
You're all right.
And chirping and chattering happily, they led her to a new home.
Hey, what kind of place is this?
It was a sweet little, tiny little house in the woods the animals showed Snow White.
Looks like a rogues gallery.
The sink was piled with unwashed dishes and everything was thickly blanketed with dust.
Shut up, shut up!
You're doping?
They had almost forgotten what the word meant.
She took one bite and sank lifeless to the floor.
And that ain't all.
Sink!
Now you drop dead, you nitwit!
God bless you.
It's a beautiful thing.
Praise God.
Praise Bob.
Why not?
The man with the plan.
Focusing up now on future America.
The mastermind for world domination.
The false superior mutant.
Marching across history or the face of it.
Well, if you go here on page 45 of the Bay Guardian, you do find there is a whole section of WADADs, mutants seeking other mutants and stuff like that.
It's a wonderful theatrical world.
It used to be cool and lonely to be a mutant, but not everybody.
Everybody's doing it.
Well, I mean, there used to be a time when it was sort of like, you know, a mule.
You cross a mutant with a normal and you get some sort of mutation, but now that mutants are doing it with other mutants, it's almost become, I don't know, mainstream.
I know.
It's really sad to see the best minds of our generation doing all that 50s stuff over again the same way they did it back then.
And now, you know, now it's almost like a new era.
It's really cool to be anything but mutant, you know?
I mean, it's sort of like, well, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, you're saying it, it, it, it, it.
Yeah, exactly.
And on top of that, if you're mutant, it's like be different for the sake of being the same.
Yes, that's right.
We're all different here for the sake of being the same on the air.
And I think that's what it's all about.
That's, that's really no better than the normal.
I mean, when you get right down to it.
You're on show.
Yeah.
Well, that's why the Church of the Subgenius is no longer a viable instrument in any of our lives.
Soon we may have to just revert to normality as an alternative to mutations.
Well, I think the ultimate thing to be is just to be me.
I just want to be the.
Not the, me.
Well, me for you.
The me is the.
Yeah, but that's the wrong me for you.
You got to be the you me.
I got to be the I me.
Well, this is no longer the me generation.
That was last generation.
So perhaps it's the.
Yeah, but I'm sterile.
So, you know, I'm kind of stuck with it.
Well.
If I could reproduce, then I might have a, a ye generation.
Ye?
Ye, that's true.
No, no, ye.
Ye.
I'm, um, likely a quién
Sure.
I would agree.
Everybody knowsी
Ye?
well, I would if senor, I would think, maybe he on it is be representative of

to parties, someonesail work Russian actually super here at that point and I.
But to put these things aside, you know have we got here territory to waster

little part 10 days and he's from Santa?
No, he's just beautiful man.
It's already humorous.
Well, we'll just have to be cartographers of the head.
And it's our duty to explore the wilderness.
Artillery-like art.
This new gray matter preserve.
Just don't look up its next stump.
You might see something you wish you'd never seen.
It was an ugly sight.
That's pretty romantic, Reverend Stang.
Yeah, I know what you do with that next stump, Pope Sternodoc's kick-haver.
I know exactly what you've been doing with that next stump.
I've detected the potential many times in the past and have been dazzled by the ill-matched, intimidating circumstances that this relationship has provided for me.
It's a breath of abnormalcy amidst a normal atmosphere of, you know, inhaling deeply of the church air.
Reverend Sternodoc, would you hang on just a second?
We're going to go to the caller. Hold on.
Okay.
Sir, I know who you are. God bless you.
Why did that nasty caller divert it before we could even get our hooks into him?
Well, he's probably trapped in a gas-filled tunnel when he's lifting his head at the scent of that golfer head.
And we're more and more interested to learn how far this mighty affair might have progressed tonight.
Might have. That's the key, I think, for you listeners who are collecting clues.
Often you in the show might have is the grass-banned caller that would have found the other side to be a possibility.
The clues are buried in the show.
But that board slid up like a Christmas tree, Commander.
Well, the character and climate of the show no doubt have exerted a slight influence on his actions.
A tidal influence, we would say.
That's true.
At the moment, they've dragged him right out of the room.
That's right. They're taking him off to the land of the sky-blue waters.
Well, we'll...
All the water's best for brewing.
We'll delve deeper and deeper into the more compelling mysteries, which lay beyond those that we had deduced had to the security of the poop-dog hat.
A monster eight feet tall, half man, half beast.
Perhaps the elusive missing link between humans and apes.
In the Himalayas, it's called...
Yeti.
Yeti.
Yeti.
Yeti.
I was cursed by being fitted with the hair of a monkey.
The big question in all this, of course, is are these animals real?
Why don't we catch them?
You must decide.
For you are the jury.
It's not my intention to delay this court.
God bless you.
Wouldn't that be weird?
Of course, a lot of folks say, well, what do you believe in, Brother Dave?
I say, I believe in everything.
You don't mean that.
Yes.
Even that?
Yes.
Yes, I...
Yes, yes, I do.
I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth.
I believe in every philosophy, every religion, every ideology, everything that exists.
And that don't give me no room for no argument.
If the world is wrong, then right your own self.
That's something to think about.
Sure.
Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness.
And I believe if a man's down, kick him.
That's right.
If he survives it, he has an opportunity to rise above it.
God bless you.
We were afraid there would be too many people on Main Street,
so we walked on down and stood in the grassy slope just this side of the triple underpass.
The president's car turned the corner and started toward us on Elm Street.
There were a lot of motorcycle police in front of the president's car.
My friend was afraid I didn't see the president,
so she said, look, there's the president's car.
Get a picture of him.
He turned to us and waved.
He faced forward again.
I lifted my Polaroid.
Just as I snapped the picture, I heard a shot.
That's a pile of horse manure, son.
God bless you.
I don't know.
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humor.
Just because you're not the same
Doesn't mean you're weird or strange
You're just different
Being different
Being great
You too, isn't that a risk?
Just because you're a different one
There's no telling what you might be doing
Come thinking different
Being different
Is being great
God bless you.
It's not who you aren't.
It's who you are.
And being yourself is being great.
From the Church of...
Let's get into trouble, baby.
I'm, uh, I think it's time to play some music.
Because we should.
They are well-dressed.


ou- defaulted and








짧은 나가 고 llegado.
He's cute.
He looks funny.
by the way I should have told you about that.
Long March.
I don't know what you're doing here. Oh my gosh.
The show rolls forward and Mobius is going nuts.
A hurtling juggernaut that can't be stopped.
But Mike, let's be serious.
And squabble.
Well, all right, what's a four-letter word for...
Oh, wait, hold on.
What's a four-letter word for pronate?
Food.
How about prolapse?
Ugh, just prolapsed on me.
Ow.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Bear with me a moment.
There's a fond analog that...
I'm gazing into the mirror now.
Okay, I'll eat it, I'll eat it.
Okay, we're going to go with the menu.
It's a punch-up 3D food.
Okay, well, how about the spooky strips of light
and I'll take the dead moth shining pie.
At Dead Moth Drive-Thru Plaza,
the pie is our...
I'll take the wall...
the fluttered wall soup.
Now available at Wall Drugs.
Yeah, and the dipping French woman.
Okay, thanks, here.
From Local Slaveway.
I'll take a real loony Cajun prune whip, too.
Wait a minute, I've been about to squeeze again.
Ugh!

Ugh!
A memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III
about a $1 billion...
Yeah, that makes me think of Meese, too.
I don't know...
...mentions a possible payment or a contribution...
Goodbye, Meese.
I don't know if it's visual or maybe it's a sense of smell.
You know, basically, ancient sense of smell
just kind of makes you think of Meese when,
well, when the whole building squeezes like that.
You get it?
And suddenly it dawned on, uh,
Crooker Fran that...
Wait, is it 6 o'clock?
Things have changed a bit.
Rappaport hired a long-time Meese and E. Robert Wallach
to get him...
Well, I just got...
I just, uh, went to the bathroom there
and almost finished the stark fifth!
But then I forgot.
I turned around.
I flushed it before I even thought about it.
And so more shows are probably going to be backing up the pipes.
Oh, God.
I need a gift.
And I really...
I just have no idea what to get him.
I know just what you mean
and I have just the gift you need,
but I can't say...
No cameras of any kind will be allowed.
I will not tolerate any outbursts...
Translation!
...any talking among yourselves...
Any laughter...
...nor anything that would interfere with the normal, orderly presentation of testimony.
Oh, a radio!
With your mid-afternoon news.
Well, all of Southern California seems to have sighted another UFO
in today's sunny, smogless skies.
The official...
The official...

The official...
Oh, they put a mic on the station?
Oh, it's coming alive!
Oh, no, it's crawling out of the toilet!
That's Mobius!
Mobius!
Hey, hey!
Let go of my...
Let go!
Let go!
Don't pull me out!
Oh, God!
Ow!
And, children, this is what you get when you eat at Cafe Neutron.
Is the new...
The irradiated food...
Is the new stark fifth out yet?
Yeah, it's out.
A little listener asking a real question.
Yeah.
Stop it!
Yeah, it's out.
It's $40.

But let's go over that again.
I don't...
Dear friends, the stark fifth, the long, long, long-awaited stark fifth of removal
is indeed almost finished, just as we've been saying for the last two years.
And this time, we really do mean it.
And...
Whoop, there went that...
Shoot, we flushed it away again.
We've now got a start all over again.
See, you backflush these things, and there's a little caller.
He's floating up.
He'll be floating face up.
There he is.
It'll be out soon.
We can tell you what the theme of the next issue is.
Get the plunger.
Get the show plunger.
Get that little caller up out of there.
The theme of the new stark fifth is not you, Jerry.
Oh, I'm afraid he's drowned.
Yeah, well...
Put it down as slowly as you can.
Oh, it's only an overshot.
Like Patty said.
On the floor.
Put it on the floor.
Gently.
Gently.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
















What could have happened to get such a piece of tripe?
You have no idea what I've gone through in the last three months.
Sometimes I'm perfectly normal, mentally.
I sit for hours and hours looking in the mirror,
hoping and praying for the slightest sign of my physical change.
But it doesn't come.
Then I feel myself going back to the animal instinct.
I try to fight it.
I try to fight it with all my willpower.
And then I feel...
Oh, Ian.
Ian, what am I going to do?
What am I going to do?
Fight.
That's all you can do.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!

Ah!
Ah!
Ah!


Oh!


Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!











Ah!
Ah!
And they mostly come at night.
Mostly.
Not all being old,
being lost.
Gently.
Sure is preferred,
it is a day.
Going down.
Mmm.
I like that.
What is the truth
about rock music?
I think it's an octopus.
Plato said,
when the music of a society changes,
the whole society will change.
Certainly, I got married
so I could retire.
Lennon said,
the best and the quickest way
to undermine any society
is through its music.
Can you think of anything else?
No, you've covered it all.
Satan has taken music
and he has counterfeited it.
See that?
Oh.
Oh!
Convoluted it.
Ah!
Twisted it.
Exploited it.
And now he's using
the hammer, hammer, hammer,
hammer, hammer.
Hammer, hammer, hammer,
hammer, hammer, hammer,
hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer,
hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer,




in the minds and the lifestyles
of this generation.
And that ain't all
sin.
What kind of ungodly being
was that?
Don't you believe
in reincarnation?
A wise guy, huh?
Quick, kill him!
Subdini's in space.
They took me up to the top
of that space needle
and they showered me
with beautiful gifts
and beautiful girls.
And love.
Moon babes.
Wow.
What moon babes?
Yeah, look at those satellites.
Look at them spiky eels.
Oh, that one's looting me now.
I can't tell whether those
are convexities or concavities,
but that looting
They some kind of moon babes.
I say, do that again.
Boy, can you dig those
potatoes out of the craters.
Hey.
Oh, I love it.
Oh!
Tiny flagellants
move through this,
and they're like a microscopic stew,
as if they own the place.
What happened?
What, did something die in here?
Uh, well,
Nancy Reagan
It's just more shit.
It's that dinosaur egg
that Hal's been sitting on
for the last 20 days.
Look, it's cracking.
I hear a screeching,
a scratching noise.
He's not even aware
that his own child
is being born now.
It's got the head of a boy
and the body of a Tyrannosaurus.
Yes, but it smokes Shermans.
Do you think that it could be a cure?
It's got the faint knowledge
of Al Cantanis.
And it's still talking.
The PLO chief rates full pardon
for safe sex.
I just don't know about this guy.
Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev
bought covert aid for erosion.
Yes, Hal had his own dinosaur baby child
on the show and didn't even notice.
And so we're going to cook
this little rare creature up for breakfast.
This single, look,
dinosaur baby child's making his first phone call.
A homosaurus sapiens.
It's Jack.
...show him that there's no way
to get out of here.
...just what do you do
when you're in trouble?
The show fought its way
to the front of the castle.
...the show thought to itself,
should I swim across the moat
or should I crawl through the mud?
Or should you crawl six miles
over broken glass
and radioactive mine tables
just to hear our program?
How many callers,
how many records,
how many eardrums?
We're going to talk about
some of the subtle racism
and sexism in the Bibles.
The sexism's pretty well accepted,
but we will talk about the racism
because it's so much more hidden
and it's so much more dangerous.
What genocide the wretched can justify
with the racism in it.
Through devious ways,
Satan has tainted the Bible
and they justify their racism
on the fact that Cain,
the son of Adam and Eve,
went off to a great city.
How is there a city
if Cain was the only first son of man?
Well, this city was not occupied by man.
But the beast of the field.
And Mormons and many other religions
still teach that blacks
are the descendants of Cain
and the beast of the field.
We single out these painted Bibles,
even St. John and St. Luke versions,
so you will know that ours
is the only Bible that should be read.
Versions of the Bible
which have racism in them
is going to be exposed
and then we will announce
how we will edit the Bible.
In a minute they are all going to be






No science is always better than
extraction from a part of itself.





only one microphone is on
and Dr. Howell and Gary the Broke Friend and puzzling evidence all went to rock it away.
Rock it away.
And that's what I'm going to do in a minute.
And while we haven't been on the phone to our friends,
we've been, well, the quick cut barrage that you've been listening to,
the edits of wonderful little sound bits,
holy messages from the collection of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,
that was all edited by St. Joe Riley.
Oh, praise St. Joe Riley.
Saves us so much work and lets us get away with murder.
Oh, other little bits and pieces that were done by others.
There's a song called Used Slack buried in there.
That was by...
Out of...

Band Experience, OBE.
You heard some Church of the New Faith there down at the end.
They'll, of course, finish their explanations next week.
On the commercial for our new product, Candy Frappy Frappy Candy,
was produced by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.
Oh, yes, up there in New York land.
The background music that's on right now is, of course,
J. Condom from his album, Zombo Frockland.
And now, this.
Well, no, how about this?
How about the post office box of the Church of the Subgenius?
I know that so many of you have been sitting there with your pens in your hands,
and it's just aching to write down that address where you can write for free,
free information about all the other services of our beloved Church.
Ah, yes.
And that post office box number, we'll just write to Bob.
That's all you need to do.
Write to Bob at post office box 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.
That's it.
That's the only piece of life between old kicks and new grabs.


We are going to be picking this folder up now,
and what that means is that you put your computer,

exactly where this box is.
And everyone in your group will open it up today.
And you guys go to paste this and whatever your friends,
and whatever company your friends have told you you can go ahead.
We'll better, using our online möj�트,
we're hoping that you're going to get to that.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.


The dead hours of the morning
between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.
This is the time when
women who have been many hours in labor
finally deliver, and when the idea
of the supernatural seems the
least implausible.
Mobius Rex is clambering
around on top of the
equipment here.
For those of you interested,
monitor number four
will show Mobius.
At this time,
ancient superstitions and night fears
have the greatest hold on human thoughts.
The time when those
who sleep are deep in the dreams.
And this is the hour
when the callers call.
The Church of the Subgenius Radio Show.
Hello?
Cookie, this is the show
trying to bother Philo.
State short question, please.
What's for breakfast, Cookie?
Cookie, this is Ivan.
You have to wake up Dr. Drumwatt.
Hey, hey, hey, I got to go.
How many presidents does it take
to screw in a light bulb?
No, no, wait, wait.
What's the most beautiful sight in the world?
A busload of presidents going off a cliff.
Get it? No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Spooky bad show.
Cookie?
Can we talk to little dude?
Don't listen to these men.
Not unless you have a connection
to dog heaven.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no.
Friends, this is dog heaven.
And this is Philo Drumhead.
Hey, dog heaven.
Philo Drumhead.
We've woken up just to be here
entertaining you in all of
Northern and Central California.
No, I'm still asleep.
You are going to save
the universe this time.
Yeah, that's right, Philo.
Yeah, if I link up,
sleep.
Be of good cheer.
Yeah.
Well, just tell us
what you're dreaming about
and we'll let you go eventually.
I'm dreaming about
a little dude.
Your dog?
Your dog that you had
five years ago?
Yes.
I've never forgotten
the little chap
who was so dear to us.
Still running out there
in the fields of toxic substance.
That's what it is.
He's prancing and dancing
through the fields of...
