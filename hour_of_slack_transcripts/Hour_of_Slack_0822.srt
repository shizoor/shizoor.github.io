1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
The Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:09,940
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be made on real-station and only in the city of...

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:21,560
Uh, my friend, the best thing about Slack is that I don't have to deliver it.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,360
I can just accrue it, and so can you.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:33,220
And you know another great thing is somebody else can deliver Slack, whole hours of it.

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,280
I don't have to.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,480
I can Slack off on something else, like computer animation of the Antichrist, as it happens to be this time.

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:52,820
But thanks to other subgeniuses and other subgenius shows, Slack is bursting out everywhere.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,340
In fact, your Slack this hour comes from one of...

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,700
One of those other shows!

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,200
The great Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:15,320
Lymph Node Institute Edition, hosted and run out of the hose by the great Dr. Ellis and Dr. Bug Blatter,

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,860
broadcast on the great WREK in Atlanta, Georgia Tech.

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Friends, one of the last great college.

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,420
Radio stations.

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,720
Before the conspiracy swoops down upon us all.

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,000
Ah, yes.

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,420
Bird of prey, bird of prey.

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,760
Lying high, lying high.

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,460
In the summer sky.

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,300
Bird of prey.

22
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,340
Bird of prey.

23
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,680
Bird of prey.

24
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,200
Flying high, flying high.

25
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,020
Gently pass on by.

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,180
Bird of prey, bird of prey.

27
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,260
Flying high, flying high.

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,160
Am I going to die?

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,500
Bird of prey.

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,080
Bird of prey.

31
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,120
Bird of prey.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,700
Flying high, flying high.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
Take me on your fly.

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,720
Welcome to Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, the lymph node edition.

35
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,540
I am Dr. Ellis and seated to the right is...

36
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,760
I'm Dr. Bug Blatter.

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,920
How the hell are you?

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,200
Not so good?

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,880
Understandable.

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,740
How you doing?

41
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,000
The studio of WREK is run with incredibly large tubes for some mysterious purpose.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,980
And I'm thinking of movies like THX 1138.

43
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,940
Books like Brave New World.

44
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,440
George Lucas and Aldous Huxley, respectively.

45
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,280
Why are you listening to college radio?

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,780
Isn't there a war on...

47
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,820
But you've probably come to escape all that.

48
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,500
Well, too bad for you.

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,300
Because we're just as immersed in this thing as you are.

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,200
Remember that war on drugs they tried doing?

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,740
Uh-huh. And how well that went?

52
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,640
It went well?

53
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,180
Oh, yeah.

54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,680
Yeah, real well.

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,380
You're facetious.

56
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,800
People can't tell sarcasm over the radio unless you saturate your voice in it.

57
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,940
But I'm winking.

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,400
Oh, wait.

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,880
You're right.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,820
Was that your third eye?

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,340
Third eye winking.

62
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,460
My third brown eye.

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,320
Don't it make your brown eye blue?

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,560
Don't it make your brown eye bleed?

65
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,740
Aye, aye.

66
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,180
Well, it kind of...

67
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,460
It could.

68
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,200
I've been winking all the week.

69
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,720
I was like a fantasy.

70
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,660
I've been winking all the week.

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,800
I've been winking all the week.

72
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:13,840


73
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,420
All the pickles, all the lettuce, special on the donut status.

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,060
Oh, yeah, I'm dancing and I'm swimming.

75
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,120
Oh, well.

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,520
I'm still a lawyer.

77
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,300
There's too much fair boys.

78
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,080
I'm over a friend.

79
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,040
Tell me which is better.

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,380
Get down.

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,240
Go.

82
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,580
Yeah.

83
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,200
,

84
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,120
cool.

85
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,560
Are you smart?

86
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:12,600
Yeah.

87
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:12,720
Yeah.

88
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:12,760
Yeah.

89
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,020
Yeah.

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,600
Yeah.

91
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:14,840
Yeah.

92
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:14,840


93
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:14,840


94
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:14,840


95
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:14,840


96
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,400
Yeah.

97
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,380
Yeah.

98
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,140
Yeah.

99
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,000
I think I got some talent, huh?

100
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,820
Ain't no record, got the bomb

101
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,600
I think I got a weapon, huh?

102
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,880
I think I got a big ragged tongue

103
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,540
All the people, all the ladies

104
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,700
Spend the money, go themselves

105
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,180
All the people, all the ladies

106
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,680
Spend the money, go themselves

107
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,940
Don't worry about it

108
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,320
There's too much

109
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,840
Don't worry about it

110
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,020
Don't worry about it

111
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,860
Don't worry about it

112
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,400
Patience

113
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,300
Patience

114
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,740
Patience

115
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,300
Patience

116
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,340
Patience

117
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,800
Patience

118
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:27,960
Patience

119
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,880
Patience

120
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,320
Patience

121
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,200
Pharmaceutical disbursement has spiked

122
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,060
over the last two weeks and I think

123
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,540
that this is due to that scary

124
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,840
miniseries the Thought Tube has been

125
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,640
oozing non-stop since.

126
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,860
I know it is

127
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,580
disconcerting to say the least,

128
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,040
stuck between an invisible horde of

129
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,200
Hashishin and the frothing dupes

130
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,040
of the home front. Unfortunately,

131
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,740
we must confront the possibility

132
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,300
that we are not alone.

133
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,960
that due to some mistake on our parts, and when I say our parts, I most certainly mean

134
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,840
your parts, or perhaps a failure on the part of Bob himself.

135
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,620
And when you think about it, that is the most likely scenario.

136
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,480
I mean, he's just as happy swindling bacteria.

137
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:15,720
But due to some combination of misfortunes, we are stuck on this cold rock with these

138
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,760
damn apes and their plague of certainty.

139
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:29,240
Anyway, my point is that there is a rumor whispering around behind the back rooms that

140
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,600
may soothe your collective and yet very personal minds.

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,060
But first, I would remind you that the ruling elite are, themselves, rogue subgeniuses.

142
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,340
Repressed and smoldering, but sub nonetheless.

143
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,740
These professional perpetual sublimators are sitting on an unknown quantity of goodies.

144
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,640
The good goodies.

145
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,280
Free energy.

146
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,040
Alien trinkets.

147
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,700
Experiments that disprove reality.

148
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,900
You know, the good stuff.

149
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,860
The stuff that might, no, shall we say, soften the borders between countries, and individuals

150
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,820
for that matter.

151
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,700
The only problem is that there are a few branches of the behavioral evolution tree that are

152
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,880
growing too close to the wires of progress, so to speak.

153
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,740
The most troublesome of the three branches is the one that is the most problematic.

154
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:18,740


155
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:18,740


156
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,000
It is the one that is the most problematic.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,940
The two branches of the three branches fall under the rough heading of fanatics.

158
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,420
And of the fanatics of the world, the two new monotheologies seem to provide the majority

159
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,220
of the grief.

160
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,900
The fitful flailing of the previous American regime with its WAKOs and sporadic African-Asian

161
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,620
bombings was just the dalliance of an old before its time phallocentric empire getting

162
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:47,060
itself hard, and perhaps demonstrating the intractable nature of the current situation.

163
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:55,160
Clearly, in the spirit of efficacy and incrementalism, the two withered limbs must be intertwined

164
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,380
and pruned in one concise motion.

165
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:05,320
So, they activate the Falwells to lather up one side, while the other side comes pre-lathered

166
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,840
by a southern Lebanese adolescence and fifty years of border wars.

167
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,220
Put them together in the desert or mountains?

168
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,480
Yes, someplace near the Tibetan Plateau would do quite nicely.

169
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,100
Who's to say what happens fifteen thousand feet in the air when a battalion of mostly

170
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,720
junkies start slinging grenades at the wind?

171
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,480
Well.

172
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,900
As the omelette said to the egg, WATCH OUT BELOW!

173
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,100
Following whatever atrocity they do have planned, they will be free to unveil their precious

174
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,500
goodies as products of the war effort.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,800
Come on, you're all conspiracy theorists.

176
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,880
You don't think the big bad boogeymen in Black Puppeteers would let things get too out of

177
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,740
hand, do you?

178
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,660
Huh.

179
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,760
Well.

180
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,460
Don't come crawling to me when you run out of time.

181
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,460


182
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,460


183
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,620
I'm not a roach crap pate.

184
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,720
For now, just absorb this aural information burst, and when I come back, I will tell you

185
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,740
how to survive the looming dark age.

186
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,280
To be continued...

187
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,340
I have...

188
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,080
We way!

189
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,740
Watch out!

190
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,640
Die!

191
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,440


192
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,440
Ah!

193
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,180
I'm on my own

194
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,760
I'm on my own

195
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,200
We get up

196
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,500
Imagine how free we would stay

197
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,900
We believe in tough love

198
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,360
Imagine how freedom is thrilled

199
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:45,140
We get up

200
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Imagine how free we would stay

201
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,500
We believe in tough love

202
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:12,100
Every single one of us.

203
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,420
The responsibility is still going on

204
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,600
No matter how far we are

205
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,700
No matter how far we'll stay

206
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,800
Our hearts will remain the same

207
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,760
Imagine how the sugar would spread.

208
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,020
Unpredictability.

209
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,640
These are the times when the rock has to sell you.

210
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,720
We believe in tough love.

211
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,300
All this is a foretelling of the future.

212
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,660
Not clear.

213
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,380
I can see my sense for myself.

214
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,540
Imagine how the sugar would spread.

215
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,880
The world would be a better place.

216
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,120
Back to the old times.

217
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,820
Imagine how freedom would spread.

218
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,080
The incredible freedom we understand now.

219
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,740
The incredible freedom we understand now.

220
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,320
Tough love.

221
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,800
Imagine how the sugar would spread.

222
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:36,360
All these arms would remind you of your family.

223
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Looking across the Willow Bridge.

224
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,360


225
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,420
Imagine our future now.

226
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,100
Look out the window Wow!

227
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,560
Where is my wall?

228
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,360
Look, now we're finished.

229
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,200
Now, the j dense here

230
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,340
we've got to do the J French

231
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:51,340


232
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,780
Royce Reema to the beginning at the sign.

233
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,960
You're stuck in a state of shock for shock.

234
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,000
And the f***ing words in your mind.

235
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,020
And I'm going to go to heaven.

236
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,680
One man who knows what's at work is a living, living, living, living, living.

237
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,880
These are the times to fly and show.

238
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,500
I tell you this, I don't know what's going to happen, man.

239
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,860
But I want to have my kicks before the whole dish house goes up in flames.

240
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,300
All right.

241
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,100
Well, now that I've soothed your apocalyptic fears, I can give you the bad news.

242
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,600
While there is the negligible possibility that the overall struggle is for a greater good,

243
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,960
the local and immediate home front effect will likely be a contraction of liberty.

244
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,680
Yes, it's just a matter of time until your favorite amendment is in peril.

245
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:07,720
Worse still, the same herd that is so quick to cash in your freedom for their security will be far more volatile.

246
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,680
Tolerance for aberrant behavior may drop to an all-time low since the Red Scare.

247
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,140
Yeah.

248
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:24,160
Don't be surprised if some anti-globalists decide to stay home and work on their besieged websites the next time the super-capitalists get together.

249
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,740
And those that do not may wish that they did.

250
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,980
But boo-nick-off-who.

251
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,840
They have their problems and we have ours.

252
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:40,680
One of our main problems is that many creatures will exert no effort until forced to do so by a need or threat.

253
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,860
If you are one of these, then it is time to consider acquiring.

254
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,000
A few defensive adaptations.

255
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes, it is evolution time.

256
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,300
Don't worry.

257
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,560
Your helix is old and has twisted past far worse than this.

258
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,860
So just relax and listen.

259
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,540
First and foremost, it is absolutely necessary that you remember to breathe.

260
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,780
I know this may sound a bit elementary, but the basics are so easily overlooked.

261
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,940
I have seen many a smooth operator busted by a gasp.

262
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,080
Regulating the depth and frequency of your respiration not only moderates your heart rate and blood pressure,

263
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,220
but also provides a certain sense of personal continuity.

264
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,520
In a similar vein, resist the temptation to scratch your itches.

265
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,620
In the literal physical sense now, not the dirty little yearnings that get you into so much trouble.

266
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,760
While the full explanation of this exercise is out of the question,

267
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,780
I will say that if you can refrain from this proprietary habit, then,

268
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,840
hypothetically,

269
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:52,340
this practiced willful resistance can travel with you up the scale of physical and psychic invasion

270
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,080
to the uncharted territory of technological torture,

271
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,940
leaving the, uh, client intact within the parameters of the, uh, adverse stimuli.

272
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,340
And while we are on the subject of torture, you need to learn to lie.

273
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,800
That is, pull the wool over your own eyes.

274
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,760
Learn to lie to yourself.

275
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:25,080
You must fully internalize your lies, whether they are part of a cover story or an innocuous explanation for your particularly freaky endeavor.

276
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,300
Memorize your lies.

277
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,520
Practice them in front of a mirror, a long mirror.

278
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,520
You lie with your entire body.

279
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,180
Lie to yourself in front of the long mirror until you convince yourself.

280
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,760
Also of crucial importance, you will need your senses crackling at full capacity.

281
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,740
Find a way to do this.

282
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,840
By now, you should have already sharpened your defensive paranoia to a hair's breadth.

283
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,200
If not, then you are dangerously behind the curve and the only advice I can offer is to

284
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,740
try to notice everything and use every drop of your sensorial flood to construct a menacing,

285
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,100
egocentric universe.

286
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,960
Which, some studies show to be the most accurate model.

287
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,300
Of course, none of this may prove relevant right now, this minute.

288
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,880
Then again, it might.

289
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:21,060
And I've always thought it better to be overly vigilant in advance than to be caught with your input jack dangling in the breeze.

290
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:35,040
If you still have time, please direct any questions to PO Box 670-541 Marietta, Georgia 30066-0126.

291
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,300
If you missed that, we will give it one final time at the end of the show.

292
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,140
Good luck.

293
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:10,940
Thanks for watching!

294
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,760
Pretentious Bisqu candle

295
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,840
On whatever else in this goddamn place we're risked in

296
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,600
The next exercise is for that

297
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,180
I will have you down on a

298
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,160
Stimulating tool

299
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:23,900
To send it's

300
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:24,900
Mogul

301
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,800
We'll need

302
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,460
Humans

303
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,640
Human

304
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,180
Humans

305
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,360
Humans

306
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:41,060
The word free is still the word free.

307
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,960
Men have lived for words.

308
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,100
Holocaust.

309
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,920
Hysteria.

310
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,720
Happy words.

311
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,280
Freedom.

312
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,320
Men have died for words.

313
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,940
Pointed words.

314
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,940
Cities have fallen for words.

315
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,920
Freedom's waiting.

316
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,560
Free.

317
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,160
The right words.

318
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,440
Iraq, inflammable.

319
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,680
The right words.

320
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,040
Islam, insidious.

321
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,880
The right words, said Lenin.

322
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,620
Are worth a hundred regiments.

323
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,920
Freedom's waiting.

324
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,400
Infamous.

325
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,720
Corrupt.

326
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
Scathing words.

327
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,320
You can say four blunt words and a man will hit you in the face.

328
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:16,860
Words.

329
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,420
Words.

330
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,400
Freedom's waiting.

331
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,680
Israelic.

332
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,480
Israelic words.

333
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,700
Words.

334
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,380
Words.

335
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,500
Words.

336
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,160
Words.

337
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,560
Words.

338
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,100
Words.

339
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,420
Words.

340
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:29,480
Words.

341
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,720
Dirty.

342
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,800
Implacable.

343
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,500
Crass.

344
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,620
Sarcastic.

345
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,100
Capable.

346
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,780
Silent.

347
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,200
A little deluge of adjectives.

348
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,760
Words.

349
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Freedom's waiting.

350
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,180
The strongest word is still the word free.

351
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,440
Free.

352
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:43,620
Free.

353
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,500
Relievability.

354
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,340
Next to the word free, the best word is new.

355
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,900
Persuasive words.

356
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,080
The best word is new.

357
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,540
New.

358
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:50,920
New.

359
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,320
New.

360
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,960
At your 7-Eleven, freedom's waiting.

361
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,980
For your kind of morning, it's our kind of freedom.

362
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,700
For you.

363
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
Other tested words are mistakes.

364
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,340
Saves.

365
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:03,640
Stop.

366
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,680
At last.

367
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,780
And don't.

368
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,540
We're not even here to discuss the so-called new war that's been going on ever since the

369
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,340
end of World War II.

370
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,480
The Holy War.

371
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,800
What we're worried about being Americans still.

372
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,500
Yes.

373
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,760
How is this going to affect us directly?

374
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,180
Because obviously, alright, you're going to have to wait longer for an airplane now.

375
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,460
Don't have a problem with that.

376
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,200
But while America is in a check-writing and law-passing mood, there are a lot of people

377
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
out there who have their agendas that they want to push.

378
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,660
No matter what the hell happened.

379
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,360
They have some agendas like, oh, I don't know, pick your favorite amendment to the Constitution

380
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,040
and the Bill of Rights and just cross it out.

381
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,920
No, sure.

382
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,400
And I can see self-censorship in the light of being a little less jarring.

383
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,320
I mean, temporary.

384
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,600
You have to move on with that type of thing.

385
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,800
I like how they're calling W the cowboy and stuff.

386
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,940
That cracks me up.

387
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Because it really puts it in the light that probably people see us in globally.

388
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,560
Crazy Westerners.

389
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,280
And then you get him and his civvies up there talking some serious trash on, what was that,

390
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,240
with a bullhorn on a mound of rubble?

391
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,320
With dead people in it?

392
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,920
Well, I hear you.

393
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,020
Hymns to the American people for the anniversary of their independence.

394
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:26,280
Brothers and sisters, on this day of deathless glory, let us come united in our battle grace.

395
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,180
To him our fathers martyrdom.

396
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,220
And to him our father's death.

397
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,220


398
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,220


399
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,080
Let us march in a battle, death to death.

400
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,580
So let it be, in God we promise.

401
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,040
They died.

402
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,740
They died.

403
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,120
And we are free.

404
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,360
Take up their cross.

405
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,360
Deserve their crown.

406
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,900
Sustain this flag of liberty.

407
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,780
Thy band shall not be cordoned down.

408
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,060
Ashes to ashes.

409
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,240
Dust to dust.

410
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,780
So let it be, in God we trust.

411
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,780
In war and earthquake, wreck of the world.

412
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,580
Still let the flag of freedom fly.

413
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,720
In peace and safety, still be strong.

414
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,480
For we will live.

415
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,540
As we would die.

416
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,520
Ashes to ashes.

417
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,780
Dust to dust.

418
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,520
So let it be, in God we trust.

419
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,720
Though we'll wash the world in blood.

420
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,320
Though death devour.

421
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,700
Though time decay.

422
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,560
Let but our hearts go to brotherhood.

423
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,420
And this we shall not take away.

424
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,400
Ashes to ashes.

425
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,860
Dust to dust.

426
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,120
So let it be, in God we trust.

427
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,800
Stand and join hands.

428
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,100
And let us sing.

429
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,660
Shake out all glory to the skies.

430
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,680
With hearts and hands, defend.

431
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,680


432
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,680


433
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,680


434
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,680


435
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,220
Defiant fling our purpose against destiny.

436
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,920
Ashes to ashes.

437
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,400
Dust to dust.

438
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,160
So let it be, in God we trust.

439
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,820
Amen.

440
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,800
All hail the American knight.

441
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,220
If tomorrow all the things were gone, I have worked for all my life.

442
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,360
And I have to start again with just my children and my life.

443
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,900
On the 4th of July, there are fireworks to celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

444
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,960
I thank my lucky stars for be riding here today.

445
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,820
Our forefathers declared the independence of the colonies from England.

446
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,700
And I thank my little brother, the King of England.

447
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


448
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,060
Because the flag still stands for freedom.

449
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,700
And they can't take that away.

450
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,480
And now the signal.

451
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,500
One if I land, two if I see.

452
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,640
We stand, with the power of God.

453
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,340
And I'm proud to be an American.

454
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,300
Where at least I know I'm free.

455
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,700
And I won't forget the men who died.

456
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,320
Who gave that right to me.

457
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,300
The Redcoats are coming.

458
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,380
Shot around the world.

459
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,940
Taxation without representation.

460
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,140
Most tax evaders make no use of crime those religious.

461
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,100
Washington's crossing of the Delaware River.

462
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,820
That's the right to bail out.

463
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,260
And I'm glad we stand up next to blue and defend her still today.

464
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,060
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.

465
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,320
God bless the blue ass day.

466
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,040
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee.

467
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,220
And I'm glad we stand up next to blue and defend her still today.

468
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,860
Across the plains of Texas.

469
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,320
From sea to shining sea.

470
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,360
From Detroit down to Houston and New York.

471
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,820
To El Dorado first ride in every American heart.

472
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,960
I still have faith in Mary Bo.

473
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,680
And it's time to stand and serve.

474
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,280
That I'm proud to be an American.

475
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,280
Where at least I know I'm free.

476
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,080
And I won't forget the men who died to give that right to me.

477
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,940
And I'm glad we stand up next to blue and defend her still today.

478
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,400
American. American. American. American. American.

479
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,620
Cause there ain't no doubt.

480
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,480
I love the rest of America.

481
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,800
American. American. American. American. American. American.

482
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,000
Can't dress like the little ass sir.

483
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,400
American. American. American. American. American. A aber Northern

484
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:14,500
Yeah I'm proud to be an American.

485
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,220
Where at least I know I'm free.

486
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,760
I'm proud to be an American.

487
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,080
who died for the

488
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,600
that right for me

489
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,040
and I'd gladly stand up

490
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,960
next to you and defend

491
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,600
the first time today

492
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,620
cause there ain't no doubt

493
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,080
I love this land

494
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,880
God bless the blue ass

495
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,020
Wake up!

496
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,920
Yeah, patriotism is usually

497
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,160
where did I hear this?

498
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,180
The refuge of scoundrels?

499
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,020
Well, yeah, but somewhere recently I read something about how

500
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,940
you know, it's fine to be cynical

501
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,960
about the mind control that they start on children

502
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,980
written with the pledge and everything

503
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,500
because really it is just to keep us rather

504
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,420
complacent with our situation, but

505
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,000
patriotism is very valid right now cause they came

506
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,580
into the country in which we live

507
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,500
and killed a bunch of people

508
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,980
Obviously they've had a hankering

509
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,820
for the World Trade Center for a little while

510
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,320
First you don't succeed

511
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
As far as patriotism, I mean

512
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,920
you're being patriotic about a system that's flawed

513
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,800
and you've got some real scoundrels at the top

514
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,880
and not necessarily the highest moral fiber

515
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,120
but, you know, you've always had the option

516
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,900
to move, so put up or shut

517
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,540
up, you know, this is what we're doing right now

518
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,860
and if we bring about the end of the world

519
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,780
it's the way it's supposed to go

520
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,900
You know, what are you gonna do about it?

521
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,940
It's the end times!

522
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,220
Don't you read the Bible?

523
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,800
I cannot believe what Falwell said about gays

524
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,160
and how we lost the...

525
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,720
We lost God's protection is what happened in New York

526
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,700
Because of the gays

527
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,500
Because of the gays

528
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,440
And the abortion doctors

529
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,060
Oh man

530
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,220
And the girls with blue hair and nose rings

531
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,380
It's what happens when you take religion too seriously

532
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,300
Oh, I read it from Kevin freakin' Smith

533
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,520
That's where I paraphrased both things about patriotism

534
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,660
and I read it off News Askew, which is part of his view

535
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:48,880
of society, and I think it's a good thing that he's not a patriot

536
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,780
I read it off News Askew.com website

537
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,260
and it really struck me as true

538
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,840
A Catholic

539
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,540
Yeah, that guy who came up with buddy Christ

540
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,360
Christianity, wow!

541
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,160
They're almost oxymorons

542
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,980
By that I mean pimpled, stupid people

543
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,780
All right, this is so much about treatment

544
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,180
That's good

545
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:28,000
All right, this is us

546
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,660
There are more

547

Killings!

574

Killings!

575
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,120
Killings!

576
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,700
This thing you know can take my thoughts away

577
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:28,540
Think of how representative the government of the United States is of the people of the United States.

578
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,520
Not very.

579
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:37,280
Well, the governments of these Muslim countries are even less representative of their people than our governments are of us.

580
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:44,420
If the Baptists, let's just pick the Baptists because they cause the most problems in Christianity.

581
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,700
They're the people that shoot abortion doctors and blow things up.

582
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,800
Hmm, sound familiar?

583
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,440
We are in the Bible Belt, so.

584
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,340
Yeah, exactly.

585
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,100
So, don't drop the soap.

586
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,140
Walter boy!

587
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:02,160
If the Baptists went and did something crazy, like say they blew up part of Mecca.

588
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,600
Oh my gosh!

589
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,300
Yeah, that would make people upset.

590
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,160
That's whatever.

591
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,300
That's what all the other Protestants would say.

592
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,660
Oh my God, what the hell are you doing?

593
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:21,020
But when the Iranians started sending teams of death squads into countries to wipe out the Baptists,

594
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:27,840
you can bet your ass that the Methodists and the Lutherans and the Catholics and everyone else is going to stand up and say,

595
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:35,540
Hey, listen, I know there are crazy little retarded cousin of our religion, but you can't just come in here and exterminate them like this.

596
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,560
And what are you going to do?

597
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,260
Thank you.

598
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,640
Good morning, everyone.

599
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,520
Great to see you.

600
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,740
I'm your host, Robert Glory.

601
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,020
We plan on making the United States the bombshell resort for almost 90,000 people, X-versions, just for all you kids who are watching cable cartoon.

Kevin правильно dice el b ***'han

604
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,620
You think we're all shallow tells someday we got to argue about it, but I think overуй he's not coming.

605
00:41:59,620 --> 00:41:59,620


606
00:41:59,620 --> 00:41:59,620


607
00:41:59,620 --> 00:41:59,620


608
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,060
468 poems or 148 �iling chords for a legend sir, David Wallace

609
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,300
169 Hanukkah standards for sketches and thus many voiced guitars.

610
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:07,260
We all can count on you to vote for them to fill us in.

611
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,260


612
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,360
Sliding between light and shadow, muttering in the dogs of unfamiliar score.

613
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,360
Across the wounded galaxies we intersect, poison of dead sun in your brain slowly fading.

614
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,120
Migrants of ape in gasoline track of history.

615
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,920
Explosive bio-advance out of space to neon.

616
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:32,040
I'm you, a wind hand caught in the door, couldn't reach flesh.

617
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,200
In sun I held the stale overcoat, dead hand stretching the throat.

618
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:43,140
Last to proffer the disaster count on track, see, Mr. Bradley, Mr.

619
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,760
And being blind, may not refuse to hear.

620
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,040
Mr. Bradley, Mr. Martin, disaster to my blood whom I created.

621
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,820
The shallow water came in with the tide in the Swedish river of Gothenburg.

622
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,720
The water came in with the tide in the Swedish river of Gothenburg.

623
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:09,800
The water came in with the tide in the Swedish river of Gothenburg.

624
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,600
That's for puke from people like you.

625
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,820
Would you F.I.B. to the F.D.I.? Would you tell to them a dirty lie?

626
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,180
Everything will soon turn out alright.

627
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,500
Would you F.I.B. to the F.D.I.? Would you tell to them a dirty lie?

628
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,920
And I think I'll have some apple pie.

629
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,900
I love it when I know I'm the king of happy life.

630
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,640
It's really not too simple, I do what I say.

631
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,400
Life's a rush, there's so much to do.

632
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,020
Love it when I say.

633
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,100
My investigated distinguish bubblers

634
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,900
Slowly splitting both my ribs.

635
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,900
Metaphorically speaking, that is.

636
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,280
Would you F.I.B. to the F.D.I. Would still like to tell them a dirty lie?

637
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,680
Everything will soon turn out alright.

638
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,920
Would you F.I.B. to the F.D.I. Would you tell to them a dirty lie.

639
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,320
And I think I'll have some apple pie.

640
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,740
Ba la la la la la la la la la la la la la

641
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,680
Play it now

642
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,200
Play it now

643
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,600
Play it now my baby

644
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,100
Oh, oh, oh oh

645
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah

646
00:44:53,100 --> 00:45:22,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah

647
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,080
In which our country chooses a lesser of two evils.

648
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,940
In the 80s, when the Soviets were attempting to occupy Afghanistan,

649
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,080
and in case you haven't looked it up on an atlas,

650
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,100
it's a country about the size of Texas, the elevation of the Rocky Mountains.

651
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,840
We decided that the Taliban was the lesser of two evils against the Russians,

652
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,400
so we gave them money and guns.

653
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:46,140
Much like we decided that Saddam Hussein was the lesser of two evils against Iran,

654
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,720
so we gave him money and guns.

655
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,020
You know I live a life of danger for the FBI

656
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,080
Keeping tabs on our nation on the line

657
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,940
Laying on the sea in the sky

658
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,260
But every single night

659
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,500
Before I go to bed

660
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,000
I get down on my knees and thank God

661
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,760
I'm a secret agent man

662
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,520
Secret agent man

663
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,480
Secret agent man

664
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,100
They've given me a number

665
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,920
But they take away my name

666
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,080
Secret agent man

667
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,680
Secret agent man

668
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:54,680


669
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,080
I got one hell of a job

670
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,440
To perform for the U.S. of A.

671
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,340
Got the responsibility of our nation

672
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,220
Lots of guarantees

673
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,160
But every night and day

674
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,560
I salute the flag and say

675
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,280
Thank you Jesus

676
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,800
Cause I'm a secret agent man

677
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,320
Secret agent man

678
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,880
Secret agent man

679
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,480

680
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,740
Secret agent man

681
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:27,740


682
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,560
Secret agent man

683
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,340

684
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,680

685

Secret agent man

688
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,280
You know they got me doing this, doing that

689
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,240
And a little bit of something else

690
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,100
Fighting cavities of evil

691
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,600
Safeguarding America's health

692
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,960
But not an afternoon pass

693
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,380
I don't get up off my ass

694
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,220
Thank you God, cause I'm a secret agent man

695
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,840
Secret agent man

696
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,840
Secret agent man

697
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,220
They give me a number

698
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,300
But they take away my name

699
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,160
Secret agent man

700
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,180
Secret agent man

701
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,700
They give me a number

702
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,720
But they take away my name

703
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,920
Secret agent man

704
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,060
Maybe they have been protecting us up until now

705
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,720
It's a shame that they failed

706
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,600
So bad with the intelligence

707
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,460
But what, within the last year

708
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,840
They got that CIA spy

709
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,080
And before that they had the FBI spy

710
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,800
The FBI director retired

711
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,660
Because of some of this crap recently

712
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,980
The missing documents for Tim McVeigh's trial

713
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,700
That showed up a month before

714
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,800
He was supposed to be executed

715
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,520
I mean those people have their heads way up their asses

716
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,040
For the amount of technology at their disposal

717
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,700
The eye of the CIA blinked

718
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,920
The eye of the FBI was closed

719
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,760
And of course who's to say

720
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,100
How history will look at this

721
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,620
Do keep in mind that all empires that have failed

722
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,320
Have failed

723
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,380
Because they attempted to fight a war

724
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,920
On multiple fronts

725
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,500
Those were land wars generally

726
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,780
But the same thing applies

727
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,900
You have to have the majority of your resources

728
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,480
Preferably in one

729
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,360
No more than two places

730
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,300
And if you want to fight a war

731
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,560
With an infinite number of possible fronts

732
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,320
And if the terrorism continues in this country

733
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,480
People might decide

734
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,660
This is how America loses by the way

735
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,620
The terror continues

736
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,280
Things keep blowing up

737
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,480
And people decide

738
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,520
That the power of the government

739
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,320
It's influence on your life

740
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,260
Is no longer outweighed

741
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,040
By it's ability to protect you

742
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,040
They're going to dump as much money

743
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,940
As the CIA wants into intel

744
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,960
Human intel as they've called it

745
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,420
That was the first thing I heard out of politicians mouths

746
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,760
Was using this as an excuse

747
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,840
We need more people on the ground

748
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,740
In operations

749
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,240
We need spies basically

750
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,200
Lots of spies

751
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,580
Because we haven't been using spies as much as we had

752
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,640
Since the Cold War

753
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,160
Since the Cold War ended

754
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,880
Which was a fabricated freaking altercation anyway

755
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,940
I mean it was a real threat

756
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,160
But it was created

757
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:53,880
So screw that

758
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,600
Initially it was

759
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah

760
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,760
And weapons of mass destruction

761
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,100
All over the damn place

762
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,520
And again this is just not going to turn out well

763
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,100
This will be it

764
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,960
I n3 don't nee Studios

765
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,220
In the End

766
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:37,120
I n3 don't nee Studios

767
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:37,960
I n3 don't nee Studios

768
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,960
In the End

769
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,580
I'll offer you

770
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,420
Sir

771
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:44,840
Rank

772
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,940
Much more

773
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,360
To Shoot

774
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:58,740
I love you sexy boys and I love you masculine men

775
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:03,000
You can be faced by a great man, my friend

776
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,580
The viewer woke up in Belgium

777
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,420
And he poured a lot of syrup on his waffles

778
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,280
And then he walked on down the hall

779
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:20,700
And he said, all I want is to have some hash browns

780
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,400
And some grits

781
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,360
And then he walked on down the hall

782
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,320
And then he said, listen

783
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,460
I've got a quarter in my pocket

784
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:37,500
And I see that Waffle House jukebox

785
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,200
And I'm gonna walk up to the coin slide

786
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,080
And there's a direct line

787
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,300
Between my pupil and that coin slide

788
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,300
And I lift that quarter out of my pocket

789
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,680
And I said, I want to hear the Waffle House theme

790
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,400
So I walked up to the jukebox

791
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,560
And I said, come on in

792
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,380
I believe I will

793
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,540
I believe I will

794
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,480
On to the Waffle House

795
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,260
I've got a six pack

796
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,200
And nothing to do

797
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,180
And I can go up all night

798
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:01,880
And it's a rockin' time

799
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,620
And all I know

800
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:06,860
Justude, I love you

801
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:06,860


802
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:06,860


803
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,100
Say the words that you would say

804
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,360
That's what I hear

805
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:08,360


806
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:08,360


807
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:08,360


808
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,920
Got all this woman that I found

809
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:09,920


810
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:09,920


811
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,200
She doesn't usle that

812
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,260
I've legogy

813
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:14,260


814
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,760
Death is not the end

815
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,400
Not the end

816
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,980
Not the end

817
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,660
Just remember

818
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,920
That death is not the end

819
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,820
When you're standing on the crossroads

820
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,700
That you cannot comprehend

821
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,980
Just remember

822
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,880
That death is not the end

823
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,880
And all your dreams have vanished

824
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,280
And you don't know what's up the bend

825
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,100
Just remember

826
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,120
That death is not the end

827
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,820
Not the end

828
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,240
Not the end

829
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,780
Just remember

830
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,080
That death is not the end

831
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,420
When storm clouds gather round

832
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,280
And heavy rains descend

833
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,240
Just remember

834
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,380
That death is not the end

835
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:38,360
And there's no one there to comfort you

836
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,560
With a helping hand to lend

837
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,340
Just remember

838
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,660
That death is not the end

839
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,300
Not the end

840
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,760
Not the end

841
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,460
Just remember

842
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,540
That death is not the end

843
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,240
For the tree of life is growing

844
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,680
Where the spirit never dies

845
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,240
And the bright light of the sun is shining

846
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,640
And the light of salvation

847
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,620
Up in dark and empty skies

848
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,400
When the cities are on fire

849
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,040
With the burning flesh of men

850
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,260
Just remember

851
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,680
That death is not the end

852
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,540
Just remember

853
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:37,540


854
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,580
When you search in vain

855
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:43,800
To find some lorry-biding citizen

856
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,240
To find some lorry-biding citizen

857
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:44,240


858
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,000
Just remember

859
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,260
That death is not the end

860
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,660
Not the end

861
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,540
Not the end

862
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,000
Not the end

863
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,060
Just remember

864
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,080
That death is not the end

865
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,840
Not the end

866
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,800
Not the end

867
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,720
Not the end

868
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:13,720


869
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:13,760
Not the end

870
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:20,280
Just remember that death is not the end.

871
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,560
If you need some place to hide or just to get away from it all,

872
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,380
why don't you drop by our post office box?

873

And it is a post office box with a number.
