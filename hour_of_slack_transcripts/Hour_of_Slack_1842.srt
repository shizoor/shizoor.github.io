1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,140
Behold.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,020
Go back to your compartments and resume the schedule.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,620
The ship is off.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,200
Wait!

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,740
No, I have something to say.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,340
Listen.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,060
Listen to what I have to say.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,900
This is what I have to say.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,640
The subgenius power of swat.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,800
What are you going to do?

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,220
I'm going to smash the earth.

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,540
The cool green earth.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,320
Fools!

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,300
Can't you understand?

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,460
Minnesota.

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,420
The land of the sky blue water.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,500
Minnesota.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,940
Minnesota became the butter state.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,420
Minnesota in the 20th century.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,860
This is Minnesota.

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,360
I have never been to Minnesota.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
Minnesota got lots of lakes.

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,460
Minnesota got plenty of lakes.

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,980
Look at them lakes in Minnesota.

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:25,440
Oh!

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,800
Lots of lakes in Minnesota.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,380
I have never been

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,300
to Minnesota.

29
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,720
I have never been

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,160
to Minnesota.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,800
Oh!

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,220
i never been

33
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,080
to Minnesota.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,780
n specific

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:54,780


36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,400
I've never been to Minnesota.

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,980
I have never

38
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


39
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,480
I have never been to Minnesota

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,820
Minnesota

42
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,980
Minnesota

43
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,660
Got lots of lakes

44
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,840
Lots of lakes

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,640
Minnesota

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,160
Minnesota

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,460
Has got lots of lakes

48
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,640
has got lots of lakes

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,940
Look at them lakes

50
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,060
look at those lakes

51
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,980
In Minnesota

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,260
in Minnesota

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,740
Plenty of lakes

54
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,820
plenty of lakes

55
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,800
In Minnesota

56
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,460
Minnesota

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Minnesota

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,700
Minnesota

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,920
Minnesota

60
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,960
Minnesota

61
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,440
Minnesota became

62
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,620
the Buffett meanwhile

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,380
The Rudy Schwartz Project did it.

64
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,880
For this episode, friends, number 1,842,

65
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,720
we're going to go back to the day before X day.

66
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,800
They got the sound system working better,

67
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,340
and the panelists on this live hour of Slack are Dr. Hal, Reverend Pease,

68
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,840
Reverend Fid Chooley, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,320
Fid first, and then Pease, actually.

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,520
A highlight, in my opinion, is Dr. Hal and I doing a duet on the song Cool Water,

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,480
but that comes later, as did Pease,

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,720
although those two things don't always happen in that order.

73
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
This microphone is on the left.

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,320
This one here is in the middle.

75
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,920
And this one's on the right.

76
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,840
Check one, check one.

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,240
Check two, check two, check two.

78
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,580
And check three.

79
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,780
Reclaimed coffee.

80
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,320
Dr. Fox, how are we looking on mix?

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,200
This is Test Chatter.

82
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,380
I'm merely talking into the microphone,

83
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,880
not to convey any actual information,

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,840
but merely to put audio into the mic

85
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,360
so that Dr. Fox can twist those robot nipples enough

86
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,780
so that we can get on.

87
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,380
R-E-Think Radio.

88
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,080
You're doing a really good show, Fid.

89
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,680
Thank you, Pease.

90
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,220
Do I need to...

91
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,180
Tell them about the bit.

92
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,160
Oh, the...

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,440
Yeah.

94
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,340
So Pease had this idea that was really funny.

95
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,300
He said we should do a bit.

96
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,980
And I was like, yeah, that is a good idea, Pease.

97
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,120
So...

98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,680
I'm gonna chew the fat with Fid Chooley later.

99
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,580
Do we have the fat?

100
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,740
I've almost caught that chicken three times,

101
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,060
so just give me a couple more chances

102
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,780
and I'll have some fat.

103
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,360
I remember bits, but only bits.

104
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,440
Bits and pieces.

105
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,520
But yeah, I remember back in the day,

106
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,060
we used to do bits, but we...

107
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,440
Either we lost them or the exes took them one by one.

108
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,740
Along with things like my spinal fluid.

109
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,540
My hair.

110
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
My memory.

111
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,140
My morals.

112
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,320
All kinds of things.

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,460
All gone.

114
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,240
All gone.

115
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,220
I'll get them back tomorrow.

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,020
You're still doing better than me.

117
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, I need to...

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,820
I got some catching up to do.

119
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,140
I'll admit, since there's no girls here anyway,

120
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,720
I lost a couple of dicks over the years.

121
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,560
I still got most of them.

122
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,640
Oh, that's okay.

123
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,260
They grow back.

124
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,580
The main one works.

125
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,360
Well, at least for one thing.

126
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,400
Yes, peeing.

127
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,300
Everybody pees.

128
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,180
Okay?

129
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,900
Anybody with a functioning urethra

130
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,180
is allowed to join for free

131
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,860
for only $35.

132
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,120
Well, hey.

133
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,920
Shout out to Dobbs Chord

134
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,300
and shout out to freethinkradio.com.

135
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,740
We are piping hot.

136
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,280
Streaming.

137
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,620
Streaming piping hot.

138
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,240
Super.

139
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,620
Ooh.

140
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,180
Ooh.

141
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,780
Ooh.

142
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,840
Getting the stage set up

143
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,780
for the hour of slack

144
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,980
coming very soon

145
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,260
to an ear hole

146
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,680
near your face.

147
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,840
And I am going to piss my pants

148
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,080
live later on too.

149
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,200
So stay tuned for that.

150
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,860
Did you guys get all the fat samples

151
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,760
for the chewing event?

152
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,680
Well, that was Pease's job.

153
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,800
And, uh...

154
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,320
If I've learned anything

155
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,940
from this X-States,

156
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,340
don't put Pease in charge.

157
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,200
Right, okay.

158
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,800
Of anything.

159
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,880
Yep.

160
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,060
I got my plane ticket home

161
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,200
for Stang Ivan.

162
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,360
Actually, I should double check that.

163
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,120
Or get to the airport

164
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,260
at real early.

165
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,260
I don't know if they fixed

166
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,540
the return ticket or not.

167
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,180
Well, to be fair,

168
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,100
me and Fox put Pease

169
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,340
in charge of your ticket,

170
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,160
so I don't know

171
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,300
who the real dummy is.

172
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,320
Is it Pease

173
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
or is it us for putting

174
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,160
Pease in charge of your ticket?

175
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,740
Why not both?

176
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,120
That's what I say.

177
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,660
I'm sure they'll have Pease drive you.

178
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,840
He never screws up.

179
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,660
Yeah, you won't have to

180
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,340
how the world's gonna end.

181
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,040
It really better

182
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,220
fucking end this time.

183
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,020
Oh, yeah, that's right.

184
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,160
Nobody made any plans

185
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,080
at all for after.

186
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,780
All the credit cards

187
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,640
are maxed out.

188
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,600
Why did I even bother

189
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
to pay for these new glasses?

190
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,960
Yeah, I've often asked

191
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,480
myself, why did I spend

192
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,760
all day paying bills

193
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,000
just before X Day?

194
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,540
What kind of idiot am I?

195
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,240
Well, Hal,

196
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,420
we're still managing

197
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,660
to get ourselves up

198
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,660
those three steps

199
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,780
to this stage.

200
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,400
Yes, well, this chair

201
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,160
will definitely cripple me

202
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,760
before long.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,920
As I was saying,

204
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,080
it's like every X Day,

205
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,140
the X's take a little bit

206
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,040
or a little piece.

207
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,280
Yes, like old man death

208
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,900
who takes little pieces of you

209
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,260
while you're lying in your box

210
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,940
till you're all dead.

211
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,220
All gone.

212
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,460
Oh, Bob.

213
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,700
Won't you spare me

214
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,160
over for another year?

215
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
Don't you take my brain.

216
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,260
Oh, Bob.

217
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,460
He's Bob.

218
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,020
Won't you leave me sane?

219
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,040
Bob don't ever change.

220
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,480
He's Bob.

221
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,980
Wish I knew your name.

222
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,180
Always will be Bob.

223
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,060
I always thought that song

224
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,720
should have the percussion

225
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,780
of Chain Gang.

226
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,220
Yeah, it should have

227
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,180
that kind of thing.

228
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,860
Hitting rocks with picks.

229
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:22,940
Yeah.

230
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,720
We need the loop of that.

231
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,120
Bob had a woman named Connie.

232
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,140
She was a righteous friend.

233
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,700
She had a lot of friends

234
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,660
named Johnny.

235
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,380
When Bobby hit the trail.

236
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,320
He's Bob.

237
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,460
They told me to praise him

238
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,080
and they told me to pay him.

239
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,120
But I just want to be him.

240
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,080
Always will be Bob.

241
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,780
Hi, Bob.

242
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,240
Oh, Bob.

243
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,000
Bob was the god of the forest

244
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,300
who claimed his jungle bride.

245
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,540
His pet was a brontosaurus

246
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,280
that Bobby used to ride.

247
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,540
He's Bob.

248
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,520
Bob don't ever change.

249
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,040
He's Bob.

250
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,960
Always will be Bob.

251
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,820
Or there's a dark and a shadow side of Bob.

252
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,620
That every subgenius knows is true.

253
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,980
I played that song on our slide.

254
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,380
Oh, yeah?

255
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,860
In the last two weeks, yeah.

256
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,100
Also, Papa Joe's fiery speech,

257
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,700
Five Minutes to Midnight.

258
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
I need to tell him that.

259
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,560
He's got...

260
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,500
Recorded in Germany.

261
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,320
In full dress.

262
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,860
I'm sure they loved that over there.

263
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
Yeah, it was nervy, actually.

264
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,920
Five Minutes to Midnight!

265
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,900
It was a wonderful rant.

266
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,900
Perfectly written.

267
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,880
Just to do it,

268
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,360
the Hamburg revival.

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,500
He's got friends up in the sky.

270
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,680
He's immortal and can fly.

271
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,980
Otherwise, he's just a guy like me and you.

272
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,420
There's a dead armadillo on the road.

273
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,220
And Bob's bumper,

274
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,180
he hit it fair and square.

275
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,780
There's a twinkle in his eye.

276
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,880
Not a tear as he drives by.

277
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,180
Cause mean old Bob Dobbs,

278
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,220
he just don't care.

279
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,880
So keep him in mind.

280
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,200
Keep on the grinning side.

281
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,300
Always on the grinning side.

282
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,940
Keep on the grinning side of Bob.

283
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,000
He may look friendly like your dad,

284
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,180
but you don't want to make him mad.

285
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,680
So keep on the grinning side of Bob.

286
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,340
Philo wrote that verse.

287
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:37,800
Yeah.

288
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,000
Well, you know,

289
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,480
those folks that want to do the Dr. Hal Art book,

290
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,660
maybe they should put the lyrics to your hymns

291
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,760
in there.

292
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,120
There's at least five of them.

293
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,280
Maybe.

294
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,260
Nobody ever sings those things.

295
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,980
But...

296
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,020
Oh, but we've seen two remixes of He's Bob.

297
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,060
That's true.

298
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,340
Somebody did make those.

299
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,620
I had them on my computer.

300
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,560
That is several computers ago.

301
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,380
I don't have them on my contemporary computer.

302
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I actually have all the audio that I've ever digitized

303
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,620
all on one gigantic 18 gigabyte hard drive now.

304
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,860
So I can pull up just about anything.

305
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,000
If it's got a decent file name.

306
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,660
Like for instance,

307
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,760
if I type in Hal,

308
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,680
it'll pull up everything that every file name that has your name on it.

309
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,040
Hmm.

310
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,960
Which would probably be hundreds.

311
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,340
Why is it so buzzy?

312
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,840
I can call up anything that has an X.

313
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,720
Of course,

314
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,620
that includes sex and a lot of other things.

315
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,040
Secret codes.

316
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,200
All that xylophone footage you have.

317
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,040
X dash,

318
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,940
X dash D.

319
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,840
Just to...

320
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,260
X D.

321
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,240
You never know how the file was named exactly for X day.

322
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,700
Sometimes you save time and leave out the dash.

323
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,580
A dash of this, a dash of that serves seven billion.

324
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,660
There you go.

325
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,740
Just a spoonful of punctuation helps the medicine go down.

326
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,680
More Dobstown Weekly whiff reader headlines.

327
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,360
Ivan Stang's secret recipe for imitation skyline chili.

328
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,460
Well, that's pretty funny.

329
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,100
Oh, boy.

330
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,560
A brown paper bag.

331
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,040
Yeah.

332
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,560
With a big M on it for Mason's Masonic.

333
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:25,980
How beautiful.

334
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,740
Thank you.

335
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Tainted frop stash endangers dozens, thrills even more.

336
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,220
Yes, we'll deal with that in a moment.

337
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,620
Paparazzi perplexed by Walter Kosmack's new fleet of anti-glamour drones.

338
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,880
I like the alliteration there.

339
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,480
Reverend P's greatest boner, Las Vegas actually shameful.

340
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,460
PMI.

341
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,160
Sexy swamp apes seeking sultry meetups.

342
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,840
Details inside.

343
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,740
You know, we had those back in Ohio.

344
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,640
The Loveland frogmen were a cryptid species that you had to worry about there.

345
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,180
Now we have the sexy swamp apes.

346
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,380
Oh, that's nothing like the Land O' Lakes frogmen.

347
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,140
Oh, no.

348
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,680
They, uh, they like the frog way.

349
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,500
We're being told to talk into the microphones.

350
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,440
Stage douche Argus Fox is instructing the...

351
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,120
performers to remember to articulate clearly into the microphones.

352
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,080
Reverend Stang, are you familiar with this, uh, publication, Mind Shaft?

353
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,380
Uh, no, I've heard, I've heard about it.

354
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,940
I haven't actually seen it.

355
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,340
It's what all the cartoonists are doing these days, and I'm in the next issue, the one that's coming out.

356
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,480
This one just came out.

357
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,500
Who's doing this?

358
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,340
Well, uh...

359
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,260
Contributors are Cromm, Christopher Mueller, Mary Flaner, Sophie Cromm.

360
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:46,980
Oh.

361
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,840
Uh, nepotism.

362
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,160
Sophie's got...

363
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,740
Dennis Kitchen, is he still alive?

364
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,020
He's still alive, and his drawings and cartoons look just like they always did.

365
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,500
Oh.

366
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,780
But, uh, we lost Jay Lynch and Skip Williamson.

367
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, oh, I didn't know Skip Williamson died.

368
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,380
Skip Williamson was so upset that Jay Lynch died that he died.

369
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,240
Oh.

370
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,400
Yeah.

371
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,500
Oh, like, like two old dogs that just can't live apart.

372
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,220
2015.

373
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,800
Mm-hmm.

374
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,120
It was sudden.

375
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,120
The fellow in the bright nightgown.

376
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,540
Sudden is not so bad.

377
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,420
I've heard.

378
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,800
I mean, I'm...

379
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,820
No, actually, I haven't heard.

380
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm just guessing.

381
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,420
Don't read Daniel.

382
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:39,720
Well, it says right here in the, uh, Dobstown Weekly whiff reader that Dr. Howell is...announced the new Universal Poet Laureate.

383
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:40,960
Yeah.

384
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,820
Well, it's gotta be true.

385
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,320
It's in print.

386
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,760
That news came out weeks ago.

387
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,960
That old...

388
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,280
Yeah, that's old, old news.

389
00:15:48,520 --> 00:16:01,160
And if you haven't got your copy of the Dobstown Weekly whiff reader, you can acquire yours from the Info Sex station over at that pretty turquoise building.

390
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,840
Anything to eat but one donut.

391
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,000
And get your free art supplies from the stage.

392
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,060
That's right.

393
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,080
Your bag of free art supplies is waiting for you.

394
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,220
It's cold.

395
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,080
It's alone.

396
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,020
It's crying.

397
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,020
It says...

398
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,380
Don't provide...

399
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,340
How come I don't have a mommy?

400
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:17,960
Or do this.

401
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,920
Well, you can be that bag of art supplies mommy right now.

402
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,840
Come to the stage, get your free bag of art supplies, and get a doodling.

403
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,240
It says tangy barbecue sauce, therefore it must be tangy barbecue sauce.

404
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,420
Well, friends, it's...

405
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,460
Ah, yes.

406
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,560
Welcome to our strike number 1,800 and...

407
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,020
Exactly.

408
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,140
That, uh, innumerate designation.

409
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,160
It's all the same stuff produced from the same spigot.

410
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:58,800
Once again, live at X Day, in a new location, Land O' Lakes, Florida, the Land O' Id nudist

411
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,160
resort.

412
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,120
I thought it was the Land of Fid.

413
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,000
Well, I guess you could change all the signs.

414
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,100
Change them to what?

415
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,260
Land of Fid.

416
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,280
Land of Fid.

417
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,400
Says Dr. Fid Shuley, who's joined us on this panel.

418
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,080
Well, he made such a sacrifice with his, um, the attack on his legs and feet the other

419
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,380
day.

420
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,360
He was so bloodied, he should have been in Fox's Book of Martyrs.

421
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,720
That's right.

422
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,480
You've injured yourself horribly and didn't even know how you did it, right?

423
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,220
Uh, that's true.

424
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
That is true.

425
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:33,840
Um...

426
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,520
It looked like a catamount or a wildcat had leapt on your bare legs and scratched and

427
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,580
marred them.

428
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,940
I actually, uh...

429
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,500
But you can't remember it.

430
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,600
I actually died yesterday.

431
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,460
Um...

432
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,280
I die every night.

433
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,140
It looked pretty bad.

434
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,100
But I was having such a good time, I figured I'd hang around a little bit.

435
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,020
Not to let a little thing like death keep me from a good party.

436
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,400
Maybe you actually did pass and sunk into the swamp, which revised you as it did Lon

437
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,060
Chaney in The Mummy's Curse.

438
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,800
Lon Chaney, Jr., that is.

439
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,560
That's right.

440
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,460
Yeah, the Mummy, the Universal Mummy, was last seen in Florida.

441
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,180
He went to the South, yes.

442
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,920
Not only that, he was hanging out with a woman named Aunt Bertha, played by Virginia Christine,

443
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,260
who was Mrs. Olsen in all the coffee commercials.

444
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,060
Oh, really?

445
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,660
Yes.

446
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,840
Oh, man, wait until Sternow hears that.

447
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,680
He's really hot for Mrs. Olsen.

448
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,320
She had a movie career in a bunch of movies where just when you're not expecting to see

449
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,260
the lady from the coffee commercials, she pops in.

450
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,540
Like in Billy the King.

451
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:36,680
Yeah.

452
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,120
Like in The Kid Meets Dracula, for example.

453
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,460
Was that the coffee commercials where she was horrified that her husband asked for a

454
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:44,880
second cup?

455
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,880
The husband is going to kill the wife or something because her coffee is so bad.

456
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,540
My husband hates my coffee.

457
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,960
Well, it's mountain grown in the face of...

458
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,500
He never asked for a second cup of my coffee.

459
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,920
And then there's a scene of the clock ticking in suspense as the hubby drinks the coffee

460
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,420
and the wife is a bundle of nerves as she waits.

461
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,240
And then the husband finally moos at her.

462
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,900
Honey, that's good coffee.

463
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,080
And she relaxes out of her kitchen.

464
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,980
No beating tonight.

465
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,540
Yes.

466
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,520
You won't have to go to the special room tonight, baby.

467
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,300
I had that experience last night.

468
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,980
That is to Mrs. Olsen and Folgers.

469
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:35,180
Dr. Fox usually never asked for a second helping of my frop, but last night somebody gave him

470
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,600
some frop and he wanted some more and I was taken by it.

471
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,300
I didn't know what to do with myself.

472
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,760
I was going to kill myself again.

473
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,360
Well, practice makes perfect.

474
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,920
Dr. Fox never asked for a second helping of my frop.

475
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,540
At X Day they give you hamburgers for breakfast.

476
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,380
Hey, you know what goes good with X Day breakfast?

477
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,580
Bloody Mary's.

478
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,640
There's some free Bloody Mary service happening right now.

479
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,560
General announcement, if you want to get your thang twisted into a spang.

480
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,560
But the sun ain't even high over the yardarm yet, matey.

481
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,120
When we gonna start boozing it up with Bloody Mary's?

482
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't know, maybe we are.

483
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,940
It's an exceptional set of circumstances.

484
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
An unusual holiday.

485
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,340
All the limitations kicked away.

486
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,340
Well, I'm gonna go acquire one for myself.

487
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,180
Because it's X Day.

488
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,260
This is it.

489
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,060
It better happen this year.

490
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,180
Who's with me? Come on.

491
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,240
Or else what, pilgrim?

492
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,420
Or else then I have to go home.

493
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,800
And then go back to work.

494
00:20:51,220 --> 00:21:00,200
Well, whether your home is a cardboard box on the street or a palace on board the X's saucers, you will be home.

495
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:09,240
I can't wait for tomorrow because Princess Wee told me that my two older dogs are pining for me.

496
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:19,300
So the first thing I'm gonna do about 7.05 is beam my dogs up and have them rejoin me and Princess Wee.

497
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,280
Be careful they're not reassembled at gigantic size.

498
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,640
They already have.

499
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,400
They already have grown to gigantic size.

500
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,780
But the...

501
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,940
Oh, I'm thinking of the puppies.

502
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,120
Professor Deamer's Puppies Formula.

503
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,360
They don't miss me. Puppies don't miss me.

504
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,040
Just the old dogs.

505
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:41,280
In fact, last night I missed some of the show because I was on FaceTime trying to console the dog.

506
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,500
It didn't work.

507
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,380
The dog didn't recognize my voice over Wee's phone.

508
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
It's all right, puppy. Just come over here near the phone.

509
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,400
My Face... No, it's a FaceTime call.

510
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,300
So they can see me too, but...

511
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,920
But they can't smell you and so they know it's fake.

512
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,440
Yeah.

513
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,880
Now my old...

514
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,000
Oldest...

515
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,700
Previous dog, Dammit.

516
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,140
We brought him to Cleveland.

517
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,820
Really? That was the name of Chicken's dog.

518
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,080
Yeah, I know.

519
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,480
My dad named Dammit, Dammit, though.

520
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,000
And...

521
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,380
Constantly heard his name called.

522
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,060
It was hard. It was embarrassing in crowds, you know.

523
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,720
Dammit, come.

524
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,180
People look at you funny.

525
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,520
I started calling him Buddy.

526
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,040
There are children here...

527
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,640
Then he died and then I got a dog named Buddy.

528
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,880
Already named Buddy.

529
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,300
Anyway, Dammit would...

530
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,700
When I went off to the radio station,

531
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,500
sometimes Princess Wee would stay home.

532
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,560
My... I was recording it at home and my voice was on the big speakers.

533
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,380
When my voice came on live, the dog would snap to attention.

534
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,520
And he recognized it.

535
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,440
He could...

536
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,860
But that was on, you know, good speakers.

537
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,080
It was live radio, not satellite, you know, iPhone tinny little sound.

538
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,800
Poor Claudia.

539
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,760
Still...

540
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,980
Still waiting by the window,

541
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,420
staring at the driveway,

542
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,680
waiting for Daddy to come back.

543
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,400
I miss... I miss those dogs.

544
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,320
You know, at the end of the world,

545
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,960
the things that are most important to you come to the forefront.

546
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,500
And I think in my case, it's the damn dogs.

547
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,860
You know, I'm not worried about my human family.

548
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,980
I'm worried about my doggies.

549
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,880
They don't know what's going on.

550
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,240
They're just idiots.

551
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,240
They're so innocent.

552
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,380
Unlike any humans that I know.

553
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,740
Man's commencement.

554
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,340
They're just a bunch of mental species.

555
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,240
Did you see that movie Alpha?

556
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,100
No, I didn't.

557
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,880
But that's not the one where they had a computer-generated dog.

558
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,340
No, no, that's Call of the Wild.

559
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:37,900
Oh, yeah.

560
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,760
They used a real dog in Alpha that looked very wolf-like.

561
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,680
Yeah, Call of the Wild.

562
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,700
It would be a very realistic dog, except that it acts too perfect.

563
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,920
It poses in shots like a real dog would never do.

564
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,580
There's no nipple slips, no accidents, nothing.

565
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,160
And dogs are all about those.

566
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,620
That gives it the uncanny valley.

567
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,860
Well, one out of eight.

568
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,880
Bad, real bad.

569
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,140
Otherwise, it's a good, it's a fun movie.

570
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,640
I heard it was a good version of the story.

571
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,720
Yeah, but if only somebody who didn't have a real dog would be fooled.

572
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,600
Yes.

573
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,220
As realistic as it is.

574
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,380
I mean.

575
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,100
It sure got hair down pretty well.

576
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,820
Well, hell, they can fake anything now.

577
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,900
You don't even need millions of dollars to do it.

578
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,580
It's a special effect.

579
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,300
You can stick your face onto anybody using a damn phone.

580
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,020
Well, Lassie and Rin Tin Tin, let's give them credit, could really act.

581
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,860
I could stick your face on Rin Tin Tin and vice versa.

582
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,620
Please don't.

583
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,020
Rin Tin Tin has been sleeping with his ancestors for years.

584
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,100
Surgically, we can do that tomorrow.

585
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,860
A ghastly match up.

586
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,840
I got the peanut butter.

587
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,900
If you can hold Hal down, I can scrape it on the inside of the roof of his mouth with a popsicle stick.

588
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:59,280
Peanut butter not good for humans of advanced age.

589
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,140
The peanut itself, not a nut, but a legume that grows on tree.

590
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,140
Same with the cashew.

591
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,320
Almonds are alright.

592
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,460
Um, let's see.

593
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,100
Well, I brought all this dope up here, so we're going to smoke it while we meander as we do.

594
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,500
Smoke that dope.

595
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,440
If it's a tiny little pipe, there's, I mean, you have to keep smoking to get it out.

596
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,500
I'll be interested to see if gift memberships will save people tomorrow.

597
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,900
For instance, my kids never spent the 35 bucks.

598
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,360
They're grownups now.

599
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,300
Well, they have the document and the...

600
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,620
I gave them membership packs.

601
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,500
One Christmas I gave everybody in the family membership packs.

602
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,920
But there's only one.

603
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,080
Only my niece.

604
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,760
Has ever actually bought one.

605
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,600
And she's a regular listener to our slaps.

606
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,600
She would know who you are and everything.

607
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,940
But what happens if you didn't buy your membership pack yourself, if somebody just gave it to you, are you saved?

608
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,540
If you don't give a shit, if you really don't even believe in Bob like my kids.

609
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,840
As long as somebody...

610
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,840
Well, that's not black in their name.

611
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,880
No doubt the exes will listen to these records as well.

612
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,720
They will know how thorough they are.

613
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:29,740
Of course, there is that transfer of documentation, but a similar change happens in the germplasm at that time.

614
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,360
As long as somebody...

615
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,240
Latent subgenius...

616
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,920
Paid for it.

617
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:45,960
Because that's one of the more insidious uses of the membership packet is you can ordain somebody else against their will just by paying for a membership packet.

618
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,920
Just like the Mormons.

619
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,120
They can betray you after you're dead.

620
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,840
Yeah.

621
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,940
Yeah, you can save your dead ancestors.

622
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,980
Just like the Mormons do.

623
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,840
And like Coca-Cola, which brings their beloved ancestors back from the dead.

624
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,240
Or you can just take somebody that you know hates the Church of the Subgenius, send them your $35...

625
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,860
I hate the Church of the Subgenius.

626
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,320
I hate it.

627
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:06,880
Guess what?

628
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,600
Oh, you do?

629
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,200
Well, you're in the Book of Life now.

630
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,260
How do you like that?

631
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,080
How does that taste?

632
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,100
Does his name appear in the Book of Life?

633
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,540
Well, I can't find him here, Lord.

634
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,860
Maybe it's spelled...

635
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,560
differently.

636
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:27,080
Then with sorrow I say unto you, into the eternal fire, prepared for Satan and his fallen angel buddies.

637
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:35,420
You had a chance when I sent that boring preacher to your door and you laughed at him and turned him away and embraced this guy with the pipe.

638
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,100
Just better hope Reverend Pease wasn't the one who wrote your name in the Book of Life.

639
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,940
The recording angel does that.

640
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,620
You know, how come it's huge and thick like a dictionary when everyone...

641
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:48,840
Yeah.

642
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,000
...in the last judgment is automatically guilty and it's all a show trial.

643
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,900
Whose names are in that there Book of Life?

644
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,460
Mostly Neanderthals.

645
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,860
Mark Twain wrote about Captain Stormfield's visit to heaven.

646
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,320
He went wrong and has traveled through space and first of all ended up in alien heaven.

647
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,660
But he finally ended up in human heaven and he found the whole place was overwhelmed by what he called engines,

648
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:25,280
which were Neanderthals, primitives, cavemen, pre-Adamic men.

649
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:32,500
You know, they outnumber everybody else and so with their tom-tom beating and so on they make heaven resound.

650
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,300
I wonder if River World owes Mark Twain an explanation.

651
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,980
They have him in there, don't they?

652
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,500
Did you ever see the thing that's based on it?

653
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:46,600
I did.

654
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,400
I had an opportunity to watch it on the plane, but I didn't want to.

655
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,620
I would have had to watch it silent.

656
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,000
Which?

657
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,420
Which?

658
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,220
The River World show or River World movie based on Philip King.

659
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,880
I did see the River World movie.

660
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,400
Jose Flamen.

661
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,640
It sucked and on top of that they didn't show everybody naked.

662
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,100
Oh, that's terrible.

663
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:09,180
I especially wanted to see Alice Blesent's Liddell naked and having sex like in the story.

664
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,020
No, no.

665
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,120
It was a TV movie so it was lame.

666
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,020
Oh, well.

667
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,740
Made for TV, that says it all.

668
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,560
Say no more.

669
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,200
Say no more.

670
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,740
Yeah, very little relation to the book.

671
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,020
I mean, really.

672
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,860
There's a problem here about COVID and everything and putting our lips on this thing.

673
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,700
Do you have one of these?

674
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,480
I've got one.

675
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,100
Don't worry.

676
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,800
I'm fine.

677
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,620
Okay, great.

678
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,080
You know, I'm at work.

679
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,000
I don't frop at work.

680
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,920
Everybody's drinking on the job.

681
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,240
Really?

682
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,620
Well, you're shaming me.

683
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,580
But on the other hand.

684
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:55,800
Oh, actually, I used to back before 9-11, when you could open the radio station windows.

685
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,840
After 9-11, they locked everything up.

686
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,020
Total lockdown was as bad as COVID and no more fropping in the stations.

687
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,240
After COVID, they locked the station itself so no one could go in.

688
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,540
Right.

689
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,060
And then there was no stations.

690
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,100
But that worked out fine for me.

691
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,720
I was already locked out of work.

692
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,420
I didn't have any stations.

693
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,520
Doing it from home.

694
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:24,760
And I managed to get the stations to accept MP3 downloads so I didn't have to mail them

695
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,820
CDs anymore, which was expensive.

696
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,740
And most of them weren't paying anyway.

697
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,900
But it's free advertising.

698
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:39,500
The great thing about real radio as opposed to podcasts is somebody can hear it by accident,

699
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,060
just driving along in your car, putting it on scan.

700
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,860
And suddenly they'll hear this crazy stuff.

701
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,180
And that's really fun to think of.

702
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,220
And I've heard examples of that.

703
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,480
I've also heard it happening in reverse.

704
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,660
Thank you.

705
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:02,380
This one woman, she was actually the station manager at the Dallas station.

706
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,140
She was driving back from Austin.

707
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,320
And it was 9 o'clock Sunday.

708
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,240
And she thought, well, I'll listen to the hour of slack.

709
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,220
She turned on the radio.

710
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,160
But she wasn't anywhere near Dallas.

711
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,500
And she thought she was listening to my show for about half an hour before she realized

712
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,740
she had it tuned between a rock station and a preacher station.

713
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,680
A rock station in a hard place.

714
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,800
She was hearing rock music with idiot preachers and figured that was hour of slack.

715
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,560
So it's easy.

716
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,900
Yeah, I used to do the same thing with scrambled porn.

717
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,020
See, anybody can do the hour of slack.

718
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:39,020
You just got to pick what kind of stations to put the needle between so you hear both

719
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,480
of them back and forth.

720
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,740
Quick Watson, the needle.

721
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,720
Hey, bees.

722
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,960
Why don't you come up here and occupy this mic so I can procure for myself a-

723
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:49,980
You can go occupy.

724
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,320
Occupy X Day.

725
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,540
I'm going to go occupy a Bloody Mary.

726
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,300
Occupy X Day.

727
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,240
Or be occupied.

728
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,200
That's funny.

729
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,040
Hey, do you scratch these things or do you peel them off in the front?

730
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:09,020
We could start a new subversive movement called anti-pie for anti-pink.

731
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,000
Anti-pie.

732
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,720
Anti-pie.

733
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:11,720


734
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:11,900
Anti-pie.

735
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,120
Well, they should know that we're anti-pink.

736
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,360
Wow, look.

737
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,580
Ice cold water.

738
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:30,340
Dr. Pease has been real careful about making sure people hydrate, especially when he sees

739
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,100
somebody stumbling along about to pass out.

740
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,320
Go follow along behind him.

741
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,080
Drink this.

742
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,580
Drink this.

743
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,220
Drink this.

744
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:37,740
Don't drink that.

745
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,200
Drink this.

746
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,200


747
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,740
Dr. Without a taste of water.

748
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,100
Cool water.

749
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,020
Water, water, water.

750
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,980
Keep a-movin' Dan, don't you listen to him, Dan.

751
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,760
He's a devil, not a man, and he spreads the burning sand with water.

752
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,060
Water, water, water.

753
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,440
Dan, don't you see there's a big green tree with the water running free, and there's water

754
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,920
running there for me and you.

755
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,480
you.

756
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,520
To

757
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,500
the shadows sway

758
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,260
and seem to say

759
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,320
tonight we'll pray

760
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,560
for water.

761
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,400
Cool

762
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,680
water.

763
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,520
And way up there

764
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,180
he'll hear our prayer

765
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,240
and show us

766
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,160
where there's

767
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,740
water.

768
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:32,600
Clear

769
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,260
cool

770
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,160
water.

771
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,840
Water.

772
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,860
Sons of the

773
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,940
Pioneers was the version I grew up with.

774
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,080
Yeah.

775
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,680
The hearing

776
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,800
aids are constantly shorting

777
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,620
out from sweat running into them.

778
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,760
So I put this umbrella made of

779
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,880
McDonald's napkin over my

780
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,020
left one. Speaking of McDonald's, there seems to be

781
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,880
an extra bacon

782
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,340
mix something here.

783
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,400
I feel foolish.

784
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,400
You can have that.

785
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,520
I'll have it alright.

786
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,780
Alright. Or you can save it for later.

787
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,300
There is no later.

788
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,600
I'll put some of this

789
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,740
I feel foolish because I saw you with the

790
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,800
napkin on your ear.

791
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,940
Time is

792
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,160
running out.

793
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,980
So it's a fabulous day here next day.

794
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,080
But there is no July 5th in

795
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,660
this building.

796
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,160
Yes, that's going to be a problem.

797
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,440
I can't believe

798
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,100
this. Look at my arm.

799
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,500
Insect. More water coming out of my arm.

800
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,420
There's a lot of meat in there, isn't there?

801
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,380
Yeah, it's going to happen.

802
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,720
That's why if you smoke frop like me,

803
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,680
you find your temperature was regulated.

804
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,280
Perhaps you've reached your

805
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,040
saturation level. I used to get

806
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,560
in Arizona when it was super hot.

807
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,480
I found if I smoked some pond ice.

808
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,320
Where did peas come from?

809
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,260
Suddenly peas are sitting next to me.

810
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,420
It's horrible. It's an X-Day

811
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:57,740
miracle.

812
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,500
The X-Day miracle for me was

813
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,440
the rain of prairie squid from the sky

814
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,880
yesterday.

815
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,240
God, that was so fun.

816
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,280
It was the torrential

817
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,200
rain and suddenly there were these

818
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800
flopping, stinking

819
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,380
prairie squid.

820
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,540
Only they were

821
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,700
wet.

822
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,440
They actually weren't prairie squid.

823
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,040
Raymond Burr in his wheelchair. People were calling them walking

824
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,280
catfish. They were making their

825
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,320
way to the pool and we had to put

826
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,380
a stop to it. They were coming out

827
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,960
of the pond trying to get to the pool

828
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,420
because they wanted cool

829
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,360
clear water. They weren't

830
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,300
reckoning on the pouring.

831
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,940
Which I think would be bad for them.

832
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,360
In fact, I saved

833
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,300
one from poisoning. I saw you

834
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,160
with that net. I hope they got out of the house.

835
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,500
He resisted your attempts to save him

836
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,600
much like many of the subgeniuses.

837
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,860
Just like, well yeah.

838
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,460
I guess that was a pink walking catfish.

839
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,360
Inside. He didn't

840
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,100
want to be saved.

841
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,220
I don't need any more friends.

842
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,340
He really remembered that one, didn't he?

843
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,140
Yeah, he did. It was a wonderful

844
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,500
tale. Well, it's typical subgenius.

845
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,300
You know, it's like you don't want to go to some

846
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,680
party and meet new people.

847
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,180
Well, I think that's a thing.

848
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,320
We've all experienced that feeling

849
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,100
and probably all done the exact

850
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,040
same thing. You've got a friend that says,

851
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,300
hey, I know this guy. You're really going to

852
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,960
like him. He's so awesome. And you're like,

853
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,300
fuck, leave me alone. I've got all the friends

854
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,760
I need.

855
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,060
Well, what convinced me to go meet

856
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,080
the Drummond family was that my

857
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,140
sister-in-law said, well,

858
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,280
he's really into Captain Beefheart

859
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,660
and he collects comic books.

860
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,440
Of course, now that describes about half

861
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,960
the subgeniuses, but then

862
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,100
in 1976,

863
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,380
I didn't know anybody like

864
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,100
that. It's like, well, okay.

865
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,020
We go over to this

866
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,580
suburban house and there's

867
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,280
Philo Drummond and he

868
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,940
looks just as pink as

869
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,860
a newborn babe

870
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,880
with this corporate haircut

871
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,780
and a sportcaster mustache

872
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,920
and he's playing darts.

873
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,240
I said, no, he's a

874
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,280
jock. And he brings me over

875
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,620
and he says, here, throw some darts.

876
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,320
Let's throw some darts while those women

877
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,520
talk. And I go, I don't

878
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,920
know. I've never thrown darts.

879
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,320
I don't know anything about this. He goes, go ahead and try.

880
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,540
So I half-heartedly give it a try.

881
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,260
Bullseye! Right

882
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,980
dead center, my first try.

883
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,500
Total beginner's luck. Philo's

884
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,360
thinking, if you don't care, you'll hit

885
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,600
the target. That shark,

886
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,440
he's like a card shark. He's an expert

887
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,420
at darts and he convinced me that he's

888
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,060
a nervous amateur.

889
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,600
So we

890
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,520
both were suspicious from the

891
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,640
get-go. But then, he said,

892
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,400
hey, I found something cool the other day.

893
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,460
And he brought it out and it was like a chip track

894
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,280
or a John Birch Society

895
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,360
pamphlet. Something like that.

896
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,560
And I was like, wow.

897
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,460
He really, he's interested in the

898
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,200
same fucked up shit that I am.

899
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,500
And next thing we

900
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,340
knew, we were, he was

901
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,480
telling me about this

902
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,400
special person

903
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,420
that I had.

904
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,460
And I normally would have fled at that point

905
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,840
when he started telling me about Bob.

906
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,780
But he had such good frop.

907
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,780
That was the other thing.

908
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,440
That was the thing my sister-in-law

909
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,280
should have told me.

910
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,980
He's got real good frop.

911
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,020
I didn't even know what frop was then.

912
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,000
So it wouldn't have helped much.

913
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,540
But he gave me this stuff.

914
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,420
I guess I thought it was marijuana at the time.

915
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,000
So I tried it for the first time.

916
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,040
Well, that's all it takes.

917
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,440
One hit, you're done.

918
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,420
You're going to be high the rest of your life.

919
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,200
You don't ever need another hit.

920
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,140
Oddly enough, I see people just keep

921
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,920
coming back for more all day long

922
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
the rest of their lives.

923
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,900
Even though you don't get any higher generally.

924
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,340
You're kind of stuck

925
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,960
in one level of extremely

926
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,360
high all the time. Consistently.

927
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,140
Too high.

928
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,380
And the rest

929
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,340
as they say. But look at me. I'm fine.

930
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,000
Aside from my backbone

931
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,100
and my memory and my eyesight

932
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,780
and hearing.

933
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,120
I have a picture of health.

934
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,440
My lungs, allergies,

935
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,620
hospital visits.

936
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,820
Memory problems. You say you have memory problems?

937
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,020
You remember the money you owe me, right?

938
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,860
No, it's the money you owe me.

939
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,780
You see, that's the...

940
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,220
Yeah, there are some memories.

941
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,760
Some things are not lost in memory.

942
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,020
The exes have those

943
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,920
memories and we'll get them back tomorrow.

944
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,500
We'll get them back tomorrow.

945
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,480
Alright, that sounds fair.

946
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
I'll see you on the saucer, mister.

947
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,540
In the home. In the casino.

948
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,520
All debts will be paid.

949
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,460
Speaking of the saucer, you have a

950
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,180
especially exquisite

951
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,080
saucer plan for yourself with many

952
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,780
national monuments and

953
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,460
tchotchkes if I'm not mistaken.

954
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,320
Right, I've just got to beat legume to them.

955
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,160
Well, hasn't he got a head start?

956
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,320
Yeah, but

957
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,180
I guess the official chase

958
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,940
doesn't start until 7am.

959
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,260
Oh, okay. That's good. But he does have a head start.

960
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,960
Yeah. And he knows

961
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,040
exactly what I want the most. And he's a

962
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,060
devil. He's a devil.

963
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,520
In the end, he'll let me have him back

964
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,400
but he'll have to... I'll have to fight

965
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
him for him. They'll be on his ship at first.

966
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,780
Yeah, I know how he is.

967
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,480
You'll have to trade it for something.

968
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,640
Yeah, like my memory.

969
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,000
Sacred nose hairs, maybe

970
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,320
a strand of the sacred ponytail.

971
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,400
All of these will be

972
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,620
the currency of the future.

973
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,380
Relics left here on this

974
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,520
burning hulk of an earth.

975
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,380
I thought you'd forgotten

976
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,140
about the ponytail.

977
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,560
No, no. Circling back.

978
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,860
Circling back. He's jealous.

979
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,640
That's what makes it funny.

980
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,720
You circle back.

981
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,420
He used to be big.

982
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,920
I'm going to tell you something.

983
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,400
That is going to make the most fabulous keychain for me.

984
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,380
I mean, people are going to see

985
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,060
that. It's hanging out of my pocket.

986
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,220
You mean not on your belt?

987
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,040
You can have it. I'm going to

988
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,500
have a whole new body

989
00:40:59,500 --> 00:40:59,840
tomorrow.

990
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,420
Now, I'm going to go for a robot body.

991
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,160
But I'm going to have an extra arm

992
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,360
for doing stuff when I'm doing stuff

993
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,480
with my regular arms.

994
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,020
I know what you mean.

995
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,860
You just need one right hand.

996
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,320
It only has to do one thing.

997
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,740
It's a pleasure saucer, by definition.

998
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,100
So you're going to need that extra arm.

999
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,180
Now, don't be foolish and just

1000
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,140
get the arm. Order the hand

1001
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,620
option.

1002
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,380
Yeah, it needs a wrist. It needs a flexible wrist.

1003
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,380
If you don't have the hand option,

1004
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,480
it's kind of a waste of time.

1005
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,380
Take the claw! Take the claw!

1006
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,520
You get calluses.

1007
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,600
Or you just get calluses.

1008
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,480
After a while, everything

1009
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,200
loses sensitivity.

1010
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,060
I know how that is. Take my word for it.

1011
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,440
He's right.

1012
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,220
Some people

1013
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,300
say they're just going to keep their regular

1014
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,360
old body. Ragnar, among

1015
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,060
others, strangely enough.

1016
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,880
Yes. Well, have you

1017
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,000
seen his body?

1018
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,880
I've seen every bit of Ragnar's body.

1019
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,200
What did he do to it?

1020
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,920
He's a very large,

1021
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,040
very pink

1022
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,180
colored fellow.

1023
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,920
He's a large sized

1024
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,280
subgenius. His skin

1025
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,180
looks like it has never seen the sun.

1026
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,860
He'd come to X Day and

1027
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,260
sunburn himself horribly in the

1028
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,000
first hour.

1029
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,040
Easy enough to do.

1030
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,540
Invariably, he'd set up his tent

1031
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,320
ineptly and it would

1032
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,240
rain and soak everything, including

1033
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,040
his brand new video cameras.

1034
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,980
So forth.

1035
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,260
Then he'd be sure that somebody else

1036
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,080
had sabotaged it. Why did Bob

1037
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,260
pick on me? I just wanted

1038
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,520
to come here and have fun.

1039
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,180
Well, Bob didn't, but some of his followers did.

1040
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,440
Ragnar quit coming to X Day,

1041
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,220
but I kind of miss him.

1042
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,220
He was such a regular

1043
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,000
and he was kind of a...

1044
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,000
I don't know. He had

1045
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,160
served one of the functions of peace

1046
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,040
as a punching bag.

1047
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,380
He was an acolyte. A classic

1048
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:02,760
acolyte.

1049
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,500
Like a vampire is familiar.

1050
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,980
I was sitting there one X Day

1051
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,320
and looked around and, oh no, Ragnar's here.

1052
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,480
Oh no, here comes Ragnar.

1053
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,340
He goes, Stang, I've got something for you.

1054
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,460
He handed me $1,000 in cash.

1055
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,020
Yeah, he had something for you.

1056
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,780
That he had saved up from his

1057
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,960
Pizza Hut delivery

1058
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,260
job. And he gave me a whole

1059
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,020
bunch of Pizza Hut plastic red

1060
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,320
glasses, which turned out to be

1061
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,840
my very favorite drinking glasses. These are great glasses.

1062
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,220
I look for those things. I steal them

1063
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,220
when I go to Pizza Hut. Those were more valuable to me than

1064
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,860
$1,000. But at that point,

1065
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,220
I changed my mind about him

1066
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,500
instantly. I said, Ragnar,

1067
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,500
it wouldn't be the same without you at X Day.

1068
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,960
I really meant it.

1069
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,380
I was thinking, well, maybe he'll bring another $1,000

1070
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,400
next year. He ended up

1071
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,020
running for governor of Kentucky.

1072
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,480
And I think he got

1073
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,380
23 votes.

1074
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,840
That's a magical number, as you know.

1075
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,120
His plan was to

1076
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,380
solve the

1077
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,680
war problems by

1078
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,420
sending out robots

1079
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:03,580
and

1080
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:03,580


1081
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:03,580


1082
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:03,580


1083
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:03,580


1084
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,940
I bought dog mule soldiers

1085
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,720
instead of human soldiers.

1086
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,500
And I said, wouldn't that be kind of expensive?

1087
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,520
How would the army pay for that?

1088
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,600
And he said, with legalized

1089
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,560
froth, of course.

1090
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,900
It's like, oh, well, okay.

1091
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,880
He's going to get all the votes.

1092
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,720
And he got all 23.

1093
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,940
He got the Discordian vote, I guess.

1094
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:33,980
But 273 is common.

1095
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,080
It comes up every 23 times.

1096
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,880
273 is much more rare.

1097
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,680
Now, 1303,

1098
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,680
13013,

1099
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
that's really

1100
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,360
the most sacred number.

1101
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,000
Thank you.

1102
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,160
Well, but that's a different

1103
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,780
type of number.

1104
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,240
999 is a good one.

1105
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,100
That was actually the number of the anti-Bob.

1106
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,880
I think the most sacred number, though,

1107
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,560
is 35.

1108
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,280
35

1109
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,840
measly dollars.

1110
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,980
About $29.99.

1111
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,440
We've got to raise it, man.

1112
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,480
It's been $35 for 20 years

1113
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,440
or something. I think we're going to suddenly

1114
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,900
raise it. $35.50.

1115
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,380
It should have been

1116
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,580
$33,

1117
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,460
but now we've gone past that.

1118
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,160
But maybe that'll include postage,

1119
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,240
unless it's overseas.

1120
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,500
It costs $26 to send a membership pack

1121
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,600
to England,

1122
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,240
and $22 to send one

1123
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,160
to Canada or Mexico.

1124
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,420
Not that anyone's

1125
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,960
ever ordered one from Mexico.

1126
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,520
I think we had two members.

1127
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,700
Well, you know, it may cost more

1128
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,080
if they succeed in

1129
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,160
describing the post office.

1130
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,800
They put a little starburst on the cover.

1131
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,640
It says, still only $0.35.

1132
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,860
Oh, I remember still only $0.10.

1133
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,820
Still only $0.12.

1134
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,660
Still only $0.20.

1135
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,320
When it hit still only $0.50

1136
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,240
and it was half ads,

1137
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,840
I quit buying comic books.

1138
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,180
Also, I had a kid to support.

1139
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,260
And read old comics.

1140
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,980
The price of the comic books

1141
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,940
outpaced the

1142
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,380
normal allotment of ducats

1143
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,760
and dollars that a young child might have.

1144
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,980
So you'd start out

1145
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,380
getting 10 or 12 books,

1146
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,480
and then they'd raise the price

1147
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,180
and you'd get down to $0.07 or $0.08.

1148
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,640
And then, like you said, when it was $0.50,

1149
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,660
well, Jesus, that's half my allowance

1150
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,400
for this week.

1151
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,580
No, I was 18 when it hit $0.50.

1152
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,160
Well, now that those

1153
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,200
children are adults,

1154
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,220
they find that the same comic books

1155
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,160
are still economically

1156
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,380
out of their reach.

1157
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,680
Having gained a bloated value.

1158
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,780
Well, here's the funny thing, now.

1159
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,260
All those $0.50 and dollar comics

1160
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:42,680
from the

1161
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,480
70s and 80s,

1162
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,780
my wife inherited from a collector.

1163
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,080
Jeff Rosenbaum,

1164
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,780
who started Starwood,

1165
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,700
was a crazy

1166
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,080
comic book collector also.

1167
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,620
He had Marvels and DCs

1168
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,340
of

1169
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,420
everything from the 70s and 80s,

1170
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,120
and he kept them really nicely in these

1171
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,260
plastic and these big

1172
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,400
comic book boxes. He had a room

1173
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,260
full of them. There's a room full of them in Cleveland.

1174
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,160
I managed to grab

1175
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,480
two boxes at random and take to Texas.

1176
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,500
That's one reason my back is destroyed.

1177
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,000
Those boxes were

1178
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,480
extremely heavy, and it was the last day

1179
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,320
before we left. It was like there was just

1180
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,340
enough room left in the car to get

1181
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,540
some comic books in. Have you looked in the

1182
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,520
box yet? Oh, the box?

1183
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,320
We managed to get the box into the house,

1184
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,300
and I even read a whole bunch of the

1185
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,480
Batman stuff. I hope they were good.

1186
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,400
They were, but they're

1187
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,840
still there, and

1188
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,720
they were jointly

1189
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,720
inherited by my wife and my neighbor

1190
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,660
Joe, but Joe doesn't care about them.

1191
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,560
I don't know how

1192
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,520
we're ever going to get them back to Texas, though.

1193
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,220
That's literally

1194
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,580
tons and tons of

1195
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,580
comics, none of which are worth very much.

1196
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,560
Well, ship them at a low rate.

1197
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,520
A low book rate or something.

1198
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,360
Hey, look at this.

1199
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,920
All right.

1200
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,360
How many? I still haven't

1201
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,740
scratched the one you gave me.

1202
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,100
Three more dollars. I've cleared

1203
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,420
40 bucks now. Well, I had

1204
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,320
30 to start with, and I've gotten

1205
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,160
another 10 bucks worth of these things.

1206
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:14,780
Excellent.

1207
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,700
I'm going to eat out tonight.

1208
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,520
The luck plane is tilting in your direction,

1209
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,240
Ivan Stang.

1210
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,580
It doesn't happen every day.

1211
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,560
It's $10 in payouts.

1212
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,040
What about tripler lottery cards?

1213
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,820
They're already rubbed.

1214
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,580
That's how much one would have to pay.

1215
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,140
You don't rub it again.

1216
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,200
I'm about to rub

1217
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,400
one of them

1218
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:38,900
myself.

1219
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,960
This is exciting.

1220
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,920
That's an excellent scratching technique,

1221
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,500
Dr. Howell. It seems efficient

1222
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,300
and yet

1223
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:49,700
adventurous.

1224
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,540
Well, actually, whenever I have

1225
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,400
an opportunity to scratch something

1226
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,280
like this, which I find

1227
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,520
irritating and unnecessary.

1228
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,540
I actually use a little metal picture

1229
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,360
of Bob that is

1230
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,620
the perfect scratcher.

1231
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,620
But I don't have that with me.

1232
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,380
I hope it doesn't hurt

1233
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,320
the luck involved. It's made at

1234
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,320
Tucson Trade Engraving and

1235
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,160
it's engraved on metal and it's

1236
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,000
a reverse image of Bob.

1237
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,580
I just put these things

1238
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,440
I tuck them into my dog's ear

1239
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,520
and then he scratches them with his hind leg

1240
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,460
and let the dog do it.

1241
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,400
Boy, those German Shepherd puppies

1242
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,160
have turned out to be a bit of a terror

1243
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,200
in that they

1244
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,280
they're right at the age where they want to

1245
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,820
see what

1246
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,460
things taste like, especially if they've been

1247
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,420
handled by me. They seem to

1248
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,000
know it for a long time that

1249
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,360
stuff on the floor was fair game

1250
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,360
but things on shelves were

1251
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,260
daddy stuff, don't mess with them.

1252
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,080
But then they got more adventurous

1253
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,360
and they tasted several

1254
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,540
video game

1255
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:55,940
controllers.

1256
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,900
They really like those.

1257
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,300
How old are the pups now?

1258
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,880
They're about seven months now.

1259
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,840
So they're going through

1260
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,540
secondary teething right now.

1261
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,700
And I would get a wash rag and

1262
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,280
get it wet and put it in the freezer

1263
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,660
and give them that to chew.

1264
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,300
Because they're looking around for things to chew now

1265
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,900
because it relieves

1266
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,600
they cause a massacration.

1267
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,360
I know they've got tons of stuff to chew.

1268
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,740
My house is covered with dog toys

1269
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,020
and cat toys and stuff.

1270
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,780
And we give them new ones all the time.

1271
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,360
But you know,

1272
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,700
they want a taste of furniture.

1273
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,080
The fossils.

1274
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,480
Yeah, actually I did want to.

1275
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,600
You wouldn't think a dog would give a hoot about a fossil.

1276
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,600
I wouldn't.

1277
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,140
Daddy's been playing with them.

1278
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,320
German Shepherds are great dogs and they're so inquisitive

1279
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,080
and so intelligent and

1280
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,540
you're just going to have a whole awesome time up ahead of you.

1281
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,800
Especially as they mature a little bit

1282
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,100
and they take on their shepherd personas.

1283
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:54,180
Well a good dog or a good cat will teach you

1284
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,340
why you want a dog or a cat in the world.

1285
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:56,940
In the first place.

1286
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,580
Because they're so sympathetic and empathetic

1287
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,500
and they're far more than you ever believed possible.

1288
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,040
And so from then on you want every dog and cat

1289
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,960
to hit that high standard.

1290
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,680
And they often don't.

1291
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,320
Well, those dogs are going to have some real treats

1292
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,760
waiting for them tomorrow morning.

1293
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,900
Very good.

1294
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,820
Now you'll circle back to get everybody at the ranch, right?

1295
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,160
That's what I said.

1296
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,940
The first thing I'm going to do, 7-05, is get them.

1297
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,320
Yeah. Because they're going to be here for a while. Yeah.

1298
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,340
They're pining for me.

1299
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,540
Princess Wee said that Claudia's just going,

1300
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,620
she just stares out the window waiting.

1301
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,700
I tried to talk to her on FaceTime yesterday

1302
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,740
but it didn't work.

1303
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,180
So yeah, first thing I'm going to do is beam up my lonesome dogs

1304
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,640
and give them something to play with.

1305
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,160
And then we?

1306
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,820
Yeah, and then my wife.

1307
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,980
And then I'll see if my kids,

1308
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,740
I want to just see if my kids automatically get beamed up

1309
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,640
or if their faithlessness leaves them down there.

1310
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,320
But just for the sake of it,

1311
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,380
for the sake of my grandkids,

1312
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,020
I'll go ahead and probably beam up the whole gang.

1313
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,800
Well, you're a better man than me

1314
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,840
because I was going to go, you know,

1315
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,940
tool around a little bit to get the feel of the saucer

1316
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,500
before I went back to get carrots.

1317
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,260
You won't have to.

1318
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,420
You don't think so?

1319
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,600
No, everything will be automatic.

1320
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:12,220
Oh.

1321
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,060
Everything will be automatic.

1322
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,200
You couldn't go anywhere on it in an instant.

1323
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,500
One will know before you think of it what you want.

1324
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,340
Or as you're thinking of it, it will pick up on it.

1325
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,480
I always want to say, she.

1326
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,680
Just like the government.

1327
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
Yeah, kind of.

1328
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,840
Well, that's not the problem with it, you know.

1329
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,980
After a while you're going, no, this is too perfect.

1330
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:34,840
I'm freaking out.

1331
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,760
That's the phase we don't tell everybody about.

1332
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,660
All I want is a thought to myself in my own mind.

1333
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,360
Do you want to know the secret of how to deal with that?

1334
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,940
It's a very important secret.

1335
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,540
What's that, Dr. Howe?

1336
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,800
The secret is that you also put a spell on yourself

1337
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,120
so that you don't know

1338
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,180
all these things you arranged are going to happen to you

1339
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,260
and you can just think you're very lucky and so on.

1340
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,780
Every now and then you get a reminder.

1341
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,120
But in your case, you see,

1342
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,980
you don't let yourself know that everything is perfect.

1343
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:13,420
Now that is a brilliant tip from the keeper of the mystic secrets

1344
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:13,920
of the Church of the Subchangest.

1345
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,740
That's why everybody goes wrong who makes a deal with the devil or whatever

1346
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,760
because you cannot take satisfaction

1347
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,280
when you know the game is rigged in your favor.

1348
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,620
So first you rig it in your favor

1349
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,680
and then you create limited oblivion for yourself

1350
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:35,900
so you can enjoy it as if it's your actual just desserts.

1351
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,840
And you forget that you sold your soul.

1352
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,860
Yes, which is also good because you don't fret about it all the time.

1353
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,120
That takes it off your mind.

1354
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,600
You can worry about that later

1355
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,020
when the devil takes you to hell for eternity.

1356
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,500
He rises up through the floor at an inconvenient time

1357
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,120
and holds the document and reminds you and so forth.

1358
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,220
And you have to beg and wheedle for a little more time.

1359
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,260
I know they say hell's going to be bad,

1360
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,580
but what if it's not?

1361
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,600
What if it's like super awesome and all your friends are there?

1362
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,820
I'm glad I'm not involved in any of that stuff

1363
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,560
because I'll be on the pleasure saucer.

1364
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,500
But I wonder about all the other people.

1365
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,640
Jack T. Chick denies it.

1366
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,980
However, isn't it part of the subgenius lore

1367
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:27,800
that the Christian heaven is subgenius hell or something like that?

1368
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,500
You have to have subgenius hell as practice for subgenius heaven.

1369
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,040
They're both fun, but subgenius heaven is so fun

1370
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,820
you'd lose your mind if you didn't go through boot camp.

1371
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,860
You tend to lose your mind anyway.

1372
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,060
You have to be able to live with yourself forever.

1373
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,960
The slightest flaw becomes a sin.

1374
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,120
You're a child of an infinite size.

1375
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,780
So you've got to watch out for that.

1376
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,320
Only the part that is worthy of moving on to the next dimension or whatever.

1377
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,400
Look at that. The thing that's supposed to protect my hearing aid is soaked.

1378
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:08,740
Soaked.

1379
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,300
I'd have to put a new napkin up there every 10 minutes.

1380
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,840
Do you want a new napkin? I believe I might have one.

1381
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,260
Yeah.

1382
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,320
I'll get one.

1383
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,260
I need to finish this bottle of water

1384
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,960
so that I'll have something to catch the soap.

1385
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,200
I'm sweating.

1386
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,640
I can refill it in about 5 minutes.

1387
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,120
I do like to remind people to please stay hydrated.

1388
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,180
You've got to drink some water today.

1389
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:33,560
We have a lot of fabulous barley beverages

1390
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:38,140
that were donated by the Orange Blossom Beer Company.

1391
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,400
They're fabulous. We've got them ice cold for you.

1392
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,640
We want you to enjoy them, but we also want to make sure

1393
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,280
that everybody has a good time. So drink some water.

1394
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,960
Ironically, friends, good old Pease himself neglected to drink enough water.

1395
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,340
Even though he remembered to drink enough beer.

1396
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,160
And by the afternoon of July 5th, he was really messed up.

1397
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,600
But then, what subgenius wasn't?

1398
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,040
Which leads us to our closing song by the Swingin' Love Corpses,

1399
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,740
a personal fave called TFBAB Bummer,

1400
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,660
which stands for Total Fucking Badass Bummer.

1401
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,980
The version heard by the internet audience will vary greatly

1402
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,940
from that heard by our beloved broadcast radio listeners.

1403
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:28,580
Afterwards, you must always learn everything from subgenius.com.

1413
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,840
It's a total fucking big ass bummer, man!

1414
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,760
My dog got run over!

1415
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,800
Bummer!

1416
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,500
P-A-B!

1417
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,500
Bummer!

1418
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,800
Garbage is getting early,

1419
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,000
we're getting in the garbage house!

1420
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:16,760
Bummer!

1421
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,580
It's a bummer!

1422
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,900
80,000 people died in an earthquake in China!

1423
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:26,780
Bummer!

1424
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,460
Total fucking bummer!

1425
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,660
It's a bummer!

1426
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,580
There was a guy in California

1427
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,180
that couldn't get his nut one night.

1428
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,660
Bummer!

1429
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:38,580
Bummer!

1430
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,340
Total fucking bummer!

1431
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,340
The guy in California was with his best girlfriend

1432
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,140
and he didn't get his nut.

1433
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:48,580
Bummer!

1434
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:48,980
Real bummer!

1435
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:48,980


1436
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,200
Bummer!

1437
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,920
I burned my finger the other day!

1438
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:57,280
Bummer!

1439
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,940
Fucking bummer!

1440
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,600
I had to tear my band-aid off!

1441
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:10,800
Bummer!

1442
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,300
Real bummer!

1443
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:14,960
Bummer!

1444
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Trillion dollar deficit!

1445
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,780
Bummer!

1446
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,200
Bummer!

1447
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:23,180
