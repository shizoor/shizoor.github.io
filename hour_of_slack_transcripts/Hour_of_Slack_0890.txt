There will be no subcutaneous violence here tonight.
In the halls of separation where all of the among us have met.
There are so many here.
I can see their faces gleaming in the dark as if they were wearing their own hats.
And I can just see my fingers passing very, very lightly over these pages.
And I don't look good, Bob.
This show is in Braille tonight.
So we went up the hill to the church that the overman had built.
Under conditions of extreme physical hardship and sleep deprivation.
Yes, it was an exquisite little building on the side of the cliff overlooking the overman.


Only to be shot down by the slug.
And its deadly disintegrator beam.
Egg heads, egg heads, new egg heads came up with new kinds of devices.
So, we witnessed raising up of the egg heads.
Now please have your dream world arranged as you enter the show.
And casting your dream world.
And paying yourself.

experience i can hear the song the polished am still hear it back there
theme with the ball can you still hear the song back there
or has the song died as a song was a song carried out of the bomb shelter
looking blue with an oxygen mask over its face and maybe one of its sons is dead
yes this could be you shuttling from universe to universe with a big happy sleepy goofy looking
grin on your face transcending the limits of the astral plane
and now

from judy joyce and mary

you know i was going with a girl's head on a plate but
he's trying to get a body for the head of his fiancee
so he has to frequent these sleazy strip keys clubs
then he brings these bimbos home
and he
will make them a special cocktail

we'll may distract the audience into believing that the song has stopped
but it isn't
in reality
in reality
it keeps on going
because
you know we tried to cripple it
nobody knows the words to it
never
my grandfather knew the words
but he's dead now
they say aliens dropped the song here
trying to get rid of it
they damaged the song
but
it just hid in a hole
until it healed
then it come back louder than ever
and hurt everybody's ears again
a single compact unit
when they pulled the plug on it
it just stumbled wrong
but never came back



it's not quite that bad
it just turned into sort of an acoustic song
so they gave up on that
but it still walks the earth
roaming the countryside
shambling about like some hideous zombie
never knowing where it'll go next
and there it goes
the show
shambling down main street yorktown
that's a bully shoot at it
with his lightning axe
because it refuses to die
maybe that's the song

that shows
that might be the show's theme song
that refuses to die
but it comes like the show
when the show moves
the wind blows
like the show
the song is an ancient animal
it extends back to the time of pangea
when all of the planets
and all of the earth's continents
were one giant single continent
a place of paradise and harmony
where all creatures live together
worshiping the song
because it still extended back that far
and it's still there
into the one world land
the dreamy paradise
true greatness of the continent of pangea
which was the prototype of mu
hey what's that knocking at the door
oh my god don't let it in
don't don't don't let it in
it's it's the song
oh my god it's roam the countryside
it's back now
tell your kids to stay away from it
don't worry about your neighborhood
property values go back up
after the song leaves
that's uh james jude
you hope you wish
but the song it just never stops
it just keeps going
sometimes the only lyrics to the song
were thousands of people in torment screaming
do they still have the kennedy car
i didn't see the kennedy car
in the past four or five times
they've got the hip hop
the kennedy car
even when the dj tries to pull it out of the mix
the song just keeps on going
they got their
motion activated sparking guards
hey overman
this guy misplaced the caller
uh-oh
they have the horizontal
i would i would speculate that the song kidnapped him
took it to another channel on your mixer there
try another channel
try the a channel
which generates up to 50 000 volts
is the song
is the caller there
caller are you there
fighting system
is the song with you
the legendary rock hard abs
in six minutes zero
maybe if you don't move the song will be
at least
a little bit
yes with the ultimate nutrition pack
you rub the oil
don't move don't move
you'll be just an empty house
where the song sucks the life out of you
the results will delight and uh
depress you
how can you kill a song that's already dead
that's the real question
it shambles on with an unholy life of its own
it's lived for centuries and it can't stop killing
strap yourselves in folks and
take a journey into the unknown
now friends
what's coming up
you may have seen ads for
uh
send in your song and we'll turn it into a record
our friend john truby saw that ad
and he wrote this song
and sent it in there

Go to the basement level.
Let them in.
Go to the basement.
The man's a little bitch.
Get down in there.
He's got his keys and his signs, man.
His stop sign.
Come on, Sting.
It's like a control thing, man.
And they've got this machine where they can tell if you're thinking or not.
It's called TV.
And if it's off, you're guilty, man.
Mom?
Dad?

So ask them.

Now, a ranch has got 800 head of cattle.
Half the herd weighs 50 pounds.
The other half loses 20 pounds.
On the way to market, each one loses 50 pounds.
The other half loses 700 pounds.
Now listen.
How much does a herd weigh?
Bull.
I'm glad those two robbers hit my head on that road.
Each one weighs 20 pounds.
Bull.
Hmm?
I don't think too bad.
I came to help.
Half the herd weighs 50 pounds.
The herd weighs 700 pounds.
Ah!
For it never sleeps or lies idle.
Every filament.
Every filament.
It's always working.
It's never at conflict with itself over such human considerations as honor or love or pity.
From now on, you will answer the question.
From now on, you are to work in the uranium mine.
Monsters.
Monsters from the id.
Monsters from the id.
Oh, I can't wait for X-Day when the monsters from the id come to raging life
and your hormonal unconscious comes back.
And you will be relching and erupting up with living beings.
Your very fantasies of beautiful women, men, a monstrous aliens.
All will become real.
Real to the pink next door.
Who will flee in terror, but he can never escape.
Because he's in your nightmare now.
He's in your nightmare.
He's alone in yours.
X-Day.
And you paid your dues.
And Bob will save you.
Now that's a name I've wanted in a long time.
The mechanics.
The mechanics to save any man.
They are Bob Dogs.
Yet to save his own precious bodily juices as they flow freely from his neck and his thigh muscles.
He is a man on a mission and I dare not say what kind of recalcified mission that might be.
He's an emissionary.
He is.
Don't be proud of his technological terror you can stop.
He is the spermatic royal.
He is the king of squids.
You and your aliens can never defeat us, Bob.
You and your squids.
You're jackass.
You're a prairie squid army.
You can never live forever.
He is.
I trust you know how to cure the subcutaneous eruptions.
Your mind is going to be going soon.
I hope you know at least where you are now, Dr. Stang.
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've been struck to.
Take the red, white and blue pill.

I wonder if there are any other words you can use.
As long as we participate out here.
Until then, I wolf off with salutes to you tonight.

At 17, I knew too much to listen to the wise.
The world of hippies beckoned,
and I joined the rebels' cries that said,
tune in, turn on, drop out,
see how free you'll be.
Now I'm an abject slave
to what they said would set me free.
To my God,
my eager hopes and dreams
have wound up on the shelf,
and I'm no good to anyone,
least of all myself.
In this mad dream
to find myself in pot and LSD,
I'm shackled beyond hope
to what they said would set me free.
My life's become a living hell.
I beg and rob and steal.
Somehow, I can no longer tell
the fancy from the real.
I may have killed.
I just don't know.
A soul gone blind can't see.
A heartless, mindless slave
to what will never set me free.
I sometimes think I feel
my mother's warm and loving hand
come through a psychic hand.
I'm in psychedelic fog,
but like the rest,
it's sham.
I'm in a world of mescaline and pot and LSD,
and link by link,
it's forged a chain
that's made a slave of me.
The devil's strumming on my nerves
and fires within me rage.
My tortured mind, so gone,
is now a slave.
I can't recall for sure my age.
I think I'm 22.
I know I won't reach 23.
But hell can be no worse
than what is made a slave of me.
I'm bold, wild, and kind,
and look how strong I've grown.
You kidding me?
Oftentimes I think all the guardmaids

It's like I see myself as a clown

I really grew up.

I shouldn't have taken that other path.
Don't worry, my friend.
You didn't take the other half.
The other half is waiting for you here.
It took me!
In the bottom of the mine.
Look, look, look.
It's a shadow of your own face.
It's a reflection of your own mind.
Look, friend.
It's you.
You're staring blankly, mutely into the dark horizon
and see nothing but that slacked-on, slacked-on face.
Look, look, look.
That face.
That face.
I've seen it before.
I think I...
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Never mind.
My mind is not my mind.
I'm aboard, kiddo.

Do you think people are going to think I'm...

You will see the way as void.
This is not the true void.
You can know that which does not exist.
That is the void.
It is not included in man's knowledge.
The inscription on the wooden post reads,
In the void, sharp and strong, it can be used to cut, sack, and stick priests.
This is not the true void.
Of course, the void is nothingness.

There is a place that I often...
I remember one time...
I remember one time...
Oh yeah? In your dreams?
Yes.
No, I am a floating spirit without entrails.
Without a need for ingestion or digestion.
It depends.
You go to bed looking at a book with pictures of insects
and you can have insects in your dream.
And you can direct what you do by...
That is true.
...just before you go to bed.
That is true.
That's probably why I always dream about...
have dreams about women.
Yes, if you go to sleep looking at voluptuous imagery,
then that will percolate through your dream.
Yo-yo-ho, that makes a lot of sense now.
Cause and effect, so to speak.
Could be, could be.
Yep, ah, well, of course...
Now, do you believe that you can change your dream by your diet?
Much to regret in our pasts,
unless we are condemned to relive certain incidents over and over.
But...
That's what we have crop for.
Yo-yo...
Yes.
Yo-yo-ho.
Well, that's another superstition.
Some people believe that frock suppresses dreams, but it does not.
It simply makes you sleep more soundly, so you don't tend to wake up and remember your dreams.
But you have them all the same.
If you don't have them, you start losing your mental health very quickly.
Yeah, you still get your rims, is what you mean, right?
You still get the by-product which the brain wants, and that's the rapid eye movements.
You get the flushing...
...out of the repressed psychic substratum.
Sort of like...
...the cleansing of the mental...
It's sort of like driving your mom's Dodge Dart, 63 Dodge Dart, backwards around in a circle in the parking lot to wind the miles off of it.
But your brain has to do that every night.
It does that when your eyeballs are blinking.
Rapidly blinking.
They sound like this.
...and tossed its...
You don't know they sound like that, because you can't...
...see them, because you're asleep.
You're sleeping.
So you don't know you're actually doing that.
People are watching you do it. They're sitting there laughing. They're holding their guns and they're laughing.
They're going, ha ha ha.
You are such an idiot. Look at that idiot.
They're looking at you and they're taunting you. They're making fun of you.
And they know that you're laying there and you can't hear them because you're sleeping.
You don't know what's going on.
You should ask the protection of Saint Pedro of Bethlehem.
Then before you wake up, they leave.
Really? And then Saint Pedro would listen?
And they take pictures of you all doing that.
He might just do that.
So that later on...
He's listening right now, right?
...they can show you those pictures and play you those tapes.
He always listens.
And you can then feel stupid.
He sits in his chair and sees all of them.
Stupid.
Listen to...
The choice is yours. Obey me and live, or disobey and die.
I'm...
Face front.
I don't want to wake up.
Everybody face to the screen.
I don't want to wake up.
Everybody knee to the road.
I don't want to wake up.
And tip that chest out. Get those shoulders up in the air.
Look directly at the face of his beatitude.
I can't.
Look at him.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.

Obey, obey, obey, obey...
I cannot gaze upon him.
Obey...
I will be blinded.
He is too...
Blinded.
He is too beautiful to gaze upon.
Never mind the brilliance, for in the light is where the signals and signs come into the
inner ear of your vapid brain.
I feel shame before him.
Yes, you do.
You've been a bad man, haven't you?
I was afraid of him.
You were afraid.
I saw him.
You detested him.
The man with the pipe.
Yes.
you can't be serious.
I am serious.
True.
And don't call me Shirley.
It happened, though.
Yes.
But it is true.
Yes, you were envious of him.
You must believe me.
You looked at his nozzle.
You said,
if only the Lord
had provided me
with a Winchester like this,
I could fly

I could live.

Escape!
No escape for you, my friend.

I'm staying.
Unplug me, then.

Why are you doing this to me?
Bring around the fizz water.
Come on.
We got to get him out of here.
Look at that stuff
coming out of his ears.
He's shocked.
I think they really got him
this time.
Oh, man.

Look at the little spindle.
The red, white, and blue pills?
Well, these are more than
red, white, and blue pills.
These actually make
the whole thing go.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, it's like a little
tiny world inside that pill.
Yeah, don't stare too hard.
You might get sucked right in there.
Just rub it very gently
on your lower parts.
Oh, yeah.
Not those parts.
Hey, and more
of them kind pills, Dave?
Yeah, I've got a whole bag here.
Oh, man, those pills feel good
all over my body.
I've never had pills

What?
I'm talking about X Day.
Well, even if X Day is the 4th of July redundant.
I'm talking about the party at Tranquility Base, goddammit.
But I mean, you know, just all this waiting that never happened.

Dave, maybe they'll be here tomorrow.

I've already met Bob, and I did not like the experience one bit.
He was drunk.
He was loud.
He tried to tickle me in front of a huge number of people.
He vomited on his shoes.
He had to be escorted by two large bald guys,
balder and larger than me, out of the area.
He never stopped smiling for a second, though.
Yeah, you call that a smile?
With all that torn flesh hanging?
Happiness.
He looked ecstatic the whole time.
Satori, indeed.
Slack.
The nth slack.
The extreme slack.
Slack.
Square.
Sure.
It's not just the smile.
It's the placidness in that face.
The expression in his eyes.
It's just the cool calm.
He is definitely in moon punch every hour of the day.
I know he's under 24 hours.
It's sighted lust.
It's the grin of infinitely sighted, infinite lust.
The first thing I...
Infinitely being sighted.
Before his desire has had a chance to barely form.
It is instantly sighted.
By fate.
The subgenius performs memory editing.
He buries his arm deep in the archives of the score,
gropes for the proper file and its specific remembrances,
and retrieves it to scan at leisure.
And he knows that this file, and his archive,
are but one drawer in the greater archive of all creation.
For everything is but a pattern, an intersection in the code.
Everything exists at once, it just shifts position continuously.
Every distinct object we see or hear, is a pattern.
Every round us is but an opening into the files.
Don't worry, if you missed something, it's all in the can.
It will all be aired again, in some better world.
And the angelic host which must soon descend will bring an index to all the shifting patterns of the code,
providing us with a guide to the anti-laws.
But we have been warned of the tampering.
Once one has gone swimming in the fourth dimension,
this dry land bound pace seems excruciatingly ordered.
It's a shame that life on this plane is so chronological.
Many are the subgenii who have gone waiting in the turbulent surf of time, never to return.
It's hard to get back in step once you've changed the setting on your astral wristwatch.
Nyaa-oy-nay-ba-bay!

There were lovely songs in this country once, look at them now, just empty husks, that were
once decent tunes, and the song sucked away their life force.
The song that refused to die, sapped every bit of energy from all of the most popular
pop songs of the time, demented in its unknowable, unthinking quest to pervade everything within
its reach.
Centuries in the making, maybe someday a way to stop this song will be invented.
Uh oh, here it goes again, looks like it's getting riled up, getting angry, oh!
Oh!
Must have said something wrong, now it's gonna kill me, I know it's gonna kill me, it's creeping
over here real slow, it's right next to me, but it won't, it won't kill me because it
wants me to suffer longer, why kill me now when it can keep me suffering for years and
years to come?
Just a quivering mass of flesh with only my nerve cells working, and yet the song kept
me alive for centuries for only to torture me, cause it never could stop, just kept getting
uglier, more pitiful.
More pathetic.
And sick.
Because sickness was its life, cause it couldn't die.
Whole religions were formed to try to stop the song, but you know what happened?
Just kept going.
Didn't have a brain, not even a face, the song with no face, it sorta had a hindbrain
that kept it going.
Kinda like a vestigial brain, sorta like what the stegosaurus had in its tail.
Just a little bit of a brain.













Yeah.
Just a little mass of nerve, nerves that sorta clustered together to resemble, maybe it
was just an action center.
Didn't have to have any higher thinking.
See what I mean?
And once they catch you that way, they can bleed you and suckle from your teeth like
vampires.
Your blood is no longer your own, no, it's going to be someone else's blood, very, very
soon.
Hey, um, my horn, it's not gonna work with my corn, but it's actually gonna be a good
sword, y'know?
Hmmm, get out of here a bit 가!
Could you forgive me if I do, King?
I'm not giving it a shot.
Come on.
I'm your master.
You is about to Quant снack my snout vous, will you.
Galleons of Gilegons...
...givens of us to get to your front yard.

What did I...?

Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
Get, get, get, get, get, get back!
Hello!
Anyway friends, it's, these are troubled times we live in and although the church is a subgenius, well, let me put it this way.
If the church goes down, well, civilization goes up.
In flames! In flames, my friend! And when the world goes up in flames, the subgenies have the weenies!
We will be the ones barbecuing!
Ah, yes! Friends, we, you know the news, you turn on the news today and it's pure surrealism.
Did I really see jiggly pixels?
The fish of Geraldo Rivera in the desert with these thousand troopers pointing guns at twenty skinny little Afghani guys.
Who are all, one of whom is standing there going, when the Taliban finds out about this, they're going to kick your ass!
It's all relative, friends.
You know, those guys weren't getting CNN, but maybe they know more because of that.
We have to get used to the idea that at any moment,
anything can happen.
Both the imaginable and the unimaginable.
Sometimes the impossible, but more often, the unlikely.
I wish Rod Serling was here to say that instead of Mr. Sister who wrote it.
Sometimes you're the screwy and sometimes you're the screwer.
More often we're the screwy and the way I read it, we're one screw short of World War III!
Which I grew up looking forward to.
Because I like atomic monsters.
You know, oh, once again, the worst it could be was Planet of the Apes.
That's pretty cool.
And the best, Road Warrior.
Whoa!
Blood for oil there.
Ooh la la.
But friends, you know, it's scary because the craziest train engineer in the world is at the helm.
Not Dennis Murphy.
No.
But Casey Jones.
The craziest train engineer in the world.
Is at the helm of Spaceship America as it careens out of control with that drunken, coat-tuck madman at the wheel.
And what is America's final destination, friends?
The moon!
The future!
And Hooterville!
Especially Hooterville.
Oh, man.
It's so depressing sometimes.
And I mean, I get depressed at watching the normal folks go through their routines.
But you know, the do-gooders can be just as bad as the evil-doers.
At times.
And they mean well.
But if you happen to be evil, and you're a do-gooder, think about it.
You don't even know you're evil.
For instance, anti-smoking.
Anti-smoking bullshit eats up a lot more slack than secondhand smoke.
I have no doubt about that.
And I swear the smug do-gooder will be the death of us all!
For our own goods, of course.
You know, they're fairly easy to spot, the smug do-gooder, because they oftentimes practice
what we would call flamboyant humility.
Or conspicuous humbleness.
Sort of a grandiose self-effacement.
Like Buddhists, who never cease to remind you of how egoless they are.
You know who I'm talking about!
They just want you to notice how egoless they are.
That's all.
Listen to me when I tell you, go beyond ego.
You don't know who you're dealing with, man.
Listen to me.
Go beyond ego.
Because I know.
It's easy to be a social Darwinist, survival of the richest, if you're that kind that puts
the evil in evolution.
And I like to think of, you know, somebody said, you sub-geniuses are just a bunch of
elitists.
Well, yeah.
Duh.
For one thing, we won't let any geniuses in.
But it's, like, you know, it's not that we look down on the cow manures.
We just don't believe in their shit!
Bob noticed how some people believe this and some people believe that.
You know, oh, I believe the world was created yesterday.
No, no, no.
I believe the world, the world happened by accident.
7 billion years ago.
Well, Bob said, believe me out of it!
You believe what?
Just relax in the safety of your own delusions, friends.
Just keep them out of my delusions.
We'll stick with the contradictions that make good sense.
Thank you very much.
You know, I think you mistook me for Mr. Give-A-Shit.
When I don't have my head stuck in a black hole, I always listen to the hour of slack.
Because it makes me laugh and I like to laugh.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Oh, you mustn't forget the nice letter.
Oh, my, my.
Uh-oh.
That's right, laddie.
It's an important physical document which you must keep with you at all times.
Especially now that the...
Dear Paul and Gary, you stink.
The show was a fake.
How can you guys laugh at my show behind your backs and still get away with it?
What was the show to you?
Some sort of sub-clown parade to impress your sick, groupie, fringe friends like Nina Hogan and Mark Motherbrow?
I put my artistic life on the line and I get the subgenius Ed Sullivan show.
I work like a little devil trying to balance the forces of good and evil in three cities and get the drum set set up and tuned each time.
The foam head adjusted, the radios and explosives in place.
The zombies checked out and nuked.
The stage managers go get them.
The speeches written.
And the line to tie Cleave in through the board done.
You guys just sit on your smiles waiting for someone to help you tear the veins off the sound man's amps.
Between Gary's asking where the food is and Paul, your bitching about not wanting to clean where the banners are.
I was just about up to my sub-glen and too much is always butter for not enough.
Gary, you sad mop of a man.
Where do you get off thinking a child's towel is the way to go on stage?
With a band that now sounds like bus breaks, you want me to play drums to what?
Hurting dolphins may be funny to you, but it simply gives little Jerry Jeff callers everywhere the wrong and the long idea.
If you'd taken your mom up on that hair deal, we could have had a decent light, man.
And some better church air, but no, you said it's Bob's will and walked away.
Nice lights, Gabo fam.
Paul, you sniveling art snot.
To make it all your show, you've moved the damn thing to LA and I had to blow it up on the freeway before we could go on.
You probably think putting the sponge head in the middle instead of me on the drums was pretty funny.
Intent as you were in wrecking my show, I tell you, everyone, oral contract, that I will wear my space suit and you scamper out to your friend to borrow his gorilla suit and say,
Space helmet.
If this is the new church, the new take what you want from whoever you want.
Well, you lowerites can sit on it and extragrameditate.
I'm gonna go back to the legitimate religion where the sneakers become suckers the old fashioned way.
We burn them, not each other.
Smith, that lost little fool.
He couldn't find Philo's show hole with both pipes.
And he expects everyone to do the same.
They'd be excited about his limp dishrag of an act.
My buddy, D Meyer, poop of all, etc.
Worked up some of the best lines and runs in the mouth history of the church.
And you steal them all the time.
All of you, every line.
Then put him on last so you may deliver his best lines first badly driving away all the people who know what we mean and leaving precious little for the audience.
For him to swing and swig and swoon to.
And for me?
When I shot Bob there were 200 tops left.
I could have shot all the audience too.
There were so few left.
I had enough bullets left in my gun.
I may have.
I was so mad.
Why save the best for last?
Those people want to see Bob shot.
And you, school marmalade of a man, Smith, act for two years like it was you I shot.
I hand you the biggest publicity ploy since Janer's device and you complain the curse and cry to Paul, your sleep genius S.F. Lowe.

And you complain to him, you're so lucky, about how it's just a blank.
And oh, he just does the best.
Really, well, you just coming up if you think you have been.
Where did you dig up those Arkansaniacs?
Funnier than a gravel mixer, yes, and noise that matches one.
But next time, get someone who knows how to dress and won't sit in the middle of Broadway to eat his dinner.
Box and knives.
Feuding.
Cemetery.
Graves.
No trespassing.
Stolen pig.
Escalated.
People died.
Killed and hurt.
Fight argument.
Hilliard Hall.
Fight rumble.
Gang fight.
Tattoos.
Fraternity.
Feud.
Uh, feud.
Don't forget, folks, the song that wouldn't die.
It's still in your brains.
You may not be able to hear it now, but it'll be with you always.
Following you through life.
And you.
In cover versions by Liberace and Herb Alpert and Ioanna Brass.
Together.
It's the most horrible thing you can ever imagine.
With Tina Turner singing background vocals.
And Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazelwood.
And Yoko Ono.
And a cameo appearance by Mel Gibson as the World War II soldier returning to his daughter.
Melanie and Claudine Loces.
With Bob sharpening knives.
And the ghetto boys.
The letter was written by puzzling evidence in copying David Depp's The Amazing Pope of New York's First Letter, critiquing the first show of the first century, of the first millennia, of the first group of subgeniuses that ever were.
That is the show's way.
We're just moving the body of the show out of the way here because in two minutes I've got to hide this thing under the sound board.
Yeah, we've got to get it under the board.
Roll it in there.
I just want to fight.
I left them showing the other way.
I know what you mean.
I know exactly what you mean.
An elite padre, a random rogue group of renegade subgeniuses are responsible for this outrage that we of the church utterly deny and shame.
Can't think clearly.
And separate our lives.
My friends, a little bit of KPFA in Berkeley.
Puzzling evidence.
Dr. Howell.
And Dr. Philodrumon.
And they're all for it.
Well, we're about ready to wash down the worm, as they like to say in Cozumel, where I like to hang my britches every Tuesday and some of the kids like to hang out with me, too.
I've got a good joke for you.
One of my friends, one of my little friends told me.
There was this little boy and kind of like a 40-year-old man.
They didn't really know each other.
They're walking off towards the woods hand in hand.
And the little boy squeezed the older man's hand and said, I'm afraid.
I'm afraid to go in the woods.
And the man said, you're afraid.
Think of how I'm going to feel coming out alone.
And, you know, that's what I think is wrong with today's people.
So true.
So true.
They just they don't understand that when their time is nigh, they might as well plop one in the eye.
They might as well forget the whole routine.
Give it up.
Give it up.
Give it up.
And buy one of these beautiful, beautiful synchronized goat shirts, ghost shirts from the ghost dancers out there in the Lakota lands.
Where the wind blows free and the bison blow.
Now that's the name I've wanted in a long time.
J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Oh, I didn't remember J.R. in the mines.
I ain't give anything for another bowl of J.R. Bob Dobbs maple syrup.
Oh, I remember him.
The only maple syrup drained straight from the cow's throat.
His fingers were as black as the ground.
The coal from all the coal he dug.
He'd circumcised the rectums of those.
He worked so hard, you know, that...
When he would mutilate a cow to get a good syrup oil.
I remember.
I remember.
Stick Bob by any other name would smell his feet.
Dismembering a cow with Bob.
Now that was a fine Sunday.
Better than singing and going to the mines.
The old fashioned way.
Old fashioned.
That's the way to do it.
And yet there's no other way than the way that happened yesterday.
Day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day.
Oh, yesterday.
It's no time for an old man.
No more.
When I was a young baggie, we used to take three and five year olds.
We'd pull their hair out as long as it would go.
Really?
And drop them down into the shaft to see if they'd make a splattering sound.
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Those were the days.
Before the damn English owner came here.
Wouldn't let us start a union.
Those were the days when I was but a young scrotum.
They want all the sheep they want.
Just a little curly hair.
Short hair, ma'am.
A little one-eyed fella.
Always standing up for his own rights and lefts.
Always eager to please the hight.
Oh, he was.
I like Jonah and the whale.
You're a good boy, he's right.
You're a good boy, he's right.
Till next week.
Keep your hat on tight.
You're back to the winter.
Sack in the saddle.
Give that sack to Princess Mary.
You know that's where it belongs.
She's a mysterious girl.
Order!
Order!
This is my rifle!
There are many like it, but this one is mine!

It's Einstein's Secret Outlaws lately.
At Post Office Box 81555 Cleveland, Ohio 44118.


Oh, no, I'm sorry.
That's not right.
That's 44181.
I could do all that again and do another take, but I'm not going to, friends, because this
is the Hour of Slack.
Praise Bob.
And praise Hell-Pope Huey, who did that music.
And, friends, if you've got some kind of tapes or CDs you want to play on that you think
is suitable, is suitably bobbed and slacked up and conspiracy bashing and ear bone ripping,
and to play on this August radio show, then you can send that to me, Reverend Ivan Stang,
at this address, Stang at Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.
44118.
That's Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights.

Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
And praise Hell-Pope Huey, the background.
By the way, friends, that song earlier, Dazed and Confused, I believe that was by Bomb Water.
Keep it slack.
We're chubby.
Bob, give me my hand.
No.
Thank you, Bob.
The following is a rebuttal to KRUD Editorial denouncing the legalization of marijuana.
Speaking for the legalization of marijuana.
The legalization of marijuana is Ashley Roach-Clip, President of United Heads for Hemp.
Mr. Roach-Clip.
Yeah.
Am I facing the right way, man?
Just look at the red light.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
I just want to say, man, that a lot of...

I know where I'm at.
All right.
On three.
Just face the camera with the red light on it.
Yeah.
There you go.
You're in focus.
Okay.
Mr. Roach-Clip.
A lot of cats put down grass, man.
Because they say things about it makes you lose your memory, you know, man.
Well, I just want to say that...
I don't know.
I don't know.

I forgot where I was, man.
Just a minute.
Okay.
Cut.
Freddy.
Freddy, stop.
All right.
Let's just take it once more.
Okay?
Just a minute.
Let me think of where...
Oh, yeah.
I know what I was going to say.
All right.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay.
We'll take it from Mr. Roach-Clip again.
Okay?
I'm ready.
Here we go.
Mr. Roach-Clip.
Yeah?
Mr. Roach-Clip.
You're supposed to do the speech.
Oh, right.
Right.
Right, man.

All right.


You're off now.
Okay.
Thanks, man.
Thanks very much.
We'll get going.
