1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,820
Ladies and gentlemen, education holds America's future, perhaps your future.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,080
The subgenius power of smoke.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,740
Work, work.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,200
First to give you premium quality.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,920
A felony.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,180
And first to give you scientific facts in support of smoking.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:23,940
A felony.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,220
Do it today.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,000
From PR News in Washington, I'm deported immediately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,320
Meanwhile, leaders from European Union countries are meeting in Texas along the Mexican border.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,760
Free our children.

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:48,340
Meanwhile, the government doubled in size overnight and now covers at least 1,500 acres around the country.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,400
Meanwhile, Trump tweeted.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,620
Free our children.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,940
A growing number of right-wing EU governments.

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,580
Are demanding no PR news.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,360
Last month, several activists were arrested and accused of undermining PR news.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,440
They're also demanding PR news in Washington.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:19,060
A man with a third eye and glasses meets a cyclops with glasses.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,200
Near-sighted perception meets thought.

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,520
Firesighted aggression.

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:37,820
The cyclops is six times taller than the man and fat from eating all the men before him.

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,580
With each huge swing, the cyclops misses.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,360
Like trying to swat a gnat, the air darting the target just out of reach and back again and again.

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:11,000
The man, too busy artfully dodging, is unable to access the third eye and too weak to throw anything heavy or damaging enough to defeat the overgrown, bloated ogre.

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,920
The man, too busy artfully dodging, is unable to access the third eye and too weak to throw anything heavy or damaging enough to defeat the overgrown, bloated ogre.

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:23,480
The giant adjusts his glasses and tries to focus on his elusive adversary, always in motion.

28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,340
The man pushes the glasses up his nose and pauses.

29
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,720
Just long enough for the boot to descend upon him.

30
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:47,100
The cyclops shoes, newly purchased and not yet broken in, still had plenty of tread.

31
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:54,080
The man easily and luckily fit between the treads.

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,040
Unfortunately, the custom Christian Dior glasses did not survive.

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,100
Now with blurred distance vision, the man searches for options.

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,080
The cyclops sits with him.

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,400
The man is a quaking thud and examines his shoe for human goo.

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:33,260
From the cornfield that he's scurried to, the man begins sharpening a long wooden stick.

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:44,380
The cyclops, finding no mush for snacking, licks his lips and hears scraping.

38
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,060
Smells deadly.

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,140
The man is a little bit nervous.

40
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,140


41
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,000
He wipes mist from his glasses.

42
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,180
The hunt is on.

43
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,860
The giant heads towards the cornfield, the source of the sound.

44
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,400
Nostrils flaring an alert as he sniffs and searches for his prey.

45
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
The man is a little bit nervous.

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,040


47
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,040


48
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,040


49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,040


50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,160
The man carves faster, frantically, as confrontation draws ever near.

51
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:36,300
Suddenly, a careless crashing through the cornfield is heard, accompanied by mis-length.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,860
Another human male, blond and bronze, emerged from the perimeter into the open field.

53
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,020
The man is a little bit nervous.

54
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,020


55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,120
His to스� fell from the ground in one fell swoop, until the tables rolled down to his

56
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,120


57
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,120


58
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,120


59
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,940
Neither of them looked surprised, saying she's a Les gì droigne, which means she's not

60
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,040
alone.

61
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,540
After pressing her nose on the layfy field of course, the sight of theange, an gladiator

62
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:58,540


63
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:58,540


64
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:58,540


65
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,400
The two engage in hardy guffaws and smiles and long-kept adoration.

66
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:13,620
The stranger reminds the giant to keep his voice down as being so large the sound can

67
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,380
be quite ear-shattering for the lesser beings.

68
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,780
They continue conversing and reminiscing about lost weekends, lovers, farming, business,

69
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,800
bozos and limetix disease.

70
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,880
Then they both notice the annoying sound of scraping and turn to look.

71
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:48,840
The man, completely mesmerized by what he was witnessing, had continued whittling his

72
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,680
stick until it is no longer than the knife he was carving with.

73
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,080
The stranger shakes his head.

74
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,780
Turns back to side-close.

75
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,400
He leaves the man alone.

76
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,100
Heuning his head into sand on the floor, he pushes him away.

77
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,860
The stranger hardly leaves.

78
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,560
The hombresons jump in, every now and then and finish them off with one blow.

79
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,520
The stranger is placed in a dodgy position with the arms breathing tahunousaders that

80
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,760
don't catch up to him.

81
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,740
tasty it turns out that the only other thing the man has to offer is that he

82
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:50,180
happens to be a master brewer a deal is struck the cyclops being a tinkerer

83
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:59,100
fashions a seal tight handle to attach to every keg the man makes and drinks a

84
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:09,980
giant mug of beer every night in return the man was free to frolic in the vast

85
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:17,000
land the giant ruled pet the man-sized sheep snack lick the pig snacks coiled

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:28,660
tail and even kitchen privileges in the ramshackle vast leaky cabin after

87
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,080
lunch

88
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:36,880
three consecutive batches of mediocre keg beer the giant pulls the man aside

89
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:46,580
given the size difference they were both effectively able to use the same lenses

90
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:57,280
the cyclops broke his glasses in half as he only needed one glass and offered the other half to the

91
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,060
man who was internally in a coma and was not able to breathe the cyclops broke his glasses in half

92
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:11,940
giving the man a rakuto but nawet a low price midway through a series of

93
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,580
hundred danes ought to be helpful to the vorne in closing the decent and courteous

94
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,420
atmosphere must have coworker high fives that egg in the case of any beast

95
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:18,420


96
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,700
the drunken without a single attack

97
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,180
in a jerk

98
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,360
but you could call the dont go around dark

99
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,380
will lay a little weak

100
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,180
the dols

101
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,400
was struggling

102
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,060


103
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,900
The praying old man was blinking back at him.

104
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,220
He was all of forty-three yet looked seventy-four.

105
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:49,400
He dove into his latest brew, the best batch yet, and let the foam and the bubbles and

106
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,140
the alcohol consume him.

107
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:01,060
The Cyclops reached for his nightcap and, in the Bed Bath and Beyond buy two get one

108
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,960
free candlelight, he looked before he drank.

109
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:15,020
Like a human-sized drink with a nat in it, he poured it down, the carbonation tickling

110
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,420
the roof of his mouth, and licked his lips.

111
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,120
The nightcap was a student.

112
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,000
protein, he said.

113
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,060
Oh, yes, dear friends.

114
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,900
Cyclops vs. Man by Sheridan.

115
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,580
Now, friends, I got a couple of CDs from this thing of all places,

116
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,520
Cleveland, calling itself Sheridan.

117
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,380
And I think we'll be hearing more of his or its short stories,

118
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,080
every single one of which has to obey certain odd and special rules.

119
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,820
They're all one famous character versus another matching famous character.

120
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,260
And one must be nearsighted and one must be farsighted.

121
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,260
He also has a CD of shorter bits, which we'll be gradually hearing.

122
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,280
Yeah.

123
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:23,100
You know, friends, doing this church and radio outreach introduces us to the most interesting people.

124
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,640
And thanks to Lemur for the titles and news and short upcoming upchucks.

125
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,980
This is our Slack number 1792.

126
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:45,480
Not a rerun, although I found in my best of ESO collections some old swamp radio clips from WCSB Cleveland.

127
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,860
With Lonesome Cowboy Dave and host Chaz Smith that I think remain most pertinent.

128
00:10:53,340 --> 00:11:00,260
This particular upcoming clip from December 2002, maybe, maybe, I'm not sure,

129
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:08,060
maybe recorded the night after the great Chaz Smith learned that he might be dying of AIDS.

130
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,880
Not that he told anyone about that ever.

131
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,020
He died five years later.

132
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,140
Of a lot of complications.

133
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,800
It was on his death certificate.

134
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,860
So tragic because he wouldn't let anyone know.

135
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,660
I have reason to suspect, though, looking back, that this was the week he got the diagnosis.

136
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,800
Okay.

137
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,860
Okay.

138
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,400
I don't know what happens now.

139
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,840
I don't know what anything is anymore.

140
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,040
Well, one thing is for sure.

141
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,860
The heretics of science have taken over the top berth.

142
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,980
Not the after birth.

143
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,780
Not the slow berth.

144
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,860
But the top berth.

145
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,260
I don't even know what that means.

146
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,620
What it means that guys like Milton Drumplay and Exocentris Squink.

147
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,580
I don't know who they are.

148
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,020
Well, they they fondled.

149
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,360
Let's say they fondled quantum mechanics until it couldn't come.

150
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't even really know what that is.

151
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,180
What quantum is?

152
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,400
Isn't it?

153
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:13,960
Yeah.

154
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,940
Well, you used to always preach to me.

155
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,180
Now you don't remember because I can't sure as hell remember.

156
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,840
No.

157
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,940
What is quantum?

158
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,220
It's that everything is discrete, has a bunch of these discrete particles all going their own way.

159
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,060
I don't believe any of it.

160
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,200
Held together by a soggy old man or something.

161
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,820
You don't believe in science anymore?

162
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,080
Oh, yeah.

163
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,360
Sure.

164
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,640
Oh, geez.

165
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,780
You sound so blase about, though.

166
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,080
I mean, that's just something that people come up with.

167
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,100
Stuff's already there anyway.

168
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:42,900
So.

169
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,440
Whether it's true or not is irrelevant.

170
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,240
Doesn't really matter.

171
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,380
Because it is.

172
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah.

173
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,080
Right.

174
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,740
It is.

175
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,700
It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't.

176
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,460
Well, you sound like a cultural hegemonist who believes that only your own ideas are.

177
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,040
What's the point?

178
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,380
Now you sound like a nihilist.

179
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,060
Like what's the point of understanding it?

180
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,240
Now you sound like a transmutational genocistic.

181
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Oh, Christ, man.

182
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,000
You got all the diseases.

183
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,900
Oh, Chaz, you got the malaise.

184
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,800
There's no point to try and understand anything.

185
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,160
Well, I can agree with you.

186
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


187
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,700
I can agree with you in a marginal way.

188
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,940
You know, like the same kind of thing that you use to cook your food in.

189
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:28,680
The same items you use to create information in your doorway or your computer and stuff.

190
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:36,240
The same things that make you up as molecules are drifting in and out of you right now and you don't want them to stay put.

191
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,840
You don't care.

192
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,640
They're going to do what they want to do, whatever.

193
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,900
It doesn't matter what I want.

194
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,300
Yeah.

195
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,400
But molecules do have a mind of their own.

196
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,840
It's a miracle they even hang out together long enough for you to get a pair of eyebrows sometimes.

197
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,560
You know what I mean?

198
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,460
Yeah.

199
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:01,620
The universe is billions and billions and billions of light years across.

200
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, we're kind of small.

201
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,680
In fact, we're miniscule when you say it that way.

202
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,920
We're hardly there.

203
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,140
We're like a particle in a puff of smoke.

204
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,140


205
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,140


206
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:21,800
So, well, when we were playing in the Puffer Dome, don't you think like some massive godlike people were looking down from strange new crafting?

207
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,280
No.

208
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,280
Do you think like the little, well, you said once that little super tiny, tiny little aliens were watching us.

209
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,340
That was the acid.

210
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,800
Oh, man.

211
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,560
Everything I built my life's beliefs on.

212
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,660
Aw, jeez.

213
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,680
Man.

214
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,040
I don't know.

215
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,260
I don't know.

216
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
Now I'm going to get the malaise.

217
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,120
Limits limit.

218
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,140
Limits limit.

219
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,140
I said I'm going to get the malaise.

220
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,440
I said I'm going to get the malaise.

221
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,940
It's a kind of a silly thing.

222
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,780
I've been working for silver.

223
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,560
He's listening to Janice again, Stang.

224
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,000
Huh?

225
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,660
He's listening to Janice and he's all depressed about his mollet tools again.

226
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,020
Janice.

227
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,080
Oh.

228
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,640
Oh, I thought it was Janice Jarpler because she's going, drag, drag, drag.

229
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,340
Oh, my god.

230
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,720
It's a man.

231
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,260
No.

232
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,320
It's Robert Plant.

233
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,060
Oh.

234
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,040
No.

235
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:08,860
No.

236
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,240
No.

237
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,220
No.

238
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,520
No.

239
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,060
No.

240
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,060


241
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,320
No.

242
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,060
No.

243
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,140
No.

244
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,140


245
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,140


246
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,140


247
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,140


248
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,140


249
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,520
That's how you do it.

250
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:15,780
That's how you do it.

251
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,260
I'm going to get this love.

252
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,260
All right.

253
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,280
Let's get to it.

254
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,280


255
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,280


256
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,280


257
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,600
I see this.

258
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,780
Yeah, baby.

259
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,940
Oh, man.

260
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,020
Oh, man.

261
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,060
This is amazing.

262
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,160
I'm going to get this love.

263
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,200
Oh, man.

264
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:33,940
All right.

265
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,080
That's it.

266
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,140
Are you out of your mind?

267
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,640
That's it, boys.

268
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,040
That's it.

269
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,980
Boy, that's it.

270
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,860
Oh, no.

271
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,260
Oh, man.

272
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,260


273
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,260


274
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,580
Oh, man.

275
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:42,580


276
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:42,580


277
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,680
the bottom are all offside. There's nothing wrong with me.

278
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,540
Oh, he's finally

279
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,640
seeing clearly.

280
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,400
This is the way it really is, then? He's lost

281
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,880
faith in religion

282
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
and science. How about

283
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,100
agriculture? No.

284
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,080
No, I understand

285
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,500
how it is, you know.

286
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,340
After a while, you just have to face

287
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,680
facts and just get used to it, you know.

288
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,600
No man is

289
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,360
an island, a rock of

290
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,500
a hard place. I think you might

291
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,440
get Minerva's curse if you ever stare

292
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,480
the facts straight in the face and you turn to stone

293
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,260
like the Gorgons or the Gnorgen.

294
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,080
Jazz is a man of stone.

295
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,260
I know he's quite...

296
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,680
He is a rock, a hard

297
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,240
rock. And I was a

298
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,340
man of water, but the water

299
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,900
has turned to stone.

300
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,400
Now you're just a stoner man, and you've

301
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,420
always been a stoner man. The rock

302
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,520
is not as hard as you think. It's more...

303
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,440
I don't know. It's like when your

304
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,720
water has trans-morphosized.

305
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,280
When your glands ooze out of your neck or

306
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,240
someplace, they have to be put back.

307
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,480
And so solid.

308
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,260
Well, sometimes it just becomes a

309
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,240
vapor. It was then, plus

310
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,020
that blind date with Medusa

311
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,880
didn't help.

312
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,340
If only it had been... If only he had

313
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,260
been blind for the blind date with

314
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,500
Medusa. Well, then he would have been Homer's

315
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,320
buddy there. What's his name? With the

316
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,240
one... Oh, the guy

317
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,500
with the one eye. The Sodclops.

318
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
Yes. Since we're

319
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,100
into Greek myths.

320
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,000
Or something. No.

321
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,980
Mythology, I guess. No, we're in...

322
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,500
in the Vale of Woe.

323
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,940
Well, not really woe.

324
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,240
Of resignation. Well, woe

325
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,660
spelled W-H-O-H.

326
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,880
You know? The valley...

327
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,200
Whoa! No, not again.

328
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,180
Whoa.

329
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,120
It's a valley that's hard to

330
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,820
climb out, especially if you don't have the right

331
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,860
shoes. You know what I'm saying?

332
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,020
The right foot gear

333
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,660
can get us out of here. Well, if you've got a

334
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,000
ball and chain holding you down,

335
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,860
it's pretty hard to climb out of there.

336
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,780
What have you got?

337
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,620
One of them Orange County jail uniforms

338
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,560
and you've got your hand cuffed to your foot.

339
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,680
That's better than a

340
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,460
ball and chain, isn't it? Well, and you know,

341
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,540
when somebody's all depressed and

342
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,620
or facing facts, as the

343
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,020
case may be, depending...

344
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,580
What's the problem with just digging into

345
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,600
some blues and getting in touch with where

346
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,940
it's coming from, for real?

347
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,140
Oh, I was just going from what you said earlier.

348
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,440
I'm just digging in. I'm just getting in touch with

349
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,720
the roots, man. He didn't say he was

350
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,420
bitter, Stan. He just said he was

351
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,480
afraid for his molecules, like many people

352
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,160
are nowadays. I'm not afraid for my molecules.

353
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,000
What the hell can I do about my molecules?

354
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,440
He's letting them do their own thing.

355
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,720
Well, it doesn't matter what I care about my molecules.

356
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,340
What do my molecules care about me?

357
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,460
Well, I think your

358
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,460
follicles care, and I think

359
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,860
probably your dendrites

360
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
are deeply concerned.

361
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,420
The DNA molecule drives

362
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,540
everything that we do, and

363
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,520
we are powerless to stop it.

364
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,360
It will do anything to

365
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,700
keep us alive.

366
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:39,700


367
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:39,700


368
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,020
It will keep itself replicating.

369
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
Have you heard of the new DNA they found?

370
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,880
It completely replicates

371
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,660
human DNA, but it's like

372
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,440
a bacterium.

373
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,200
Hello? Hello.

374
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,800
Hello.

375
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,900
Your forehead is leaking

376
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,060
strange blue fluids.

377
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,720
Hello? Hello.

378
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,640
His forehead's making kind of a cool buzz.

379
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,120
Well, I think that's the cabinet it was built into.

380
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,560
Hello?

381
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,660
He won't speak. He keeps vibrating.

382
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,960
Hello? Hello.

383
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,660
Hello? Hello?

384
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,580
Are you a monster there?

385
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,240
I can make it worse if I turn my radio on.

386
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,180
Whoa.

387
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Oh, man. Don't take that pill.

388
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,740
Greetings, Reverend Funny Name.

389
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,020
Good to hear from you.

390
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,980
I hope you don't mind if I make my reply

391
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,160
in part during my

392
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,760
afternoon constitutional.

393
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,820
Congratulations, and well

394
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,660
done for buying a

395
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,760
gift membership to

396
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,660
the Church of the Subgenius for your

397
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,300
friend. Glad to hear it. Welcome.

398
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,820
And

399
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,660
your good taste will

400
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,300
pay off come X day.

401
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,820
Your friend asked

402
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,480
you, and you asked me, for

403
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,240
some advice for a new subgenius,

404
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,720
and I can

405
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,860
reply readily

406
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,400
in two parts.

407
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,540
First,

408
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,140
be miserable.

409
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,500
Be as miserable as

410
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,660
you know how to be.

411
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,640
Study miserable people

412
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,680
and do what they do.

413
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,620
And if you know people who are not at the moment

414
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,440
miserable,

415
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,300
avoid them and definitely

416
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,040
don't do what they do.

417
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,360
If you are miserable,

418
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,980
be more miserable.

419
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,640
That is my first piece of advice

420
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,580
for a new subgenius.

421
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
My second bit of advice

422
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,240
for a new subgenius is

423
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,540
don't only be

424
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,060
miserable.

425
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,620
And the reason is, we already

426
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,620
have a member in longstanding

427
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,560
who is miserable

428
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,120
all the time.

429
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,620
And your friend

430
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,740
is not that

431
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,900
member.

432
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,180
No, the role of

433
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,840
constantly miserable subgenius

434
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,760
has been filled,

435
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,800
and skillfully so.

436
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,400
Therefore,

437
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,860
that role

438
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,960
is occupied.

439
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,460
A new niche must be

440
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,880
discovered

441
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,000
for your friend,

442
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,200
and for yourself,

443
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,380
and for me, and for all of us.

444
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,300
We must find a way to

445
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,460
not be only miserable

446
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,180
all the time.

447
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
And so that second

448
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,340
piece of advice

449
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,920
in sum total is

450
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,900
be miserable

451
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,480
sometimes.

452
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,240
And other times

453
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,000
find some other way to be.

454
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,520
Perhaps filled with rage.

455
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,360
Perhaps in love.

456
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,800
Perhaps indifferent.

457
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,700
Happy sometimes.

458
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,920
Bored sometimes.

459
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,260
Asleep sometimes.

460
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,580
Enjoying the company of friends.

461
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,580
Or taking an afternoon

462
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,260
constitutional.

463
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,120
Many paths are available

464
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,880
to self-same

465
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,940
members of the church of the subgenius.

466
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,640
I thank you.

467
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,480
Let there be slack.

468
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,000
Thank you.

469
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,520
Thank you, Uncle Dr. Onan Canabite.

470
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,820
So uplifting

471
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,340
from such an unexpected angle.

472
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,720
Subgeniuses,

473
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,340
have you checked out

474
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,640
Dobbs.town on the internet?

475
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,620
It's a newish

476
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,000
and non-Facebook forum

477
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,900
that's being used by

478
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,780
some of the best subgeniuses.

479
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,820
The hundred million new ones

480
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,740
that I don't know.

481
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,160
But now, Sheridan muses.

482
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,200
With Lemurian in-betweens.

483
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,440
In my time,

484
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,720
I filled out a lot of job applications.

485
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,620
One thing that puzzles me

486
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,340
is not when they ask

487
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,840
for your present address.

488
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,400
It's the next line

489
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,980
where they ask for your permanent address.

490
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,360
Permanent is so final

491
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,900
and unrealistic

492
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,480
in any economy.

493
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,540
There's dwelling options.

494
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,960
There are landlords and evictions.

495
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,260
Buildings have burned down.

496
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,720
Entire cities

497
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,860
washed down the drain of too bad.

498
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,820
Sorry for your loss.

499
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,020
Here's money.

500
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
But really,

501
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,000
how would your parents feel

502
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,360
if at age 16,

503
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,640
you inked their house in

504
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,200
as your permanent address?

505
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,000
So I finally snapped.

506
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,500
Today, I put down the only logical answer.

507
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,400
Technology be damned.

508
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,020
Today, under permanent address,

509
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,080
I wrote,

510
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:46,420
I will ask Jesus to help me

511
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,880
to keep my heart from sin.

512
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,040
After reflecting his goodness

513
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,580
and all we shine for him.

514
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,900
A sunbeam, a sunbeam.

515
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,140
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam.

516
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm a sunbeam.

517
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,340


518
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,340


519
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,340


520
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,340


521
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,340


522
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,340


523
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,340


524
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,660
A sunbeam, a sunbeam.

525
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,020
I'll be a sunbeam for him.

526
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:36,880
But I don't know what to do.

527
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,340
I'm not sure I'm a sunbeam.

528
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,340


529
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,340


530
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,340


531
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,340


532
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,340


533
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,060
Any one be positive

534
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,960
that you're not worried about

535
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,880
being mistaken?

536
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,700
Man, that's a technical problem,

537
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:49,700


538
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:49,880
is more greetable than do open

539
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,680
your eyes and

540
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:50,680


541
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:50,700
that happens to you

542
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:50,700


543
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,160
That actually.

544
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,020
Whatever it is,

545
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,200
let it be.

546
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,340
Every single being

547
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,760
This is PR. The U.S. military has been seriously injured in a car crash in Las Vegas.

548
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,000
President Trump addresses Nevada's PR news.

549
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:25,500
We're going to talk to you about the most urgent thing that is on our mind and what we suspect is

550
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:33,200
the most urgent thing on the minds of those who will connect with us. We'll title this tape.

551
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:43,560
Now, the reason this is such an interesting tape is, well, what's this tape? This is such a doomsday

552
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:56,000
statement tape, and that's absurd. Well, now, we're on the end of the absurd doomsday. What's this?

553
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:03,080
What's all this? What's all this? Well, we suspect that that's pretty major. Well, we speak of

554
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:11,500
human ways only because we suspect this is the end of human ignorance of how we would speak of

555
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:20,380
human behavior. Absurd, absurd. Well, we speak of this world just on the tail end of that

556
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,760
window, if I can speak of it that way.

557
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,060
Well, we suspect that that's the end of human behavior. Well, we suspect that that's the end of human behavior.

558
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,800
Abnormal.

559
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,820
Abnormal.

560
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,440
Abnormal.

561
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,940
Abnormal.

562
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,880
Octopus salad and pink cocaine

563
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,220
Hamburgers, pudding and black champagne

564
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,280
Tempest arises and the walls melt away

565
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,160
Floating green iron or milky gray

566
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,900
Well, okay, I had a nasty twist for ten thousand days

567
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,240
I've been wrapping my head around a tangled maze

568
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,720
It's raining holy hell down on my big old brain

569
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,200
And there's too many numbers to keep track

570
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,100
Of the names and it's mildly mercury

571
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,520
And retrograde, cause I've been yapping all day

572
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,700
But ain't got much to say

573
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,060
La la la la la la la la

574
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,620
We gon' play it

575
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,580
Just tell me which molecule make the ring get paid

576
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,140
Which molecule make the ring get paid

577
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,400
Which molecule make the ring get paid

578
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,340
Look, it's buried in any cell

579
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,340


580
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,340


581
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,340


582
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,340


583
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,340


584
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,340


585
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,180
I'mreceived collective badge, love too cheese enormous Remember that

586
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,660
They seek the gift of better living

587
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,400
They seek the gift of better living

588
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:53,200
They seek the gift of better living

589
00:30:53,220 --> 00:31:23,200
They seek the gift of better living

590
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,140
Like I am, you feel all your internal organs being massaged with vibrations from this

591
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:50,640
Better living through confirmation bias

592
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,200
Is the name of the algorithm

593
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,640
And cult of Zier is the artist

594
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,820
A whole new album from Reverend Moog of Portland

595
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,840
I bought that album online from cult of Zier

596
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,740
Spelled Z-I-R

597
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,460
And I got a cult coffee mug along with the download

598
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:21,720
See, our refrigerator is decorated largely with his startling subgenius fridge magnet art

599
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,200
And I got a cult coffee mug along with the download

600
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,760
And cult of Zier performed at our Portland revival

601
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,300
Back a long time ago before the nightly battles started out there

602
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,880
If there were more revivals there

603
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,600
Maybe there wouldn't be so much strife

604
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,580
Anyway, here's another short story

605
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,380
From Sheridan of Cleveland

606
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,560
Firebee doesn't need anything

607
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,180
Firebee doesn't need anything

608
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,580
If her dad doesn't show up in good enough time to change the lightbulb in her penthouse apartment

609
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,040
She'll settle for a special 1 3rd scale Nordstrom scented candle

610
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,380
Beyond that, she's happy dancing around naked in her cutaway half house

611
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,300
Trying on clothes

612
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,180
Near sighted Barbie can only see the glow of the sun in her penthouse apartment

613
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,180


614
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,180


615
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,040
alarms

616
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,280
Aünkin

617
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Aünkin has got to swing across pale green

618
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:33,320
Aünkin goes right‑to where the stars are

619
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,320
And our kid wins

620
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:42,940
Aünkin absolutely wins

621
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,380
Aünkin sticks sawing and enjoying the light as soon as部 palette closes

622
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,260
Shooting now

623
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:50,260


624
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,320
We try on our contradictor

625
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,160
We try on our spectacles

626
00:33:53,160 --> 00:34:04,300
is the best to be found and surely he must, must meet this beautiful, flawless, lustful thing.

627
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:13,460
He watches as she pulls out her brush before the mirror.

628
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:32,080
One, ten, fifty, ninety-nine, one hundred strokes across those beautiful locks of golden synthetic strands.

629
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:41,620
She stands after one last hair flip and turns out the light for bed.

630
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:50,800
In that fleeting glimpse before the darkness, he sees that she is perfectly clean-shaven.

631
00:34:53,180 --> 00:35:00,460
A gnat lands on the lens of this harbor freight telescope, free flashlight with any purchase,

632
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,640
and he kills it with one puff of his bad breath.

633
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,100
He tries to time her daily morning departure.

634
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,900
It is as inconsistent as his own slacker schedule.

635
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:30,700
Without using the lens, he cannot read which uptown RTA stacker buck picks her up.

636
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,040
Where does she go?

637
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,380
Probably shopping for more accessories, he would have to guess.

638
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:50,120
One day, he sidles up to the curb and engages her in his bright red convertible,

639
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:58,900
top-down, top-not included in the package, all other accessories, including steering wheel, sold separately.

640
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,540
She looks down her impossibly perfect chiseled pointed nose.

641
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,080
I mean, really, have you ever seen a nose like that anywhere?

642
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,440
People, it's a nose.

643
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,660
It just can't be done.

644
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,200
But that Jackson fella sure did try, and look how that turned out.

645
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:30,420
She looks at him, long and hard, almost as if she could see right through his plastic shell.

646
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,920
You think I'm a hooker, honey?

647
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:42,100
She yells, loud enough that it catches the attention of the police officer standing nearby.

648
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,920
I'm not a hooker, honey.

649
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,260
News for you, bitch.

650
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,100
I just dressed like one.

651
00:36:52,020 --> 00:37:00,940
Tires squeal as he speeds away, and he wonders if it was the gas stench from topping off at the last fill-up.

652
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:13,160
Barbie casually wanders off and searches for her next fix from someone not so shallow.

653
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,600
So I'm sure we're all supposed to speak about what I'd been in any different way for a pretty long time.

654
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:31,600


655
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,700
Measure them, rendezvous with цел backup.

656
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:34,700


657
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,340
AiE satisfied or not?

658
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,200
Un hallucinate, then go and break up.

659
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,920
You just can't hold out, more like get it back.

660
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,040
ден

661
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,040


662
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,220
Shackled.

663
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,840
Disappointed

664
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,440
This is getting план's note, so go and Google me.

665
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,440


666
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,000
어지acue!

667
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,140
Disinformation, you're with the brain punch, so why'd you leave the ending news?

668
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,440
It's all the same, just the names of their chains.

669
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,820
You, scripted and staged for your entertainment.

670
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,580
Disinformation, it's a friendly tie with a suited guy.

671
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:13,920
Radiating bodily knowledge, ruminating stories of human interest.

672
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:22,360
Univated, crispy carnage, so what a bummer dog, he won't get to fall for disinformation.

673
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,560
Oh, you bastards, Peter Jennings, damn fucking brother.

674
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:36,800
I hate you all, I wish you all would shut up, get off my TV, I hate you.

675
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,440
Disinformation!

676
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,880
The song disinformation from the mystery band called Thunk!

677
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,380
Exclamation point.

678
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:21,840
I hope there's not more than one cuss word in that song, because my hearing aids let me catch only one.

679
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,620
Basically, friends, I have to struggle to hear lyrics.

680
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:33,540
Folks who send audio to us should also include lyrics, text if possible.

681
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,080
I seriously can barely hear.

682
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,720
And yet, now this.

683
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,900
From PR News in Washington, I'm the wife of the Prime Minister.

684
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,720
President Donald Trump is holding and speaking.

685
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,160
The Dow's 99-24-458-6017.

686
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,480
President Donald Trump claimed at least one life.

687
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,340
President Donald Trump caused widespread damage throughout the region.

688
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,060
President Donald Trump had to be rescued from as many as 30 hundred.

689
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,500
homes. Well, the U.S. House is set to vote this afternoon on a pair of PR news.

690
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:20,720
Substances, that's what we need here. Let me out. I'm not dead. Let me out.

691
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:27,940
Isn't this music about evolution or something? This is the first scene follows this amoeba for

692
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:33,500
about 4,000 million years. That's the first movement. We see the scene. And the amoeba

693
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:40,480
splits in half and eats itself. And it never evolves because it eats itself and splits in half,

694
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,500
eats itself and splits in half. He becomes larger and gives birth to many more children,

695
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,000
shown in this diagram here. Until lightning strikes nearby. And then there's monkeys

696
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,980
swinging from trees. As soon as the lightning clears, the smoke clears. And there is the force

697
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,340
of Zeus as the lightning bearer, stretching each one of those monkeys down.

698
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,660
Then as soon as the rain dries up, the trees die away, like within two hours.

699
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:13,080
So the monkeys don't have as many trees to swing around in. And they have to jump down to the

700
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:18,160
ground and run from one group of trees to the other. And they found that, you know, after a

701
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,680
while, they stood up. They could run faster if they stood up, not on all fours. And right about

702
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:33,060
that time, their heads started getting bigger. And I am lonely and I shall create me man from

703
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:42,120
mud of the earth. And he shall slay all these nearly evolved other primates. And so God rose up,

704
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:49,320
the first completely created, unevolved homo sapiens. And now for a limited time only, you can

705
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:57,180
own in your very own home this unlimited collection of man's original homo sapien. And that was exactly

706
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,860
2,714 years ago that happened.

707
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:01,580
Yep.

708
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,180
Beijing.

709
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,420
And then God played.

710
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,720
He placed all the fossils.

711
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,920
And many varieties of homo sapiens.

712
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,320
To test the faith of the scientists and the geologists.

713
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:12,720
Yes.

714
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,660
That is what is the crux of everything in reality is testing science.

715
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:24,980
If you're out in the African desert somewhere and you find a skull, it was planted there by God just a few thousand years ago.

716
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,700
So you could lick it.

717
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,340
It's right next to where Lucy was.

718
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,980
Well, we're walking around the savannah, right?

719
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,140
You go down a few feet deeper than Lucy even.

720
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,020
And you see the skull, man. He's like, what the hell?

721
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,320
And there's another.

722
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,220
You know, it could be billions of years old, right?

723
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,280
Yeah.

724
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,320
Well, there were cavemen and dinosaurs running around back then.

725
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,560
But the great deluge came and smashed a lot of them.

726
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,040
Suck on the eye socket, you know?

727
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,840
Was that when Noah?

728
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,420
Yeah.

729
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,580
When Noah managed.

730
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,580
But see, the dinosaurs were too big.

731
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,900
And that's why they didn't survive.

732
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:56,620
And the Australopithecines and the Andorhans, Paleoanthropocas and so forth were all too smelly.

733
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,000
That was their only defense.

734
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,280
And so Noah and his family.

735
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,400
Actually, Noah's wife didn't let them off.

736
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,760
There's no account.

737
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,720
No suitcase.

738
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,060
He was going to let the other erect humanoid primates off.

739
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:13,460
Them three brothers just shouted they were going to erect human eggs from primates by taking two of each kind.

740
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:19,780
And why did these other ones, these non-godly primates, why did they bury their dead ceremoniously?

741
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,980
Like Neanderthals buried their dead ceremoniously in some of the other...

742
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,720
They were Satanists.

743
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,240
Yes.

744
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:25,980
Neutral primates.

745
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,020
They were burying them to the wrong god.

746
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,600
Yes, the neutral primates are all Satanists.

747
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,000
So they were also lost in the great flood.

748
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,240
But many of them had not learned the correct prayers.

749
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,080
So as their prayers are uttered throughout the woods and picked up thousands of years from the sound of the...

750
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,540
The Grand Canyon was cut 2303 years ago.

751
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,480
The Grand Canyon was cut down?

752
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:46,800
That's right.

753
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,700
De-neuded? Deforested? Deforested?

754
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,240
Actually, it was, what was it? 4600...

755
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,380
Oh, you mean when it split its swath through the gland.

756
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,160
The fundament was created 4,000 years ago.

757
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,360
The mighty girdle of the Colorado which spans...

758
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,980
Now that's taught in Sunday.

759
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,360
Some schools.

760
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,300
And in some it's just loose.

761
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,600
Some's taught, some's loose.

762
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,080
Well, how come...

763
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,420
They give, you know...

764
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,060
How come there's no mention of the Americas in the Bible?

765
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,180
It's a touchy-feely thing, Chaz. We don't wanna...

766
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,140
Oh, that's the true... That's where the true Israel migrated to, don't you see?

767
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,940
Have you not read your Identity Christianity textbook?

768
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,540
Yes, sir.

769
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,360
Which would tell you that when...

770
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,960
Yay, the tribe of Israel moved into the Northland where was Gog and Magog.

771
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,720
But see, this is actually...

772
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:37,900
If you see the true interpretation of the Gnostic clubhouse,

773
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,220
you would see that this actually means the British Isles.

774
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,820
There he is.

775
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,400
Wow.

776
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,160
The picture of Der Fuhrer, he's so cute.

777
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,980
The ones masquerading as God's chosen people are of course merely the Khazar, Asiatic,

778
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,640
Yeti-like humanoids.

779
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,720
That's actually kind of part of the teaching of some identity Christianity.

780
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,420
Identity Christianity things, which is such a silly superstition compared to identity subgenius.

781
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,760
They have...

782
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,000
Where we know that the...

783
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,380
Let's... We can speak seriously.

784
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,980
True chosen ones...

785
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,460
Those people of who you speak...

786
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,380
Are those who have sent their $30 to J.R.R.

787
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:21,760
...have regurgitated a religion, a substantially sick religion,

788
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,860
which existed in the 1840s based on white supremacy and other forms of insanity,

789
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,960
and also filtered through their Lucifer-like Nazism.

790
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:36,260
Oh, actually, everybody ripped off the Zoroastrians.

791
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,560
Oh, you can go to any old bookstore and there's some crack who says that

792
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,700
the true Israelites are guys who look just like me and who like bland food and can't dance.

793
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,740
That's the substance of their religion, that God was one of them.

794
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,820
Gots mit tans!

795
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,000
Remember that old phrase, gots mit tans?

796
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,120
All I know is that they're right...

797
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,180
That was the Nazis, I should say.

798
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,480
We are in some...

799
00:45:59,480 --> 00:45:59,940
...gottes mit tans.

800
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,020
Deep doopoo.

801
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,300
Deep deep.

802
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,300
We are in some...

803
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,720
Deep Dobbs hairdo, my friends.

804
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,800
If the Southern Baptists, if the identity Christians are right...

805
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,500
Or for that matter, friends, if any rival cult is right, most of us are doomed.

806
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,460
But if the Church of the Subgenius is right, most of you are doomed.

807
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,920
And most of us are...

808
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,840
...saved, saved, saved.

809
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,380
Yeah, if you follow our subject, you're saved.

810
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:29,580
You're saved.

811
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,080
Yeah, but we're still going to be saved.

812
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,080


813
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,300
...derminated by your own silly machinations.

814
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,940
Utopia after utopia for a thousand lifetimes.

815
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,720
...saving of silly machinations.

816
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,860
Check out a beautiful backseat on this Jesus Chrysler mobile.

817
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,300
To come.

818
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,420
And...

819
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,440
And also some of the expensive furniture in the very front, which is a digital replay

820
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,520
of everything that previously happened.

821
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,400
Come on, to Bob and Connie.

822
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,540
Oh Lord, you'll be loving it all on the way to paradise.

823
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:51,840
To come.

824
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,680
Just as you are.

825
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,640
Step on up.

826
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,940
Step on up.

827
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,660
Make me step on up.

828
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,360
Stand on my foot so I get the hang of this.

829
00:46:59,360 --> 00:46:59,360


830
00:46:59,360 --> 00:46:59,360


831
00:46:59,360 --> 00:46:59,360


832
00:46:59,360 --> 00:46:59,360


833
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,420
And Bob said unto the masses,

834
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,640
Step right up and form here.

835
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:17,440
Gaze unto this so awesome oleum serpentum, oil of the great snake.

836
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,260
Ah, snake oil.

837
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,240
Snake oil.

838
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,340
In a dream, Jesus the Lord, the Lord came to me and said,

839
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,520
I have been walking with you.

840
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,400
Here's your path.

841
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,160
And he showed me the path of my life.

842
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:35,000
And all along the way, there was two sets of footprints.

843
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,960
But every now and then, there was only one set of footprints.

844
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,880
And I turned to the Lord and I said,

845
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,360
Lord, what's going on there?

846
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,020
You want me to do it like Scabby?

847
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:47,520
Yeah.

848
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,220
And what did he say, brother?

849
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,180
What's going on there?

850
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,300
Jesus, come here.

851
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,600
And what did Jesus say to you now?

852
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,620
And there's only one set of footprints here and here.

853
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,160
And who's the worst?

854
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,280
In the times of my life, there was only one set of footprints.

855
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:07,020
And the Lord said, well, son, that's when I abandoned you.

856
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,160
Couldn't take your misery.

857
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,100
You're a pathetic loser at those times.

858
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,460
I couldn't stand looking at you.

859
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:17,080
Thank you for that wonderful interpretation of the usual retreat.

860
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,460
But I realize it's good to be a loser.

861
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,200
It's good to be an idiot.

862
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,820
It's better to be an idiot.

863
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,840
Then you don't know what's wrong with you.

864
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,280
You are forgiven.

865
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,120
You are forgiven, my son.

866
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,640
I thought you were going to end that with,

867
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,660
well, Scabby, that's when I was humping you on the neck.

868
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,540
God so loved the idiot and the drunkard that he protected him in the car wreck.

869
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,540
That would have been much better.

870
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,740
I should have gave it to you.

871
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,000
Jumped on your back and humped him.

872
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,300
The hardworking house mom was instead taken by the angels.

873
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,120
Come on down.

874
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,900
Your clam cakes, they're alive.

875
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:56,840
For God loves drunks and protects them and lets hardworking moms fall by the wayside.

876
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,560
And his great vengeance.

877
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:58,960
What is that?

878
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,220
Chaz?

879
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,500
Chaz?

880
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,800
Could you help me?

881
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,820
I think Rogers died.

882
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,780
And he was.

883
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,700
And he was died.

884
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,580
He's gone.

885
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:22,300
The stark fist of removal is real, my friends, and it hovers over each and every one of us.

886
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,580
And that's when you tied your shoe boots today.

887
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,260
For the very...

888
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,760
You don't tie them tonight.

889
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,940
Will the Undertaker be untying them shoes tonight, friend?

890
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,640
Are you ready?

891
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:41,960
Have you made peace with your god or goddess or thing or totem pole, whatever it may be?

892
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,280
I'm afraid that Jolly Roger is really flying the skull and crossbones this sad afternoon.

893
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:56,320
Your guardian angel or your guardian demon or your little guardian alien gray or your lucky rabbit's foot.

894
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,520
Or your winning lottery number or your special anti-baldness formula.

895
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,580
That inorganic penis licker, that's one demerit.

896
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,140
Your ear candling equipment.

897
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,940
Your auto jack.

898
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,300
Your...

899
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:18,120
The frozen peace pipe and eye remover, that's two demerits.

900
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:23,200
Your hobby, your addiction, your crutch.

901
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,600
Your elation upon riding into the little train tube.

902
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,820
That's 60 merits.

903
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,720
Face it.

904
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,600
You're hooked.

905
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,080
Kick that crutch away, my friend.

906
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,840
Become yourself the crutch of Bob Dobbs.

907
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,660
Let Bob lean on you.

908
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,360
I see the light.

909
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,900
And you'll walk again.

910
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,080
Kick that crutch away and walk.

911
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:45,500
I...

912
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,700
Walk and let Bob limp on you.

913
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:49,760
But I...

914
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,340
I never could walk.

915
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,420
Throw yourself into that pipe and light yourself up.

916
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,320
Yes, friends.

917
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,760
Light yourself up.

918
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,840
Not that naked woman on the hill, Chris,

919
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,360
screaming incoherently, driving a Porsche.

920
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,760
No, not that cheesy cab driver with the Iranian accent.

921
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,680
All of you, yes, all of you,

922
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,740
there is a cause for disturbance.

923
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,840
Each and every one of you is entreated to become one

924
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,840
with a new type of human being.

925
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,460
A new species of man.

926
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:26,680
A new kind.

927
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:31,280
A big blue onion in the sea.

928
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,540
An overman.

929
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,680
An uberwoman.

930
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,040
The frozen overwoman.

931
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,340
A great woman.

932
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,320
Hairy and muscular uberwoman.

933
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,760
Oh, dear.

934
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,040
I don't think of your appearance now.

935
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,840
You die.

936
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:56,980
No.

937
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,720
We rejoin the evolution of mankind back on the savannah

938
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,940
as three more lightning boats have zapped five more families

939
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,440
of small monkey-like semi-human beings.

940
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,420
They've just returned from a bowling alley

941
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,880
and Grandpa's taken a nap.

942
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,860
But things aren't going to be much...

943
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,240
I am your descendant.

944
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,120
And I, your descendator.

945
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,480
Listen to us very carefully, if you can listen at all.

946
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,360
We know that you're ill.

947
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:41,420
But I don't think we have enough sleep.

948
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,460
I look like sleepwalking here on hell.

949
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:46,760
I only need to have food and to drink.

950
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,560
There are about 600 of these littleforce you have onio...

951
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,560
NOPE.

952
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,340
So why'd you record the concerned species

953
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:51,340


954
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:51,340


955
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:55,380
Because they're not gonna make their lives any simpler.

956
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,340
some other alternate

957
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,400
further on in the universe.

958
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,500
One day there will be a last

959
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,200
perfect day on Earth

960
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,820
and then the sun will start

961
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,720
to shrink and they repulse

962
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,780
and shrink a little bit and then it'll

963
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,520
expand out

964
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,780
consuming Mercury, Venus

965
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,560
and Earth

966
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,820
inside of itself.

967
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,180
Eventually

968
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,800
after that the sun will slowly

969
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,740
use up the

970
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,480
hydrogen's gone, now it's just the helium

971
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,800
burning slowly that gets used up

972
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,880
and it becomes a white

973
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,140
dwarf

974
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,520
only about the size of the Earth

975
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,720
and then it becomes a brown

976
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,500
dwarf colder yet

977
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,840
than just a little

978
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,620
orb of black

979
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,860
schmuck in space.

980
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,640
Black dwarf.

981
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,720
Of course if the sun was

982
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,640
a lot bigger it would turn into a black hole though.

983
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,620
Hey man, you don't know

984
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,900
where I could get some of that

985
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,880
neutron matter?

986
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,900
Dwarf neutron matter.

987
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,640
Oh yeah man, you want neutron matter?

988
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,320
A teaspoon full of it would weigh as much as a mountain.

989
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,460
Let's sing this song.

990
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,600
Shall we sing this song?

991
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,720
As much as 19 Earths.

992
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,040
Come on guys, let's sing this song.

993
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,540
An atom of it would weigh as much as a mountain.

994
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,040
A teaspoon of neutron matter makes the medicine

995
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,100
go down. Come on, let's sing it now.

996
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,680
A teaspoon of neutron matter

997
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,940
makes the medicine

998
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,800
go down.

999
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:24,480


1000
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,700
I'd like to take another shower this year,

1001
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,940
but my friend in his wisdom,

1002
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,880
knowing I'm an alcoholic,

1003
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,220
bought me a new shower curtain

1004
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,360
that looks like a close up

1005
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,460
of a frog's mouth.

1006
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:54,740
I'll take another shower,

1007
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


1008
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,360
a glassy cold beer.

1009
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,600
I will finish my beer,

1010
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,440
rinse the glass,

1011
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,600
head towards the shower,

1012
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,660
and suddenly be parched,

1013
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,660
and I will drink another beer.

1014
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,480
Wash the glass,

1015
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,240
approach the shower,

1016
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,300
become dry and raspy,

1017
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,640
down another beer.

1018
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,420
Hose the glass,

1019
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,680
stand before the shower, thirsty.

1020
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,420
Suck a few more beers in, rinse and repeat.

1021
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:26,400
Currently, my glass is cleaner than I am,

1022
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,760
and I forgot why I'm standing in the bathroom.

1023
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,920
So I just take a piss

1024
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,580
and have another beer.

1025
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,560
Thank you ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland

1026
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,420
and then Sheridan.

1027
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,180
Also from Cleveland.

1028
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,920
Heck, I guess I was from Cleveland for almost 20 years,

1029
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,540
and I still kind of am.

1030
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,440
Even though it's now.

I say thanks too

1048
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,140
to Apple,

1049
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,500
for maybe

1050
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,200
ending this show

1051
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:31,440

1052
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,800
the

1053
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:32,800


1054
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
AFRICAN

1055
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,360
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1056
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,480
Think about it.

1057
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,440
Who is the last guy to say to you these words?

1058
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,100
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1059
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,920
Who?

1060
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,600
I say, don't trade Bob for eagle stamps.

1061
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,280
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1062
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,200
Who?

1063
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,800
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1064
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,440
Take a rubber chicken to lunch.

1065
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,600
Fake your orgasms two in a row.

1066
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:21,660
I say, the ultra-bizarre is a belch of the mind.

1067
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,980
I'll choke daily.

1068
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,840
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1069
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,600
The moonies are groovy, but Bob...

1070
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,420
Bob.

1071
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,100
It's Bob.

1072
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,720
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1073
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,120
Eat your spinach, baby.

1074
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,940
Eat your spinach, baby.

1075
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,440
Eat your spinach, baby.

1076
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,140
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1077
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,100
Take a rubber chicken to lunch.

1078
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,920
Fake your orgasms two in a row.

1079
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,560
The moonies are groovy, but Bob...

1080
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,940
Bob.

1081
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:26,940


1082
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:27,360
Is Bob.

1083
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,140
Is Bob.

1084
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:30,700
Bob.

1085
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,520
