00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
And welcome, dear friends, to the Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,220
Praise Bob!

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,860
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,640
Turn on the machine.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,360
This is Radio Yerevan.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,980
Wake up, puppet boy!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,660
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,660
There is absolutely no other possibility.

Copyright 1986 by the Subgenius Foundation and the participants.

10
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,120
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

11
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,200
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,380
The Subgenius Hour of Slack!

13
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:29,680
The practice of hallucinatory drugs was big back in then and they were hearing these messages that the Beatles were placing backwards.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
Bob, I'm so...

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,660
We smell Bob.

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,340
A silver light.

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,520
Well, friends, I'm married. I'm not a virgin anymore since the last show.

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
But enough of the future, friends.

19
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,420
There's a pics of the wedding and so forth on SubSight as there are logs of these shows.

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,860
But tonight we're going into the past.

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,980
I'm playing a rerun of Ancient Hour of Slack show number 50.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,760
51.

23
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,300
The beloved anti-drug special.

24
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,040
Part 1, take 1.

25
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,760
And next week we'll be following that with the pro-frog special.

26
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,400
And these shows, friends, are truly old.

27
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,460
These are from 1986.

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,360
Only the names of the presidents have been changed and yet nothing has changed, friends.

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,860
Except that back then we said man instead of...

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,940
Dude.

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,640
But in this ancient show, friends, we'll be hearing from puzzling evidence.

32
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,560
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,500
Doctors for Bob.

34
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,460
Buck Naked.

35
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,860
The Rainmakers.

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,300
D.K. Jones.

37
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,720
Dick Gregory.

38
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,140
Steppenwolf.

39
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,100
Nina Hagen.

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,280
The Firesign Theater.

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,320
Art Linkletter.

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,160
Alice Cooper.

43
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,160
Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh.

44
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,120
St. Palmer Vreedies.

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,320
Frank Zappa.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,440
And...

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,860
Oh.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,480
Friends.

49
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,040
Oh, the last poets.

50
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,040
Alan Watts.

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,940
Dr. Philo Drummond.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,420
And beautiful collages by...

53
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,040
Hell Pope Huey.

54
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,320
Byron Werner.

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
And yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,820
So let's go back, back, back in time to that anti-drug special.

57
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,360
This one's for Dr. X.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,040
May he rest in peace.

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,220
Now you're saying...

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,840
Now, now, now.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
Reverend Stang, what is this?

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,580
The subgenius anti-drug special?

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,260
What is it?

64
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:44,500
The church of the subgenius joining with the conspiracy on its big fad of anti-drug mega-hype

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,920
and holier-than-thou witch-burning?

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,280
And I answer nay-nay.

67
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,540
This is the anti-mega-hype we're hyping.

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,660
Not that we've ever condoned drug addiction.

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,200
Of course not, friends.

70
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,320
This is a church.

71
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,400
The only drug you need is Bob, my friend.

72
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,340
Bob will get you high and keep you there.

73
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,600
No, we're just anti-certain drugs, just like the conspiracy is.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,380
They only hate the drugs that they're not on.

75
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,200
Death to pushers.

76
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,160
That's what Ronald and Nancy, if that really is her name, Reagan, say.

77
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Death to pushers.

78
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,760
Oh, yeah.

79
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,220
And yet, dear friends,

80
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:37,560
they continue to use the United States government to support the tobacco industry

81
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,500
and the alcohol industry.

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,760
Oh, oh, but we're only against drugs, they say.

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,140
There's nothing wrong with being able to have a little drinky-winky now and then, is there?

84
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,580
And one cigarette never killed anybody,

85
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,420
unless it's lit right next to a leaky tank full of church air.

86
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,200
That's what Ronald Reagan said.

87
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,020
Oh, death to marijuana pushers.

88
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,160
But subsidize the tobacco industry and the liquor industry.

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,740
Oh, friends, you know, lips that have touched the bottle will never touch mine.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:25,260
Though I do partake occasionally of the holy frop admixture prescribed by my personal physician,

91
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,840
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

92
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,000
But like Bob himself said,

93
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,520
I frop that others may live.

94
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,400
And, friends, frop ain't one of those conspiracy street drugs.

95
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
Uh-uh, but we'll be talking about frop later, maybe even next week.

96
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,800
I know, I know y'all want to know what frop really is and how to get you some,

97
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,560
but we're just going to have to listen.

98
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,520
You're going to have to listen real, real close in stereo headphones tonight, friends,

99
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,960
if you even want to gain but an inkling.

100
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,880
Drugs have become an escape for a nation of ignored youth.

101
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,780
Many parents too busy to stop, listen, and love.

102
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,540
.

103
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,080
.

104
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,660
Bob said I'm going to give you drugs.

105
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,340
Bob said I'm going to give you pills.

106
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,680
.

107
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,180
.

108
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,180


109
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,680
a false flag of the conspiracy.

110
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,260
He's a son of

111
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,020
water. He's a

112
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,740
god that sat down.

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,200
He's a

114
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,140
pyrocladulator.

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,020
And three-year-olds can't

116
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,280
read.

117
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,800
Hi there, Mrs. Garvin.

118
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,060
Okay.

119
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,940
And so she had found the answer to her affection

120
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,540
by herself.

121
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,320
Okay. Bye.

122
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,740
Here comes Mrs. Darvon again

123
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,040
in her nice soft dress.

124
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,080
Hi, Mr. Valium.

125
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,520
Hi. Well,

126
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,060
today we're going to make sure that everybody

127
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,000
feels okay.

128
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,820
That's right.

129
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,040
Yes. They're eating Kool-Aid and pills.

130
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,320
Yeah.

131
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,560
Miss Valium.

132
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,200
Well, I'm sad

133
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,680
today.

134
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah.

135
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,260
in the day and pills in the

136
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,620
night. Yeah, pills.

137
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,780
Pills.

138
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,560
Talking about pills.

139
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,660
Pills.

140
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,200
Pills for the

141
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,160
bad and pills for the

142
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,080
good. Pills for the

143
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,660
young and misunderstood.

144
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,580
Pills.

145
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,400
Talking about pills.

146
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,480
Pills.

147
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,880
Pills in my

148
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,740
hamper. Pills in my

149
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,020
sick.

150
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,820
Pills in the woods and pills on the rocks, yeah, pills.

151
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,120
Pills.

152
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,340
Talking about pills now.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,880
Pills.

154
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,580
Pills are the only things to do.

155
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,740
Pills are better friends than you, yeah, pills.

156
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,640
Pills.

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,020
Talking about pills now.

158
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:25,560
Pills.

159
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,540
My friends, the pills.

160
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, just give me some of them pills.

161
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,880
Oh, give me those pills, Bob.

162
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,600
Can we have some pills over here, please?

163
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,640
Here, have some pills.

164
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,880
I don't think you should be taking all those pills in the morning.

165
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,460
Can I have some pills, please, from my heart?

166
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,060
More pills.

167
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,780
And that's just the sort of thing I was talking about.

168
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,400
Exactly, gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen.

169
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,900
Hello to you in Dallas, Texas.

170
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,320
This is the secret Reverend Bleepo Abernathy speaking to you over the airwaves of your local radio station there,

171
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,520
courtesy of...

172
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:04,320
Stang and the Reverend Bucknaked, for which I am glad to present this opportunity to myself to speak at this time.

173
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,760
First of all, I want to say that none of the pills are ever good enough, as you all know.

174
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,980
And as you're out there, you know, you cannot feel anything without some sort of pill.

175
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,840
Now, that pill could be, of course, you know, your average, you know, vitamin or dexatrim or something like that.

176
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Or it can be Jesus.

177
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,400
It's any kind of pill that you mention at all.

178
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,560
We don't want to get too specific here.

179
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,700
But let's just face it, friends, you're all looking for a pill.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,320
And I don't know.

181
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know.

182
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,760
And we're not talking a quart of pills.

183
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,040
We're talking a bucket of pills.

184
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
Which is sometimes...

185
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,920
Some people relate to half an old-fashioned bathtub full of pills.

186
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,380
Like, sometimes, I don't know how much quarts of pills go for in Dallas right now.

187
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,980
But I think in New York, you can get about a half a handful of pills for what, like a pint of pills might cost you in Austin.

188
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,280
Or...

189
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,960
Chicago.

190
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,720
But we're in Dallas now, so we're talking quarts of pills.

191
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,840
But this is just...

192
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,780
Heleopters full of pills.

193
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,820
These are all legal.

194
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,660
They're not drugs.

195
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,400
These are herbs.

196
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,000
They've been smuggled in by Tibetan llamas, which have been working for Bob for centuries.

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,160
I heard they put them on the bellies of sea turtles at one point.

198
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,080
They'd fit them in the Atlantic.

199
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,700
They put them on...

200
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,820
A seven-year voyage together.

201
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,880
They put them on your tongue.

202
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,800
They put them on...

203
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,240
They might put them on...

204
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,080
Funguses that you're...

205
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,040
They put them in your nose.

206
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
You can put them in your shoes.

207
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,160
And Bob makes the best pills ever.

208
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,740
He never was made.

209
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,340
Yeah!

210
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,380
Yeah!

211
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,860
Yeah!

212
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,820
Get pills!

213
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,320
Yeah!

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,240
Get them...

215
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,160
Get them pills!

216
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,940
Get them pills!

217
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,440
And you feel...

218
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,220
You feel wise.

219
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,220
Your heart feels wise.

220
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,720
You're buying.

221
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,540
And you know that you're the only one, and the rest of them are wrong, and you're the

222
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,360
only one that's right.

223
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,960
And that's how you're supposed to feel, because you got the pills of Bob in you.

224
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,600
That's right.

225
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,920
Possess these children with the fire of thy holy way.

226
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,140
Fill them with the blood of Jesus.

227
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,960
Fill them with the blood of your passion that will enable their weak spirits to move

228
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,900
in pursuit of your holy work.

229
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,940
Oh, go on.

230
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,220
Two million you bastard cowards!

231
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,720
We don't want to live anyway.

232
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,660
Not in a stinking water like this.

233
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,340
Oh?

234
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,780
And what's so stinking about it?

235
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,580
It's a stinking water because there's no law, no other anymore.

236
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,120
It's a stinking water because it lets the young get a bit of the fun.

237
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,120


238
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,120


239
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,120


240
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,120


241
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,120


242
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,980
Now to the old, look you, darling.

243
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,860
Oh, it's no water for an old man any longer.

244
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,840
What sort of water is it at all?

245
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,980
Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth.

246
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,680
And there's not no attention paid to earthly.

247
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,140
No, no, there's no more.

248
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,680
Oh, dear little lad, I thought for thee.

249
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,220
In the U.S. today, one of every ten high school seniors uses marijuana daily.

250
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,740
Thirty-five percent of all students use drugs at least once a month.

251
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,620
It isn't all in the illicit, illegitimate market that's the problem.

252
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,540
We have a panacea in America that is a place to solve every problem.

253
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,980
The farmer, he got wild.

254
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,220
The bricklayer got plastered.

255
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,640
The mechanic, he got tanked.

256
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,360
And the construction worker got blasted.

257
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,000
And daddy beat up mommy and broke her collarbone for good luck.

258
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,660
And daddy beat up mommy and broke her collarbone for good luck.

259
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,300
And everybody's drunk.

260
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,080
And everybody's wasted.

261
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,420
And everybody's drinking on the job.

262
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,940
The garbage man got trashed.

263
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,900
The janitor got messy.

264
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,580
The taxi driver got smashed.

265
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,520
And the waitress, she got...

266
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,640
She got tipsy.

267
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,540
In Kansas City, New York City,

268
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,320
Great Big City,

269
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,200
Itty Bitty City.

270
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,720
Now everybody's drunk.

271
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,480
And everybody's wasted.

272
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,840
And everybody's drinking on the job.

273
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,540
Well there's a whole lot of places that I ain't been.

274
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:55,640
And I ain't been to the same place.

275
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:55,640


276
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:55,640


277
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,260
I'm having pounds on my skinny killer.

278
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,960
So I'll have to break out to get to Kansas City.

279
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,460
Quickly, I've come down to New York!

280
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:06,460


281
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,860
and we're gonna try the prologue.

282
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,360
And everyone remember me as Mr. Knife.

283
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,600
Because now your Social Security is covered

284
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:10,600


285
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:10,600


286
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,420
the era of school rules.

287
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:19,500
Oh,

288
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:19,820
oh,

289
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,620
of the 80s.

290
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:25,620


291
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:25,620


292
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,680
The terrorists got bombed

293
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,740
The president got hit

294
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,340
Security was tied

295
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, the Secret Service got lit

296
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,440
The FBI, CIA, TWA, USA

297
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,700
Everybody's drunk

298
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,500
And everybody's wasted

299
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,920
And everybody's stoned

300
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,960
And there's nothing that's gonna change it

301
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,180
Cause everybody's drunk

302
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,320
Everybody's drunk

303
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,320


304
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,800
And everybody's wasted

305
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,140
And everybody's drinking on the job

306
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,040
And everybody's wasted

307
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,420
Everybody else has a your ass

308
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:09,720
Cause everybody's drunk

309
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,820
And everybody's wasted

310
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,240
And everybody's wasted

311
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,060
Cause everybody's wasted

312
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,140
We can't get anything but crack

313
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,320
I wonder why that is

314
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:29,480
might light it up on rare occasions or Jesus or Jim Jones or whatever or a

315
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,640
subgenius tape or a subgenius show like this every two minutes will light it up

316
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,320
or the merest glimpse of one of Bob's hundred-year-old footprints might light

317
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,220
up that spot in your brain that mighty that a that a mighty undiluted

318
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,440
unneagified squirt will flood that spot with with just the right juices from

319
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,260
just the right glands but but since to to read that good book takes days you

320
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,100
got to be in the right place at the right time for that song to have the

321
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,580
effect if you're gonna get it through sex well that takes at least five

322
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,460
minutes and often you have to take them out to dinner but my god you can just go

323
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:15,420
out and spend some money and in no time at all you can light up that little spot

324
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,160
just as soon as you can get back in your car baby

325
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,420
just as soon as you can get back in your car baby

326
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,280
just as soon as you can get you a sample fire that booger up quiet what

327
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,680
else do you need why would there be any need for noble feelings for all mankind

328
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,900
or even any sense of human decency whatsoever why would there be any need

329
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,520
for anything but to light up that spot in that brain and when you get those

330
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,400
headsets where you just tape a little pad to either side of your temple one in

331
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,280
the front one in the back on a shaved place

332
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,480
on your head and you have that little control in your pocket with the battery

333
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,140
in it as long as you've got your $1 98 9 volt battery and that thing you can

334
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,540
crank it up to 5 to the 5 marker on the dial and feel mighty damn good or turn it

335
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,300
up to 10 and tiring shall you'll never turn it off there better be somebody

336
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:16,520
standing by anywhere past 6 on the infinite control with knob and you're

337
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,260
not gonna turn it off you're not going to friend you might actually want to jump if you turn it off better watch your officer and if not you'll fall out of shape!

338
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,260


339
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,260
I'd turn it off for a second, but it would hurt.

340
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,160
Oh, it would hurt to turn it down, even to turn it down.

341
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,000
And once you've felt that 10 setting, you're not going to want to live with anything else.

342
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,380
You're going to be crying a year later for the 11 setting.

343
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,780
You're going to be begging.

344
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,700
Oh, you'll be reading all the catalogs, waiting for that breakthrough that'll give you an 11 on that control.

345
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,080
Oh, yesiree, you think they got a drug problem now.

346
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,860
Now, you think there's a drug problem in the United States, in the whole world now.

347
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,700
Oh, mark my words, ye sinners, wait until you get some electronics involved, baby.

348
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,960
You think those computer whizzes got rich quick.

349
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,240
Wait until they invent the head zapper.

350
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,320
Oh, it's my head, you'll say.

351
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,760
It's my head, that's all you'll be able to say.

352
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,160
Every song will be the song, it's my head.

353
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,620
That'll be the only awareness you need.

354
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,740
It's just between you, your head, and your control.

355
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,540
Your pleasure center stimulator control.

356
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,160
Oh, yeah.

357
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,840
Oh, yeah, you'll be like a monkey in a cage, sitting in a pool of his own saliva.

358
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,580
That's right.

359
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:36,340
Because once you feel number 10, you can kiss what you now know as reality.

360
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,680
Goodbye, baby.

361
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,740
Yes, and after a while, even the 10 starts to feel like pain.

362
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
But you can't kiss it.

363
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,280
Go looking for the 11 button, because you can't get up.

364
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,100
You've been there too long, because you're dead.

365
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,900
You're a ghost that died while it was high.

366
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,480
Yep, yep, if you die when you're high, my friend, your spirit becomes a wandering shade.

367
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,480
Wandering, trying to score for eternity.

368
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,080
Or at least until a subgenius priest comes along and sends it spanking back to where it originally came from.

369
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,620
My God, and here I am, running out of gas.

370
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,260
You're always going to run out.

371
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,100
Sooner or later.

372
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,080
That's what you've got to remember.

373
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,560
Too much.

374
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,200
Oh, yeah.

375
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,300
Too much is always better than not enough.

376
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,540
Till you run out.

377
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,180
And you will, friend.

378
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,780
You'll run out of that church air right when you least expect it.

379
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,700
Right when you thought you had all the church air in the world.

380
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,240
Oh, yeah.

381
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,620
Oh, yeah.

382
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,280
Oh, I had all the church air in the world.

383
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,040
But, but, but, Negi.

384
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,200
That's it now.

385
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,980
Oh, you'll scream, you'll cry, you'll wail and gnash your teeth.

386
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,500
And you'll wish you could die.

387
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,780
You'll wish you could die.

388
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,520
But you can't.

389
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
You can't die.

390
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,080
Because your terror keeps you alive.

391
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:03,780
And manufactures just enough church air for you not to die, but just to keep needing more.

392
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,920
You're going to be ready for the finals in 1998, my friend.

393
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,580
There can be no such thing.

394
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,160
There's no such thing as a safe pleasure drug.

395
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:29,040
Even if it had no harmful physical side effects, it still would have, it would still be overused by some people who cannot get pleasure in other ways.

396
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,820
That's what's so sad.

397
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,700
Oh, I know smoking cigarettes cause cancer, but I can't stop.

398
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,060
But if them same folks told you smoking cigarettes in your automobile would corrode your engine,

399
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,580
it would be no more smoking.

400
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:43,580


401
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,360
In the car.

402
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,020
Now that's kind of sad.

403
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,620
Because they manipulated us to the extent that these educational institutions ain't nothing but tricks.

404
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,960
Before you.

405
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,220
Why?

406
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,460
Well, I didn't tell you this before, but he's an egg salad addict.

407
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,640
You mean he's hooked on it?

408
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,540
He's hooked.

409
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,720
He's got a chicken on his back.

410
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,320
Yeah, well, too bad for him.

411
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,440
Ha ha ha ha ha.

412
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,260
As far back as educated men have recorded their history,

413
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,740
veils have been lowered to disclose a vast new reality,

414
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,720
rents in the fabric of man's awareness.

415
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,740
And somewhere in the endless search of the curious mind lies the next vision,

416
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,060
the next key to his infinite capacity.

417
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,580
There's reason to believe that incessant stimulation of the reward or privilege of a man's life,

418
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,580


419
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:50,460
the pleasure centers of the brain will lead to a resetting of the pleasure threshold so that ordinary,

420
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,120
enjoyable things no longer stimulate that area.

421
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,940
Or if they do, they aren't effective.

422
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,360
And one can't enjoy ordinary life so that all one has left are the chemicals.

423
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,560
If we keep using drugs the way we are, we're going to go down the chemical dumper.

424
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,380
You look puzzled, Peter.

425
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,780
Other than you're still plain Peter Wayne.

426
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,220
But don't worry.

427
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,660
You'll all be crystal clear as soon as you cross over.

428
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,960
Consciousness expanding.

429
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,700
Properly induced CE will give a subject full awareness of capabilities never known before.

430
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,420
The doses have been somewhat shorter for me the last time or two.

431
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,180
I'm not sure how long I'll be in there.

432
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,160
You better listen to my warning.

433
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,500
Warning.

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:47,580

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:47,580

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:47,580

456
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,140


457
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,140


458
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,140


459
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,140


460
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,140


461
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,860
Have you got a reading that shows us in detail just how easily that came up?

462
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:19,860


463
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,400
You don't mean the words, though?

464
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:37,080
Some said it was always Frühlings, It control a very large amount of heat, like coal, snow.

465
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,320
A storm? No.

466
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,420
Tibetan wilderness?

467
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,260
Land of the pharaohs.

468
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,840
Land of the pharaohs. That sounds great.

469
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,040
Wow.

470
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,880
Here's the police!

471
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,420
The madness is a journey to hell,

472
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:51,420
that the brain is sick and weak.

473
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,100
In ever new dimensions,

474
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,960
they live up there, where the evil nights dwell.

475
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,220
And all along, Pops, oh, darling,

476
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,080
I'll remember when the least of your problems used to put you right to sleep.

477
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,740
Oh, not anymore, Matt.

478
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,720
Today's modern, now-a-go-go woman

479
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,880
just pops these simple little pills, called Angadream.

480
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,080
Swell demonstration, eh, Sarge?

481
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,600
It's routine.

482
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,380
Maybe.

483
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,220
But if the Chief ever caught me taking these pills, he'd snap my head off.

484
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,840
Here, try one of mine.

485
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,480
Oh, yeah?

486
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,820
Yeah, the Chief himself's been on these for a week, and he's a chum.

487
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,300
Good. Open your mouth, Chef.

488
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,080
No, I'm not.

489
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,840
I don't like pills.

490
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,060
It really does help take the trouble out of falling asleep.

491
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,900
The haunting reality is

492
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,480
that any one of these addicts,

493
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,420
prostitutes, or runaways

494
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,160
could be your child.

495
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,220
There was me.

496
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,280
That is Alex.

497
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,020
And my three droogs.

498
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,560
And their enemy is the God-centered family.

499
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,860
An 18-year-old teenager named Diane,

500
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,080
living here in the middle of the desert,

501
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,540
in Hollywood,

502
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,760
took her life.

503
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,720
She was under the influence of LSD.

504
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,500
She had experimented with it

505
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,200
as a result of peer pressure from her friends.

506
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,600
This young lady had everything in the world to live for.

507
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,580
She had just won a Grammy award.

508
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,620
She was signed for a television series.

509
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,140
Today, drugs and alcohol

510
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,520
have replaced baseball and football

511
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,840
as the national pastimes.

512
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,940
We are producing a country

513
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,420
without a future.

514
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,540
Any punk will tell you there is no future.

515
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,900
They don't think about it.

516
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,240
They wallow in just now operating.

517
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,140
They only have the present.

518
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,700
No puns.

519
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,380
I can't hold my breath

520
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,300
any longer.

521
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,540
In front of the policeman,

522
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,660
I have no choice but to go with him.

523
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,060
See what he has to say.

524
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,940
I'll minister to him.

525
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,260
I've tasted the dew

526
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,720
on the lips of sweet death herself.

527
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,660
You were right, Paul,

528
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,980
when you said that someday

529
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,040
we'd all live in the treetops.

530
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,500
Like apes,

531
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,120
like monkeys,

532
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,920
like rodents,

533
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,120
like vermin,

534
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,060
like the squirrel

535
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,980
that has found itself electrocuted.

536
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,740
On my electric fence,

537
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,480
the one I use to keep Zandy inside,

538
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,360
and the dogs.

539
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,060
The squirrels can't take the voltage.

540
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,500
They fry.

541
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,880
They die convulsing.

542
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,620
They suffocate

543
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,540
because their lungs can't take in another breath.

544
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,300
But yet,

545
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,760
their brains are aware of the terror.

546
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,360
My little boy walked out one morning,

547
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:24,940
and he said,

548
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,520
Daddy, is the squirrel sleeping?

549
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,880
Is the squirrel sick?

550
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,800
I said, No!

551
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,380
My child, the squirrel's not sleeping.

552
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,440
The squirrel's not sick.

553
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,160
The squirrel is dead.

554
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,900
The squirrel will not come back.

555
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,080
The squirrel can't be fixed.

556
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,400
It turned into a skeleton.

557
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,320
A squirrel skeleton.

558
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,880
My son said,

559
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,480
Father,

560
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,260
I want to be like that squirrel.

561
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,120
I, too, want to be a skeleton.

562
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,240
You can't arrest me, officer.

563
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,240
I'm not drunk.

564
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,240
I might be half-ass drunk, though.

565
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,440
Well, I will.

566
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:27,860
Well, I will.

567
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:27,860


568
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:27,860


569
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,400
I'll get you drunk.

570
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:29,620
And I will.

571
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,480
You know you are.

572
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,700
You know you are.

573
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,040
When you got a hangover

574
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,640
And it's all hung over back

575
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,360
Straight at your girlfriend's car

576
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,780
Half-ass drunk.

577
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,320
Just you and me.

578
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,060
Sergeant Carter hair-cut

579
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,460
Gomer Piles hookup

580
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,900
living off of LSD.

581
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,520
Have a ass drunk.

582
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,160
And I'm feeling blue.

583
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,980
Well, a flood come in and it washed away my den

584
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,980
and my water bill's still past due.

585
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,320
Have a ass drunk.

586
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,740
Called my boss.

587
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,480
I ain't feeling quite right.

588
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,960
Well, it can't be Monday

589
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,320
because I don't remember Sunday

590
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,220
and my hands are spinning Saturday night.

591
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,760
Sweet love song.

592
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,240
Have a ass drunk.

593
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,800
And I'm drunk as shit.

594
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,520
Well, I used to have a job

595
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,760
but I'm sick of getting robbed

596
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
so I finally do a band quit.

597
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,100
Mama had a fit.

598
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,760
Have a ass drunk.

599
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,520
Well, my head feels odd.

600
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,940
Well, baby needs food

601
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,200
but I'm still feeling blue.

602
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,680
But his daddy needs a lewd brother.

603
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,380
Baby better find himself a job.

604
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,660
Have a ass drunk.

605
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,180
Have a ass drunk.

606
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,860
Have a ass drunk.

607
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,500
And I'm having fun.

608
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,100
Stopped on a hill

609
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,440
cause I had to take a pill

610
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
but I couldn't quite find my tongue.

611
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,860
Have a ass drunk.

612
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,420
Hell, I can see.

613
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,960
Well, they said the light was red.

614
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,000
Now, a couple of folks.

615
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,880
Well, there was 22 mangled

616
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,200
and there was one guy

617
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,640
that was gimped up pretty good.

618
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,340
He had to sort of walk like this

619
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,440
for the rest of his life.

620
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,700
And there was one guy

621
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,640
it was pretty neat.

622
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,720
They had, he was hurt pretty good, I guess.

623
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,140
They had like this machine

624
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,280
that was like hooked up

625
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,760
where he had this tube running up

626
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,480
through his nose, you know.

627
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,500
And that was the only way he could breathe.

628
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,880
And well, there was this one dude

629
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,420
it was like a blade

630
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,600
he chopped straight down on his toes.

631
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,480
Last I heard, he still couldn't walk.

632
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,980
There was one guy, well,

633
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,340
this is what's weird.

634
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,120
They found parts of him on front of the car

635
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,360
and other parts of him

636
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,240
on the back of the same car.

637
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,260
I mean, it sort of defies the mind, doesn't it?

638
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,680
How you can walk like that.

639
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,020
You could find pieces of the same person

640
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,120
on the front and back of the same car.

641
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,980
I mean, I just don't understand.

642
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,220
They ought to run some kind of scientific test.

643
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,000
I don't even see how that could even happen.

644
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,500
And a couple folks dead.

645
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,960
Well, it sure looked green to me.

646
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,480
Half-ass drunk.

647
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,320
Well, I wish I was.

648
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,280
Turned a brand new Trans Am

649
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,580
into an old tin can

650
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,620
trying to outrun the fuzz.

651
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Half-ass drunk.

652
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,440
I'm a victim of lies.

653
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,920
Well, there's nothing wrong with me,

654
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,560
your honor.

655
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,920
I can see, hell, I got you

656
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,300
damn de-dug your eyes.

657
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,620
Half-ass drunk.

658
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,320
Oh, woe is me.

659
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,940
Mommy, where's Daddy?

660
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,500
He's been gone for so long.

661
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,980
Oh.

662
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,620
Come home.

663
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,920
Come home.

664
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:36,920


665
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,500
Come on.

666
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:41,840
Such a Dragon.

667
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,200
Come.

668
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:42,840
My détente.

669
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:42,840


670
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,200
Stop.

671
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,240


672
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,260
Be quiet now.

673
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,280


674
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:44,620
Be quite.

675
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,780
I was gone for 14 days

676
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,200
I could have been gone for more

677
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,860
Held up in an intensive care ward

678
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,640
Lying on the floor

679
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,580
I was gone for all those days

680
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,040
But I was not all alone

681
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:27,540
I made friends with a lot of people

682
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,580
In the danger zone

683
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,680
See my lonely

684
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,620
Love is gone

685
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:39,620


686
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,260
I was gone for more

687
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,860
I see it every day

688
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,280
See my lonely

689
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,540
My next goal

690
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,240
Since I've gone away

691
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,680
I can't remember

692
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,320
In my razor end

693
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,060
I can't understand

694
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,260
All the pushing

695
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,620
All the pushing

696
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,540
All the pushing

697
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,180
All the pushing

698
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,820
All the pushing

699
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:19,980
All the pushing

700
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,020
All the pushing

701
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,580
All the pushing

702
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:23,780
All the pushing

703
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,700
Now imagine a world where

704
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,520
heroin was legal

705
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,800
but possession of coffee

706
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,420
was punishable by up to

707
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,500
50 years in jail.

708
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,520
In other words, friends,

709
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,400
think of a world where you could run down

710
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,620
to the nearest convention center

711
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,840
store just about any time of day or night and purchase any amount of liquid

712
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:50,720
heroin you wanted a whole bottle of heroin be about three bucks or you could

713
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,400
go down to heroin den and sit and shoot up with all your shooting buddies until

714
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,660
about 2 a.m. then you get on the expressway and drive home or that matter

715
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:08,380
folks that in the heroin world where imagine that the authority is making

716
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,080
heroin so much a part of their business world that nobody closed a big business

717
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,360
deal without having a few shots of smack with the client when there'd be

718
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,720
billboards all over the roads for the coolest brands of heroin showing

719
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,120
beautiful models skin popping next to a waterfall and on TV well they're not

720
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,100
only would there be all these ads showing your favorite sports heroes

721
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,140
shooting their favorite brand a heroin but in any party scene

722
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,360
any place you go get some heroin.

723
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,500
Any scene of any TV show where people were shown relaxing or having a good time,

724
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,260
well, they're always taking just a few little sniffs of smack.

725
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,700
Now, the leaders of a world like that would have to be pretty insane, right?

726
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,820
I mean, it'd be obvious that the leaders themselves were not only heroin users,

727
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,600
but stood to gain quite a bit from the whole population,

728
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,140
aside from a few anti-heroin fanatics leaning on this substance.

729
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,380
But let's take it a step further, friends.

730
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,840
Imagine if these people made coffee illegal.

731
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,220
Because they said it was addicting, and it led to harder stuff like espresso.

732
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,100
But yet, untold, millions of people had been drinking coffee for thousands of years,

733
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,000
and no one had ever OD'd.

734
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,120
You drink it, and it sharpens you up a bit, and then later you crash a bit.

735
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,800
But it's so illegal that the smugglers are getting fantastically rich

736
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,360
having contraband products.

737
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,840
Coffee beans flown up from South America.

738
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,600
And there'd be this whole subculture of bean heads.

739
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,400
People that were into coffee, partly as a rebellion against the establishment.

740
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:54,820
And the whole reason that coffee led to harder stuff, like espresso or NyQuil,

741
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,940
was because to buy coffee, you had to go to a coffee dealer's house,

742
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,360
a pusher's house, where you'd encounter people who were espresso users.

743
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,140
And on top of that, a one-ounce bag of coffee,

744
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,920
would cost like a hundred bucks, just for an ordinary Maxwell House grade.

745
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,060
And people would be arrested and spend their whole lives in jail.

746
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,560
Maybe even be executed for using coffee, which is relatively harmless.

747
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,160
While this whole planet of junkies was going scot-free.

748
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,240
And President Reagan would be up there.

749
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,220
You'd see him in the news at, you know, partying with world leaders.

750
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,060
All of them snorting a bit of smack and shooting up.

751
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,120
Imagine what a horrible, topsy-turvy world we'd be in.

752
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,680
Imagine what a world that would be, friends, where they made a powerful,

753
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,620
central nervous system depressant, not only legal, but glamorous.

754
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,980
While an organically grown, harmless bean off of a bush,

755
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,020
could wreck your life only because of the laws against it.

756
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,340
But, but, we're enlightened people here.

757
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,320
So just forget that little allegory.

758
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,640
You know, let's not get depressing about it, friends.

759
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:19,580
Let's, let's just lean back with a good, stiff, drink, and forget it.

760
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,100
Something was missing.

761
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,360
It was my pills.

762
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,360
I wonder if that guy bopped or not.

763
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,140
I guess I better run over there.

764
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,000
Go down this dark river.

765
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,740
Doug, Doug.

766
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:33,940
Yeah.

767
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,760
Oh yeah, okay, what?

768
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,100
Down.

769
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,380
Down here.

770
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,440
Oh, okay.

771
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,260
Where are we going?

772
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,240
The dark river.

773
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,000
Where are we going?

774
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,540
Tunnel ride.

775
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,380
Don't worry.

776
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,400
Just like, hand the guy a cordon.

777
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,580
That guy took all my pills.

778
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,720
Yeah, well don't worry about those pills.

779
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,360
You don't need those pills anymore.

780
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,560
Okay, well I still got my tape recorder and my camera.

781
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,280
You don't need those anymore either.

782
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,020
Give them to me.

783
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,740
Come on.

784
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,120
Whoa, look out!

785
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:06,600
Whoa!

786
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:06,940
Whoa!

787
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


788
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


789
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


790
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


791
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


792
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


793
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


794
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


795
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


796
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


797
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


798
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,080


799
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:19,960
I got a job here.

800
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,420
I got a job here.

801
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:32,520
Oh, look out!

802
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:33,940


803
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,040
Whoa!

804
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:34,560


805
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,240


806
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,040
Whoa!

807
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,240
Whoa!

808
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,720
Whoa!

809
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:36,720


810
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:36,740
Whoa!

811
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,060
Whoa!

812
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,020
Whoa!

813
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,440
Whoa!

814
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:06,560


815
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:06,560


816
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:06,600
Yeah.

817
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


818
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


819
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


820
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


821
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


822
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


823
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


824
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


825
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


826
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,600


827
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,660
Let me come down with you guys.

828
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:06,680
Let me show ya what's real.

829
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:06,720
Shay!

830
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,040
Ghirel.

831
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:06,900
tać

832
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:13,400
They call it the nows, they call it the nows, they call it the nows.

833
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,700
And when it finally rocks away, I guess you'll probably drive a truck in.

834
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:26,740
They used to call it the nows, they call it the nows, they call it the nows.

835
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,040
La la la, la la la la, la la la la la la la.

836
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,860
Kinda young, kinda dead.

837
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,940
Yeah, Charlie's disgusting brain, well, it's all black.

838
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,060
The girl's got a very dead brain, it won't come back.

839
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,840
She used to convey, but then she took an extra kick.

840
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,960
Of course her friends are extra dumb.

841
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,660
And they were terribly excited while they watched her do it again.

842
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,720
Charlie's disgusting brain, well, it's all black.

843
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,760
The girl's got a very dead brain, it won't come back.

844
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,480
She got dirt all around the hole, where they dunk her boxes.

845
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,260
They call it the grave, they call it the grave, they call it the grave.

846
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,620
Which is as good a place as any for a chump.

847
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,320
Charlie's disgusting brain, well, it's all black.

848
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,260
They used to call it the nows, they call it the nows, they call it the nows.

849
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,020
They call it the grave, they call it the nows, they call it the grave, they call it the grave.

850
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:03,640
And all around, at the site of the grave, stood Charlie's friends, who could not save.

851
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,840
Charlie's disgusting brain, well, it's all black.

852
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,220
Stupid girl from the way she behaves

853
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:16,660
But among the mourners and the frowners

854
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,440
They cry, why, why?

855
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,760
And it haunts us

856
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,400
And it haunts us

857
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,840
And it haunts us

858
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,380
And it haunts us

859
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,680
No, I ain't got any more

860
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,280
No, I ain't got any more

861
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,740
No, I ain't got any more

862
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,100
No, I ain't got any more

863
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,240
Birdland

864
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,820
The Brotherhood

865
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,200
Wrote on the rotted basebald wall

866
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,100
Right next to the sign that read

867
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,300
Please don't pee in our hall

868
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,640
And then he reached in the slide

869
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,460
And he pulled out the tiny transparent bag

870
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,240
The one filled with the chopped white powder

871
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,840
The junkies called Skag

872
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,700
And he sighed as he hit the big vain in his arm

873
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,080
And his mind took off on Bird's musical charm

874
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,580
And Brother Bird was blowing

875
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,500
Bracelet for you like only he was it to a secret he knew

876
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:43,760
Wow the brother said he slipped up into a nod bird sure he's the pain

877
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,880
Now I wanna hear brother John

878
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,560
Coltrane

879
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,480
He tried to get up with his body with the moon

880
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,440
Told him his senses were in a groove

881
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,520
Finally bird was through and trained to go ahead a spiritual debut

882
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,080
His heart began to pound

883
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,580
As he dug the bar sound down

884
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,180
Bird train show knock was down

885
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,960
And then he looked up and saw

886
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,480
That the box wasn't even on

887
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,620
And it was damn near dawn

888
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,900
I'm high

889
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:23,940
I'm high

890
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,500
I'm high

891
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,600
I'm high

892
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:26,740
I'm high

893
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,280
I'm high

894
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,160
I'm high

895
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:29,240
I'm high

896
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,500
I'm high

897
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,420
I'm high

898
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,580
I'm wasted

899
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,200
Like an helicopter down

900
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:54,760
Give me some dough

901
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,100
So I can buy me some smack

902
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,620
And get back on the fast track

903
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,980
He looked off into a nod as the sounds became odd

904
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,460
And he could no longer hear train or bird

905
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,580
He could only hear the loud unspoken word

906
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,540
Get back nigga, you're black crowned

907
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,920
But I'm beautiful he said

908
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,300
And then he suddenly realized that he was dead

909
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,000
And he was being lowered into the ground

910
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,540
And couldn't utter a single sound

911
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,540
And his family and friends were standing around

912
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,240
With their heads hanging down

913
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,540
Crying and carrying on

914
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,280
Because their beautiful black song was gone

915
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,920
No I'm not dead his mind said

916
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,580
Don't bury me

917
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,440
Because I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't

918
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,600
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't

919
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,320
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't

920
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,620
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't

921
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,320
And then he realized

922
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,600
Oh Dee

923
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:03,340
Oh, D. Oh, D. Oh, D.

924
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,520
Oh, fuck.

925
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,540
Oh, fuck.

926
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:11,500
Wow.

927
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:17,620
Oh, I'm dead too much.

928
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,760
I know, Mr. Green.

929
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,960
I'm dead too much.

930
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,560
I'm dead too much.

931
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,580
I'm dead too much.

932
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,080
Also, it doesn't exist.

933
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,960
Also, it doesn't exist.

934
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,480
And they are shooting each other because of a new prize.

935
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,240
Billions of dollars in American money.

936
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,140
The hard-earned or hard-stolen dollars of America's heroin addicts.

937
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,620
Hey, if you want any of this junk, huh, go to it, boys.

938
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,520
But this young girl, 14 years of age, in the eighth grade,

939
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,600
recently took 50 pills to take her life.

940
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,500
She has slipped her wrist.

941
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,120
And she's been into heavy drugs.

942
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,680
I've got super dynamic overdrive.

943
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,340
I'm operating in 10,000 revolutions.

944
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,960
My motor is being preserved because I'm operating in supernatural overdrive.

945
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,380
Are you certain you know what reality is?

946
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,680
No matter what I do to change it,

947
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,560
normal I remain.

948
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,520
Normal can be just as bad

949
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,580
as right as wrong.

950
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,500
I'm in a wheelchair.

951
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,460
I'm in a wheelchair.

952
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:31,600
Today,

953
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,340
serious heresy

954
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,860
is a deviant state of consciousness.

955
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,980
Not so much deviant opinions

956
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,620
as having a kind of experience

957
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:51,500
which is different from regular experience.

958
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,700
We are taught what experiences are permissible.

959
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,580
We are taught what experiences are permissible.

960
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,240
And therefore, if a person has so-called strange experiences

961
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,560
and endeavors to communicate these experiences to other people,

962
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,340
he is looked at in a very odd way and asked,

963
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,400
are you feeling all right?

964
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,860
Because people feel distinctly uncomfortable

965
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,360
when they realize that they're in the presence of someone

966
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,480
who's experiencing the world in a rather different way from themselves.

967
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,540
They call in question as to whether this person is indeed human.

968
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,660
They look like a human being,

969
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,120
but because the state of experience is so different,

970
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,760
you wonder whether they really are.

971
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,740
And in rather the same way,

972
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,880
in a very everyday kind of circumstance,

973
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,860
when you're sitting in a bar drinking

974
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,000
and you find you have a drunk next to you,

975
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,960
and he turns to you and says,

976
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,580
I say,

977
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:55,620
and you sort of move your stool a little way away from this man.

978
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:02,140
Because he's become in some way what we mean by non-human.

979
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,100
We expect a high of about 65 degrees tomorrow,

980
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,080
increasingly cloudy skies once again,

981
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,320
with some rain in the forecast.

982
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,420
So I found this little niche, crawled in,

983
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,740
and I say I'm happy.

984
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,920
All right, boys.

985
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,380
Bob's got you hooked.

986
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,280
Bob's got a monkey on your back.

987
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,980
Bob's doing something spooky again, ain't he?

988
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,160
That's what you're listening to.

989
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:25,740
Yeah.

990
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:27,860
Yeah.

991
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,380
This is the kind of Bob that comes up out of the shadows.

992
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,140
It's the kind of Bob that follows you home.

993
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,980
It's the kind of Bob that calls you up in the middle of the night

994
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,960
and hangs up as soon as you say hello.

995
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:41,980
Hey, Doug, let's kill Bob.

996
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,660
Yeah, yeah.

997
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,020
Yeah, yeah.

998
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,040
Yeah, yeah.

999
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,880
I have an espresso machine in there.

1000
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,460
Espresso.

1001
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,260
I feel the need to express myself

1002
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,140
into a cup.

1003
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,380
And then pour it back into the spot in which I once stood.

1004
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,240
Pour it into my shoes, and I will be reborn again.

1005
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,920
A man of caffeine.

1006
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,000
Y'all get your little whiskey, get your little snort,

1007
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,740
get your little reefer, get your little...

1008
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,520
You serious?

1009
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,000
The same people as fixing to kill you

1010
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,560
puts the drugs out here for you.

1011
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,220
How many of y'all know that?

1012
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:16,760
Let me see your hands.

1013
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,480
Some of y'all got your hand up.

1014
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,380
Got a reefer in your pocket.

1015
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,400
And we sat in the Corova Milk Bar,

1016
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,980
trying to make up our razzoo dogs what to do.

1017
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:25,460
The evening.

1018
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,440
The Corova Milk Bar sold Milk Plus.

1019
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,740
Milk Plus, Vellicet, or Synthamesque, or Drencrum,

1020
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,260
which is what we were drinking.

1021
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,060
This would sharpen you up and make you ready

1022
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,220
for a bit of the old ultra-violence.

1023
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,280
And they got your head so messed up,

1024
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,160
everybody got their high and don't like nobody else's.

1025
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,200
Yeah, the whiskey drinkers have always looked down

1026
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,460
on the wine-o's.

1027
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,540
Reefer smokers now got an attitude about whiskey drinkers.

1028
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,080
And all at once the cocaine snorters think they're more sophisticated

1029
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,920
than the reefer smokers.

1030
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,440
And the coffee drinkers hate them all.

1031
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,300
A lot of the evangelical leaders seem to have forgotten that.

1032
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,620
Now, we understand the drunk.

1033
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,740
We know what's the matter with him and it'll wear off.

1034
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,460
But when quite unaccountably,

1035
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,360
a person gives representation,

1036
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,060
that he's suddenly got the feeling

1037
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,560
that he's living in backwards time.

1038
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,460
Or that everybody seems to be separated from him

1039
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,520
by a huge sheet of glass.

1040
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:44,140
Or that he's suddenly seeing everything

1041
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:49,960
in unbelievably vivid, detailed, moving colors.

1042
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,180
You say, well, that's not normal.

1043
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,440
Therefore, there must be something wrong with you.

1044
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,240
We like you and should ignore you.

1045
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,180
But instead...

1046
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,220
Makes...

1047
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,120
Oh, God, it hurts.

1048
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,380
My headaches come back.

1049
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,220
Ah!

1050
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:10,940
Ah!

1051
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,400
Ah!

1052
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:13,660
Ah!

1053
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,620
If these headaches keep up...

1054
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,220
Fuck.

1055
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,860
I'll go down in the medicine fish hole.

1056
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,560
I'll go in the medicine fish hole if I have to.

1057
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,020
I...

1058
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,840
Oh...

1059
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,260
Do you have any aspirin?

1060
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,720
No, I'm Bob.

1061
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,820
No, I'm...

1062
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,620
No, I'm Bob.

1063
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,460
No, I'm Bob.

1064
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,120
A light from the sky

1065
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,180
settled over them trees.

1066
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,080
It left this wire in my head that customized me

1067
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:07,160
The wire in my head, it advises me

1068
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:14,720
Better living through bio-circuitry

1069
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,200
The wire in my head has found me new friends

1070
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:38,260
We meet at the airport where the old freeway ends

1071
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:46,300
And we lay down our lives for the power it sends

1072
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:53,080
I got a wire in my head and so do my friends

1073
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,000
The wire, a big business opportunity

1074
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:07,780
The wire benefits me financially

1075
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:15,840
The wire in my head gets me good deals

1076
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:22,640
I drive a real solid car and I eat fancy meals

1077
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:31,360
You can bet I'd kill any sucker who squeals

1078
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:37,500
I got a wire in my head and I like how it feels

1079
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:45,700
I got a wire for your head and I'd install it for free

1080
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,080
Better living through surgery

1081
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,660
I got a wire in my head

1082
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,480
Squeal and you're dead

1083
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:34,620
Oh, yes, dear friends, that was Wirehead Conspiracy by Reverend Buck Naked.

1084
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,620
And that's on Paris Records.

1085
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:44,720
Yes, Paris Records presents Made Up in Texas, Wirehead Conspiracy.

1086
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,740
You can pick that one up here and there.

1087
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,660
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1088
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,780
You know, time is running out.

1089
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,760
It's so sad that time has to run out on the hour of slack.

1090
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,620
