00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
This is KNON 90.9 FM.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,840
Dallas, I'm Robert Wisdom.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,460
You've been listening to the American Music Party.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,380
Be sure and come out to our parade Saturday.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,700
And look for the blue GMC.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,420
That'll be me.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,860
All hail Robert and Bob.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,080
The mighty Robert and the mighty Bob.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,500
One after another, friends.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm a linter.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,000
Follow, follow, follow.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,940
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,740
Format 6Z subliminaloid hypnopodiatry version.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,840
Start level 3 trance learning state on tone.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,680
It's a wonderful feeling to be so relaxed.

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,660
Drink and be comfortable.

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,740
No worries, no cares.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,880
Bob?

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,440
Bob?

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,120
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

21
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,700
Bob?

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980

00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When you say, see, hear, or think.

51
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,160
Bob?

52
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,120
That's your key phrase.

53
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,500
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

54
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,140
We are controlling transmission.

55
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,460
We will control the horizontal.

56
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,200
We will control the vertical.

57
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,280
We will control the vertical.

58
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,620
It will signal your subconscious mind.

59
00:01:59,720 --> 00:01:59,840
Flash.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,720
You core a research Wirb.

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,200
Flash.

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,320
It's a Omarалось system.

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,340


66
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,200
The subconscious will listen and absorb this message.

67
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,620
Exactly.

absolutely

81
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,440
possession of a subgenius instructional video barrage tape. Prepare yourself. You are about

82
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,900
to be remade into a new being through forbidden knowledge previously kept secret for centuries

83
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,140
by the jealous priesthoods of many religions. Caution. Improper viewing techniques may lead

84
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,700
in some persons to dependency, seizures, cranial fits, priapic conditions, micturition, sternutation,

85
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:01,920
subtle glandular mutations, and in some territories, legal arrest. This videotape bears a patented

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,040
Dobbs Drome PowerShell time code, which may cause some home video decks to react unpredictably.

87
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,880
Although only a small percentage of playback systems or their owners have suffered permanent

88
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,500
damage from this signal, the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated is not responsible for injuries

89
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,680
or damages inflicted by paramedics.

90
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:24,960
The Subgenius Foundation Incorporated is responsible for the

91
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:24,960


92
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:24,960


93
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,700
Subgenius technology is a tool that can be used to detect paranormal events during tape

94
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,380
play mode.

95
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,960
Special interactive holosonic stereo effects produced on the Ultomate Cerebral Synclock

96
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,560
Interocitor are designed to trigger stem cleavage, or brain division between the forebrain and

97
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,840
hindbrain. Using newly discovered break-thinking principles, the viewer's brain waves are

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,160
locked into synchronization with the tape's underlying suggestions by means of neuroelectric

99
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,440
pulses. For the unworthy, this tape may be a one-way ticket down a bottomless metal pit

100
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,160
from which there can be no escape.

101
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,540
In unreceptive viewers, there is a danger of synaptic backfire in the brain pan caused

102
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,840
by overheating of the attention gland.

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,200
The demons you may see during the initial hallucination sequence are not real. If you

104
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,180
do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

105
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,500
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave yourself suggested. We're having operating difficulties,

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,860
which has necessitated a delay.

107
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,040
Wake up, puppet boy!

108
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,820
Do not attempt to flip the tape when you reach the end of cycle.

109
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:39,820


110
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:39,820


111
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:39,820


112
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,100
The tape is not a side one. No matter what you are told by later instructions on the

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,680
tape, there is no side two. However, if you do discover one, don't look at it.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,200
If you follow these instructions, you will experience a profound cathartic reaction to

115
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:04,580
the flow of archetypal images and racial memories. You may find yourself laughing and crying convulsively

116
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,100
and even astrally projecting. These are normal.

117
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,980
Enjoy them.

118
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,140
Mob? Mob?

119
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:23,040
That's your key phrase. It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

120
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:30,200
Three, two, and one. Now to continue with the tape recording.

121
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,040
Oh, yes.

122
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,320
Oh, yes.

123
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,840
Oh, yes.

124
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,240
Oh, yes.

125
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,720
Oh, yes.

126
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,320
Oh, yes.

127
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,560
Oh, yes.

128
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,580
Oh, yes.

129
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:43,980
Oh, jeez.

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes, dear friends.

131
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:55,080
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack on Kano and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

132
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,040
Let me get a good grip on things here.

133
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,500
Dear friends.

134
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,900
Tonight—tonight.

135
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,600
Let me shut the one tape off here.

136
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,400
I just…

137
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,820
Oh, please, my browser, be quarrel-free.

138
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:09,820


139
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:09,820


140
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:09,820


141
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:09,820


142
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,960
flop the other guy in.

143
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,820
Friends, you know, there's a parade coming up.

144
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,000
A Save the K-N-O-N parade.

145
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,240
Yes, indeed.

146
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,400
And cartridge one is out of order.

147
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,040
That's the only thing that could possibly tell you the details.

148
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,120
But, folks, I think that we should have a subgenius float.

149
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,120
I haven't gotten for sure confirmation that we can use the Batmobile.

150
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,640
But if it ain't the Batmobile, it's going to be some other Bobmobile.

151
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,620
You know, I've got a six-foot-high Dobbs face we can display to the unbelievers.

152
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,220
And that's this Saturday at noon.

153
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:01,480
But a special place we're going to have to meet at Pikes Park there off Harry Hines.

154
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,320
Let me see what cartridge one can tell us about this.

155
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,740
Let's go.

156
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,200
Talk about suffering here below and let's keep loving Jesus.

157
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:22,060
Talk about suffering here below and let's keep following Jesus.

158
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,360
Are you rocking not cats and kitties?

159
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,940
This is the Nightmare Colin from the Big Bad City.

160
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,100
You want to know how?

161
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,360
The help can't win out.

162
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,920
Listen to what I'm talking about.

163
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,720
We are having a brand-new huge parade and rally.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,540
Saturday, December the 6th, beginning at noon at Pikes Park, just north of downtown on Harry Hines.

165
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,960
We're going to go down St. Paul Street through downtown Dallas

166
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
and going to wind up in front of Dallas City Hall at City Hall Plaza.

167
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,520
So, man, you got a skateboard you want to ride.

168
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,280
You got a float you want to enter.

169
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,900
You got a veterans group you got.

170
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,740
You got a blow rider by hitters.

171
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,860
You got a car you want to get in the parade.

172
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,080
Colin can't win.

173
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,200
8-2-8-9-5-0-0.

174
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,940
Get in that giant parade for Saturday.

175
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,960
Do simple.

176
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,780
The 6th helps the park.

177
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,300
K-N-O-N.

178
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,960
That's right.

179
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,680
That was exactly what I meant to say.

180
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,640
So, I know I don't sound all that enthusiastic.

181
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,660
Friends, this is the first time I've ever done a subgenius hour of slack show

182
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,060
using one source tape.

183
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:43,880
But this one tape is actually the, oh, it's a melted down conglomeration of tapes

184
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,200
that go back six years.

185
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,980
What we're going to listen to is another instructional subgenius show.

186
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,540
This particular one is, this is another version of the soundtrack of the subgenius video.

187
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,240
So, while you're listening to this booger, I want you to, I want you to imagine that

188
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,060
this is actually a video.

189
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,800
You see.

190
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,760
What is happening here.

191
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,720
The deviable scenes and so forth.

192
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,060
It's from the video Arise.

193
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,340
Not yet completed.

194
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,900
From subgenius time control productions.

195
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,080
And friends, what you're listening to is the weekly hour long voice on K-N-O-N

196
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,760
of the church of the subgenius.

197
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,860
This is the hour of slack.

198
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,760
And this is Reverend Ivan Stang speaking to you.

199
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:41,880
And perhaps what's coming up here will explain everything you need to know.

200
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
Because not all of you need to know anything.

201
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,820
But if anyone wants to make plans, the phone is lighting up here.

202
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,100
I'm not going to put anybody on the air.

203
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm just going to have a tape.

204
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:59,080
But if anyone wants to call and try to get together a float for this mighty parade through

205
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,220
downtown of all the K-N-O-N shows, including this one.

206
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,740
I'm going to put you on the air.

207
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:03,740


208
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,300
Please call 823-7490 or 828-9500.

209
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,900
And if it has to ring for a long time, then so be it.

210
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,120
Just hang in there.

211
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,220
You gaze upon any given street.

212
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,420
Normally, you might never suspect that only some of these people are true humans.

213
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,940
Outside appearances offer no clue that among this ordinary looking crowd,

214
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,880
on an ordinary day,

215
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,460
a certain number of these people are actually subgeniuses.

216
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,560
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person or that carries

217
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
the rare subgenius gene.

218
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:57,660
But once inside those heads, we would discover a vast new universe, a new dimension, coexisting,

219
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,740
not always in harmony, alongside the mundane workday world of the common human.

220
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:03,740


221
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:03,740


222
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,560
Another world that until now has been forced into hiding.

223
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,700
Now at this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

224
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,540
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare,

225
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,220
behold us, for we are the subgeniuses.

226
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,840
But what is a subgenius?

227
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,420
Wise up!

228
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,980
They're out to get you.

229
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,500
The different are being silenced by a global conspiracy.

230
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,540
Weird men arise!

231
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,880
Find out who they are and how to smash them.

232
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,800
You probably already knew that the U.S. government is a sham.

233
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,580
Something propped up there for you to blame.

234
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,740
But did you know that the U.S. government is a sham?

235
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:03,740


236
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,040
Did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

237
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:14,120
That they are actually shambling, unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?

238
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,320
Yes, Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!

239
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,920
Defy the sinister star forces which mock us all.

240
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,640
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

241
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,860
God has been misquoted all this time.

242
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,560
His actual words may disturb you.

243
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:49,140
But Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind.

244
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,900
Repent! Quit your job! Slack off!

245
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,260
The world ends tomorrow and you may die!

246
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,860
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

247
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:25,460
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon which, in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change and carnage, insanity, and destruction than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

248
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,480
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

249
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,620
A time of cataclysmic economic collapse.

250
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:32,620


251
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,640
A time of change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know.

252
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:45,200
While billions of deserving conspiracy dupes fry in hell on Earth.

253
00:13:45,720 --> 00:14:02,400
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob, will usher in a spiritual rebreath and a cascade of astounding mysteries, supernatural riches, and a restoration of lost psychic abilities.

254
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,600
Bob's mind is now in a state of ecstasy.

255
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,180
The power of the mind.

256
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,680
It will totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

257
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,620
That's right. You're lucky to live in the end time.

258
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,700
Cheers, Bob!

259
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,000
Cheers, Bob!

260
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,900
Welcome, potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

261
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,960
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

262
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:30,860
No!

263
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,140
NOOOO!

264
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,820
Welcome to Babylon, children.

265
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,120
It's great to be here in the belly of the beast tonight before we get started with our second LAD Bible.

266
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,200
If we could all please bow our heads and have a moment of sacred, traditional, NOISE!

267
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,540
NOISE!

268
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:54,540


269
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,100
NOISE!

270
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,420
Oh yes, everybody! Praise Bob! Can I hear a praise Bob?

271
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,700
Praise Bob!

272
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,120
Oh yes, we're here to do three things tonight.

273
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:21,140
That's praise Bob, hate, hate the conspiracy, and what was the other thing? To get slack!

274
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:40,520
Now before we proceed with our quote, dispensations, unquote, I would just like to take this opportunity to state briefly and for the record that my fellow Doctors for Bob and myself are members in good standing of a church.

275
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:50,340
But not just any church, for the church to which we belong just happens to be, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the world's only,

276
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,020
BOO!

277
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,860
true religion. Of course, I am referring to the church of the subgenius!

278
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:12,860
Let's look at the word subgenius. It does not simply mean just below a genius. Sub-G intelligence level can range far, far below genius.

279
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,940
Because it ain't the intelligence that counts, it's what you do with it.

280
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,540
One idiot.

281
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:27,440
Inventing one good joke is worth a thousand scientists making A-bombs, according to Bob.

282
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,900
The subgenius does not pretend to super-knowledge, but to sub-knowledge. Knowledge of the under-things.

283
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:42,260
The hollow earth from whose darkness issue the Nazi hell creatures and other demons of the abyss.

284
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:51,120
It is in contemplation of the under-things, the underwear lurking just below the clothing of existence that the subgenie is.

285
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,940
The secret of whom the subgenial gods serve.

286
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,400
Rather than denying them as

287
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,000
beings.

288
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:04,940
bat 터

289
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,040
rat

290
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,120
rat

291
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,100
rat

292
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,420
켜

293
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,660
What must he have? What must he have? What must he have?

294
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,540
He must have slack.

295
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:45,220
And friends, one really good way to get you some slack is going to be to show up and show your support for KON visibly and forcefully at the parade and rally through downtown.

296
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:55,300
What we really need, I think, if we can't put the Big Bob on the Batmobile, which we're hoping to do, praise Batman and Robin,

297
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:08,180
we may be able to get a pickup truck or something that would safely hold the incredible, magical six-foot-high Dobbs head that I have.

298
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,420
And there's going to be a bunch of young subs down there.

299
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,200
I don't know about any old-timers.

300
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,080
I guess me and Buck.

301
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,480
We'd be the old-timers down there.

302
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:24,320
But anyway, call the station, 828-9500, tomorrow or sometime during the week to register.

303
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,940
Let them know.

304
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,780
Or call me here tonight at one of those numbers.

305
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,460
If you have a pickup truck or something like that that we could use that we could load a whole bunch of mutants onto

306
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:44,640
and get out there and display to those bored pinks in the city just exactly what it means to exercise your do-rights.

307
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,560
That's the final fight of Slack.

308
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,480
Ah yes.

309
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,240
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us.

310
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,980
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to deprive us of.

311
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,480
Slack is our way of grabbing life by the lapels and screaming at it.

312
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:08,700
Now back in the 50's, children, Bob himself noticed a decided lack of Slack in our culture.

313
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,800
He noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy.

314
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,260
He noticed that the normals formed a vast conspiracy against the different.

315
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,520
An insidious conspiracy dedicated to squelching our natural rogue instincts.

316
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,420
Dedicated to wiping out our fun factor.

317
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:39,180
Dedicated in short to the total and utter eradication of the original slack with which we were all born.

318
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,180
Well Bob wanted to fight this conspiracy children.

319
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:48,520
And what better way I ask you than by the foundation of a major new world religion.

320
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,640
Hence the church and the subgenius.

321
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,500
Praise Bob.

322
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,820
Help me somebody.

323
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,340
Slack.

324
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,300
What is it?

325
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,140
Well if you have to ask you will never know.

326
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,520
You were born with original slack.

327
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,700
An infinite supply of it.

328
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,820
But the conspiracy has most of it now.

329
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,220
It has the conspiracy.

330
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,160
It has the conspiracy.

331
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,940
It has the way of everything in.

332
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,100
And I think most of you know what I mean by the conspiracy.

333
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,900
It's what makes you work a nine to five job.

334
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,800
A meaningless.

335
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,960
Most cases.

336
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,260
A sad and meaningless nine to five job.

337
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,980
And what?

338
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,320
It's worth your bread.

339
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,560
Your food to eat.

340
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,660
You know you have your brain stem goes down into your spine here.

341
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,120
And how the conspiracy puts these piano wire ropes and things.

342
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,100
And pulls it real tight.

343
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,180
Until you can't think and you stay around all the time.

344
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,700
Point of the church is to unknot those knots.

345
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
Get the piano wire from around your neck.

346
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,320
And make life wonderful.

347
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,660
The conspiracy is a patchwork of different things.

348
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,400
Some are nations.

349
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,840
Some are products.

350
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,000
Some are hypnotic television shows.

351
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,480
Some are bad pills.

352
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,880
Now there's a distinction.

353
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,480
There's good pills and there's bad pills.

354
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,680
There's a good Bob and there's a bad Bob. Right?

355
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,760
Okay.

356
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,480
And the conspiracy is the bad Bob.

357
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,800
The bad pills.

358
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,780
The bad TV shows.

359
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,980
And anything that you know is keeping you from realizing that you gotta get right with Bob.

360
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,680
It's the human condition.

361
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,240
It's things falling apart.

362
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:34,700
It's fat ladies in double knit jumpsuits beating their kids in Krogers.

363
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,820
All of America has a strange idea of just what slack is.

364
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,700
But I think you can buy it.

365
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,660
Actually, slack for three-fourths of the world is a good dinner.

366
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,660
But here, it'd be funny, ain't it?

367
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,540
Yeah.

368
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,240
Ha ha.

369
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,840
Three thousand kids starving to death in Mexico City every day.

370
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,540
Big joke.

371
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,980
Conspiracy.

372
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,100
A big joke.

373
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,120
Slack, that must be a big joke too.

374
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,240
It's too good to be true.

375
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,320
True slack is by definition indefinable.

376
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,800
It is a kind of a lie.

377
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,700
A lie of direct perception, unfettered by common sense.

378
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,860
It is not mere laziness.

379
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,920
It is rather a kind of active sloth.

380
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,300
Slack in its pure form makes happiness seem like agony by comparison.

381
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,460
One might call it something for nothing.

382
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:37,980
But the normals, the mediocritons, the somnambulax and pseudo subslans have tried to make it something which we have been led to believe we must work to buy.

383
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:47,720
The next rule of the Church of the Subgenius is if you act like a dummy, they'll treat you like an equal.

384
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,640
That's right children.

385
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,500
That's right.

386
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,080
Because the conspiracy wants to drown out the unusual.

387
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,200
They want to drown out the intelligent.

388
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,280
Even the intelligence of weirdness.

389
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,340
They want you to act like a dummy.

390
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,920
If you go out there and you act smart, they'll treat you like an inferior.

391
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,200
But if you act stupid, children, you're one of them.

392
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,820
It's 20th century traditions.

393
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,820
It's the old traditions.

394
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,240
It's all the things that got us where we are now.

395
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,000
It's Christ without a penis.

396
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,280
He's part of the conspiracy.

397
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,720
It's presidents that don't look like they're capable of getting erections anymore.

398
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,840
That's the conspiracy.

399
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,900
The conspiracy is a real conspiracy.

400
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,480
It's a living, breathing, fiendish entity.

401
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,180
It wants you, children.

402
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,880
Oh, it wants you, man.

403
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,340
The worst crime that ever was is the easiest to commit.

404
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,380
The worst crime is serving the conspiracy.

405
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,020
And the penalty?

406
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,320
The penalty is worse than having your arm cut off.

407
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,180
The penalty is worse than having your arm cut off.

408
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


409
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,940
The penalty is worse than having your gonads cut off.

410
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,140
The penalty is worse than having your head cut off.

411
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,520
It's being cut off from Bob!

412
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,880
What good do brains do you today, children?

413
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,800
Oh, my God, children.

414
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,700
How are you going to earn a living if you have to think about what you're actually doing?

415
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:35,860
How are you going to contend with society the way it is if you actually have to think about the issues it confronts you with?

416
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:44,460
How can you stand the pressure that conspiracies grind you down with if you actually have to think about that pressure?

417
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,460
Children, brains are a great detriment to life in the 80s.

418
00:24:52,140 --> 00:25:00,860
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocritons, these pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens,

419
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,020
these normals who have made normality the norm?

420
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:19,160
Pinks are but living stereotypes, insensate meat puppets and food tubes who lack and fear the spark of originality that ignites every subgenius soul.

421
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,420
I saw a...we were playing the Dallas Picks not too long ago.

422
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:35,000
I saw a columnist had written a thing in the Dallas paper that said there will also be an appearance by an act called Dr. Pinks.

423
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,000


424
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:48,280
I said, what is that woman who's got those legs, who'll never walk again for the rest of her life, who's going to win the Academy Award if it's an act?

425
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,920
I guess they're going to think the conspiracy's a metaphor.

426
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,020
Yeah, the conspiracy's just some kind of joke.

427
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,020
Oh yeah, El Salvador, ha ha ha, yeah, that's real funny.

428
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,020
Nicaragua, good joke, yeah.

429
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,000
Vietnam, yeah.

430
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,060
They pull them in babies, that's a good one.

431
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,360
Yeah, good, good, good.

432
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,340
Joke! Dr. Spock's messing with an act!

433
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,780
Help everybody, grace, Bob!

434
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,980
But the long, senseless march into slacklessness may soon come to an end.

435
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,140
Oh, it won't happen without a bitter struggle.

436
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,040
But at least there is hope.

437
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,520
For in this, the 20th century, we have seen the coming of a savior,

438
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,360
a beacon of slack, a banner behind which we may unite.

439
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,900
It is the coming of J.R. Bob Dobbs and his mighty Church of the Soap Genius.

440
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,460
Welcome to the end times, boys and girls.

441
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,820
We're going to shock up the house with your friend in the world.

442
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,940
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

443
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,560
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

444
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,980
Bob is coming here to ease your strife.

445
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,180
Commercuckers let Bob into your life.

446
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,660
Well, I'm MC Cleef. I'm a master rap.

447
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,020
I'm a dog like my lips got the clack.

448
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,180
Y'all sitting out saying, oh, woe is me.

449
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,660
Well, I'm here to tell you, it ain't worth peeing.

450
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,920
The end times is here.

451
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,940
You're pretty mad now.

452
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,540
I've been paying for the of the past.

453
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,680
Who else is going to have to go through a rebirth?

454
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,940
And that means paying the spaceship Earth.

455
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,740
Because this will come from Planet X to remove from us the paintball's heads.

456
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,880
In the meantime, we will have our say.

457
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,900
Get slack and fallacate everything.

458
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,520
Oh, yes, dear friends.

459
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,000
We come in for a slow landing here.

460
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,140
Yeah.

461
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,140
How about that?

462
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,040
Let's see.

463
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,900
What's creeping in here?

464
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,540
Let's see a little bit more about the parade, friends.

465
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,180
By the way, this is the.

466
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:09,080
If you just tuned in, this is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack on Kano and ninety point nine FM in Dallas, Texas.

467
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,880
And I've been playing an unusually instructional sort of all purpose show tonight.

468
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,040
It's all on one tape.

469
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,620
It's copied off the soundtrack.

470
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:26,120
It's actually a rough mix of the soundtrack of the subgenius video soon to be finished.

471
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,200
Not that I can advertise that sort of thing.

472
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,080
None of you could afford it.

473
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Anyway.

474
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,520
But and that's months off.

475
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:47,080
But but in the meantime, Kano and it says here has need for some special items for our big parade coming up Saturday, December 6th, the Saturday.

476
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,740
And those items are white sheets needed badly for banners.

477
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,580
So, friends, you got.

478
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,180
Now, don't call me here tonight with this stuff.

479
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,640
Call Kano in eight to eight ninety five hundred during business hours.

480
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:16,320
But they need white sheets for banners that they can paint up poles to make the banners with paint paint brushes, poster board, staple guns, walkie talkies, megaphones, motor scooters, a stage and sound equipment and artists.

481
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:24,760
Oh, I know there's a lot of quote artists, unquote, that listen to this show to make these banners and posters.

482
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,560
Now, the only banner and poster I need is the mighty face.

483
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:30,860
A Bob.

484
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,120
I've got a big one, a big one that we're going to be somehow showing.

485
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,400
We get somebody did call in with a pickup truck.

486
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,500
So if it ain't the Batmobile, it'll be the pickup truck.

487
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,160
And tomorrow I'll find out if it's Batmobile.

488
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,900
But meantime, friends, we're going to we're going to get back to the word here.

489
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,580
Once again, this is a isn't a finished soundtrack because every time you hear Dr.

490
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,620
Howell talk in the narrator, there'll be some music behind that, which I meant to throw in tonight.

491
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,540
But can't do it with the phone.

492
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,700
Ring like this.

493
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,920
So, dear friends, this is your preview.

494
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,980
Just close your eyes while you're listening.

495
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,380
It's not stereo, by the way.

496
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,120
The video, ironically enough, will be.

497
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,260
But the audio tape of the rough cut isn't.

498
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,780
We got to spend a lot more money to get it in stereo, folks.

499
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,600
The Church of the Subgenius is probably the single most important organization in the 20th century.

500
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,520
Our function is quite simple.

501
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,660
We just want literally to save the world.

502
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,380
At least make the end of the world happen.

503
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,760
Right.

504
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,900
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob love you.

505
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,160
Bob love you.

506
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,960
Bob love you.

507
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,860
Bob love you.

508
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,660
Bob love you.

509
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,100
Bob love you.

510
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,220
Bob love you.

511
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:59,120
I love you.

512
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:07,940
you. Bob loved you. Bob loved you. Bob loved you. Bob loved you. Bob loved you. Bob loved

513
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:18,420
you. You'll fly unless you find Bob, and you better find Bob right now. Confusing, isn't

514
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:25,360
it? The people really need to be able to understand things very quickly, and the Church of the

515
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:46,420
Subgenius, I think, confuses them. You cannot hide from God. He's bigger than all reality.

516
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:55,260
Help me somebody. She ain't got no legs. My legs are on fire. I'm from L.A.

517
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:03,760
and I first got contacted by these guys about a year and a half ago, and it was a lot of

518
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:11,280
fun at first, and then I wasn't quite sure if it was all fun or like if it was serious

519
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:20,520
or not, and now I'm still not sure, but I'm still having fun. Bob will help you dig your

520
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,000
own weirdness. He knows you want that slack, that slack attention.

521
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,900
He knows you want to make you free, that slack that makes you see, the slack that puts a

522
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:35,640
cloud in your scribe. I'm not going to take a lot of your time tonight. I got a short

523
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,480
message, an important message, but it won't work without you.

524
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,700
Now, children, you've been here a long time. I want everybody to stand up. Take a slackful

525
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:54,700
stretch for Bob. Stand up, children. Stand up. Stand up, children. Raise your hands above

526
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,240
your head.

527
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,760
Raise your hands above your head. Go from side to side, children. Side to side. That's it.

528
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:16,040
Be seated. And now, children, now that you're ready to receive the word of God, now, children,

529
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,700
the churches are so genius, like many great organized bodies, and certain rules, certain

530
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,320
guidelines.

531
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,340
If you were here last, you would know that.

532
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,140
Last night, you heard those rules, but they're worth hearing again.

533
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,600
Before I read these rules, I want to remind you of the great words of J.R. Bob Dodd.

534
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:38,840
I don't practice what I preach, because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

535
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,320
Thank you, children. Thank you.

536
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:48,440
Is there a typical subgenius? Of course not. The very thought is a blasphemy.

537
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,700
The only thing that most subgeniuses have in common is that they're all different, and they

538
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,320
have nothing to do with each other.

539
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,160
They have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normals.

540
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,520
By definition, the Church of the Subgenius can't really exist, because it's an organization

541
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,300
for people who are not joiners.

542
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,640
Eccentrics, unpredictables, true visionaries. Let us observe a few examples using the hidden

543
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,200
camera.

544
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:22,980
It was in the first 30 issues of Nine Inch Worm Comics, and I think in 14 issues of Four

545
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,340
and a Half Inch Worm Comics.

546
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,320
Is this the...

547
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,840
Is this man a subgenius?

548
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,500
Between 7-Eleven comics, those aren't the comics about 7-Eleven. It's the adventures

549
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,220
of a 7-Eleven. They have a person that works at 7-Eleven that just writes down everything

550
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:42,180
that happens. They draw them up, and the whole comic is shaped like a big 7-Eleven. It's

551
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:47,240
three-dimensional. And they've got the idea from a flying saucer that was shaped like

552
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,220
a 7-Eleven that flew over one night. It was a UFO believed to be...

553
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,840
A subgenius, obviously.

554
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,100
A subgenius.

555
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:02,100
The approach patterns are unmistakable. And here is another one. And here is another one.

556
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:11,060
All very different, yet all subgeniuses. They share only the quest for slack and the love

557
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:17,920
of their beloved spiritual teacher, the living avatar of slack, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

558
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
E.O.P.

559
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,400
E.O.P.

560
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,000
E.O.P.

561
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,080
E.O.P.

562
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,500
E.I.I.

563
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:25,520
E.O.P.

564
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,100
E.I.I.I.

565
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,940
E.I.I.I.

566
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,360
E.I.I.I.

567
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,360
E.I.I.

568
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,360
E.I.I.I.

569
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,840
E.I.I.I.

570
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,360
E.I.I.I.

571
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,500
E.I.I.I.

572
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,580
E.I.I.I.

573
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,640
O.O.

574
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,300
O.O.O.

575
00:35:53,380 --> 00:36:00,080
I was getting messages in the back of my brain as long ago as about 12 or 13 months.

576
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,460
And I just kept hearing the word Bob, Bob, Bob.

577
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,020
It would wake me up in the middle of the night.

578
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,640
I'd wake up doing jumping jacks.

579
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,480
I wouldn't know why.

580
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,140
You know, I'd say, oh, my God, the rod.

581
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,080
I didn't know what was causing these things.

582
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,520
I called up my doctor.

583
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,980
I knew that there was one time I had been under sedation in my whole life.

584
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,500
And it's the only time they could have implanted a device in my head.

585
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,200
I had the back of my head shaved.

586
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,540
I went to other doctors.

587
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,180
I had them look for scars.

588
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,860
I had my body gone over with x-ray devices and metal detectors.

589
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,120
And they could not find whatever it was that was implanted in me.

590
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:45,040
So it was only by chance that I started receiving mail from the Subgenius Foundation.

591
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,900
And I realized who Bob was.

592
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,960
And finally...

593
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:59,300
Friends, hopefully by now you've begun to get just the barest inkling of who J.R. Bob Dobbs really is.

594
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,680
And you can get a slight more inkling if you want to join us in this mighty parade and rally.

595
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,060
It says here, I got a memo from the station.

596
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,280
The media coverage of the results of the first round of the station's legal battle with them

597
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,660
made it sound like we were going to be off the air the next day.

598
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,860
Now, this is not true.

599
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,660
This is not true.

600
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:20,660


601
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:20,660


602
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,820
Why, many costly appeals can keep things going for a long time.

603
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:31,680
To correct this misperception, to channel the positive energies and slack of our thousands of supporters,

604
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,100
and to begin our winter pledge drive,

605
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,880
I sure hope some of you people that I called have gone ahead and sent your pledges in that you promised.

606
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,280
On Saturday, June 6th, beginning at noon, at Pike Park, just north of downtown Dallas on Harry Hines Boulevard,

607
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,640
you, uh, it will follow St. Paul through downtown and ride on Yonge to City Hall,

608
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,760
where there will be a rally, a monstrous rally on City Hall Plaza.

609
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,560
We need as many people as possible.

610
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,440
It needs to be a humongous, giant parade with godzillions of people.

611
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,480
And so our show needs to be represented and afloat with as many other cars and people as can make it.

612
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,880
But you have to call the station tomorrow at 8.

613
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,600
828-9500 to register.

614
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,920
And just let them know how many, you know, who you're going to be with, what you're going to bring.

615
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,060
Uh, and, uh, I mean, this is important for the station.

616
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,540
What we need is, you know, we're going to build some sort of a float.

617
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,480
I doubt if it'll really float.

618
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,440
We don't have anti-gravity suspensors.

619
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,960
But, uh, you know, an old beat-up truck with sacred symbols on it.

620
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,920
And we can have banners.

621
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,560
I actually have six 16-foot banners painted.

622
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,740
By Lies himself.

623
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,780
That I hate to take outdoors.

624
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,000
But I suppose I could if the weather's good enough.

625
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,080
And you can ride roller skates or be more creative than this, friends.

626
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,780
You can, you can, uh, become a shape shifter.

627
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,240
And actually do your magic tricks.

628
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,860
Change into the evil thing you really are right out there in front of people.

629
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,780
Or you can become the angel you truly are and fly away.

630
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,180
But in the meantime, let's silently watch.

631
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,860
Or actually, we got this.

632
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,060
We don't have the noise, but we don't have the picture.

633
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,780
So, so we'll pretend we're watching the subgenius video.

634
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,860
Just close your eyes and lean back.

635
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,420
And try to imagine.

636
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,280
Oh Bob.

637
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,800
Oh Bob.

638
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,260
Oh Bob.

639
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,400
Oh Bob.

640
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,320
Oh Bob.

641
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,120
Oh Bob.

642
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,340
Bob.

643
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,460
Bob.

644
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:41,860
Bob.

645
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:41,980
Bob.

646
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,780
Bob is everywhere.

647
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,060
Bob is bursting out all over the place.

648
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,080
Just look through any phone book in any city.

649
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,320
You get the same thing.

650
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,060
Bob's Construction Company.

651
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,520
Bob's Martinizing.

652
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,780
Bob's Floral.

653
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,220
Bob's Auto Parts.

654
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,640
Bob's Automotive Service.

655
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,020
Bob's Burgers.

656
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,200
Bob's Rent-A-Jalopy.

657
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,340
And then down here we've got Bob's Used Furniture Store.

658
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,680
I mean, he's like everybody's dad should be.

659
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,440
Bob is about as American as you can get.

660
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,520
Bob loves you.

661
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,220
Bob loves you.

662
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,320
Bob loves you.

663
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,400
Bob loves you.

664
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,120
Bob loves you.

665
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,440
Bob loves you.

666
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,040
Bob loves you.

667
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,800
Bob loves you.

668
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,680
Bob loves you.

669
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:16,820
Bob loves you.

670
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,340
Bob loves you.

671
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,140
Bob loves you.

672
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,900
Bob loves you.

673
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,240
Bob loves you.

674
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,120
Bob loves you.

675
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,060
Bob loves you.

676
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,980
Bob loves you.

677
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,000
Bob, I love you.

678
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,520
Bob loves you.

679
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:33,520


680
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:41,580
No matter where you are you're going.

681
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,000
Bob loves you.

682
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


683
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


684
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


685
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


686
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


687
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


688
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


689
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


690
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


691
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


692
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


693
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000


694
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,300
Bob loves you.

695
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,500
Bob loves you.

696
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:43,800
Bob loves you.

697
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,020
Bob loves you.

698
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,240
Bob loves you.

699
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,020
Bob loves you.

700
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,120
Bob loves you.

701
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,420
Texas 75214

702
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,720
Praise Bob.

703
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,080
The great Oz has spoken.

704
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,540
Hello.

705
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,680
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.

706
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,000
We all praise Bob.

707
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,520
And Bob, Bob prays on us.

708
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,280
But just who is this man, Bob?

709
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,620
Some call him the slack master,

710
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,820
the high epopt, the saint of sales.

711
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,200
Others call him liar, pimp, whoremonger,

712
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,380
a sleazy con man

713
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,820
foisting his dangerous scam off on gullible suckers.

714
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,020
Well, dear friend,

715
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,720
J.R. Bob Dobbs isn't some outmoded,

716
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,720
overused deity from ancient fairy tales,

717
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,780
but a living, bleeding deity

718
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,600
for today's world.

719
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,060
Today, the divinely appointed messenger of slack,

720
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,340
the mystic super salesman upon whose wheeling and dealing skills

721
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,460
the fate of the universe hinges.

722
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,800
He can sell you anything, and I bought it.

723
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,700
Bob is the aware man.

724
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,980
Bob can hear a fly cough,

725
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,260
and he can go up to that fly.

726
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,440
He can look that fly in the eye and say,

727
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,280
son, I'm going to give, I'd like to sell you a big old,

728
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,780
big old mound of fecal matter.

729
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,720
And I tell you what, that fly will buy that mound.

730
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,420
Excretory machines.

731
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,100
Huh.

732
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,760
Let me tell you the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

733
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,860
Bread of man in Yeti, he walked with the gods.

734
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,620
He wore a silly grin and he smoked a stupid pipe.

735
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,600
He fought the conspiracy every day.

736
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,540
He lived the day of his life.

737
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,360
He whipped the stench of many a man.

738
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,120
Followed many children with his mighty glance.

739
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,520
He founded the religion in which we all believe.

740
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:11,280
Brought us all the slack that everybody needs.

741
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,600
Born to humble parents somewhere in the middle of the world,

742
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:15,600


743
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:15,600


744
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:23,400
the child Bob experienced a traumatic close encounter with a UFO at the age of three.

745
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,420
Soon thereafter, he began to exhibit strange powers of persuasion.

746
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,200
The young Dobbs became a salesman of legendary, almost frightening abilities.

747
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,360
Known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

748
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,680
He worked his way up to the very top of the conspiracy ladder,

749
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,560
and might have stayed there.

750
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:53,140
But, late one night in 1953, while working on an amateur television of his own design,

751
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,620
an event occurred which was to become a milestone on man's mind path to slack.

752
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,320
He was suddenly seized up in this vicinity.

753
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,760
By the hand of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

754
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,700
It is so.

755
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,740
The cosmic puppeteer of the Old Testament.

756
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,820
The rival alien space god.

757
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,440
From some more corporate scene.

758
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,380
In this time and moment,

759
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,680
which we call the divine imagination of Bob,

760
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,620
Dobbs received the first of those three crippling amounts,

761
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,620
which form the sacred three scriptures of the church.

762
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,020
He was shown a vision.

763
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,200
A world where all humanity was equally wealthy.

764
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,120
Rich beyond imagination.

765
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,020
But without our work.

766
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,420
This experience combined with his UFO vision,

767
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,780
and the UFO given sales magic,

768
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,900
led him inevitably into the religion field.

769
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,920
He quickly discovered the golden rule embodied in his classic saying,

770
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,140
they'll pay to know what they really think.

771
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:05,180
And so, Bob Dobbs founded his church upon a sandy beach of common sense,

772
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,940
sense of humor, and dollars and cents.

773
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,380
A likely story, you say.

774
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,900
But it's simple, really.

775
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,580
Bob is lucky, not smart.

776
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,060
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,

777
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,740
he is gifted with incredible stupidity.

778
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,600
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.

779
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,460
This enables him to act without thinking.

780
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,660
To surf effortlessly on the luck plane.

781
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,520
To float down the fabled path of least resistance.

782
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,960
In fact, to make a million dollars every time he screws up.

783
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,000
And the only way to save yourself from this is not by doing it.

784
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,000


785
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,720
The next rule of the Church of the Subgenius is,

786
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:54,020
the Church of the Subgenius will help you pull the wool over your own eyes.

787
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,420
Now, children, what do we mean by pulling the wool over your own eyes?

788
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,780
You see, since you were, the day you were born,

789
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,560
you have been sold everybody else's wool.

790
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,300
You've been sold your school's wool.

791
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,420
Your church or synagogue's wool.

792
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,020
Your parents' wool.

793
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,560
Television's wool.

794
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,800
Movies' wool.

795
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,400
Here in the Church of the Subgenius, we want you to pull your own wool over your eyes and

796
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,140
relax in the safety of your own delusions.

797
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,200
And when you do that, children,

798
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,440
when you do that, in five minutes,

799
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,460
you'll be so sick of it, you'll do what God wants you to do.

800
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,640
You'll scrap those delusions and start thinking for yourself!

801
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:35,760
Get down!

802
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,780
He brings the student to the realization that

803
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,520
everything you know is true.

804
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,720
Under the conspiracy, you're being ripped off every day,

805
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,700
but you can learn to enjoy it.

806
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,180
They're always trying to screw you.

807
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,700
Well, maybe we ought to choose the way we want to be screwed.

808
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,820
Some ways are fun!

809
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:05,940
Yeah!

810
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:06,380
Yeah!

811
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,160
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

812
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,340
B-O-T.

813
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,200
O-N-A, O-O-O-N-A.

814
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,620
B-O-T.

815
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,220
Big Bang.

816
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:17,580
Bop.

817
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,360
B-O-T.

818
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,320
One, one dollar.

819
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,780
B-O-T.

820
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,600
B-O-T.

821
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,100
B-O-T.

822
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:24,980
B-O-T.

823
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,620
B-O-T.

824
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,720
B-O-T.

825
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:34,640
B-O-T.

826
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,160
B-O-T.

827
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,360
B-O-T.

828
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,680
B-O-T.

829
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,460
B-O-T.

830
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,100
B-O-T.

831
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,800
B-O-T.

832
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


833
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


834
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


835
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


836
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


837
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


838
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


839
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


840
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


841
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


842
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


843
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


844
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


845
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,220
He called his seminars,

846
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,180
instant instructions for those who follow no master.

847
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,380
He journeyed to Tibet,

848
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,860
and under ancient holy men,

849
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,620
he perfected the arts of landscaping and acupatting.

850
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,300
And.

851
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:22,480
He also began modeling for hundreds of magazine ads, leaving early clues of his presence.

852
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:30,180
These old ads are the only known photos of Dobbs, for he otherwise remains elusive, shunning

853
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,180
both the spotlight and the authority.

854
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:42,640
The church is so omnipervasive and so full that we could not possibly get into the dogma

855
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,240
in any less than three or four hours.

856
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:52,080
This will outline everything, clear and concise detail, easy to read, keep it near you, and

857
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:57,760
we promise that any answers that you need will be found in this handy little pamphlet

858
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,280
right here.

859
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,840
One dollar for salvation.

860
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,740
One dollar.

861
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,660
The Reverend Ivan Stang, who doesn't want his real name used to protect his wife and

862
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:11,400
kids, says he'll offer an immense cash prize to anyone who can prove that Bob Dobbs is

863
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,760
just a piece of clip art.

864
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,360
He sums up his strong feelings for his church and its founder.

865
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:21,900
Bob, unlike other gurus, doesn't demand that you believe in him all the time.

866
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,200
In fact, he pushes the idea of short-duration personal saviors.

867
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,840
You should have your own church.

868
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:31,720
You should have your own church.

869
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,720
You should make up your own church, ultimately.

870
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:42,560
Those who stayed in subgenius and cling to it like Trekkies do to Star Trek are not really

871
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,440
subgeniuses.

872
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,300
Those people are unfortunately humans.

873
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,720
And nine-tenths of them out there are like that, and thanks for the money.

874
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,660
Reverend Stang won't discuss income, but he says his church won't hide behind tax-exempt

875
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,660
status either, which is why he calls it the world's first industrial church.

876
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,080
The book sells for $10, memberships for $20.

877
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:01,720
The book sells for $10, memberships for $20.

878
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,460
The church urges members to study the literature closely, to keep it by the toilet and memorize

879
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:06,820
it.

880
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,920
Church leaders say this is the chance to get in on the ground floor of a huge lucrative

881
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,240
cult, now while rates are low.

882
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,700
Put on or good business.

883
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,980
Judge for yourself.

884
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:25,080
The conspiracy media, unable to ignore the church, has attempted to discredit it as a

885
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,780
mere joke, a pathetic satire.

886
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,660
The reason?

887
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,720
Slack is simply beyond their emotional limit.

888
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:31,720


889
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,320
It's their emotional grasp.

890
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:42,180
I was preparing tacos one day for my children, and the face appeared, and it's Bob.

891
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,020
After I joined Jane on stage, and the heckling becomes a merging of forces.

892
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:52,000
The stern of Jane will sort of segue into the headline.

893
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,260
They do the head-launching.

894
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,980
The arc containing the head will be brought out.

895
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,540
Right up to the opening of tonight's service, elaborate preparations.

896
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,700
All in the late morning.

897
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:01,700


898
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,940
the name of the psychodynamics of abnormality.

899
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,560
Okay, I'm Reverend Sternodox. I front one of the official heretical offshoots of the

900
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,400
Church of the Subgenius, the bleeding head of the World Cup Golfer Launcher Society.

901
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,160
And we encourage schismatics to join up and schism immediately.

902
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,620
And so, to the stirring sounds of the left coast zombie corral, tonight's religious experience

903
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:40,120
was underway. A capacity crowd exhorted to always remember that the world is a turkey

904
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,200
and that Bob gives you the carving knife.

905
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,520
About half the people here will have a great time. The rest of them will probably run for

906
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,020
the exit.

907
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,560
We had to run for the exit.

908
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,300
I got out.

909
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:28,160
And the police officer came up to me and says, uh, what the hell do you boys think you're

910
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:28,420
doing?

911
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,540
I said, why we're just bold surrealists, sir.

912
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,760
Bold surrealists!

913
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,660
Bold surrealists!

914
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:46,800


915
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:54,700
Son, you know how many men we got locked up in the state penitentiary who just love

916
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,060
to claim they're nothing but bold surrealists?

917
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,200
Come in here!

918
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:05,900
The church is subjected to constant harassment and attacks from every corner, which only

919
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,400
serves to illustrate how much they fear his message.

920
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,740
People say we gay! Say gay!

921
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:12,680
Gay!

922
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,700
People say we rev gay!

923
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:15,840
Rev gay!

924
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,140
People say we come along New York City!

925
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,780
We come along New York City!

926
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,300
Don't you have slack?

927
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,100
Children of the dope, I don't have slack.

928
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,440
One of the reasons I don't have slack is that which defines the subgenius.

929
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:39,680
As a pope, as a hard working subgenius, children, I am into a backdoor that hides my slack.

930
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,500
The harder you live it for Bob, the harder that new spirits you reach out to crush you.

931
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,120
That time they killed my father.

932
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


933
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


934
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


935
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


936
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


937
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


938
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


939
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


940
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


941
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


942
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


943
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


944
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


945
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


946
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


947
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,120


948
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,260
That was a fun one.

949
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:09,340
Oh yeah, that was fun, whoa.

950
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,540
That was a big ol' party.

951
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,720
Holy chybaary!

952
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,220
Pay for it!

953
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,660
Earlier on this program we were talking about thecito, we were talking about stereotypes,

954
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:17,660


955
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,640
That's one time they...

956
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,740
Shock the living gee out of me.

957
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:30,280
People have been accusing us of being some sort of devil worship cult.

958
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:36,500
This is really absurd and, you know, people see a devil worship everywhere,

959
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,580
the Procter & Gamble logo or what have you, but it's all untrue.

960
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:46,080
We have a special relationship with the being that is called the devil.

961
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:51,340
We're not worshipers precisely, but we are aware, as was he,

962
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:57,120
that God, or as we call him, Jehovah One, has gone slightly insane.

963
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,480
Also, Lucifer, the angel of light, only wanted a promotion in rank

964
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:09,560
and made a bad judgment and thus was thrown out of heaven by Jehovah One.

965
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,900
Meanwhile, Lucifer fell sizzling through the heavens.

966
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,060
In the Almighty God.

967
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,180
He hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky

968
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:24,680
with hideous ruin and combustion down to bottomless perdition,

969
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,740
there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire

970
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,220
who durst defy the omnipotent to arms.

971
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:35,540
Poor guy.

972
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:41,200
Some call us Satanists or the mockers prophesied in the Bible

973
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,280
as harbingers of the end times.

974
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,860
Still others dare to deny.

975
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,560
That Dobbs exists at all.

976
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:53,340
But if that were so, who posed for all those magazine ads in the 50s?

977
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,880
Everybody, it's time to stand.

978
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,980
Put your finger in your bobs land.

979
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,980
Touch your head and touch your knee.

980
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,060
I'll kill you if you kill me.

981
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:15,660
Now pull your wallet out of your pants and pray.

982
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,460
The feminist dupes of the conspiracy charge that not enough members are women.

983
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,620
Bob would agree to that.

984
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:28,780
Indeed, he would say there will never be enough women.

985
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,200
But at least the ones we have are all woman.

986
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,140
And Bob?

987
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,280
Bob is all man.

988
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,320
The James Bond of Zen masters.

989
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,560
The most dashing religious leader of his time.

990
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:44,840
Huh?

991
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,840
Bob is a sex god.

992
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:06,620
Bob is a sex god.

993
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,320
Bob is a sex god.

994
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:09,320


995
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,460
Unspeakable.

996
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,900
Unbearable.

997
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:15,820
Unころable.

998
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:16,200


999
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:17,900
Understandably.

1000
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,960
I understand that.

1001
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:23,700
If one of me is Satan, I'll come after him with my whole mind and think to fact.

1002
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,660
I don't know if God滲滲滾 does i search for lust.

1003
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:24,660


1004
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,120
throughout the universe, all men are bastard!

1005
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:26,120


1006
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:26,400
They just watch their karma!

1007
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:26,400


1008
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:26,400


1009
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,840
Bob doesn't care about your sins!

1010
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:33,760
Bob isn't ready to give a blah about your sin!

1011
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:43,180
Bob, jail-๜, todos, came and comes again and again and again to justify your sins, my friends!

1012
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,820
To rescue my soul!

1013
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:44,820


1014
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:44,820


1015
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,880
The squirting universe, children.

1016
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,660
Bob is a sex god, my friend.

1017
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,520
That's right.

1018
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,040
But he don't limit nothing.

1019
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,120
The whole universe is sex.

1020
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:57,920
Abuse.

1021
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,380
Nothing but sex.

1022
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:06,220
When the promised kingdom of Bob's great paradise of unlimited sales occurs,

1023
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,280
there'll be 25 sexes in the human race.

1024
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,240
25 sexes.

1025
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:16,520
Think of how many singles bars you're going to have to go to to score then, children.

1026
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,260
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

1027
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,900
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex.

1028
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,880
Bob is a sex god.

1029
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,360
Bob is a sex god.

1030
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,780
From the corporate sin galaxy.

1031
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,260
Oh, well, you all heard a lot of that stuff last week.

1032
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,240
Remember free love, children?

1033
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,240
The worst thing that could happen was you might need some penicillin later.

1034
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,200
A little penicillin was all you needed.

1035
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,180
You wouldn't die.

1036
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:05,040
And Bob, you'll be pleased to know that there's no trace of your old V.D.

1037
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,780
You mean to say that Bob has actually had one of those horrible diseases?

1038
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,920
That isn't true, doctor.

1039
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,120
Is that true, Bob?

1040
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,800
Just a minute, Sally. One scandal at a time.

1041
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:21,120
Yes, Bob Dobbs is a sex god.

1042
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:26,140
Rather than forgiveness, he offers something far more powerful.

1043
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,300
An excuse. A divine, all-inclusive excuse

1044
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:35,640
which allows the bearer to free himself from the grip of temptation

1045
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,220
by overindulging in it until it releases him.

1046
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,220
Oh.

1047
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:41,220


1048
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,420
The true seeker must give himself up to temptation,

1049
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,000
or he will never conquer it.

1050
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,220
That's right, dear friends.

1051
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,120
And, well, it's just about time for the end of that mighty hour of slack.

1052
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,860
You know, I've been sitting here, like I said,

1053
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,380
the soundtrack from this video, which I've been playing,

1054
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,940
is not totally mixed.

1055
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,880
All the spoken word parts are in.

1056
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,400
The pictures are sync.

1057
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,620
Live revival footage is all in.

1058
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,220
But when...

1059
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,220
When Dr. Hal is narrating, why...

1060
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,040
Uh, there's no music behind that.

1061
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,020
And I've got these ten cassettes in front of me.

1062
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,240
I've been flipping in and out

1063
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,840
to, uh...

1064
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,100
in hopes that they would sort of fit the mood.

1065
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,100
And, um...

1066
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,620
This is pathetically silly music to go with that kind of a thing.

1067
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,880
And here's some more information about the parade and rally.

1068
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,460
We need to have a mighty subgenius parade and rally, friends.

1069
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,240
We need to show them what slack is all about.

1070
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,740
Show them what they've been missing.

1071
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,660
Or in a lot of their cases, what they don't...

1072
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,680
You know, they don't want slack.

1073
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:46,940
They really don't.

1074
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,960
They just assume...

1075
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,820
Step up to higher pay or...

1076
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,820
Well, I would too, you know.

1077
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,660
It's confusing.

1078
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,400
It's a confusing issue and it...

1079
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,220
Come one, come all.

1080
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,900
Everybody needs to come.

1081
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:03,560
We got...

1082
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:03,860
That's...

1083
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,860
If you were wondering,

1084
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,560
that thing was on...

1085
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,300
Mainly on just one channel there.

1086
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,080
I'm gonna take off.

1087
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:10,740
Uh...

1088
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:13,320
Ron Lindsay ain't here, but you got Nippy Jones tonight.

1089
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,200
Yep.

1090
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,420
Nippy Jones up late at night.

1091
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:17,520
And, uh...

1092
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,940
Well, you know, I played...

1093
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,520
I played 45 minutes out of that, uh...

1094
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,540
Video soundtrack.

1095
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,720
And there's a whole nother 45 minutes to go.

1096
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,100
That means I don't have to work hard

1097
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,080
to get ready for the next hour of slack.

1098
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,820
And look, I gotta do a quick set of credits.

1099
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,460
The people that you heard ranting

1100
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,840
there in the devival were...

1101
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,740
St. Jainer Hypercletes

1102
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,940
and Sternodox Kekever of Doctors for Bob.

1103
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:40,520
Pope.

1104
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,520
David N. Meyer, Pope of all New York.

1105
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,340
Uh, me, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1106
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,480
Pastor Buck Naked from here in Dallas.

1107
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:48,440
Uh...

1108
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,400
And, uh...

1109
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,960
Oh, man, there's so many of them.

1110
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,440
How are I...

1111
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:52,760
Well...

1112
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,640
Music by D.K. Jones, among others.

1113
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,160
I had to get that in there, Nippy.

1114
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:57,640
I'm sorry.

1115
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,380
I mean, these guys don't get paid.

1116
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:00,800
That's all right, man.

1117
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,580
They could, I suppose, but they don't.

1118
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,180
And, uh...

1119
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,660
So, it's all yours.

1120
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,240
All right.

1121
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,340
Thank you very much, Dad.

1122
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:06,880
All right.

1123
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:08,020
Yeah!

1124
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:08,360


1125
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,280
It's the station.

1126
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,240
That's the party people picked for 1986.

1127
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,980
K-N-O-N 90.9 FM, Dallas, Fort Worth.

1128
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,700
A little bit after 12 o'clock.

1129
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,020
Nip Jones sitting in for Ron.

1130
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:19,660
Good morning.

1131
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,300
Morning, Mr. Radio.

1132
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,580

01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,780
Morning, Sister Oreo.

1134
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,760
Did I tell you everything is fine?
