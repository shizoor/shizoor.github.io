1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,140
The subgenius power of SWAT!

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,020
It's hard to believe they were attacked by an owl.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,700
Praise Bob!

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,640
Good evening, ladies and germs, this is Synesthesia.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,020
Very special episode here because Reverend Stang and Princess Wee Ardo are in the room with me tonight.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,640
The penultimate live broadcast from WCSB.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,100
That means next to the last.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,940
Yes, penultimate, yes.

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,020
See, I was under the impression this might be the last.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:52,860
Well, it could be, but I figured, you know, we might as well do every live show we can while we can here.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,000
I gotta admit though, it's really cold in this room.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,080
It's the same studio when you move away from that board.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,360
It's icy cold.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,240
Well, you're right underneath the vents there, and that's the way I like it.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,040
Personally, I would keep the studio this cold all year round, constantly.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,160
This is my ideal temperature.

17
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,840
It's a lot easier over there.

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:25,060
No, I was sitting right there where you're sitting right now just a few minutes ago during the previous hour, and I found myself saying, this air is deliciously cold.

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,460
That is...

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:39,740
You know, my Texas studio is in the living room, and I have to turn the heating or the AC off to record because it's noisy.

21
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,760
You can really hear it on these cheesy mics of mine.

22
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:53,100
You know what's funny is there's a lot of stuff that you cannot hear over the air that you can hear in the headphones on the studio.

23
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,440
Like last week, I was listening to Crabbe.

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,860
Crabbe Radio on my way home, and I heard comments about some kind of background noise that I could not hear from my car stereo.

25
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:14,040
And there are other times when I have listened to recordings of my own program, and I make a comment about some kind of background noise that's awful, and yet I can't hear it on the recording.

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,680
Well, for a long time, Dave had this buzz on his phone that drove me crazy, but other people didn't seem to be bothered by it.

27
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,100
Yeah.

28
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, you know, it was entirely appropriate.

29
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,980
There should always be a buzz on that line.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,960
And by the way, Buzz Buzz, Dave, if you're out there, 216- from the West, the S-5, like you didn't know the number already.

31
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,900
And we might even take a few other calls.

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,900
So this is a unique special occasion here on Synesthesia.

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,140
I normally don't start the talk show until 11 p.m., but the circumstances are a little different tonight.

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,160
And so that's why I need to advise you right now that portions of the following broadcast may be objectionable to some members of the audience.

35
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,700
Therefore, Bob.

36
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,980
Advises listener discretion.

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,400
And any views or opinions expressed in the program are not necessarily those of Bob or Cleveland State University.

38
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:10,760
And I know that I have been very fortunate to have the Hour of Slack as my lead-in for over 16 years now.

39
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,380
Wow.

40
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,560
And I cannot say enough good things about having you as a lead-in because it has allowed me to get exposed to more listeners.

41
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,000
And I can't say enough bad things about how things turned out.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,160
Like, I mean, Bob keeps letting us down.

43
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,420
But did Bob let us down or did we let Bob down?

44
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,240
Is that why the saucers haven't come yet?

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,060
Or have they and we just don't know it?

46
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
We just don't know nothing.

47
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,980
We don't know nothing about what Bob's got in mind or neither does he, no doubt.

48
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,420
He's probably sort of forgotten about the whole thing.

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,580
That's why he's so happy.

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
That's why he's smiling all the time.

51
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,540
He has that smile on his face that says, I don't know something you know.

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,780
And that's a kind of freedom.

53
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,220
I know that when Bob smiles, I'll ignore bad weather.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,600
What about the dog?

55
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,420
What about the dog?

56
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,000
What about the dog?

57
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,360
He'll pee the floor.

58
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,620
Well, we don't want to start singing our rock opera.

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,080
Well, you know, I am flattered that you did so on my program.

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,320
Thanks.

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,200
We have the whole 20-minute opera here.

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,680
The opera's only 20 minutes?

63
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,520
We truncated it quite a bit from the original, which is Tommy by The Who.

64
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,840
It's now called Buddy.

65
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,000
And it's not rehearsed enough yet.

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,920
No, no.

67
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,860
We're working on it.

68
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,420
We'll get there.

69
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,580
We'll present it when it's ready.

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,720
We know it by heart.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,940
In fact, I've had it as an earworm.

72
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,840
It kind of mixes between the original Tommy lyrics and the new Buddy lyrics.

73
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,160
Sometimes it's Peter Townsend singing, sometimes it's us.

74
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,920
And the words change.

75
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,280
But the music hasn't left my head in about four days now.

76
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,040
That's when you know you're onto something, when the music won't get out of your head.

77
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,480
Did you actually compose any original songs yourself here for this?

78
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,080
No, no.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,100
This is the lowest form of songwriting, filk singing.

80
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,920
We just took an existing thing everybody knows, changed the words slightly,

81
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,140
so it's not about a...

82
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,620
It's a parody.

83
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,780
I've done that myself on a few occasions.

84
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,460
Oh, sure.

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,320
I have...

86
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,700
I have...

87
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,680
Slackman.

88
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,640
Yes.

89
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,080
Do you still have the recording of that?

90
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,640
Because I don't.

91
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,420
Oh, I'm sure.

92
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,120
I lost it.

93
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,220
I lost my original recording of Slackman.

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,860
Now we have a recording of you saying, I lost it.

95
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,440
Yeah.

96
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,820
Well, you know what?

97
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,980
I might go do karaoke later tonight and I could just change the lyrics.

98
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,160
Yeah.

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
I could do that.

100
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,720
And record.

101
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,560
I've written a couple of poop songs based on existing songs.

102
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, that's the easiest thing to do.

103
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,940
It's the lowest form of songwriting.

104
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,740
Don't you say that poop songs are easy, man.

105
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,780
I'd like to see you write 10 albums worth like the Toilet Bowl Cleaners did.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,700
Actually, Princess, we and I have a band that only records once every 10 years or so.

107
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,180
And the name of our band is...

108
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,340
Pooh Water.

109
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,620
Pooh Water Towel.

110
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,180
Pooh Water Towel.

111
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,120
Pooh Water Towel.

112
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,460
Pooh Water Towel.

113
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:34,700
It's, you know, if the toilet overflows and the poo water comes out, you have a towel

114
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,820
that lays on there.

115
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,140
And what are you going to do with that towel afterwards?

116
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,020
You know, are you really going to wash the poo water towel?

117
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,740
One of life's bleachable moments.

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,920
Or you're just going to throw it away and get a new towel.

119
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,240
You ever see the show Doc Martin?

120
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,480
I remember seeing an episode where like there was everybody who went to the clinic was getting

121
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,860
sick.

122
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,020
And it's because they were serving everybody tea and the dishwasher was all messed up.

123
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,620
And like, you could save people tea with cups that have been washed in poo or...

124
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,560
Oh, so that's how you pronounce it.

125
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,260
Pooh Water.

126
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:10,620
Pooh Water.

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,460
Yeah, you just leave the tea out.

128
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,180
That depends on your...

129
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,420
But you can't leave the pee out.

130
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,300
Damn right.

131
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,160
That's a different band.

132
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:27,540
We could go on and on and on about the subtleties of pronunciation of, you know, waste products.

133
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,060
But let's take a call here.

134
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,160
I don't know who this is.

135
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,240
I don't know if this is Dave or not.

136
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,180
I don't think it is him.

137
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,300
Hello, you're on the radio.

138
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,340
Hey.

139
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,300
Hey.

140
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,780
Turn it down.

141
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,120
There we go.

142
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:38,900
Hey.

143
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,320
Hey, great to talk to you guys.

144
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,700
Does Bob own any pets or is he just in charge of all of them?

145
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,340
I don't know.

146
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,420
We are his pets and he owns us, yes.

147
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:07,520
Actually, he had a dog named Fido and a dog named Rover at some point in the past, but

148
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,920
that's all we really know.

149
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,680
We...

150
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,860
Kind of mysterious, huh?

151
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,200
We're his dogs.

152
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,720
Yes, we're his dogs.

153
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,120
I agree.

154
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,680
We're Bob's dogs.

155
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,540
Yeah.

156
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,460
I can think of worse ways to go, you know.

157
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,740
I've...

158
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,160
I was lucky enough to see Bob once.

159
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,400
Yeah.

160
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,320
Yes.

161
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,260
I was at a coffee shop and he came in with his pipe blazing as it always is.

162
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,880
And they're like, you can't smoke that in here.

163
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,380
And Bob just stood there and just kept on smiling and, you know, you don't want to try and remove that pipe.

164
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,400
No.

165
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,100
You don't want to see what's in there.

166
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,080
You don't want to see what happens when you try and pull.

167
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,480
You will rip your arm out of your socket before you can pull that pipe out of Bob's mouth.

168
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,540
Ouch.

169
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,400
And sad to say the, you know, because he just stood there with his smile, you know, they

170
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,320
threw him out into the street and a bus came along right there, ran him over.

171
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,860
You know, the first time I saw Bob was on the short way.

172
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,120
I saw him again.

173
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,580
I saw him again, though, the next day he was just fine.

174
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,840
In fact, he was even better from it.

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,800
He won a multimillion dollar settlement.

176
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,200
Did he really?

177
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:18,720
Oh, yeah.

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,480
No.

179
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,620
Whatever happens to Bob, it's good luck for him.

180
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,460
Wow.

181
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,820
Yeah.

182
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,820
Whatever Bob wants just happens to be what's going to happen anyway.

183
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,560
Sometimes he's in the mood for some kind of painful disaster, but not often.

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,020
But it all works out in the end for him.

185
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,220
And he usually makes a million bucks at least.

186
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,180
He makes a million bucks every time he screws up.

187
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,740
Yeah.

188
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
Every time.

189
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,160
And that was true even before his immaculation.

190
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,980
Ah, yes, the immaculation.

191
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,000
That may have been why Jehovah One chose him.

192
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,040
It's like, Lord, this human is even more powerful than I.

193
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,820
You were playing during your portion of the broadcast all along the watchtower, and I

194
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,660
think that was actually put out by Jehovah One's witnesses.

195
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,720
No, I get it, because his watchtower is actually on the wall.

196
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,720


197
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,720


198
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,720


199
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,720


200
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,720


201
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,720


202
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,720


203
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,720


204
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,000
He's a watchtower.

205
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,780
And awake, that was their other publication.

206
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,500
Boy, their artwork.

207
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,160
That's the one thing I miss.

208
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,160
Those have gone downhill.

209
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,780
Their artwork used to be beautiful paintings, and now it's so modernistic.

210
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,640
You know.

211
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,200
They just don't paint the mushroom clouds with the same brilliance as they used to.

212
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,340
No, the big fist hovering over the flaming planet.

213
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,640
It's all new agey, modern-y looking.

214
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,700
That's the one thing I miss about having a Kingdom Hall.

215
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:45,700


216
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:45,700


217
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:45,700


218
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:45,700


219
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:45,700


220
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:45,700


221
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:45,700


222
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,160
in my neighborhood is free copies of Awake.

223
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,600
They don't show up in my lobby anymore.

224
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,240
Is it true that Bob can never get cancer?

225
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,640
Can never get cancer?

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,720
Well, of course Bob can get cancer,

227
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,160
but the question is, what does the cancer do to him?

228
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,740
Right, and what does he do with it?

229
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,500
Yeah.

230
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,940
He can turn it into a positive.

231
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
He could probably, probably in his case, it's contagious.

232
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,660
And that is why they tried to abolish him.

233
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,700
That's why they tried to lock him up and quarantine him.

234
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,260
But of course, we saw how that worked out for Bob.

235
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,380
You're right.

236
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,120
You try to put walls around him.

237
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,540
Every one of those, the judge, the DA, all of them got cancer.

238
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,060
Yeah.

239
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,640
The warden, the bailiff, the jailers,

240
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,420
everyone who tried to jail Bob.

241
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,040
Even the executioners who tried to put him down.

242
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,400
But it was his cancer and they loved it.

243
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,160
They died with a big smile on their face.

244
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,380
So this is slack.

245
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
There is no cancer like Bob's cancer.

246
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,820
Yeah, that's a good one.

247
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,040
So what else?

248
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,540
Any other questions, caller?

249
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,300
Yeah, does Bob own a cell phone?

250
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,080
Can I call him?

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,900
How much time do you have?

252
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,880
Do you know how long Bob's phone number is?

253
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,640
20 minutes.

254
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,720
You know how long Bob's phone number is?

255
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,100
You ever tried to make an international call?

256
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,880
Well, raise that number of digits by an order of magnitude.

257
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,340
That's how long it's going to take you to dial Bob's phone.

258
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
By the time you actually get a ringtone,

259
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,900
by the time you actually hear the phone ringing,

260
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,840
it's already July 5th, 1998.

261
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,060
When's the last time you guys talked to Bob?

262
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,240
Did you ever?

263
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,060
I mean, we prayed to him before.

264
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,240
I was standing on a stage during one of our devivals,

265
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,980
in San Francisco,

266
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,680
on the fateful night of January 20th, 1984.

267
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,680
Totally unexpectedly, Bob appears backstage.

268
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,040
We all just kind of stared like,

269
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,840
huh, what?

270
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,580
Dr. Hal had the presence of mind to go out and get on the mic

271
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,540
and excitedly introduce him.

272
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,280
Bob walked out, and before he could say a word,

273
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,140
his own beloved disciple, Puzzling Evidence,

274
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,160
ran out with a handgun and shot him dead.

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,440
Oh, my God.

276
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,300
And some of us, well, Puzzling Evidence was immediately brained

277
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,880
with a handy whiskey bottle that was nearby, but...

278
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,460
Everybody was shocked.

279
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,640
I thought it was tequila.

280
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,400
Huh?

281
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,580
Well, you hear all kinds of stuff.

282
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,240
It was empty.

283
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,240
It was an empty bottle.

284
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,700
Anyway.

285
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,860
Uh, he did bounce back,

286
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,720
but he quit coming to shows after the second time he was shot dead.

287
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,380
Well, Bob was actually able to salvage some of the metal from that bullet,

288
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,460
and it turned out that it was actually worth more than its weight

289
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,060
once he melted it down.

290
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,900
You know, that was the one time we saw him without part of the pipe.

291
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,140
The pipe broke in half.

292
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,720
Yeah.

293
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,020
There's an excellent...

294
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,820
But it grew back.

295
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,660
It grew back later.

296
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,760
All of this, by the way, can be seen in the subgenius documentary movie,

297
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,420
the original, the first subgenius documentary movie called Arise,

298
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,100
which we put together many years ago.

299
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,980
And it's also in the new movie that's coming out soon,

300
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,060
which is called J.R. Bob Bob's End of the Church of the Subgenius.

301
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,480
Can't wait to see it.

302
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,140
I sure do hope it gets a distributor and gets on Netflix or something.

303
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,260
It's really...

304
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,840
It's really slick.

305
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,400
It's very, very entertaining.

306
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,460
Moves really fast.

307
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,040
He's speaking in terms of his own opinion, of course, here.

308
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,380
That's not my movie.

309
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,320
I didn't make it.

310
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,400
This non-commercial station does not endorse or make qualitative statements

311
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
about any product out there for sale or rent.

312
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,640
But, you know...

313
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm saying that I hope to be able to see it again.

314
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,760
I've seen it five times in movie theaters at film festivals.

315
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,440
And I think Reverend Stang was just expressing his own personal feelings.

316
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,820
Exactly.

317
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,180
It's my...

318
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,540
It's my admiration for the director, the editor, the camera people.

319
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,500
That was a...

320
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,860
The writer, the sound mixer, the music person.

321
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,940
All of the elements of it are really professional.

322
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,000
And they were very well paid by the director, Sandy Boone.

323
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,760
And it just showed in Australia at two different festivals.

324
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,740
The only people who have seen it are people who have gone to film festivals.

325
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,440
Right.

326
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,160
And I'm sad to say that I have not been to a film festival in many years.

327
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,840
I think...

328
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,420
And it's been eight years, I think, since the last film festival I went to.

329
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,420
I don't know if you know who knows that number off the top of his head.

330
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,740
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

331
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,240
You're on the radio.

332
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:54,580
What?

333
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,480
Yeah, wake up, Dave.

334
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm awake.

335
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,700
I'm pulling...

336
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,720
Get your act together, man.

337
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,440
I'm ready to go.

338
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:01,940
I'm ready to go, man.

339
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,460
Your face is on fire.

340
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,780
Put your face out, dude.

341
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,840
You know the ancient martial technique of face biting?

342
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,160
Yeah.

343
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,520
As a form of self-protection.

344
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,120
What are you talking about, dude?

345
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
I'm a third-degree black belt in face biting.

346
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,180
Third degree?

347
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:20,700
Yeah.

348
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,920
That means you've been questioning for the longest period of time...

349
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,780
It's the Bob Alarm.

350
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,440
...then we set back to the countryside.

351
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,700
It's the Bob Alarm?

352
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,140
Yeah.

353
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,160
What, is he here?

354
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,920
No, I don't know what it means.

355
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,420
We've never heard it before.

356
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,780
Oh, man.

357
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,980
No, this is not good.

358
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,520
This is not good.

359
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:33,640
Oh, it stopped.

360
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,200
Is it...

361
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,980
Oh, that's even scarier.

362
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:37,960
Yeah.

363
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,440
That is...

364
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,000
The only thing scarier than the Bob Alarm is the Bob Alarm.

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,380
The Bob Alarm is stopping.

366
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,440
Yes.

367
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,860
Oh, my God.

368
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,960
I saw Bob in the sky.

369
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,060
Like, what's going to happen to us?

370
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,060
I don't know.

371
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,980
Well, you know, if we can truly try to emulate Bob, it'll be okay.

372
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,140
We'll be just fine.

373
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,140
It's all good luck at the end.

374
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,120
The atmosphere is going to catch on fire.

375
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,140
I need some help on that.

376
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,040
Do you think so, Stan?

377
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,180
Do you think that's really true?

378
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,160
Help on what?

379
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:01,480
Huh?

380
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,120
What was I listening to?

381
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,320
What Dr. Sinister just said.

382
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,540
Do you think that's really true?

383
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,420
Yeah, whatever he said there.

384
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,960
I was trying to figure out...

385
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,520
Everything I say is true.

386
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,400
This statement is a lie.

387
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,200
Bob, Bob belies reliance.

388
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,160
Don't lie.

389
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,740
What?

390
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:28,640
Hey, Dave, I got a couple more good reviews of our slack that I need to read because of the last one.

391
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,520
This portion of shameless self-promotion is brought to you by the Church of the Serb Genius.

392
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,600
Well, these are real reviews that were on Apple podcast version of it.

393
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,380
And, okay, this guy says,

394
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,020
This show is the best slackful broadcast I know.

395
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,500
Long live Haas and puzzling evidence.

396
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,140
It makes more sense than any religion I have seen.

397
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,000
I love Bob Woo.

398
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,480
It's like Fireside Theater on crack or, more accurately, on Bob.

399
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,340
Always uplifting.

400
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,640
Download it.

401
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,860
Gain slack and praise Bob.

402
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,640
And then here's my favorite one.

403
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,900
And this one's from Canada.

404
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,680
Pretty much unlistenable.

405
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,360
Pretty much unlistenable.

406
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:17,200
See, there's a small clique of Canadians that have an agenda.

407
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,400
Whatever happened to St. Bucky?

408
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,440
Oh, he was never a problem.

409
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,260
St. Bucky is still around.

410
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,260
He was in the Canadian Army for a while.

411
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,500
He got married and had a kid.

412
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,360
He almost came to X Day again a few times.

413
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,080
He used to.

414
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,220
I think he had trouble with the...

415
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,000
The GFY group.

416
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,920
This is a different Bucky than the one that I know.

417
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,460
No, there's the Bucky in Germany.

418
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,640
That's a different...

419
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,460
That's a different Bucky, yes.

420
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,060
I'm talking about the Canadian Bucky.

421
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,760
And Buckminster Fuller is nowhere to be found.

422
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,260
You know what?

423
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Seriously, if I ever have a son...

424
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,280
Oh, he's at Owen Ann's house.

425
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,680
If I ever have a son, I will name him Buckminster.

426
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,200
Well, he's still busy baking his geodesic bones.

427
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,080
Yeah.

428
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,700
And Buckminster wasn't even...

429
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,360
Bucky Fuller's first name.

430
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,920
He chose to go by his middle name, Buckminster.

431
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,740
Yeah, well, he was naming himself after those Bucky balls.

432
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,720
Yeah.

433
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah, I think his first name should have been Pork Illusion.

434
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,140
For all I know, it might have been.

435
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,160
By the way, one of the top three archivists of Buckminster Fuller

436
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,760
is our old buddy, Uncle Dr. Onan Canobite.

437
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,600
He's also our main archivist of a couple other...

438
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,540
Somewhat more obscure names.

439
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,900
And when I croak, he gets the shed, the Dobbs Shed in Texas,

440
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,260
which has all of our archives.

441
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,740
That shed currently has two air conditioner units running all the time.

442
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,140
You gotta climate control those archives, man.

443
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:00,580
Yeah.

444
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,200
Not too happy he agreed to that.

445
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,620
Well, it's 100 degrees there now.

446
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:06,740
Yeah.

447
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,280
So, yeah.

448
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,280
It's probably about 80 in the shed.

449
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,540
But it feels like...

450
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,280
When I come to visit, it will be wintertime.

451
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,560
It's really nice weather then.

452
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,540
It's beautiful in the winter.

453
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,500
No, I went to Raleigh.

454
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,480
That's the farthest south I've been in the United States.

455
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,360
I went to Raleigh in March, and it was too hot in March.

456
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,720
Heck.

457
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,700
They have watermelon festivals in Alachua, Florida in the beginning of May.

458
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,900
Their watermelon crop was already in.

459
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,060
It was the end of May.

460
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,560
Down by the bay where the watermelons grew?

461
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,560
Yep.

462
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,100
Where the water increased by the numbers, too.

463
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,620
There's five of them now.

464
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,640
They have big, big, big, shiny, shiny teeth.

465
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,040
I like to beat gophers and watermelons with a stick.

466
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,820
Watermelons with a stick?

467
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,580
Yeah, beat the hell out of them.

468
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,320
They used to use that as a punch in the face.

469
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,420
I was beating a watermelon with a small baseball bat.

470
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,000
At the Foley table.

471
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,840
Does anybody know what a Foley table is?

472
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,980
A Foley table?

473
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,480
That's for recording sound effects for movies.

474
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:15,920
Yeah.

475
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,080
Yeah, you smash a watermelon for a body hitting a pavement.

476
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,580
And that's what they call a Foley folly.

477
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,640
What?

478
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,200
What?

479
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,720
I thought that was clever as hell.

480
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,960
I'll have to try and remember that, but I'm having problems remembering things.

481
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:31,980
No.

482
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,180
No.

483
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,820
Well, how much of it's really worth remembering to begin with?

484
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,360
Wait, what were we talking about?

485
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,900
I think we were talking about meteorites.

486
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,800
I have to keep very careful notes.

487
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,140
But what about the vegans out there?

488
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,760
They don't want to eat meteorites.

489
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,940
They want to eat vegierites.

490
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,300
You know?

491
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,280
Oh, man.

492
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,940
Dr. Dark said he was going to come back from the dead.

493
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:58,660
Yes, he did.

494
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,660
Yes, he did.

495
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,380
He warned us.

496
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,960
Exit stage left.

497
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,260
Exit stage left.

498
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,820
That is definitely the worst pun that's going to be on the air tonight.

499
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, that sounds like a challenge.

500
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,960
I had an all plant burger.

501
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,920
An all vegetable burger.

502
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,920
Like they're selling it in many places that I shouldn't name.

503
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,960
I was walking through the produce aisle and I saw a sign that said healthy beets.

504
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,060
But I kept on walking because I only rock out to sick beets.

505
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,620
A ham sandwich.

506
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,360
A ham sandwich walks in a bar.

507
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,780
The bartender says, sorry, we don't serve food here.

508
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,300
See the difference between those two jokes?

509
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,120
The one I told about.

510
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,580
The beets.

511
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,420
I made that up myself.

512
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,300
You want to hear one?

513
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,960
I made one up.

514
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,000
You want to hear another one?

515
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,700
Not really.

516
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,500
A horse walks into a bar and he says, and the bartender says, show me your ID.

517
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,780
And he says, I left my wallet in the stable.

518
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,620
I just made that up.

519
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,700
Horse walks into a bar.

520
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,300
Bartender says, why the long face?

521
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,480
The horse says, I stripped your mother.

522
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,440
Oh, there you go.

523
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,120
Hey, a panda walks in a bar.

524
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,180
My saying joke is a bar walk.

525
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,020
A dog walks into a dog.

526
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,740
Same kind of thing.

527
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,120
There's a little, the saying brings a little growth on the side of his head that looks just like a little talking version of his regular head.

528
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,700
He walks in the bar and the bartender says, hey, man, we don't serve freaks in here.

529
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,900
And the little talking head goes, you're telling me, man, I've been trying to get rid of this a-hole for the last half an hour.

530
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,680
That's really funny considering that you have a double mean baby head hanging off the back of your head.

531
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,960
No kidding, Dave.

532
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,060
You can't.

533
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,720
It's gibbering.

534
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,960
It is not my fault.

535
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,680
It is a matter of perception.

536
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,880
I do not see the tiny baby head on the back of mine.

537
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,760
And it does nothing.

538
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,280
Actually, you can.

539
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,360
Nonetheless, there.

540
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,000
There's a.

541
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,620
How about this one?

542
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,360
A panda walks into a bar.

543
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,300
The bartender says, hey, dude, not everything is black and white.

544
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,860
I'm sorry.

545
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,100
I'm sorry.

546
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,960
I made that up.

547
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,340
A C, an E flat, and a G walk into a bar.

548
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,260
The bartender says.

549
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,240
The bartender says we don't serve minors.

550
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,880
That's deep, man.

551
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,080
But that's absolutely true.

552
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,100
Those notes are the actual three notes of the triad of the C minor chord.

553
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,740
I'll be in town all week.

554
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,220
Thank you.

555
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,400
Yeah.

556
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,340
You're a waitress.

557
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,600
But.

558
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,640
Dr. Dark said that he was going to prove there was life after death.

559
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,040
He was going to come back like Houdini, who didn't.

560
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,180
But I think he.

561
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,380
Houdini, who didn't.

562
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,540
I think Dr. Dark.

563
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,540
The most deadly punster who ever walked the earth.

564
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,580
And they always.

565
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,180
He always got heckler of the year at the Bobby Awards.

566
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,060
He was just.

567
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,500
All right.

568
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,440
You want to hear a really bad one?

569
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Torture expert of puns.

570
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,800
So a frog walks into a bank.

571
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,160
And he introduces himself as Kermit Jagger.

572
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,140
And the loan officer he meets.

573
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,840
Her name is Patricia Wack.

574
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,640
And he says, you know, I'm.

575
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,300
Yeah, my father is Mick Jagger, but I'm trying to get out from under his shadow.

576
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,020
And I just, you know, because Mick Jagger got around.

577
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,660
Right.

578
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,380
Right.

579
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,740
And he's like, well, but so I need to take out a loan to start my own business here.

580
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,200
And Patricia Wack says, well, I mean, you know, with your credit score being what it is as a frog.

581
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,240
I don't think, you know, I don't think we can do this without some collateral.

582
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,300
So he pulls out this like Jade elephant sculpture thing.

583
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,520
And he says, well, how about this?

584
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,760
How's this for collateral?

585
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,520
You know?

586
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,420
And she says, I don't know.

587
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,980
It's kind of small.

588
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,800
Let me ask my manager.

589
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,180
So she goes to the bank office and talks to the bank manager.

590
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,980
And she's like, what is this thing?

591
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,560
And like, why should we, you know, can we give this?

592
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,820
The manager just says, relax.

593
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,140
It's a knickknack.

594
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,660
Paddy Wack.

595
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,580
Give the frog alone.

596
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,720
His old man's a rolling stone.

597
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,980
That was horrible.

598
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,240
That was not what we wanted.

599
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,240
You knew it was going to be something like that.

600
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,380
It was horrible.

601
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,560
It was good.

602
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,580
Anyway, anyway.

603
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,720
I remember that.

604
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,440
That's what you call a shaggy mammoth stone.

605
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:17,940
I'll never forget.

606
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,880
It's like a bad day in a mental institution.

607
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,280
My mom told me she was getting a hip replacement.

608
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,220
I said, good for you, mom.

609
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,740
You haven't been hip since the seventies.

610
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
Oh, that's better.

611
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,720
I laughed, but it was bad.

612
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,460
I laughed internally.

613
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,120
So funny.

614
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,780
You forgot to laugh.

615
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,140
Yes.

616
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,440
So there is.

617
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,500
I mean, I think I'm going to have to go back to the old man's story.

618
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,500


619
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,500


620
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,500


621
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,500


622
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,500


623
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,500


624
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,500


625
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,500


626
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,500


627
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,700
I'm going to have to go back to the old man's story.

628
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:38,700


629
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:38,700


630
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:38,700


631
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:38,700


632
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,040
I'll tell you what, it's life after death, but it's a kind of death.

633
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,820
It's in life.

634
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,260
Death by pun.

635
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,660
What does Bob say about the afterlife?

636
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,740
I think it's time for you to read a book called The Book of the Subgenius.

637
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,640
Okay.

638
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,020
It's been in print for sales since 1978.

639
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,020
When was the first?

640
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,820
Wait.

641
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:04,860
The first?

642
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,640
The original pamphlet was published in 78, right?

643
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,280
Actually, it was.

644
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,480
It was a pre-published book.

645
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,480


646
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,480


647
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,100
It came up from the printer on January 2nd, 1980.

648
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,040
Book of the Subgenius was published originally in 1983, flopped.

649
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:24,880
Then it was published by somebody else in 85 and did much better.

650
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,060
So it's still around.

651
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,480
None of our other books are.

652
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,360
We did four or five books after that, and they're all out of print.

653
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,700
Nobody cares.

654
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,920
So this all started in Berkeley, right?

655
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:36,920


656
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:37,940
No.

657
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,280
What are you talking about, dude?

658
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,460
No.

659
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,000
It will.

660
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,500
Was JFK shot in Berkeley?

661
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,780
No, no.

662
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,560
These guys went to Berkeley, didn't they?

663
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,440
No.

664
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,300
For crying out loud.

665
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,420
No.

666
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:56,480
The Puzzling Evidence show started in Berkeley in 1982, three hours before the Hour of Slack.

667
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,360
I mean, three years before the Hour of Slack was broadcast.

668
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,540
This is getting like a really bad superhero's origin.

669
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,400
You should change the subject.

670
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,140
Yeah.

671
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,180
I know.

672
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,300
It sounds like an X day.

673
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,560
Well, it's like, you know, I'm not going to be around forever.

674
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,020
I want to set the facts straight.

675
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,800
And I think that is important.

676
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,920
I mean, there's even a Wikipedia page about this stuff.

677
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,180
Yeah, and all the facts aren't exactly right on there.

678
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:25,880
Luckily.

679
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,780
But it would be a violation of the terms of service to edit a page that pertains to yourself.

680
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,760
Oh, right.

681
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,440
I actually was mentioned on a Wikipedia page.

682
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,780
I think it was.

683
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,720
About the Hour of Slack.

684
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,680
And it said that it airs in Cleveland as, quote unquote, part of Dr. Sinister's show.

685
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,020
That's not true.

686
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,460
But I can't correct it because you can't write about yourself on Wikipedia.

687
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,440
There's all kinds of little odd details in there.

688
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,500
No, no.

689
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,760
You know you could correct something like that.

690
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,220
You just get in touch with whatever person you're supposed to get in touch with.

691
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,880
You can email them saying, listen, that's who you are.

692
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,320
And you've always been that way deep down in your soul.

693
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,280
You know there's nothing like Ragupazini.

694
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,700
And you just love every minute and every second.

695
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,160
Yeah, this is the first carnival.

696
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,100
There you go.

697
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,880
See, it's simple.

698
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,360
Yeah.

699
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,940
I don't see how you could make it any more plain.

700
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,020
Well, I don't.

701
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,220
It's Dave's special.

702
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,200
There's no reason to be insulting.

703
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,060
The plain could be beautiful.

704
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,500
Dave, you don't just make the plain beautiful.

705
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,660
You make it sublime.

706
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,960
I make the plain sublime.

707
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,960
Yeah, but he makes sublime things.

708
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,900
He makes things terrible and broken.

709
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,140
See, that's the point.

710
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,080
It goes both ways.

711
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,700
That reminds me of the time that you told me about when you almost got into a lawsuit

712
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,040
with a band called Sublime.

713
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,100
Oh, that was so sad.

714
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,340
That was horrible.

715
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,100
Yeah.

716
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
They were lemons for sure.

717
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,620
Well, there was this record, Sublime's first album.

718
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,800
They had gotten big.

719
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:05,940
Yeah.

720
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:05,980
They were big.

721
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,940
And their first album was reissued.

722
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,280
Too big for their shorts.

723
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,840
When they first did it, nobody knew who they were except in Long Beach or something.

724
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,540
But they used Bob on the CD itself.

725
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:25,020
Not the packaging, but the actual CD had a picture of J.R. Bob Dobbs on it.

726
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,660
And this album was selling great.

727
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:34,380
And at that time, I had a business manager who would get after this kind of stuff.

728
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,200
That year, we made more off of trademark violations.

729
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,340
All settled out of court.

730
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,300
We never sued anybody.

731
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,160
We just point out, hey, that's a trademark.

732
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,300
And they go, oh.

733
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,780
Well, Jesus calls Sublime on the phone.

734
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
And the bass player answers.

735
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,340
And Jesus says, well, you guys used our Bob thing.

736
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,000
He goes, yeah, Bradley was really into that.

737
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,360
He just died of a drug addiction.

738
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,340
He was drug overdosed.

739
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,520
See, he was OD'ing when we were in performance school.

740
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,740
We didn't have any money then.

741
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,200
What would you have charged us?

742
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,180
And I said, oh, Jesus said $2,000.

743
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,040
He goes, oh, well, that's not, yeah, OK.

744
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,060
Bradley loved you guys, man.

745
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,140
And the funny thing, I loved that album, too.

746
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,900
I started playing it.

747
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,260
I just loved it.

748
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,460
You know, I like it a little less now than I did when it first came out.

749
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,200
I was a teenager when that album came out.

750
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,600
And the whole song, like, What I Got, you know, you might get run over.

751
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
You might get shot or whatever.

752
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,300
But then on another song, it's like, I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat.

753
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:54,860
Like, so he's advocating violence, like, in one of these songs.

754
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:01,140
Like, oh, oh, my girlfriend left me for you, so I'm going to kill you.

755
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,700
Like, he wrote a whole song about that.

756
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,180
Well, now, if Stephen King writes a thing about a murder, that doesn't mean he murders anybody.

757
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,440
That does not mean he's a murderer.

758
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:09,900
Exactly.

759
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,160
Ice-T had that same problem.

760
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:12,960
Yeah.

761
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,160
Ice-T ain't no cop killer.

762
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,180
He plays a cop on TV.

763
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:15,960
Yeah.

764
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,320
It's the frame of the letter.

765
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,800
Hey, you know what?

766
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,160
If you rearrange the letters of Sublime, it spells Smile, Buh.

767
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,280
Wow.

768
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,060
Why did they even say Sublime?

769
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,580
I am so glad I learned that.

770
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,300
I was taking a class in Ukrainian language development the other week.

771
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:32,680
And I was like, I'm going to kill you.

772
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:32,680


773
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:32,680


774
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:38,000
And believe me, the first thing you want to see is something like a nurse showing her underpants.

775
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,320
Yeah.

776
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:39,520
Yeah.

777
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:46,740
That Sublime album was about the only album that my daughter and I both liked.

778
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,320
She had decided to, she's about the age when it's time to hate your parents' music.

779
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,980
You know, I consider myself very fortunate in that I liked almost all of my parents' music.

780
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,660
Although I have to say, there was a time when I used to actually tell my parents to turn their music off.

781
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,120
I was like, I'm going to turn their music down.

782
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:12,000
Mainly because I was upstairs trying to jerk off while they were blasting the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and kind of got in the way.

783
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,800
Not the Flying Burrito Brothers?

784
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,640
No.

785
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,100
No, they saved that for nights.

786
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,540
No, they're the Eggplanted Age Chicago.

787
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,560
That's what the name of the one song was, wasn't it?

788
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,940
The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band?

789
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,240
Well, I was thinking of the Circle Be Unbroken or something like that.

790
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,560
Yeah.

791
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,100
I thought it was.

792
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,140
Yeah.

793
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,060
And that's the thing I didn't get because we are not hillbillies.

794
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,960
We're not religious.

795
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,460
And my parents would blast this song like,

796
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,620
It was there in that little mountain church house.

797
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,080
Really?

798
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,300
Like, why?

799
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:58,780
Like, oh, well, you know, this is like the kind of stereotype that gives liberals a bad name.

800
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,180
You know what I mean?

801
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,480
Like, oh, I identify with the simple faith of these.

802
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,560
It's conservative, isn't it?

803
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:10,260
Simple working people who, like, I don't want to judge these people based on where they came from or what.

804
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,900
Like, you cannot identify with this in any way, shape, or form.

805
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,380
Like, why are you blasting this tune?

806
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,700
I don't know.

807
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,740
Oh, sometimes I listen to some pretty hillbilly-ish sorts of things.

808
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:32,340
But Nitty Gritty, that song was one of those, well, I hated and still hate any song that was played on the radio over, like, every hour.

809
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,800
I can't stand that.

810
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,660
You want to know the song that drives me the craziest of anything?

811
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,780
The song I hate the most?

812
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,240
What song do we hate the most?

813
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,100
Sweet Judy Blue Eyes by Crosby, Stills, and Nash.

814
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,820
And yeah, no, not her.

815
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,520
Yeah.

816
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:48,840
Go!

817
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,300
That's why we listen to college radio, baby.

818
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,240
How do you catch the sparrow?

819
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,480
That's why college radio is the refuge.

820
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,220
College radio is the refuge away from Mets.

821
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,680
That's right.

822
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,520
Well, not every college radio station is anything like this.

823
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,100
Exactly, which is why you need to remember that in a couple of months when we do our fundraiser.

824
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,900
You've got to support this kind of alternative programming.

825
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,640
Yeah.

826
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,980
I will in the future.

827
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,880
A lot of college stations aren't, well, a lot of colleges don't have stations.

828
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,740
A lot of college stations are just mimicry of the conspiracy radio.

829
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,260
I actually gave up.

830
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,040
The Org.

831
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,640
I mean, they're organized.

832
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,380
I'm sorry, but they are developed along each individual line of a certain species.

833
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,320
You know what I mean?

834
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,480
Like if you went to Case Western Reserve University, you'd have a similar hairline and similar

835
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,280
teeth shape and everything else.

836
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,140
Yeah, this city has two of those stations.

837
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,280
Yeah, and you know, I will say that RUW, I have a lot of respect for them, although

838
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,300
I do think we're cooler.

839
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,720
Okay.

840
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,040
I actually, I gave up a free ride to a school.

841
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,700
I think I gave up a free ride to a school that is much more prestigious than Cleveland

842
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,380
State because their radio station sucked.

843
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,500
Wow.

844
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,700
And this, what I'm doing right now, this is what I wanted to do.

845
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,080
They're always going to keep sucking.

846
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,500
You know, there's no way around it.

847
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:14,720
Wow.

848
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,280
Princess, we wanted to be on the radio.

849
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,740
I did.

850
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,060
But dreams do come true.

851
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,620
That was my dream, to be a DJ.

852
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,560
You know what really disappoints me is my alma mater sold out.

853
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,040
I guess I can't say it.

854
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,360
Oh, come on.

855
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,940
You can say it.

856
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,740
Well, duh.

857
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,960
Trump University.

858
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,880
Sold out to iHeart Radio.

859
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,780
I mean, they just, they're basically WNCX now.

860
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,700
I think WNCX is owned by CBS, not iHeart.

861
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,900
Well, no.

862
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
What I mean is they play the same, you know, robotic music.

863
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,140
You know, the same rock and roll, stupid 80s and 90s and.

864
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,220
You know, the biggest problem that Jesus had after his crucifixion is, you know, thanks

865
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,720
to those nail holes in his feet, he can't walk on the ground.

866
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:00,720


867
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,140
He can't walk on water anymore.

868
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,560
Oh.

869
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,720
No, no.

870
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,460
Well, it makes little fountains.

871
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,000
Pink fountains.

872
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,100
Well, he couldn't eat green peppers either because he lost his gallbladder.

873
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,600
Have you ever heard the classical so-called parochial school joke?

874
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,860
It goes like this.

875
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,380
There's a crowd around the Calvary time.

876
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:23,680
The Lord is up on the cross talking, calling out to Peter, going, Peter, come to me.

877
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,620
Peter, come to me.

878
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,540
Peter hears and he's pushing his way through the throngs and pushes his way through the

879
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,740
last bunch of legionaries guarding the corpuscles there.

880
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,760
Stuff like that.

881
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,160
And he goes, yes, master.

882
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,540
What is it, master?

883
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,640
He says, yeah, Peter, I can see your house from here.

884
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,000
Or could you hang me up for the night or.

885
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,220
Did you hear about the time?

886
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:54,960
Did you hear about the time in heaven where Jesus and Buddha and Mohammed were all given

887
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,440
a.

888
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,780
They were all given a coding challenge.

889
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,480
Like who can who can write the most elegant.

890
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,280
Programming.

891
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,400
They were getting drunk though, weren't they?

892
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,520
Well, I don't.

893
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,400
Well, I mean, Jesus had a blood alcohol content of approximately 12 percent, you know, because

894
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,260
his blood is wine.

895
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,120
It's way over the state of Ohio anyway.

896
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:11,640
Yeah.

897
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,700
But no.

898
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,360
So Jesus, Buddha and Mohammed, they were all challenged to, like, write the most elegant

899
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,160
programming they could on their respective computers.

900
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,240
And right when they're just about to finish, the power cuts out.

901
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,140
And then once the power is restored.

902
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,020
Buddha and Mohammed had to start over.

903
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,260
But Jesus was right there, like close to the second last line of code.

904
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,160
And everyone's saying, like, how how is it that Jesus was able to finish this program,

905
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,720
you know, and had his material still there, whereas Buddha and Mohammed didn't?

906
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,860
And well, the answer is simple.

907
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,540
Jesus saves.

908
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,600
Yeah, I smell that one.

909
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,960
I smell that one.

910
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,140
Very old one.

911
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,920
Yeah, I know.

912
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,600
I think I just caught a fly, actually.

913
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,000
That was.

914
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,020
Oh, my God.

915
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,120
Oh, my God.

916
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,120


917
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,220
I think I just went in my mouth.

918
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,320
That's right up there with how's mom doing?

919
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,360
She's up on the roof.

920
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,120
Yeah, that that that warm fuzziness.

921
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,060
It's actually mold growth.

922
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,120
Isn't that Jesus?

923
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,580
She's talking faces.

924
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,480
I can't help it.

925
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,320
I tell bad jokes.

926
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,060
That's what I do.

927
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,500
Oh, man, you're the worst.

928
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,980
I mean, I love you, but am I the worst?

929
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,560
No, no.

930
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,060
The worst?

931
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,560
No, no.

932
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,100
I tell jokes like.

933
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,960
I miss it.

934
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:29,960
Articulated.

935
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,120
I know you're not the worst.

936
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,880
Okay, thank you.

937
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,760
Because I don't think I really deserve any kind of superlative title of any kind.

938
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,940
You know, I'd like to say that.

939
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,460
Not the worst.

940
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,260
I'd like to say that my show is one part.

941
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,100
There is nearly the worst.

942
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,040
There's a penultimate.

943
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,820
They're kind of.

944
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,260
There we go.

945
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,860
And I'm in the penumbra.

946
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,120
I'd like to say my radio show is one part.

947
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,860
Diane Rehm and one part Howard Stern and one part miserable failure.

948
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,080
I'm sorry.

949
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,200
Miserable failure.

950
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,620
That was a great band.

951
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,600
I love them.

952
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,400
So there's that news.

953
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,680
Not if you're in the psycho ward.

954
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,560
Not if you're in.

955
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,240
Lock the door.

956
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,560
There's a war in ward four.

957
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,260
Not if you're in a mental institution someplace.

958
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,900
Well, you know, I do have a tendency to ward off the psychos.

959
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,780
Dr. Sinister thinks that he wards off psychos.

960
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,560
Actually, I attract them.

961
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:26,860
Did you hear that?

962
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,900
I actually attract them.

963
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,020
I'd say the last five minutes disproves that.

964
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,520
I heard it, but my brain resisted hearing it.

965
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,500
You lure us out.

966
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,320
You called me out.

967
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,980
You called me out.

968
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,300
You're right.

969
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,800
Church's subgenius is too.

970
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,040
It's flypaper for coops.

971
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,980
It's a psycho magnet.

972
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,680
There must be a reckoning.

973
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,580
There must be a reckoning.

974
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:43,820
It's coop paper.

975
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,660
For all my lies.

976
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,620
For all my lies.

977
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,900
We must have a reckoning.

978
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,400
And yes, as a matter of fact, I do actually.

979
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,400
You draw coops like a watermelon draws flies.

980
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,640
In fact, it keeps the flies off of this watermelon.

981
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,860
Yeah, you better make sure those watermelon trucks don't start exploding in your face while you're trying to do the vacuum power from the rear end.

982
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,700
In your Foley table.

983
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:06,980
Yeah.

984
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah, man.

985
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,440
My eyes are watermelons.

986
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,820
My lips are like chickens.

987
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,980
My feet are like very, very, very tired.

988
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,240
So.

989
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,080
That's not the way I wanted to end my life.

990
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,380
You know, I have bigger plans.

991
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,680
Well, who says it's over, huh?

992
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,080
It ain't over until we say it's over.

993
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,060
We're done.

994
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,220
It's not.

995
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,160
It's not over.

996
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,740
When I say we're done.

997
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Even when Fat Man D sings.

998
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:31,740
That's right.

999
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,900
It is 11 p.m. though.

1000
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,340
It's the battle alarm again.

1001
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,020
It's 11 p.m.

1002
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,540
You know what that means?

1003
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:36,860
Could you stop?

1004
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,380
I am Dr. Simpson.

1005
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,020
I have a major question.

1006
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:40,620
Yes.

1007
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:49,780
When in the world is the United States going to legalize marijuana nationwide?

1008
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,700
That's a darn good question.

1009
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:51,920
Predict your year.

1010
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,760
Predict your year.

1011
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,160
That's a darn good question.

1012
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,820
And I'm not going to try and make a prediction.

1013
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,040
You know, I'm not going to make a prediction.

1014
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,040


1015
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,040


1016
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,040


1017
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,700
You know what's really funny?

1018
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,900
I remember a few years ago.

1019
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:04,380
I remember a few years ago back when we had Obama as president and he was actually asked

1020
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,940
that question in an interview.

1021
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:13,740
And he said, let me be clear, as president of the United States, I cannot just legalize

1022
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,820
marijuana with the stroke of a pen.

1023
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,740
But as a matter of fact, he could if he knew what he was doing.

1024
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,360
Because the way the control.

1025
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,600
That's a pretty damn good impression, man.

1026
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,200
Thank you.

1027
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,940
It took me years.

1028
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,960
Like, it was like right after he was leaving office that I finally got my Obama impression

1029
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,380
right.

1030
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,080
It's good.

1031
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,120
Thank you very much.

1032
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,840
No, but here's the thing.

1033
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,380
All right.

1034
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,340
Barack Obama, constitutional law professor, says that he did not have the power to legalize

1035
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,540
marijuana with the stroke of a pen.

1036
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,500
But the Controlled Substances Act, the way the Controlled Substances Act is written,

1037
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,880
the DEA has the power to reschedule controlled substances.

1038
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,320
And who's in charge of the DEA?

1039
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:53,920
The Department of Health.

1040
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,740
The Department of Justice or whatever.

1041
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,660
Who's in charge of the Department of Justice?

1042
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,300
The Attorney General.

1043
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,040
Who orders the Attorney General around?

1044
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,300
The President of the United States.

1045
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,180
So, yes, as a matter of fact, he could have legalized weed with the stroke of a pen.

1046
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,100
So either he was ignorant of how the law works or he was lying to the American people.

1047
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,020
OK.

1048
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,440
A politician lying?

1049
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,380
Ignorant.

1050
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,980
A president lying?

1051
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,200
How can such a thing ever come to be?

1052
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,640
That's like some weird sci-fi thing.

1053
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:23,900
That's what I'm saying.

1054
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,740
It's like some satire of politics.

1055
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,300
The people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook.

1056
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,140
Well, I am not a crook.

1057
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,040
And it all came true.

1058
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,740
Think how that would feel.

1059
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:47,640
Your worst, most paranoid, sarcastic joke nightmares come to pass within your lifetime.

1060
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,260
And you thought you were having a sick fantasy.

1061
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,140
Mr. Gorbachev.

1062
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:53,460
And you thought you were having a sick fantasy.

1063
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:53,460


1064
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:53,880
I'm not a crook.

1065
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1066
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1067
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1068
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1069
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1070
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1071
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1072
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1073
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1074
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1075
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1076
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:53,880


1077
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,400
Very much.

1078
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,220
Have you ever thought about having a fake fantasy?

1079
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:56,380
I haven't.

1080
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,120
I've never thought.

1081
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,580
I haven't thought about transparency.

1082
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,160
That's the thing.

1083
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,140
All right.

1084
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:11,620
I hear you.

1085
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,660
Thanks, Doug.

1086
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:13,800
All right.

1087
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,380
We'll stop talking.

1088
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:14,720


1089
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,300
I don't understand many people in imperialhoror and服 mite.

1090
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,880
Well, when a colleague or a friend of ours.

1091
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,140
as God intended.

1092
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,860
Yeah, I remember that.

1093
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,420
Hello, you're on the radio.

1094
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,120
Hello to all the subgeni.

1095
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,660
Hello, no money markets.

1096
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,740
Hello to the parking subcontractors.

1097
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,960
Yeah, I won't take up too much of your time tonight.

1098
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,980
I just wanted to say that, you know,

1099
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,460
Reverend Stang and Princess Liardot,

1100
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,640
we'll miss you in the studio.

1101
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,000
Ohio's loss is Texas' gain.

1102
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,240
Aw, well, we're going to miss you no money, Mark.

1103
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,120
Well, actually, we're not heard anywhere in Texas

1104
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,420
on broadcast radio at all anymore.

1105
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,180
No.

1106
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,420
It started in Dallas,

1107
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,060
but there was a change at the station after nine years,

1108
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,860
and I just did them at home for years and years,

1109
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,640
mailed them to the six or seven,

1110
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,980
in those days there were maybe ten broadcasts

1111
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,260
and there were only ten broadcast stations that played it,

1112
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,480
including WFMU in New Jersey.

1113
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,980
Was WREK on that list, too?

1114
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,640
Yeah, WREK was pretty good.

1115
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,920
So they had the Hour of Slack and Bob's Slack Time Funhouse?

1116
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,080
Yeah.

1117
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,060
They had two subgenius shows on WREK?

1118
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,780
Yeah, in a row.

1119
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,500
They were 11 and 12.

1120
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:41,760
Wow.

1121
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,680
You know, I have to come back to X Day next year.

1122
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,180
I mean, I have, the last time I went to X Day was in 2012,

1123
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,980
and I've had various personal reasons why I couldn't.

1124
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:51,980


1125
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:51,980


1126
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,800
I couldn't make it in the last seven years.

1127
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,020
Yeah, it's called Slack.

1128
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,920
But I gotta come back for one more.

1129
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,660
Yes, you do. I agree.

1130
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,560
I have to do it at least once more.

1131
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,440
It would be a much better X Day with Dr. Sinister.

1132
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,600
Well, there's fewer of the old-timers around each year.

1133
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,920
You know what I want to do?

1134
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,200
I want to be Subcomandante Subgenio.

1135
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:16,540
Oh.

1136
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,100
You know what I'm talking about, Subcomandante Marcos?

1137
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:19,760
Yeah.

1138
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,660
He wears the ski mask with a pipe.

1139
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,840
He's a little bit of a can-cannaly Bob-like.

1140
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,420
Yes.

1141
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,240
Yeah, sure.

1142
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,700
I've known about him for years.

1143
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,160
Yeah.

1144
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,500
So, like, I could, like, I was actually rehearsing a rant,

1145
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,060
and it was all in Spanish, too.

1146
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,180
All right.

1147
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,500
But it was like elementary school level Spanish,

1148
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,020
where, like, you'd probably understand it, you know, about the Slack.

1149
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,800
If you know certain words, like, instead of, I don't know how you say Slack exactly,

1150
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,960
but I know how you say, you know, flying saucer.

1151
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:51,980


1152
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,640
Slag.

1153
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,060
OVNIS.

1154
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,120
OVNIS.

1155
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:54,980
OVNIS.

1156
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,120
OVNIS.

1157
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,040
We had that, sir.

1158
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,880
We had that.

1159
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,560
I should play.

1160
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,040
.

1161
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,780
.

1162
00:46:59,780 --> 00:46:59,780


1163
00:46:59,780 --> 00:46:59,780


1164
00:46:59,780 --> 00:46:59,780


1165
00:46:59,780 --> 00:46:59,820
.

1166
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,480
.

1167
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:00,520
.

1168
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:00,580
.

1169
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:00,640
.

1170
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,460
.

1171
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:02,720
.

1172
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:02,780
.

1173
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:02,800
.

1174
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:02,880
.

1175
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:02,880


1176
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,160
.

1177
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:07,160


1178
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:07,380
.

1179
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:07,380


1180
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:07,460
.

1181
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:07,560
.

1182
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,120
.

1183
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1184
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,140
.

1185
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:17,200
.

1186
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,440
She'd been living in Bolivia for a long time at that point.

1187
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,240
And her, she's really skilled at languages.

1188
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,420
She's a cunning linguist.

1189
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,180
It was the kind of Spanish I could do.

1190
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,720
I wish I could remember it now,

1191
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,660
but it would be better if I'd dig it up one of these days

1192
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,240
and start replaying it.

1193
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,180
Todos nacimos con Slack.

1194
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:46,720
Pero la conspiracia siempre está planeando robarnos nuestro Slack.

1195
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,520
El subgenio puro necesita el Slack.

1196
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,900
¿Quiere un carro nuevo?

1197
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,960
¿Quiere mucho dinero?

1198
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,220
Pues no tengo mucho dinero en este momento,

1199
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,520
pero he pagado para mis boletos para los ovnis.

1200
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,980
¿Conoces a J.R. Bogdans?

1201
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,140
Nos vemos muy pronto en Planeta X.

1202
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,100
Mucho más.

1203
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,960
¡Muchas gracias!

1204
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:55,140
He was just quoting one of his favorite fanatic conspiracy idiots.

1205
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,080
So, you know, on the other hand, I think he liked saying it.

1206
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,340
He liked the feeling of saying those words,

1207
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,460
and he'll probably find excuses to repeat it

1208
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,340
because he knows it ticks off smart people.

1209
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,960
And that's all they, that's their whole agenda.

1210
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,620
Liberal tears.

1211
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,100
Liberal tears.

1212
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,460
That's what we live on.

1213
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,280
That's the entire agenda, is to tick off the intelligence.

1214
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,720
We'll fry the lard of our own delusions.

1215
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,380
And to tell the truth, here's the most horrible thing.

1216
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:34,860
I understand.

1217
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,040
I actually understand that feeling.

1218
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,080
I do not share it anymore, but...

1219
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,020
Oh.

1220
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,840
It's terrible to see.

1221
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,680
It's terrible to see.

1222
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,540
Your predictions come true.

1223
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,800
It's a nightmare.

1224
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,940
That bodes ill for the next 20 years, too.

1225
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,440
Dateline for dominance was just a little ways off.

1226
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,640
We should have been totally prepared.

1227
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,000
We were only off by about 50 years.

1228
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,060
That's really...

1229
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,660
Actually, when you think about it,

1230
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,000
compare that to the age of the universe, all right?

1231
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,780
That is remarkably accurate.

1232
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,280
How old is the universe?

1233
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,080
It's like...

1234
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,160
You know, like, you only need...

1235
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,000
You only need to calculate pi to about...

1236
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,020
Four digits to measure the circumference of the universe

1237
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,920
down to the size of a single hydrogen atom.

1238
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,820
And you know how big the universe is, right?

1239
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,440
So the fact that you were able to get within 50 years of the end of the world,

1240
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,160
that's pretty accurate.

1241
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,160
Hey, let me tell you this.

1242
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,980
All right, everybody talk at once.

1243
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:36,800
Bob would know this.

1244
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,620
10 to the 76th power.

1245
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,740
That's how many atoms there are in the universe.

1246
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,040
That's...

1247
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,020
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard in my life.

1248
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,680
But Bob knows it.

1249
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,460
I did...

1250
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,160
I'll have to take your word for that.

1251
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,060
Bob also knows that atoms are an illusion.

1252
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:00,980
Are they?

1253
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,300
Yeah, because are they waves or are they particles?

1254
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,520
In fact, they are not atoms at all.

1255
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,580
Atoms are a lie.

1256
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,140
The very word itself comes from ancient Greek,

1257
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,840
atomos, meaning like that which cannot be cut up.

1258
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,560
But we have split the atom.

1259
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,040
Yeah, but it's got a lot of parts.

1260
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,180
We have split the atom.

1261
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:16,620
Yeah.

1262
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,280
Therefore, atoms are lies.

1263
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,700
They're just made of energy vortexes anyway.

1264
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,400
Is that what that means?

1265
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,380
Strange action at spooky distance?

1266
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,520
This is all just a pattern of energy vortexes.

1267
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,260
How many Eves are there in the universe?

1268
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,280
How many what?

1269
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,260
Eve.

1270
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,640
You know, Adam and Eve.

1271
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,500
All right, all right, all right.

1272
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,520
Are you guys on acid?

1273
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,780
You were telling me that I made the worst puns

1274
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,600
and you just heard no one else.

1275
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,400
You're on a funny mark right there.

1276
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,920
I'm telling you, Dr. Dark is influencing us

1277
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,020
from the other side.

1278
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,120
I think it was so slow.

1279
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:54,660
I think he is.

1280
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,020
It was like an underhanded softball.

1281
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,940
I couldn't even see his line.

1282
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,960
The next Reverend Heathen's going to start influencing us

1283
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,740
and we'll all get real high.

1284
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,620
I hope we hear from Reverend Heathen's scum,

1285
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,780
but that's probably not going to happen.

1286
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,280
Who about Heathen?

1287
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,060
You know, not since the Chinese consulate

1288
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,140
was involved in all those sex scandals and everything.

1289
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,780
I don't know, man.

1290
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,940
Oh, God, what if Dr. Legume comes through?

1291
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,620
We'll get in big trouble.

1292
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,180
We'll say something terrible.

1293
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,460
We'll all get in big trouble.

1294
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:26,900
Yeah.

1295
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,020
You'll end up saying something terrible.

1296
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:29,600
Yeah.

1297
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,520
Six semper terranis.

1298
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,000
Don't fall on your sword no money, Mom.

1299
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,300
Or should I say six semper fidelis?

1300
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:42,860
Your own mother.

1301
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,980
He's always hateful.

1302
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,560
Recording.

1303
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,720
He's always unto the faithful.

1304
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,460
He always falls on his sword.

1305
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,960
We may need to think about taking off.

1306
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,900
My neck is starting to get stiff.

1307
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,340
Yeah, well, that's my fault.

1308
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,680
No, no.

1309
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,300
We have...

1310
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,580
I have a condition.

1311
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,540
Oh, yes.

1312
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,460
Don't we all?

1313
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,160
It's a horrific condition.

1314
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,700
What condition is your condition in?

1315
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,600
Yes, what condition is your condition in, dear?

1316
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,540
My back is killing me, figuratively.

1317
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,360
I hope.

1318
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,020
Oh, yeah.

1319
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:18,980
Oh, yeah.

1320
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,260
Oh, yeah.

1321
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,440
Oh, man, I remember that.

1322
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,240
You had a...

1323
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,560
Some kind of music track.

1324
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,520
It was a chicken.

1325
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,080
No, it was a...

1326
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,560
It was a car.

1327
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,700
They used that sampler where someone says,

1328
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:32,320
Bob?

1329
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,800
And they turned that into, like, a piano voice.

1330
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,600
And so it was like...

1331
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,780
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1332
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,400
Oh, yeah.

1333
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,940
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1334
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:42,620
Oh, yeah.

1335
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:43,700
Yeah.

1336
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,900
Reverend Circlemaker,

1337
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,240
uh,

1338
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,380
did that.

1339
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,800
And obviously noticed the Oye guy.

1340
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,720
Of course, we...

1341
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,640
You know, I replayed a whole lot of your show

1342
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,860
and Chaz's show,

1343
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,360
and Masturbating Sean was a regular caller.

1344
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,100
He was...

1345
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,040
He was one of our guys.

1346
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,640
He was, like, the core of our core.

1347
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,680
That Oye thing turned into a whole kind of sub-language

1348
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,880
that Princess Wee and I do.

1349
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,260
To tell you the truth, it nauseated me

1350
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,480
to hear people saying,

1351
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,260
Oye, Oye, Oye, Oye, Oye too often,

1352
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,560
especially when it didn't mean anything.

1353
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,200
He was saying,

1354
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:20,920
Oh, yeah.

1355
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,020
They're trying to create a con-

1356
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:22,680
Yeah.

1357
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,480
But some of us interpreted it as,

1358
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:24,800
um,

1359
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,860
Oye, Come, Ova.

1360
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,160
Yeah, like, Listen, Listen.

1361
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:27,920
But it was...

1362
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,800
Or, you know, when somebody, uh,

1363
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,800
is opening up Congress,

1364
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,180
they'll say,

1365
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:30,900
Oye, Oye.

1366
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,460
Like, in French, you know,

1367
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:33,520
to say, listen, listen.

1368
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,760
He had a strange way of saying,

1369
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,520
Oh, yeah.

1370
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1371
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,140
But it was because he was...

1372
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,100
Oye, Oye, Oye, Oye.

1373
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,420
He was, uh-

1374
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:39,800
Play some sex music.

1375
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,340
Parliamentary procedure.

1376
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,400
Play some sex music.

1377
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,180
Yeah, he was, uh-

1378
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,860
Oye, Oye, Oye, Oye, Oye.

1379
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,460
Princess, we and I innocently thought

1380
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,100
that it was just a kind of a mantra that he did.

1381
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,200
A meaningless mantra, and we started doing it.

1382
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,280
But it's beyond...

1383
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,780
See, it's not meaningless, okay?

1384
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,380
There's such a thing as meaningless.

1385
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,320
There's such a thing as meaning.

1386
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,760
But then there is transcending the very idea

1387
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,000
of meaning itself.

1388
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,980
Well, he was a jack-off artist.

1389
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,280
Oh, you can't fool my mind.

1390
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,480
He was a jack-off of all trades

1391
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,800
and a masturbator of one.

1392
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,420
He was an artist.

1393
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,540
We were a little shocked when it was explained to us,

1394
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,220
well, just his name.

1395
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,280
But up until then, we just, we thought it was kind of a mantra.

1396
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,300
And as I say, we found it to be a very, very comforting mantra.

1397
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:29,980
It was inspirational.

1398
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:30,780
It really was.

1399
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,760
It's mutated.

1400
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,820
It changed and mutated.

1401
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,940
It would be a different word a month later.

1402
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,260
And God, there's so much more to it.

1403
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:40,260


1404
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,500
There's been hundreds and hundreds of them.

1405
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,360
It is meaningless.

1406
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,060
It's a form of meditational behavior.

1407
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,520
We savor them all, each one.

1408
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,460
But they do change slowly over time.

1409
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,040
And they're all...

1410
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:01,000
I would like to tell Princess Weir something about language, that where she comes from

1411
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,440
originally Warren, Ohio, is the home of the original Northern speech that they use as

1412
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,020
broadcast speech for a long time.

1413
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,420
Oh, come on, Dave.

1414
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,320
Come on.

1415
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,760
That's where McKinley was born.

1416
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,340
Our president.

1417
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,260
Princess Weir.

1418
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,960
No, McKinley was from Niles, which is not, which is not Warren.

1419
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:17,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1420
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,940
With the Ewins or Yuns accent.

1421
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:27,160
If we knew which planet Princess Weir was princess of, believe me, we probably wouldn't

1422
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,100
be here now.

1423
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,980
I was saying there's two dialects, two accents spoken within, on the border.

1424
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:33,980
All right, Dave, Dave.

1425
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,900
She was raised by humans in Ohio.

1426
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,140
Dave, all right.

1427
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,640
My dad is from Warren also.

1428
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:38,980
Oh, okay.

1429
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,780
And he says his name is...

1430
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:45,080
Does he talk the same as they do in Youngstown, which is like, Yuns-Gom-Bom-Tom?

1431
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,740
No, he hasn't gone that way.

1432
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:46,960
No, he's not.

1433
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:47,720
No, no, no.

1434
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,040
They're not Yunsers, all right?

1435
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,060
You take that across the border.

1436
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,720
You can take that across the Pennsylvania border.

1437
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:52,860
You know what a Yunser is.

1438
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:52,860


1439
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,280
Okay, go ahead.

1440
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,640
That's a Pittsburgh thing.

1441
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,060
Yeah.

1442
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:59,280
I mean, there are people in the Youngstown, the Honing Valley, there are people there

1443
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,840
who do kind of sound like Yunsers, but they don't say Yins, because that's...

1444
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,280
No.

1445
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,700
As soon as you cross into Ohio, Yins is forbidden.

1446
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,620
Right.

1447
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,220
But no...

1448
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,600
Let me tell you something, all right?

1449
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,200
I was telling my dad about this friend of mine named Dawn.

1450
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,580
This really pretty girl named Dawn, D-A-W-N.

1451
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:19,200
Did you ever kiss her?

1452
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,160
I'm not telling.

1453
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,060
I don't kiss and tell.

1454
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,360
And my dad's like, you kissed a guy named Donald?

1455
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,160
Dawn, Dawn.

1456
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,800
You know, like he pronounces those...

1457
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:31,900
Dawn.

1458
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,100
He pronounced those things the same way, Don and Dawn.

1459
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,260
As a part of the Collinwood accent.

1460
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:36,840
Dornold?

1461
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,240
Yeah.

1462
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,320
And my mom is from further north, not that much further north, you know?

1463
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:48,680
And I was telling her about this girl named Ann that I had a thing with, and she's like,

1464
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,220
what do you mean?

1465
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,020
A guy named Ian?

1466
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,000
Ian?

1467
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:58,160
So like, yeah, between my mother who is from further north and my dad who is from further

1468
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,700
south, like, yeah, my accent's a little bit neutral.

1469
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,180
My mom's from New York.

1470
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:08,340
See, those are two different language patterns, and they coexist right in the same space along

1471
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:08,820
the border.

1472
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,660
Yeah, there are like, there are no fewer than four different accents within a one hour drive

1473
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,080
of Cleveland.

1474
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,040
Yep, that's true.

1475
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,760
We're the crossroads of America.

1476
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,280
Man, the gender blurring of mispronunciation.

1477
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,480
Ian and Ann.

1478
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,460
Dorn and Dawn.

1479
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,320
How about you go to Washington, Maryland and...

1480
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,300
Washington?

1481
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:31,380
You know how they pronounce toast?

1482
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:32,920
Toast.

1483
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,440
Toast?

1484
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,500
You know how they say...

1485
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,000
Toast.

1486
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,740
How about water?

1487
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,980
It's like W-A-D-D-E-R.

1488
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:39,600
Water.

1489
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,760
Well, they say water in Philly.

1490
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:47,520
Yeah, and around DC, around Chris D.R., they say stuff like...

1491
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,980
God, we're all mental midget armies.

1492
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:54,320
Philadelphia, South Jersey, Baltimore, Delaware, Northern Virginia, yeah, they all got ridiculous

1493
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,280
accents there.

1494
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:56,700
Yeah.

1495
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,780
Yeah, I met a waitress once and she was...

1496
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,580
...went out of their way to come up with the most ridiculous sounding accent you could

1497
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:01,920
think of.

1498
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,040
It's like, is this Hildaly or is it Easton?

1499
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:05,740
What is this?

1500
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,180
Well, we're going to be skittin' back to Texas pretty soon.

1501
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,400
Pretty soon?

1502
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,700
Too soon.

1503
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,560
But, uh, I think this is a good time to pause.

1504
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,380
Pause.

1505
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,880
I don't know what kind of accent I'm talking with.

1506
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,280
I don't know.

1507
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,180
Uh, so Reverend Stang and Princess, we, uh, can do their thing.

1508
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,920
And plus, you know, we're old fashioned.

1509
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,520
We still record these shows on CDRs.

1510
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,280
So, uh, we're just about out of time on CDR here.

1511
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:34,700
Oh, yeah.

1512
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:34,700


1513
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:36,920
No more

1514
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,220
low
