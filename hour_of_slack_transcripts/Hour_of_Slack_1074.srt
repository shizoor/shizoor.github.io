1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,140
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the subgenius of OVSLUG.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,980
I feel real good. And then other times, I feel like I was going to get sick right in my stomach.

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,880
Well, that doesn't take much doing.

4
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,800
Hello, Bob. I need someone to talk to.

5
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,160
Hello, Bob. It seems there's nothing I can do.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,060
Hello, Bob.

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,280
I need someone to listen to me.

8
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,940
I'm hitting all the locked doors and I need some help.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,340
And I was hoping you'd have the key.

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,400
Hello, Bob.

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,360
Have you been listening to my thoughts?

12
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,420
Hello, Bob.

13
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,920
And I'll tell you all the thoughts.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,680
I've got.

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,480
Hello, Bob.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,160
Hello, Bob.

17
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,840
I can't seem to find the truth.

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,740
I read the books.

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,520
I took the drugs.

20
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,240
And I drank a whole bottle of Verluce.

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:45,860
Yeah.

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,840
Hello, Bob.

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,080
I seem to have misplaced my slack.

24
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,800
Hello, Bob.

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,860
Well, I just can't seem to get it back.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,940
Hello, Bob.

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,380
Can you point out what it is I lack?

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,440
I've climbed to highest heights, hit the lowest lows.

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,400
But now I'm on my back.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Hello, Bob.

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,980
Are you still here at home?

32
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


33
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


34
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


35
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,960
Are you in the world's greatest epiphany?

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,020
I can hear my heart rate racing in the background.

37
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,940
Even when I got nowhere to go?

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,140
Hey, what if I get a pen and ink on the wall?

39
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,720
Excuse me, may I have a

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,680
two glasses, please?

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,800
What is it?

42
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,280
Hello Bob

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,380
Am I coming through to you?

44
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,020
Hello Bob

45
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,780
I thought I already paid all my dues

46
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,120
Hello Bob

47
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,360
I know that you can see me through

48
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,980
But it's damp and dim and I can't swim

49
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,360
What am I supposed to do?

50
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,940
Well hello Bob

51
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,440
I'm feeling better now you've listened to me

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello Bob

53
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:53,440
Well the sun's out now and I can see

54
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,320
Hello Bob

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,520
A great change has come over me

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,920
My eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear

57
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,620
And I'm as happy as I could be

58
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,280
Yes my eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear

59
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,900
And I'm as happy as I could be

60
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,000
Hello Bob

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,360
Dear Bob

62
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,220
Sometimes Bob

63
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,200
Bob

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,040
I get so scared

65
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,800
And I don't know why

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,440
I just don't know why

67
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,380
But

68
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,160
Sometimes there are things and they're after me, you know?

69
00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:04,520
I mean, it's those kinds of things that, you know, how come hot dogs, you know,

70
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:14,220
the kind of hot dogs you get at the circus, you know, the kind of hot dogs, why are they so red?

71
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:23,100
And it's only at the circus that you get that, can get hot dogs of real red.

72
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:31,960
You know, there's a red kind of, it's more, more, more red.

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,920
And sometimes things live in walls, you know, and it gets scary.

74
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,940
Because, yeah, there are some things that are.

75
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,940
They're all better work.

76
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,100
It's a lot better.

77
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,860
Okay.

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,600
Is that okay?

79
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,660
That's okay.

80
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,980
I can't hear anything.

81
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,920
I can't.

82
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,620
You know, there's something wrong with this one over here.

83
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,900
Give me some of that noise.

84
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,180
Hey, I need some noise.

85
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,020
Is it working?

86
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,420
I'm number five.

87
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,920
I'm number five.

88
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,700
Yeah, we really need some noise.

89
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:10,960
I'm number five.

90
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,920
Hey, what'd you say?

91
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,860
I raised somebody.

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,620
I'll check.

93
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,140
What'd you say?

94
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,580
I'm down there.

95
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,360
Oh, Jesus Christ.

96
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,800
Did you feel that big devil?

97
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,780
I didn't say nothing.

98
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,360
What'd you say?

99
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,580
Well, you said what?

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,240
Hi, officer.

101
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,840
Hey, what did you guys do over here?

102
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,760
No, I mean, we were on.

103
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,760
Get over there.

104
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,340
Get over there.

105
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,660
I saw what you put in your pocket.

106
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,340
Give me that.

107
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,120
Give me that.

108
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,580
Get over there.

109
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,700
Okay, get in there.

110
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,580
Get in there.

111
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,140
Get in there.

112
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,100
Get in there.

113
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,540
Get in there.

114
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,140
Get in there.

115
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,920
Get in there.

116
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,380
The battle for the mind.

117
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,200
Get in there.

118
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,200


119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,200


120
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,200


121
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,200


122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,200


123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,200


124
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,640
how about your voice?

125
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,900
Are you going to allow them to out-shout you?

126
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,260
Are you going to allow them to be heard over and above your objections?

127
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,260
Boring.

128
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,360
Oh, too boring.

129
00:06:59,340 --> 00:06:59,860
Boring.

130
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:00,900
Boring.

131
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,600
Boring.

132
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,160
Boring.

133
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,280
Boring.

134
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,480
Boring.

135
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,120
Boredom quotient.

136
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,900
Boredom quotient 9 to the 13th.

137
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,200
Wilson.

138
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,880
Warp 7.

139
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
Here's Wilson.

140
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,080
Here's Wilson.

141
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,260
She's a Wilson.

142
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,180
Your name's Wilson?

143
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,800
Yes.

144
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,340
Well, I'm glad it's not.

145
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,300
Farmer.

146
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:29,140
But the Holy Ghost is God's authorized detective agency.

147
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,420
The Holy Ghost is God's high sheriff that has come to restore and get back for you.

148
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,220
Pastor, and be my hero.

149
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,620
Those things that the devil has stolen.

150
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,520
I know, Pastor.

151
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,500
The origin.

152
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,760
The original God.

153
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,740
Don't turn it off.

154
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,400
I've got you.

155
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,620
Oh, I've got to have Pastor Eftley.

156
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,900
He's telling me about the God that has taken him from your heart.

157
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,440
The smile that he has stolen from your lips.

158
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,160
Where'd my lips go?

159
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,720
The dream that he's stolen from your eyes.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,900
I can't feel my lips on my teeth.

161
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,620
They don't all feel the same.

162
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,080
He's come to restore these things.

163
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,100
Pastor Eftley.

164
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,980
Now, son, I want to ask you to be quiet for just a minute.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,620
I don't know anything.

166
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,400
So we can hear Pastor Eftley.

167
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,020
Okay.

168
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,120
As far as I know, you haven't told him.

169
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,140
Have you told him I stabbed anything about yourself?

170
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,340
You haven't.

171
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:23,900
No.

172
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,700
Then if I know anything about you, it would be because the spirit of the Lord has led me to you today.

173
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,720
Am I right?

174
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,500
Uh-huh.

175
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,060
I've got something for you.

176
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,800
I want you to leave your seat and come here.

177
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,480
Okay.

178
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,000
Amen.

179
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,220
Amen.

180
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,120
My knowledge, I've never seen this lady before in my life.

181
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,980
I'm not saying that.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,600
I hope she doesn't feel bad if she's come here two or three times.

183
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,960
I hope she doesn't think I've ignored her.

184
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,920
No, I've never been here before.

185
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,440
For a crowd like this, I can't remember everyone that comes to church.

186
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,480
Can you say?

187
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,820
Pastor Eftley, I read about you.

188
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,420
But the Lord told me that he sent you here today.

189
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,520
Pastor Eftley.

190
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,240
And Jesus is passing by for you.

191
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:00,980
Pastor Eftley.

192
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,900
I feel his presence.

193
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,040
Passing by for you.

194
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,140
I want you to take this envelope and hold it open.

195
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,580
I don't know.

196
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,680
This is Jesus.

197
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,720
I'm going to get back to you.

198
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,760
I want you to get back to me.

199
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:12,900
I'm going to get back to you.

200
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm going to get back to you.

201
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:13,600


202
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:13,600


203
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:13,600


204
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,760
What a crime how they stole it away.

205
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,880
Oh, the devil wants to steal it from your friend.

206
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,160
But he's hard to keep that devil out of your back pocket.

207
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,820
A step less a thing.

208
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,340
What a shame how they stole it away.

209
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,120
Oh, it's a miracle, friend.

210
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,600
It's a miracle revival starting now.

211
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Perform the salute.

213
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,540
Perform the salute.

215
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,680
All right, here's how to do the salute.

217
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,260
Yeah.

218
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,080
See?

219
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,700
Ready?

220
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,200
The finger is on the neck.

221
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,480
Hands, left hand up.

222
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:04,940
Up and down.

223
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,580
Left hand up.

224
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,080
Left hand up.

225
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,340
Finger on throat.

226
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,660
Finger on throat.

227
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,120


228
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,400
Come on.

229
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,560
All right.

230
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:14,560


231
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,420
Perform the salute.

232
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,160
Yeah.

233
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,840
Yeah.

234
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah.

235
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,880
Excellent.

236
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,000
It's a miracle.

237
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,900
I think before we start the service,

238
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
we should have just a moment of noise.

239
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,580
Ah!

240
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,360
Ah!

241
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,680
Ah!

242
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:28,960
Ah!

243
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,220
Ah!

244
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,440


245
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:30,640
Ah!

246
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:30,860
Ah!

247
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,380
Ah!

248
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,420
Ah!

249
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:32,440
Ah!

250
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,480
Ah!

251
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,480


252
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,480


253
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,480


254
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,480


255
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,560
Yes, I can feel it.

256
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,380
The spirit.

257
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,220
Bullets can't stop them.

259
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,480
Oh, bullets can't stop them, friends.

260
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:38,840
No.

261
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,180
The mark of the beast?

262
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,100
Oh, you don't need to worry about it.

263
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,560
You've got your credit card.

264
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
It won't do you any good tomorrow, but it's okay.

265
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,260
Well, I guess now Bob's going to have to work through me, friends.

266
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,540
So, we're going to...

267
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,320
...snow mixed with freezing rain and rain.

268
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,900
We're going to...

269
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,480
...and we're going to...

270
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,620
...through the afternoon.

271
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,900
...on...

272
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,820
...we're going to...

273
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,140
...we're going to...

274
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,680
...go...

275
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,080
...to...

276
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,020
...no accumulation at mid-morning.

277
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,080


278
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,080


279
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,900
...no accumulation...

280
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,040
...it's all right.

281
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,520
... affair,

282
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:31,820
fun...

283
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,740
...is that the suffines...

284
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,400
of the foreign city someone dropped onto...

285
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,960
...ne contestants.

286
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,060
No.

287
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,460
...pointing itself so far

288
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:38,640
that no one got worthy.

289
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:38,660
Go...

290
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:38,660


291
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,920
We don't need to get in trouble, friends.

292
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,080
... interpreter...

293
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,080


294
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,080


295
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,080


296
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:33,040
Sometimes I've got these rats, and they're like inside my stomach,

297
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,840
and I haven't swallowed them.

298
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,500
I mean, they're like hot, hot, hot dogs, but they're eating their way out,

299
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:49,140
and they're coming out, and sometimes I just want to take these hot dogs

300
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,580
and just shove them, and just shove them away.

301
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm taking these hot dogs, and I have to go.

302
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:07,400
But please, Bob, send me some more pills, Bob.

303
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,360
Please, Bob, send me.

304
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,260
Some more.

305
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,220
Send me some more of those pills, Bob.

306
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
God, Bob, Bob.

307
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,180
Bob.

308
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,100
Bob.

309
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,260
Oh, oh, Lonesome Bob says,

310
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,960
you got to get some pills.

311
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,700
Oh, Lonesome Bob.

312
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,560
Just telling me.

313
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,160
Oh, yeah.

314
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:58,380
Just give him some more pills, and Bob will kill you.

315
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh, yeah.

316
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,700
Oh, so long.

317
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,240
Be mine.

318
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm upset.

319
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:24,960
But sometimes I just, I don't feel too good, you know?

320
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:34,140
I mean, I really don't feel real good.

321
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,620
And I don't know why.

322
00:14:39,500 --> 00:15:06,340
But Reverend Booney says, my head is obsessed with the anti-bomb.

323
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,160
Oh.

324
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:08,500
Oh.

325
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,480


326
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,480


327
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,480


328
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,480


329
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,480


330
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,480


331
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:18,020
And I don't really know what he means.

332
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:29,140
And so that's why I'm talking to you directly, because he isn't of much help.

333
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:38,500
But Bob says, if you don't give me some money, you just.

334
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:38,620
Oh.

335
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:39,480


336
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Won't ever get any slack.

337
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,840
And then, you don't get no slack, you can't get no money, no food, and no pills.

338
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:56,560
So what we have there really is two rituals going at once on the radio.

339
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,200
It's a miracle.

340
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,260
What can we say?

341
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,160
We're used to them by now, but it's definitely miracles, and we've got proof.

342
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:04,860
Yeah.

343
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,740
It's amazing.

344
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,240
It's a miracle.

345
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,460
Signs, signs in the heavens, signs in the earth.

346
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,460


347
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,460


348
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,460


349
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,460


350
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,460


351
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,460


352
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,460


353
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:18,440
the earth we're seeing the signs everywhere and they still seem to be

354
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,600
washing the implements on the other side in this blood of the lamb

355
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,520
class

356
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:54,560
¡don use kwe punishment!

357
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,840
The cockatiel Doctor

358
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,060
!

359
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:12,480
And we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, or nobody for why.

360
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:32,720
Praise Bob, tell me Bob, I want to buy from Bob, I want to buy and ask the holy war fulfilled, the big boys and the gomels.

361
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:42,460
We can make them buy and we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men.

362
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:51,780
And we'll all come out over men, if we don't come out over men, there ain't no reason why.

363
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:11,940
All wives, gizms, they will fall beneath our laser blades, and we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, in victory for us.

364
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,160
Praise God.

365
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,960
Praise God.

366
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,920
Praise God.

367
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,320
Praise God.

368
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,040
Praise God.

369
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,480
Praise God.

370
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,880
Praise God.

371
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,600
Praise God.

372
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:10,940
Praise God.

373
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,660
Praise God.

374
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:46,920
Praise God.

375
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,160
Praise God.

376
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,380
Praise God.

377
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,320
Praise God.

378
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,580
And I don't care, I don't care if people laugh at me.

379
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,400
I did, Bob.

380
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,660
He ain't no man.

381
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,000
He ain't no God.

382
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,940
I don't want to walk the path that Bob's trod.

383
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,980
Ain't no man, ain't no God.

384
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I don't want to walk the path Bob's trod.

385
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,940
Okay, let's do it right this time.

386
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:35,680
And people ask me, where do you get this energy, this life I see glowing in you, Jander?

387
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,940
And I just point it up.

388
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,140
And I don't even have to say it.

389
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,860
I won't even say the word Bob when I said it.

390
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,860
But I just point at the sky.

391
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,580
Because it's not me that's doing it.

392
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,780
And you know and I know who it is.

393
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,640
It's Bob.

394
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,680
Now we take you into a great Holy Ghost revival that is now in progress.

395
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,880
Bill, you want to say something to the clinch?

396
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,360
To the Dallas clinch?

397
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,180
It's too pink and they refuse to comment.

398
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,440
If they're so hip, what are they doing in Dallas?

399
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,560
We can put on the Bob tune tape and sing along.

400
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,060
Doctors for Bob.

401
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,640
Doctors for Bob.

402
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,580
Doctors for Bob.

403
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,060
Doctors for Bob.

404
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,280
You need your harvest.

405
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,600
Yeah.

406
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,880
Copters for Bob.

407
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,660
Copters for Bob.

408
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,640
Proctors for Gob.

409
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,760
Proctors for Gob.

410
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
Bloctors for Snod.

411
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,900
Bloctors for Bob.

412
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,480
Doctors for Bob.

413
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,820
Sphincters for Bleed.

414
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,760
Sphincters for Bob.

415
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,400
Sphincters for Bob.

416
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,080
Sphincters for Bob.

417
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,600
I have something weird on my tongue.

418
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,420
Pills.

419
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,060
Pills for Bob.

420
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,640
Pills for Bob.

421
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,080
Everything I know in my life.

422
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,260
Give me some of them pills, Bob.

423
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,220
That damn pickup gun run over my wife.

424
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,460
Got the blues cause Bob let that pickup run over my wife.

425
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,280
Hey, you got three points for hitting that hippie, girl.

426
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,660
Bob stayed fine.

427
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,580
He did.

428
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:33,980
He did.

429
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,660
He did.

430
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,680
He did.

431
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,180
He did.

432
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,180


433
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,180


434
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,600
He'll get a couple more.

435
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,520
If both stuff buttons gone wrong we'll be fine.

436
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,580
I'll believe you.

437
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:55,960
If both stuff buttons go wrong, you'll be fine, Rob.

438
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,880
That's what it is.

439
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,500
It's the fucking volts noises.

440
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,020
What's that?

441
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:04,640


442
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:04,640


443
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,660
effect on the sensitive youth who became, thanks to the pharmacy's wares, a chronic

444
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:21,120
alcoholic at age six. It didn't affect his precocious salesmanship, however. And he made

445
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,760
his first small fortune selling stolen prophylactics and other things to high school boys.

446
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:47,800
Wash it out, Bob. Freak it out, Bob. Zap it out, Bob. Hook it out, Bob.

447
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:56,020
Slarp it out, Bob. Slurp it out, Bob.

448
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:04,180
Munch it out, Bob. Punch it out, Bob.

449
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,820
Scrunch it out, Bob. Hunch it out, Bob.

450
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:25,280
Tear it out, Bob. Mutate it out, Bob. Slack it out, Bob.

451
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,500
Arf it out, Bob. Kill me, Bob.

452
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,660
Thank you. Thank you, Sterno.

453
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:51,140
Coming up next, we have the original Doctors for Wotan album, which is called Doctors for

454
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,700
Negi. And the song,

455
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,600
I'm driving a car,

456
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,160
Bob sold me.

457
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,680
You're so damn married.

458
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,040
Mac?

459
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,480
What do you mean, ha, ha, ha?

460
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,040
Take that pipe out of your mouth.

461
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,380
What are you grinning about, buddy?

462
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,680
Where'd you get that haircut?

463
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,060
Are those dots on your face, or have you got some kind of disease?

464
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,220
You look like Ward.

465
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,460
You look like Ward Cleaver.

466
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,460
I'm leaving.

467
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,900
You look like Mark Trails.

468
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,460
What's the deal, buddy?

469
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,020
You look like Mr. Appleton.

470
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,180
You look like Big Van Dyke with a pivoted mouth.

471
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,340
What?

472
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,140
What'd you say?

473
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,520
Did you say, yeah, sure.

474
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,380
Sure, I'll buy that used car.

475
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,620
I'll buy that used car from you, mister.

476
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,060
Sure, anything.

477
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,740
How much do you want?

478
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:57,740


479
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:57,740


480
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,260
How much is it?

481
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,180
It's only a dollar?

482
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,080
That used car is only a dollar?

483
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,080
Wow.

484
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,380
Wow, you got any other good deals, mister?

485
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,860
You got something else that'll only cost a dollar?

486
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,480
A little booklet?

487
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,780
I don't know, that doesn't look like it's worth a dollar to me.

488
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,800
Oh.

489
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,240
Oh.

490
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,500
It does have a lot of print inside.

491
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,240
And some neat pictures.

492
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,540
Sure, I'll give you a dollar, mister.

493
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,400
Here.

494
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:37,900
Whoa.

495
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:39,760
Whoa.

496
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,920
I feel weird.

497
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,940
I feel, I feel really weird.

498
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:53,720
But I feel kind of, I feel, I feel kind of good.

499
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
I like this.

500
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,880
This little book.

501
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,560
Hey, where'd you go, buddy?

502
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,740
Hey, where'd, where'd he go?

503
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,380
Where'd the guy with the pipe go?

504
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,120
Hey, I gotta talk to him.

505
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,760
Hey, what happened?

506
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,340
Hey, buddy, where'd, he took off with my two dollars.

507
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,720
And he left me this little book and this car.

508
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,700
Hey, buddy, where'd you go?

509
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,120
I'll get in this car.

510
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,000
I'll start it up.

511
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,560
He left the keys in for me.

512
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,880
Okay, here goes.

513
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,120
I'm driving the car that Bob sold me.

514
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,520
Boy, I can go pretty fast.

515
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,760
Hey.

516
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,520
Hey, that Bob guy's okay.

517
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,540
He made me forget about, he made me forget about Odin for a minute.

518
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,040
That's really weird.

519
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,880
Boy, this car is smooth.

520
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,780
I like the way this feels on the road.

521
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,760
I like the way it feels.

522
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,400
It feels good.

523
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,620
It's throbbing.

524
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,640
It's throbbing.

525
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,420
Hey, it's leaving the road.

526
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,060
It's going up in the air.

527
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,440
Where's it going?

528
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,840
Hey.

529
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,680
Hey, it's, there's a cloud up in front of me.

530
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,840
A big cloud.

531
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,280
It's got a sign on it.

532
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,200
A big sign.

533
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:02,280
It says, it says, welcome, welcome to Odin's place.

534
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,160
It says, this is Nirvana.

535
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,260
Wow, Bob.

536
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,460
Thanks.

537
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,280
I can't wait to meet Odin.

538
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,760
Really.

539
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,220
Hey, Mom.

540
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,400
Yeah.

541
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,380
I love it when you're together.

542
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,000
You know that, Bob like, Zhao?

00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,240
Put a barbed line, fold on

564
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,420
The world looks to me

565
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,700
Like a nice place to be

566
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,240
Cause I got my barbed line, fold on

567
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,180
Like some kind of big mess

568
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

569
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:13,080
Is he waiting there for me?

570
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,200
He's not waiting for me

571
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,220
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

572
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,180
Oh, the world looks to me

573
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,920
What is waiting there for me?

574
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,400
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me

575
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:47,860
Bob can save me, but will he?

576
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,660
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby

577
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,160
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby

578
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,700
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, welcome

579
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,440
What is waiting there for me?

580
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,700
Bob

581
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,840
Thank you

582
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,740
Bob

583
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,100
Bob

584
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,760
Bob

585
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,060
Bob

586
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,520
Bob

587
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,680
Bob

588
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:22,900
Bob

589
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,280
Bob

590
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,360
Bob

591
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,460
Bob

592
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:23,460


593
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:23,560
Bob

594
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,140
Bob

595
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,140


596
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,140


597
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,640
Doctors for Bob!

598
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,720
Doctors!

599
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,460
Meet Doctors for Bob!

600
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,540
Meet Doctors for Bob!

601
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,820
Doctors for Bob, ma'am!

602
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,400
Can you name Doctors for Bob?

603
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,720
Are you sure you know Doctors for Bob?

604
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,620
Praise Doctors for Bob!

605
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,440
Can you name the Doctors for Bob album?

606
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,500
What is subgenius?

607
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,060
It's Doctors for Bob!

608
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,140
Can you name the Doctors for Bob album, ma'am?

609
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,560
You think you can know the subgenius without knowing Doctors for Bob?

610
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,740
Well, you're wrong!

611
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,900
What is Doctors for Bob?

612
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,880
Doctors of Bob!

613
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,560
I ain't no Bob, y'all!

614
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,180
Doctors for Bob!

615
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,480
Doctors for Bob!

616
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:25,480


617
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,820
Doctors for Bob!

618
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,640
Doctors for Bob!

619
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:36,460
Yes, about half the people I know will enter the before-life in the 80s.

620
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,160
Millions will die in a small nuclear skirmish with China in 1988.

621
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,100
Russia will invade Iran, Turkey, Africa, and of course Israel,

622
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,500
and there will be plenty involved.

623
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,340
Draft wars in the US.

624
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,260
Look for a tenth member to join the common market,

625
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,240
called by war.

626
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,760
A bad nuke accident in New York City.

627
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,800
Rockefellers will finally be implicated.

628
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:14,660
Long-spread famine in 86 and 87 when the 13 and 17 year locusts emerge.

629
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,480
Acid rain tough times the big screens.

630
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,820
German war in South America.

631
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:28,580
The great reformer, actually the Antichrist, enters Jerusalem through the East Gate

632
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,960
and is made superhuman after miraculously recovering from a head wound.

633
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,640
He starts the one world government which can only be stopped by a one world religion.

634
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,000
Russia develops an era of German educated only non-twined locusts.

635
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,220
Big Massacre.

636
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,100
The Great Rebellion.

637
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,480
This is Kevin Wilson of the Abominations from Boston.

638
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,840
I batter myself after 66.

639
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,160
I don't want to be nobody's Carolina.

640
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,380
They take me on a ship.

641
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,520
Put me on a motor.

642
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,420
Let me out in the water.

643
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,360
Let me go.

644
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,000
Cause I'm a subgenius.

645
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,040
Cause I'm a subgenius.

646
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,160
Let me go naked in the park.

647
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,400
Let me feel like my head's coming apart.

648
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,160
I don't know.

649
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,780
But I have been told.

650
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,220
Everybody thinks that people gotta get old.

651
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,540
But I don't believe it.

652
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,700
Cause I'm a subgenius.

653
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,700
But I don't believe it.

654
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,600
Cause I'm a subgenius.

655
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,140
I take everybody for what they're worth.

656
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,020
I don't make no exception.

657
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,420
I don't like it when people try to talk back to me.

658
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,880
Cause I'm a subgenius.

659
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,760
I'm a subgenius.

660
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,100
I don't want you to get away from me.

661
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,580
You better like me for what I am.

662
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,660
If that isn't what pleases you.

663
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Better make it right for me.

664
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,260
Cause I'm a subgenius.

665
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,520
Cause I'm a subgenius.

666
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,360
And I'll never be a subgenius.

667
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,440
I'll drag you out like St2p2 or something.

668
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,220
You feel one close to get it before you know it.

669
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,540
But one night in the park.

670
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:04,600
And that night my friends can never get to see me again.

671
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,700
Cause Jesus sprayed upon my demás life own relics.

672
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,980
Cause I'm a subgenius!

673
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,480
But I don't believe it

674
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,180
Cause my head's coming apart.

675
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,920
Cause I'm a subgenius.

692
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,420
Well I never found Bob that day, they said he just had gone away

693
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:08,260
He was out to lunch or off to get shoes or gone buying groceries for people to blues

694
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,600
I must not have been in need of slack cause I never really managed to make it back

695
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:21,920
But I sent my dollar to those people in town, and I still keep getting them pamphlets sent around

696
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,160
And I feel a little closer and a little more in touch

697
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,800
And I know it's helped me a whole lot of much

698
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,800
But I sure do wish I'd been managing to hang out in the right place to actually catch a look at that

699
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,240
Shotgun order

700
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,940
Out of the face of Bob.

701
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,560
Bob.

702
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,800
Same.

703
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:57,180
Other reasons why you should buy some genius products.

704
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,740
Reason number one.

705
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,440
I am the one.

706
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,660
Reason number two.

707
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,240
You can know doctors for Wotan.

708
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,960
Reason number three.

709
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,600
We will not suffocate you or your wife with mayonnaise.

710
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,080
This has been a message from the Subgenius Church.

711
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,420
We hope that you will send us money.

712
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,580
Don't forget, if you don't have a check or credit account with the Subgenius Church,

713
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,100
you can send food stamps, money,

714
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,960
uh, Vulcan engine repair parts,

715
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,660
uh, pieces of a meaningless void,

716
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:33,640
uh,

Doctors for Bob.

720
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,120
Uh, you can send brain-locking tree sockets,

721
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,200
or, uh,

722
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:44,800
Doctor Bob.

723
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,600
tree backwards mouth climb.

724
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,520
You can send

725
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,020
Doctors for Bob.

726
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,360
tunnel, inner, non-existent void particles.

727
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:51,720
Doctors for Bob.

728
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,420
You can send, uh,

729
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,880

Doctors for Bob.

tap-shoot disc patterns.

732
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,900
Uh, you can send us

733
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,540

uh, cow vomit,

735
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:01,520
Doctors for Bob.

Doctors for Bob.

738
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:03,440

910
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,860
I was walkin' over Houston

911

but he sang the song he changed it into a little town.

913
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,140
Just to see what I could see

914
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:45,880
And the angel, the angel

915
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,180
He was walkin' over me

916
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,920
He was walkin' over Houston

917
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,320
He was walkin' in the air

918
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,740
He was walkin' in the air

919
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,560
And I saw my friend was with him

920
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,940
Hallelujah, Bob was there

921
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,980
He was walkin' in subgenius

922
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:26,600
He keeps me high until the end

923
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,740
For as long as I am subgenius,

924
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:32,740


925
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:38,340
I know Bob is my friend

926
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,180
Now I know

927
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:48,320
Where'er we travel

00:53:53,280 --> 00:54:00,800

930
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,720
We know Bob is my friend.

931
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,120
He's with us too

932
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,880
Keep on walkin' with subgenius

933
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:20,060
Ridin' high before the end

934
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:27,440
If I always buy subgenius,

935
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,860
I know Bob will be my friend.

936
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:38,300
And now this third verse ain't necessary,

937
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,560
but if, I know Bob said we should always be ready to sell out,

938
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,260
and if you wanted to play this on a tape or something,

939
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,140
you could stick an ad on me and like this.

940
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,360
Here we go.

941
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:59,540
