1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,980
It's a form of sacrilege

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,640
It's a form of disconsecration of the vowel sounds made by your very existence

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,840
As you twizzle and twazzle DNA

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,700
As you weasel and wazzle your slimy way

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,580
Up and down and out of life

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,540
Hong Kong, the hub of the Orient

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,040
And now it is time for us to conclude our visit

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,560
And reluctantly say

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,520
Hong Kong, the hub of the Orient

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,700
Thank you for joining us tonight

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,560
Now, I just heard in the room

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,160
A report that

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,420
The subgenius power of slashing

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,760
That is correct

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,280
To engage in this attack

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,360
That's correct

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,420
We have a number of individuals that have had girls from 15 to 25

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,420
Jeez

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,680
Why, what, why, what, why?

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,120
I have a list of about 20 of them

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,120
They're like 14, 15, 16

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,520
Any photos?

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,440
That's correct

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,440
You changed your cover

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,140
I started to work

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,160
Hello

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,100
And I don't mind telling you

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,880
It's no change for the better

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,200
Why, you're wearing a mask

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,080
I'll explain the mask later, Mr. Jackson

32
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,040
Now

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,220
It's fun time

34
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,640
I just can't understand it

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,200
Oh yeah?

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,860
Maybe it's just because you're stupid

37
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,420
Well, yes, Wally

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,080
Sure, punch yourself in the nose

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,560
No

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,820
No

41
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,560
No

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:56,560


43
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:56,760
rain

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,020
Not much

45
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,020


46
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,080
Do you want to choose a woman I talk to?

47
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,080


48
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,080


49
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Do you look like self respect?

50
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,580
A little competitive

51
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:00,580


52
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:00,580


53
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Well, Shen's first moviegery used to be very god dawg

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,000
So試기

55
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,820
Maybe but it's regulate

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
He's notorrwatching it

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,340
Just a mate on the canterall

58
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,400
Since I was a little kid

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,060
They've been the two best friends

60
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,960
That a man could ever hope for in this world

61
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,560
Now I'm a normal guy

62
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,620
And I work all day for my money

63
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,260
And I fear the good Lord like I know I should

64
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,140
I ain't no new age coot

65
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,980
But I gotta get this off my chest

66
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,680
And put this tragedy behind me now for good

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,520
I remember getting drunk

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,380
And I remember falling down

69
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,580
And someone laid me on a pool table

70
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,140
And I don't live too soon

71
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,940
Then through the blinding light

72
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,900
Two creatures stared into my eyes

73
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,320
As half a jukebox or a flying saucer

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,400
Spinned around the room

75
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,760
And I tell myself this couldn't have been

76
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,720
No member of the human race

77
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,120
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,060
From outer space

79
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,880
Well it hit me like trouble

80
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,900
In the back of my head

81
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,580
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

82
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,540
And when I woke up, Lord

83
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,100
I wished that I was dead

84
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,360
I wish that I was dead

85
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,600
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

86
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,180
This must have been an abduction, Lord

87
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,720
Cause I don't know what happened

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue

89
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,940
And I think I'm gonna look crazy

90
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,740
But I know that it weren't them

91
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,340
Say this is the end of the world

92
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,440
Things that T.K. do and never do

93
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,760
Well when at last I woke

94
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,740
Both my legs they had been broke

95
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,540
Both my eyes were black

96
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,440
And my ears was ringing bad

97
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,700
I'd seen enough of nasty things

98
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,180
But this was the worst case

99
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,060
Of intergalactic relations I've ever had

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,100
And I tell myself this couldn't have been

101
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,080
No member of the human race

102
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,320
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men

103
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,460
Who were meant for my outer space

104
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,260
Cause it hit me like a shovel

105
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,140
In the back of my head

106
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,960
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

107
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,900
And when I woke up, Lord

108
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,520
I wished that I was dead

109
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,160
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

110
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,440
This must have been an abduction, Lord

111
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,900
Cause I don't know what happened

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,620
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue

113
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,280
And I think I'm gonna look crazy

114
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,980
But I know that it weren't them

115
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,080
Say this is the end of the world

116
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,120
Things that T.K. and her would never do

117
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,160
Himmy�

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:07,280
You'd do the same thing

119
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,980
You would never do

120
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:08,980


121
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:08,980


122
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,120
Exactly

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,120


124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,120


125
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,940
What

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,220
There's no

127
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,540
There's

128
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,340
It's like a lot of

129
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,460
Some essential

130
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,180
Water of life

131
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,440
or something

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,580
And you don't

133
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,880
They can't

134
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,100
Then they take away

135
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,360
Oh, yeah

136
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,580
This thing

137
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,280
That was Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights, dear friends.

138
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,580
Flank Hoyt and the Swerving Headlights.

139
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:39,880
And you can learn more about Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights from swervingheadlights.com.

140
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,780
The collages were by Mr. Fernandinande Lemur.

141
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,700
He's fuzzy.

142
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,380
I guess he's not a reverend.

143
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,100
He's very specific about being a mister.

144
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,340
Well, speaking of DNA implants and so forth and moving this stuff around, he does have lizard skin.

145
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,020
I mean, a lot of people talk about the lizard people.

146
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:10,060
That's a conspiracy theory that a lot of people are real excited about.

147
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,840
It's kind of old hat for subgenius diehard old conspiracy theorists.

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,460
They make those guys wear old hats.

149
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,800
That's part of the whole conspiracy of it.

150
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,000
The DNA thing is implanted.

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,900
Is that what the old hat thing is about?

152
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,460
Yeah.

153
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Oh, man.

154
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,380
Spooky.

155
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:25,860
Yeah.

156
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,240
Call something old hat.

157
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,940
That means the DNA goes right in your brain and changes you.

158
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,440
I think that's what it means.

159
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,440
Change.

160
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,280
Spare change, my friend.

161
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,240
Can you change your ways?

162
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,840
Can you quit telling yourself you're awake and enlightened long enough to realize you're still asleep?

163
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,740
See, I'm the automatic robot that goes around telling the other automatic robots to wake up.

164
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,660
I'm the automatic robot that goes around telling the other automatic robots to wake up.

165
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,640
But that's just what I do automatically.

166
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,640
You show them the pictures, don't you, Stang?

167
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,220
Yeah.

168
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,340
The pictures of the kneeling bodies, the scarce and astounding naked bodies,

169
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,480
of the people with, oh, yes, the old lady that was brought in a late-night dragnet,

170
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,660
whose face was rubber-hosed with a...

171
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,380
More precisely, I sell them the pictures.

172
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,260
Yes, you sell them the pictures on the corner side.

173
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,340
Underneath the street lamp.

174
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,360
It hurts, these pictures.

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,760
It hurts.

176
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:20,760


177
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,200
Well, it hurts.

178
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,080
Tell it to him.

179
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,220
He has fish head stockings on your head.

180
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,160
Hey, I got an interesting letter from a listener, Reverend Fenian,

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,540
who had just started listening to the Hour of Slack fairly recently.

182
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,360
Fenian.

183
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,920
About a year ago, actually.

184
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,000
About a year ago, he started listening to it on the Internet.

185
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,480
And what attracted him about it was the Oye guy.

186
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,840
He first started tuning in about a year ago.

187
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,240
When we were getting calls from the Oye guy...

188
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,780
You know what that is?

189
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,720
It's the sound of a poodle being sodomized.

190
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,600
Well, that was the thing.

191
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,760
We later found out from other DJs at the station that, indeed, the Oye guy was known...

192
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,280
A poodle sodomizer.

193
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,580
...as famous as Masturbating Sean.

194
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,020
Exactly.

195
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,640
That's the name that he's known by at the station.

196
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,260
And that Princess, we and I were right.

197
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,000
It is a mantra.

198
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,300
And he brought great disgrace on that name, too, by the way.

199
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,460
Well, he brought great disgrace on his name.

200
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,420
Well, it depends on how you look at it, Dave.

201
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,760
It's a life-saving mantra.

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,040
His name should be Shane.

203
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
Well, now then.

204
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,240
Some denominations, he gets a special award pinned to his chest.

205
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,180
Well, sometimes it's in the form of one of those IEDs, really.

206
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,120
Improvised Exploding Devices.

207
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,220
Friends, are you wondering what the hell this is all about?

208
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,840
Are you wondering?

209
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,420
Well, give up.

210
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,320
Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

211
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,760
The subgenius is probably the single most important organization in the 20th century.

212
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,360
Our function is quite literally to save the world.

213
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:49,920
No.

214
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,980
At least make the end of the world happen right.

215
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,900
Bob Love You.

216
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,360
Bob Love You.

217
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,660
No problem unless you find Bob.

218
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,640
You better find Bob right now.

219
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,140
Yeah.

220
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,520
The people really need to be able to understand things very quickly.

221
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,420
and the church of the subgenius, I think, confuses him.

222
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,620
Confusing, isn't it?

223
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,600
I want to remind you of the great words of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

224
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,740
I don't practice what I preach

225
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,160
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

226
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,300
Thank you, children, thank you.

227
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,520
Is there a typical subgenius?

228
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,720
Of course not.

229
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,960
The very thought is a blasphemy.

230
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,500
The only thing that most subgeniuses have in common

231
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,980
is that they're all different

232
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,600
and they have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normals.

233
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,700
By definition, the church of the subgenius can't really exist

234
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,800
because it's an organization for people who are not joiners.

235
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,300
Eccentrics, unpredictables, true visionaries.

236
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,920
Let us observe a few examples using the hidden camera.

237
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,560
It was in the first 30 issues of 9-inch worm comics

238
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,440
and I think in 14 issues of 4.5-inch worm comics.

239
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760
Is this man a subgenius?

240
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,520
It's a 7-Eleven comic.

241
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,400
Those aren't the comics about a 7-Eleven.

242
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,280
It's the adventures of a 7-Eleven.

243
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,060
They have a person that works a 7-Eleven

244
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,820
that just writes down everything that happens.

245
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,620
They draw a book and the whole comic is shaped like a big 7-Eleven.

246
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,480
It's three-dimensional.

247
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,260
They've got the idea from a flying saucer that was shaped like a 7-Eleven

248
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,900
that flew over one night.

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,120
It was a UFO believed to be...

250
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,580
A subgenius, obviously.

251
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,040
The speech patterns are unmistakable.

252
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,860
They share only the...

253
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,740
The quest for slack.

254
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,960
And the love of their beloved spiritual teacher,

255
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,940
the living avatar of slack,

256
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,140
J.R. Bob Dogg.

257
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,960
B.O.B.

258
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,920
B.O.B.

259
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,420
Bob.

260
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,300
I was getting messages in the back of my brain

261
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,620
as long ago as about 12 or 13 months.

262
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,340
And I just kept hearing the word Bob.

263
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,320
Bob.

264
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,700
Bob.

265
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,520
Bob is everywhere.

266
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,660
Bob is bursting out all over the place.

267
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,460
Just look through any phone book in any city

268
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,600
and you'll get the same thing.

269
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,320
Bob's construction company.

270
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,580
Bob's marketing company.

271
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,480
Bob's factory.

272
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,900
Bob's auto parts.

273
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,440
Bob's automotive service.

274
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,860
Bob's learning local.

275
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,900
Bob's dentist.

276
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,740
And then down here we've got Bob's used furniture store.

277
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,800
I mean, he's like everybody's dad should be.

278
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,360
Bob is about as American as you can get.

279
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,360
Bob's TV.

280
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,000
Bob's TV.

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,840
Bob's TV.

282
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,520
Bob's TV.

283
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,720
Bob's TV.

284
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,200
Bob's TV.

285
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,840
Bob's TV.

286
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,420
Bob's TV.

287
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,360
Bob's TV.

288
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,060
Bob's TV.

289
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,100
Bob's TV.

290
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,100


291
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,020
There's no laughing matter.

292
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm afraid he's determined to take us with him.

293
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,460
Even if it means force.

294
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,240
I'll handle this.

295
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,980
Hey, wait a minute, you guys.

296
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,720
Put your guns away.

297
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,960
No, Wally.

298
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,720
That's just what I'm gonna do.

299
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,320
Hello.

300
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:07,720
Hello.

301
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,180
We're glad you called us about masturbation.

302
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,440
You'll probably hear a lot of dumb and scary things

303
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,420
about masturbation from your family doctor.

304
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,760
Masturbation is touching and handling

305
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,520
your school nurse in a way that creates pleasurable sexual feelings for most people masturbating is

306
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,080
physically harmful now we like masturbation but if you masturbate it can be psychologically harmful

307
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:37,260
it could mess up your head in fact masturbation makes you go crazy or blind if this happens it

308
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,880
may indicate a serious problem the problem however is lack of masturbation punishing shots and it's

309
00:12:43,880 --> 00:13:02,080
over a wet wet kiss baby well yes splashing our way on in yep in towards x day it has all been

310
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:10,220
encapsulated and brought into one mighty compaction unit it is ready for the force field to be enacted

311
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,860
it is ready for decompartmentalization and transplants

312
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,440
that's what they're doing with those people in iraq right those those prisoners of war

313
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,040
well i think it's a new like club or something like that and hey have you noticed everybody's

314
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,380
giving the thumbs up sign type an snm club yeah and everybody gives like the kind of wink and the

315
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:36,400
thumbs up sign like hey man i humiliated some i've noticed that according to the media the only

316
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:43,760
torturers and abusers are really hot looking girls young uh attractive especially red

317
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,220
headed girls well the one girl that they showed uh who was giving the thumbs up i i suppose her

318
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,020
excretory function was not correct or else she wouldn't have always wanted to do the old

319
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,660
proctology boogie with all those people i think that um you know you know the they uh they're

320
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,600
just following orders and they're being given orders by people who want to those soldiers to

321
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,800
be able to do it to them when they get back to dc yeah until they use their safe word or say maybe

322
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,740
if the fate of yin get them and some they want to do it to them and they want to do it to them

323
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,960
they're going to get the same kind of friendly treatment say for instance it might have a slight

324
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,200
muslim or arabic slant to it like maybe you know there might be little cuts and so forth and it'll

325
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,520
still be the same hot action you get everywhere across the world with the new gw bush world

326
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:39,900
engram under which we're stamped say hi baby i can't nowadays let's not be extremists

327
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,540
and go to prison let's not be extreme unctionists

328
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,480
because we're all headed towards the same purple necktie baby you know what i'm saying it's it's

329
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,220
like you're in jail whether you're even if you're out on the street you're still in jail you're

330
00:14:52,220 --> 00:15:01,200
the man still got you as long as you're wearing a wristwatch you're in prison it's a slave planet

331
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,700
so well as you know it is nothing but a cell block but your arms a violent world

332
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,500
you wonder what you're eating do you think it is pork and beans

333
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,620
hahaha

334
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,260
yes there's pork and beans in it all right my friend but it is mostly

335
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:27,280
the substance of your own brain matter yes it's organ slush the tiny piece of

336
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,440
metallic fluids the apocantic fluids

337
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,420
excuse me we have recreated you and never mind dave do your neighbors consider you to be

338
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,420
different out strange do they give you funny

339
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,880
looks

340
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,480
wow they are incapable of giving looks my friends with the eyes ripped out of their

341
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,280
sockets and only the little oblong pills exposed what can they really see not the oblong pins

342
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:02,480
little tiny things for their own gratification they push back all the way in the head

343
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,100
you take the red pill and you stay asleep take the blue pill and you'll run around telling

344
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,760
everybody that you're more awake than the next guy

345
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,740
what which who would you choose w-what are you doing with your eyes you're not going

346
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:13,740


347
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:13,740


348
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:13,740


349
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:23,560
I took the red pill I took the square the octagonal yeah but it didn't I heard about people

350
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,740
that took the oblong pill in either one is red or blue not a good story it looks like

351
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,260
it there's a force field around each of them they made me take the pill that tell that

352
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:39,260
makes you tell everybody about pills they made me take the pill that that causes you

353
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,740
to go on and on and on and on about how you're more awake than some of your good friends

354
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:43,740


355
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,220
If you take this other pill.

356
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,600
But that's really just because you took the pill that makes you say that you're awake and alert and noticing the real world.

357
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,520
And, you know, it's like, it's the same thing over and over and over again.

358
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,720
One layer of the onion peeled away and it's still a damn onion.

359
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,040
There's nothing to do but fry it in the pan and hope you get a whooping in your titty-totty can.

360
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,520
Sit down, little man.

361
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,720
We have a message here.

362
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,120
It's encrypted, but you may be able to make out some of it.

363
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,780
And you're slated for some sort of, what do we call it?

364
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,960
That's the, no, that's the more erotic, neo-neurotic way.

365
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,760
Smell of frenulis?

366
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,500
Torture.

367
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,460
Torture.

368
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,260
Or as John Stewart, I heard John Stewart called it, freedom tickling.

369
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,700
One room at a time, buddy.

370
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,620
Freedom tickling.

371
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:32,940
Yeah.

372
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:40,420
Well, speaking of normals and everybody we hate, here's a song from the old Bonzo Dog Band about your neighbors.

373
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,140
Ha, ha, ha.

374
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,500
Yo, what we call me, I cross the fence.

375
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,060
I'm common sense.

376
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,320
I got a mouth of land full with a prize.

377
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,380
Won't that be nice?

378
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,200
And by the way, I'm your wife.

379
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,660
Your holidays were spent in Spain.

380
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,360
You went by train.

381
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,080
You'll go again.

382
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,320
Have you seen me bullfight poster on the wall?

383
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,000
Do you know?

384
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,700
The happy memory recalls.

385
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,060
It's a photograph of me and my son Ted.

386
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,320
That's me cousin with his achy on his head.

387
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,660
We booked in at our hotel just after two and met a family from Bradford that we knew.

388
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,600
Yo, what melody?

389
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,480
Yeah.

390
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,940
I think I'm on the brain pipe.

391
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,720
I'm a little extra crummy.

392
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,960
I think I'm on the brain pipe.

393
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,100
Oh, no.

394
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,320
Mama.

395
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,620
It longs for me.

396
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,800
Rodney's bass saxophone solo has promised.

397
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,560
I think I'm on the brain pipe.

398
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
Semi-detached.

399
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,820
Head up.

400
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,360
Semi-detached.

401
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,900
Semi-detached.

402
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,260
Semi-detached.

403
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,260


404
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,260


405
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,260


406
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,260


407
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,260


408
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,260


409
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,260


410
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,680
Oh mama.

411
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,220
Belongs to what?

412
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,400
I've a sister in Toronto who's a nurse.

413
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,720
And I've had a bit of bother laying turf.

414
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,800
It's life, not books that taught me all I've learned.

415
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,300
But if they're bothering my rice pudding's getting burnt.

416
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,540
Have you seen the new attachment on me drill?

417
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,900
I must have a cat put down because he's ill.

418
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,760
Hey, neighbor!

419
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,920
My pink heart of the green pine

420
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,820
I may change it for

421
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,800
My pink heart of the green pine

422
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,860
It's the same from you

423
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,940
I'm a woppy jelly, you're a paper bunge

424
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,280
I'm a sherry trifle, you're a chocolate sponge

425
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,620
You're a glass of paper hat, mine are face balloons

426
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,380
Whoops!

427
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,200
Here comes the spoon

428
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,260
My pink heart of the green pine

429
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,620
Separates me from the incredibly fascinating story of your life

430
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,320
And every day today, bent in all its might, you can teach us attention to detail

431
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,520
And was it a Thursday or a Wednesday or...

432
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Oh no, it wasn't so, who cares anyway, cause I do not sew normal

433
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,220
If you're normal, I intend to be a freak for the rest of my life

434
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,600
And I shall baffle you with cabbages and rhinoceroses in the kitchen

435
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,800
In sets and quotations, from now we are six

436
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,360
Through the mouthpiece of Lord Gryffindor

437
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,240
To Snootles giant poisoned electric head

438
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:52,380
So go...

439
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,160
My poverty but not my will consent

440
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,920
I pay thy poverty and not thy will

441
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,680
Put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off

442
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,160
And if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight

443
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,280
Here is thy gold

444
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,920
Worse poison to men's souls doing more murder in this loathsome world

445
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,960
And these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell

446
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,420
What is the taste of crunchy clusters?

447
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,780
Perfect forever

448
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,740
And it got in the spokes of the wheel and it choked it into

449
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,540
Death

450
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,400
Ah ah well I'll end it

451
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,440
No no no

452
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,540
It's the senate vote

453
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,420
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye

454
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,600
No aye no no aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye

455
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,400
Back to the very beginning of the first part

456
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,540
No

457
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,720
Underneath annoyances starting with a petty, bastardly, tiny, menacing, and wimpy

458
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,780
Sculp overbearing all encompassing

459
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,740
I'm gonna remove the sinus here

460
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,920
Just pull that very gently

461
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,080
Just take out my left sinus passage here

462
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,000
Get the whole thing right out

463
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,160
I'm ready to have the third nostril put right in

464
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,580
Are you kids quit playing with your little third nostril toys there

465
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,060
Are you kids?

466
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,440
Third nostril openings

467
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,360
Third nostril opener toys

468
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,280
Yeah get away from the slurpee machine

469
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,260
And put the hands off the third nostril straffinator

470
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,580
All you peep-ups get off and run

471
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,720
Bonzo Dog Band did my pink half

472
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,520
My pink half of the drainpipe

473
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,960
Separates me from the tedious endless email from bobbies and numbskulls, idiots and well-wishers

474
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,260
Do-gooders and nimrods and numbnuts and jillybops

475
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,280
Now do well

476
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,800
That's what your fear is my brother

477
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,820
Now do well

478
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,400
Now do well

479
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,780
Now do well

480
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,500
Those who have nothing not more in mind than to do you ill, yes

481
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,000
Now do well

482
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,740
The destruction of the Reverend Ivan Stank

483
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,920
I have seen their writs

484
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,580
I have seen their manifesto-ay-ay-ay-ay

485
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,020
Hey, hey, speaking of weirdos and stuff

486
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,800
I've seen their

487
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,500
Hey, hey, hey

488
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,820
We've got a show coming up

489
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,040
That we can't, uh, I wouldn't exactly recommend this to anybody but, uh, I'm not gonna say

490
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,040


491
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,560
But, uh, there is a subgenius devival

492
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,580
They should be made aware

493
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,780
They should be made some, somewhere

494
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,460
At, uh, on May 22nd, Saturday night at the Beachland Ballroom

495
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,820
It's, it's a touch of the old sarcophagus, you know, it makes you feel like you've gone and gone on

496
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,240
And you can't get back out and, you know, in here

497
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,400
Well, the girls are gonna be there

498
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,620
Reverend Nikki Deathchick will be

499
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,160
Snake it

500
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,600
And her nun snakes

501
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,440
Snake it

502
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,920
Will be applying the sp, the, the bonding

503
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,000
Spankings of, uh, guilt relief or guilt or something

504
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,460
I, I always get, I get religious things

505
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,900
I will be applying my own special brand of nasal pressure to the third nostril cruise

506
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

507
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,260
And, uh, those beautiful girls in the amino acids

508
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,460
They're a masked surf music band

509
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,920
Surf punk, uh, instrumental masked alien band

510
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,840
Who are actually beautiful girls underneath those masks

511
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,580
You wouldn't think it

512
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,020
Or beautiful goats, depending on which, uh, trend

513
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,640
Or which trans-vibrational level you come from

514
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,260
They never take the masks off and they look like men or, or something like men

515
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,460
Yeah, but they are goats

516
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,600
Beyond human semblance

517
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,060
I've seen their molecules evaporate

518
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,680
Beyond mere hums

519
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,760
I've seen the petri dish with the goat horn and the piece of magic eye

520
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,220
I, I, I know what they are

521
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,440
Oh, here they are playing in the background

522
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,640
Oh, Lord

523
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,900
I can hear them

524
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,500
Oh, Lord

525
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,600
Well, that's not the amino acids, but it's close enough

526
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,020
I think it's Robert Johnson about to sell

527
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,920
Bucca

528
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,920
That's a bad dream, amino acids

529
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,120
This is the Paul Bucca theme

530
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,320
This is the Paul Bucca theme

531
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,240
I didn't know they had theme music

532
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,820
Just a Paul Bucca

533
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,080
I'm just an old Paul Bucca to you

534
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,540
They call me Bucca

535
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,340
Silence is a bug

536
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,560
Just a Paul Bucca

537
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,340
Be quiet now

538
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,240
Put your hand on the thermometer

539
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,140
Oh, and that other, that Paul Bucca named Man Incorporated

540
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,860
The one man band will also

541
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,960
And that actually is a pretty impressive one fellow

542
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,980
How about the dopamine tyrants?

543
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,880
The beaters of serotonin which will come in a flood

544
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,960
Oh, the Minoan brain eaters

545
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,820
Yeah, they'll probably be there

546
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,740
Flood into your brains

547
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,700
And Reverend Carter LeBlanc who is the good subgenius preacher

548
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,480
As opposed to the rest of us

549
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
And, uh

550
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,940
Man

551
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,580
And the movie show

552
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,160
Oh, and the movie show?

553
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,960
Yeah, the movie show

554
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,540
And the nostril, uh, dripping

555
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,360
The nostril, third nostril openings

556
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,960
The mind-melting movie show

557
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,580
Yeah

558
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,200
The people in their shells and their concomitant gestures

559
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,920
Believe it or not, I, Scene Magazine called me up about that

560
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,300
About the gestures?

561
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,220
And quizzed me about this

562
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,500
Yeah, gestures

563
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,940
What, just what this lonesome cowboy Dave brain cell was going to do

564
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,560
Oh

565
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,080
In this big circus

566
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,720
Oh boy

567
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,340
Whether he was going to be jumping through hoops or

568
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,140
Or throwing himself into Bob's pocket

569
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,620
Or, uh, you know

570
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,360
Oh boy

571
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,440
I told, I told her that we were basically going to nail you up on a cross and tote you

572
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:51,780
around

573
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,400
Oh boy

574
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,240
And do a takeoff on that famous religion, uh, uh

575
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,560
I am from the Carolingian Brotherhood

576
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,900
I am a member of the Zul organization

577
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,740
And I do not believe in your bastard Nazarene, pale Nazarene Jesus

578
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,380
I went, oh

579
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,020
Oh, I do sometimes

580
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,600
You know when it serves

581
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,640
That's the scary part

582
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,680
When it serves my purple

583
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,580
If you know what I'm saying

584
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:20,100
Is that where we bring offerings of whipped cream, bowls of whipped cream down to your toes?

585
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,520
Little cherries too

586
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,200
Yeah, that's what I thought, yeah

587
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,300
Listen little pink, little normal worm

588
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,900
You didn't hire me last time I blessed you with a resume

589
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,480
Now I'm back to buy your company and close it down, demolish it, pave over the ruins

590
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,920
And forbid anyone to approach the site for ten thousand years

591
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,360
Cheers

Bye

00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,200
Bye

601
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,600
Bye

602
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:09,660
Bye

603
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:09,660


604
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:09,660


605
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,740
Bye

606
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


607
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


608
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


609
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


610
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


611
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


612
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


613
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


614
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


615
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


616
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:32,320
Oh, I want some of that

617
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:32,620
Well it's really spicy

618
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,260
Well I want to go around here withカizen

619
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,800
And we will see you through the back door

620
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:33,800


621
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:33,800


622
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:33,800


623
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:33,800


624
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:33,800


625
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:33,800


626
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,580
How long are we meeting all there for?

627
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,440
5

628
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,900
60

629
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,980
It's, uh, you know, it's still just an unknown.

630
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,840
Subgeniuses must be chameleons ready to don at a moment's notice the disguise of the normal.

631
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,640
They will endure the polyester of the pink if that's what is required in order to earn their daily bread

632
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,420
and grab a little slack for whatever awful things they do at night.

633
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:13,080
If Dr. Jekyll is not allowed to surface on some rare occasions, Mr. Hyde will be captured.

634
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,640
The brain will start weapon down, you know, pretty much like one of those ancient birds.

635
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,460
You know, it's got the same kind of profile.

636
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,640
It just, uh, but if you can, uh, say, for instance, get your hand on the right kind of material,

637
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,820
like a quartz crystal or something like that, uh, it works just like a baby dog.

638
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,800
Yeah, it's a charm.

639
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,720
And I, I mean, it's a charm.

640
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:01,800
Some subgeniuses never for an instant cease to project a contrived hate,

641
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,600
indiscriminately despising everything,

642
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,740
everything normal.

643
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,820
But that's just another way of ignoring the vagaries of life in favor of some escapist formula,

644
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,900
some rule book.

645
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,000
It only proves they are normals because they haven't caught on yet that by definition,

646
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,020
half of what they call normal is actually stranger than them.

647
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,200
They just don't get in strangeness

648
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,700
because they can't tell the difference between bulldonner, stupid, and camp.

649
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,380
And here in our camp is Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

650
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,140
I am not in your camp, nor have I ever been a member of your cr-

651
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,680
You can't hide from normality!

652
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,960
You cannot hide from the all-seeing eye that peers everywhere.

653
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,960
There's a lot of happy campers around here, but no.

654
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,320
It's in the lavatories.

655
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,980
It's in the basement.

656
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,320
It's in the foot lockers.

657
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,540
It's over in the, uh, in the closet space there.

658
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,340
It's in the broom closet.

659
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,700
It's in the, uh, these, uh, where they put the cats and hoes.

660
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,400
It's over where they have-

661
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,380
War, friends.

662
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,200
War, war, war.

663
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:13,700
Huh!

664
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,860
What is it good for?

665
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,260
What's the use of dying if we're already gonna live anyway?

666
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,900
What is it good for?

667
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,460
Yes, sir, dunks are just-

668
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,240
Good God, y'all.

669
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,460
Absolutely nothing.

670
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,700
This will make friends for you.

671
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Mars, the Roman god of war, played the drums for the ban war.

672
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,180
Hmm, alright.

673
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,760
Just because they're dunks.

674
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,240
That'd be sick.

675
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,300
Did you ever wonder about that?

676
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,840
No, I didn't.

677
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,640
I didn't wonder about a lot of things.

678
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,300
The mythical beast has always had a purely symbolic function.

679
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,740
And maybe somebody might say I wondered about the moon.

680
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,920
Representing the lunar and feminine aspect, and also through the rampant horn.

681
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,880
You know, sometimes you do a lot of thinking that-

682
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,960
The victory of the male over the female.

683
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,020
Might as well have never thought it over.

684
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,700
Did you ever think this sky was a great big blueberry pie?

685
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,600
Yeah.

686
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,540
It makes me hungry when I think about that.

687
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,740
Did you ever think, did you ever think the sky was a great big blueberry pie?

688
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,780
Yeah, and I wanted to stick it in my thumb and pull out a plum.

689
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,560
Well, you're right.

690
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,120
It is.

691
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,600
Bad, isn't it?

692
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:15,960
Um.

693
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,560
Shhhhh.

694
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,380
Crazy man.

695
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,100
Oh, that music in the background there was by Norrell Preff.

696
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,100
That, that killer guitar music.

697
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,140
That was, uh, Norrell Preff instrumental.

698
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:34,920
Norrell Preff is reachable at heavyconfetti.com.

699
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,220
We heard some music also earlier in the background by Hipsodic.

700
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,080
And this in the background is Ed Fred.

701
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,680
Ed Fred music, I think.

702
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:53,360
And they leave the earth, their troubles melting like lemon drops as they cascade over the

703
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,720
edges.

704
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,440
.

705
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:54,440


706
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:01,000
The episode bodys howling

707
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,680
Can you see anything different about this structure?

708
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,280
Yeah.

709
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,180
You notice anything kind of, knew or unusual?

710
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,580
There's, uh, lots of new things going on now.

711
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,100
What is that, man?

712
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,000
What is that?

713
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,860
I don't know.

714
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,120
But we can't let it get out until

715
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,300
Oh, man!

716
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,700
I can't believe we're, like, actually witnessing this.

717
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,340
It's a war between the dopamine um

718
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,820
Oh, man.

719
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:32,240
Each man have their own troops, their little vehicles, their fighting tanks, their mighty, mighty military robots.

720
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,080
Each and every one of them is a vessel designed by Satan.

721
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,820
But don't worry.

722
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,560
What?

723
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,640
The engine is going to go up.

724
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,040
Oh, no.

725
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
Oh, no.

726
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,820
Oh, I just remembered something.

727
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,300
I've got a scary.

728
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,640
Scary thing.

729
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,920
I've got a scary thing.

730
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,840
A scary thing.

731
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,280
Oh, no.

732
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,420
No, no, no.

733
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:08,520
Well, what it is is, you know, over the years, those alt-binary slack creatures.

734
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:13,800
Where I scrape a lot of the sound for the hour of slack off of.

735
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,880
I see you scraping.

736
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,340
Alt-binary slack where you download the weird audio and the weird pictures from subgenius land.

737
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,300
Those guys have been cutting up little.

738
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,620
Little pictures of sounds for millions of years and have made tiny.

739
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,840
Funny, goofy, little fissures on the side of the statues.

740
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,580
That's only one side of the head.

741
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
The other side of the head is much more.

742
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,440
Genius.

743
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:43,940
Great.

744
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,880
You scrape up the bits.

745
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,980
Well, you know, these types do rip your brain in half.

746
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,100
You start.

747
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,040
They take the left.

748
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,720
Here and the right here and yank them apart.

749
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,880
And so just pay attention.

750
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,020
Educational.

751
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,400
Fun.

752
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,700
Free.

753
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,120
Huge.

754
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,560
Radiant.

755
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:22,900
Gorgeous.

756
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,260
Beautiful.

757
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:23,380
Beautiful.

758
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:23,680
Beautiful.

759
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,160
Genuine.

760
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,500
Great.

761
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:24,920
Great.

762
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,180
Oldest.

763
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:25,400
Only.

764
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:25,740
Large.

765
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,180
Huge.

766
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,760
Most.

767
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,060
Great.

768
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,580
Great.

769
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:27,740


770
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,480
Suspicing.

771
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:28,900
First.

772
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,740
Magical.

773
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,460
Legendary.

774
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,800
Fading.

775
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,400
Large.

776
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,040
Big.

777
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,260
Great.

778
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,480
Big.

779
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,480


780
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,520
Big.

781
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,000
Costly.

782
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,440
Magic.

783
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,360
New.

784
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,340
Older.

785
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:35,740
First.

786
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,140
Brilliant.

787
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,040
Perfect.

788
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,040


789
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,300


790
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,440
Perfect.

791
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,060
Cool.

792
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:39,640
Special.

793
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,040
Clear.

794
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,280
Special.

795
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,880
Labyrinth.

796
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,160
Easy.

797
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,620
Ultimate.

798
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,120
Best.

799
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,660
Special.

800
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:42,660


801
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:42,860
Natural.

802
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,040
Growing the special much more.

803
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,480
Nice price.

804
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,160
And much more.

805
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,400
Much more.

806
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,680
Much more.

807
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,180
It's a jolly, jolly Bob show.

808
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,400
It's jolly.

809
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,000
It's so jolly.

810
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,460
It's a funny Bob show.

811
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,920
It's jollier than jolly.

812
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,980
It'll mess you up.

813
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,140
It's so jolly it makes me laugh.

814
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,180
It'll steal your soul if you let it.

815
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,640
It'll mess with Bob's coat.

816
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,940
Tasty prairie squid spread.

817
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,480
Salted and unsalted varieties available on the East Coast only.

818
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,440
The radioactive cloud is now over Little Rock.

819
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,340
Crager shat piercingly.

820
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,020
It's a crazy awesome lady.

821
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,760
This is really amazing.

822
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,840
Ergo, those that refuse the program while a minority, if unchecked,

823
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,260
would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.

824
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,880
Bob!

825
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,000
Bob!

826
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,080


827
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,380
Bob!

828
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:15,720
Bob!

829
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:15,900
Bob!

830
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,060
Bob!

831
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,200
Bob!

832
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,260
Bob!

833
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,340
Bob!

834
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:16,440
Bob!

835
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,440


836
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,440


837
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,440


838
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,440


839
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,440


840
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,480
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

841
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,020
The following order is to be carried out immediately.

842
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,780
It's not a crutch, Dad.

843
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,140
It's something I've come to rely on to help me through life.

844
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,220
Praise Bob!

845
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:37,660
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ,

846
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,340
and since I've been listening to it.

847
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,160
I gotta have some slack.

848
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,120
Slack.

849
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,160
To the street, faster than any other leading,

850
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Our advanced analyzer software helps you quickly sort through expensive diapers.

851
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,500
And our streaming data page enables you to size up body parts.

852
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,460
I'm going to bypass your forebrain and appeal directly to your amygdala.

853
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,740
Oh, don't grab me.

854
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Okay, great.

855
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,000
Don't grab.

856
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,320
Ah!

857
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,180
This is civilization's jungle.

858
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:26,520
After the jackals of society have ruthlessly ravaged it, ending the world of decency.

859
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,140
I haven't had time for your kind of woman.

860
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,080
Don't touch me.

861
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,060
I can't stand you.

862
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:40,840
But all you're remembering is merely a series of sensory impulses which you now realize have no real definite connection with outside reality.

863
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,160
True.

864
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,500
But since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.

865
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,360
I have no time to make a show of loving kindness before my fellow men.

866
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,620
Not in this life.

867
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,940
I've too much laughing to do.

868
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,800
Hurrah!

869
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,280
Unfair to kick a man when he's down.

870
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,920
Let's get him up on his feet.

871
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,240
Excellent.

872
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,660
He will not reveal his identity.

873
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,900
So for today, we're calling him Bob.

874
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,060
Men and women of all races and creeds pause to destroy the earth.

875
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,240
Because they saw such a mystifying sight.

876
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:26,300
I sometimes feel that I am impersonating the dark subconscious of the whole human race.

877
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,000
⁠—

878
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:44,720
Baaah-ba-ba-baah-b-b-baah-baah-baaah-baaah saaaahhhhh.

879
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,660
Aaaaaaaaaahhhh!

880
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,040
What's that? What's that?

881
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,000
Fantastic things have already happened.

882
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,060
And more are getting ready to happen.

883
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,000
This is because the planet on which you're residing has entered the space age.

884
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,840
You are a most unusual individual.

885
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,880
And decidedly in the minority.

886
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,980
Oh, another victim of confusion?

887
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,920
Decidedly.

888
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,840
Oh, that's crazy talk.

889
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,200
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe.

890
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,860
Well, we're all pretty much, aren't we?

891
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,440
I'm sorry.

892
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,500
Do you think Bob is just a guy with a pipe?

893
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,220
Are you just a guy with a pipe?

894
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,580
Well, it's like a form of dialectic.

895
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,500
You know, you could divide the world into different cramps that you were talking about cramps before.

896
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,080
You could have some who believe that it's just a guy with a pipe.

897
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,320
And others who dynamically believe it's just a guy with a pipe.

898
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,280
You know what I'm saying?

899
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,800
Like when they say it, they look at each other and they're just like,

900
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,180
Yeah, man, it's just a guy with a pipe.

901
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,960
It's just a guy with a pipe.

902
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,280
You know, and in a special glimmer in each other's eyes, you know,

903
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,640
and they can give each other the high sign or different signs, you know.

904
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,020
To truly believe.

905
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,300
To truly let all brain cells die.

906
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,940
That must be glorious.

907
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,060
Well, that's our goal.

908
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,760
That's the goal of each and every individual aspirer or perspirer.

909
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:06,100
Anybody who wants to attain that certain secondary, I don't know what it is.

910
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,160
I guess you can read things when you don't really.

911
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,540
But, you know what I'm saying?

912
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
We all need this.

913
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,140
I know what you're saying.

914
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,100
We all need this.

915
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,600
It's in a manufactured need.

916
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,000
Must have slack.

917
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,800
Must have slack.

918
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,260
Must.

919
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:18,800
Must.

920
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
Must have slack.

921
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,700
Must.

922
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,580
Must.

923
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,700
Must have slack.

924
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,360
Must.

925
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,080
Must.

926
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm slack.

927
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,080
Must have slack.

928
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,920
Must.

929
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,240
Must.

930
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,600
Yeah, when they buried the poor little guy, he was as bloated as a grape.

931
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,160
He had to use a rake to pull him out of the...

932
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:42,700
...pond.

933
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,860
He'd been swearing up and down he was going to do it all week.

934
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:55,300
He said if Bob didn't give him a call or he didn't get some word about that 30 bucks he sent that damn...

935
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,060
Oh, that 30 bucks.

936
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,500
Well, now you know.

937
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,240
He finally did it.

938
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,020
There he is.

939
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:07,060
He brought up his grave and put him in a shallow grave and had a beer and went down...

940
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,560
Yeah, baby!

941
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,460
Baby!

942
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,060
It's all coming down.

943
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,620
Civilization, that is.

944
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,060
Falling apart.

945
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,040
Falling to pieces.

946
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,220
You're part of it.

947
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,000
You're part of the problem, not the solution.

948
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,300
You're one of the tiny cracks, man.

949
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,460
You're one of the little fissures pulling the thing down.

950
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,620
You're one of the things, you know, reducing it to a common...

951
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,320
So do the right thing, man.

952
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,020
Go ahead and jump.

953
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,060
Just get it over with.

954
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,080
Yeah, get it over with, man.

955
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,420
Go on and get it over with, then.

956
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,100
It's so easy.

957
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,600
And your troubles will melt like lemming drops as you fall off the edge of that cliff.

958
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:57,740
So, so high up over the sea, it's a beautiful, breathtaking dive

959
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,840
a hundred feet down to the new beach and rocks below!

960
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,600
Lombada.

961
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,340
Ah, the Lombada, the dance of love.

962
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,240
Ah, eh, eh.

963
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,900
Eh, practice.

964
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,140
By Bob and Connie.

965
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,960
In the heat and feverish passion of their desire.

966
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:25,600
Oh, and you, too, can glean some of the sweaty, sheeny, shiny sweat off of their skin.

967
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,900
If you'll just do as your master Bob says and fetch the paper every morning, bring him

968
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:39,720
his slippers and his little pipe loaded, uh, for bear, and, uh, join us, humans, in our

969
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,160
subterranean time.

970
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,500
Bottles of love.

971
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,580
Oh, buddy.

972
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:44,920
Ha, ha.

973
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,380
You're gonna have to ripen first.

974
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:53,920
You're gonna have to be a little more, uh, a little more less.

975
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,960
Yes, you just have to lose a little bit of those, uh, excess brain cells you've been,

976
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,460
uh, tripping over, really.

977
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:03,920
That's it.

978
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,580
They're not much.

979
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,500
Lombada.

980
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,460
Lombada.

981
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,660
Lombada.

982
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:09,760
Lombada.

983
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,120
Lombada.

984
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:10,660
Lombada.

985
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:10,960
Lombada.

986
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:10,960


987
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,120
Lombada.

988
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,140
Lombada.

989
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,100
Lombada.

990
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,120


991
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,120


992
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,120


993
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,120


994
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:12,320
Lumbada.

995
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,320


996
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,600
What we're trying to say is dance the lumbaba.

997
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,440
Ta-da-da-dum.

998
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,540
Lumbaba.

999
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,260
Lumbaba.

1000
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,340
Lumbaba.

1001
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,420
Lumbaba.

1002
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:23,540
Lumbaba.

1003
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,220
Lumbaba.

1004
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,380
Lumbaba.

1005
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,020
Lumbaba.

1006
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,460
People could get involved with almost like a form of aerobics of, like, people want to

1007
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:36,580
lose weight, they want to shed those unnecessary LBs, they want to bring the kilos down, and

1008
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,440
yet at the same time, they want to bring their own architecture up.

1009
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,360
So what do they do?

1010
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,980
They run around little circles.

1011
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,800
They get on those bikes and things like that.

1012
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,620
Well, how can they reduce their brain cells?

1013
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,740
How can we...

1014
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,860
How should we say it?

1015
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,600
How can we...

1016
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,940
Lighten the load.

1017
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:52,660
Lighten the load.

1018
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,220
Lighten the load.

1019
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,740
Up there where it's real heavy.

1020
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,560
You know, a lot of people got fat butts.

1021
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,860
A lot of people got a midriff.

1022
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,600
A lot of people maybe got a saggy neck or something like that.

1023
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:05,380
But how many of us, and I'm saying pretty much 90% to 100,000% of all of us,

1024
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,380
have too much going on upstairs?

1025
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,760
We've eaten too many psychic donuts.

1026
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,960
And the psychobalk, that's an old world,

1027
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,060
I didn't make that up.

1028
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,500
Well, Dave, there's an answer.

1029
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,780
There is an answer.

1030
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,280
That's where break thinking comes in.

1031
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,600
Bob teaches a technique called break thinking

1032
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,960
by which you completely disconnect the mind.

1033
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,520
This is also called a path to higher consciousness-lessness.

1034
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,880
Can that help the bulges in my brain?

1035
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,760
It's to create smooth noodle maps,

1036
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,160
as depicted by Devo.

1037
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,100
I love smooth.

1038
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,680
Yes, to smooth the maps,

1039
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,160
the noodles,

1040
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:42,960
on your noodle,

1041
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,860
to smooth down the corrugations,

1042
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,800
which contain so many excess thoughts,

1043
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,880
thoughts of unfairness and sadness that you don't need.

1044
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,280
Smooth it down and have only simple, simple thoughts of happiness.

1045
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,300
Smooth, they say, smooth.

1046
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,120
Lisa, smooth.

1047
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:10,840
One, two, cha-cha, bob.

1048
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,000
Cha-cha, bob.

1049
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,040
One, two, one.

1050
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:15,740
Cha-cha, bob.

1051
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,920
Blow the world up.

1052
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,640
Cha-cha, bob.

1053
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,080
Blow the world up.

1054
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,800
Cha-cha, bob.

1055
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,140
Blow the world up.

1056
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,800
Cha-cha, bob.

1057
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,120
Blow the world up.

1058
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:23,800
Cha-cha, bob.

1059
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,640
Oh, hang on.

1060
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,220
Now, now, let's get away from that because nihilism is not where the,

1061
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,900
this is not even really a church,

1062
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,440
but nihilism is not where this organization is going from head to head.

1063
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,480
No, who cares about Neil?

1064
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,160
We're into Bob.

1065
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,760
Who cares about Neil?

1066
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,400
Neil Innes, perhaps, if we could hear his song.

1067
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,720
That's a great, yeah, Neil Innes of the great Bonzo Dog Man, sure.

1068
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:41,960
Sure.

1069
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:42,700
Bonzoing again, but.

1070
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,320
I'm going to be nihilist.

1071
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,100
We don't need that kind of, we don't need the kind of destructive.

1072
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:47,900
You can't stop me.

1073
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,920
There's a slathery.

1074
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,640
You know, some people are afraid of slavery.

1075
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,920
We're afraid of slathery.

1076
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,500
Like that one cosmic-minded guy was saying on the internet,

1077
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,680
negativity is bad and positivity is basically good.

1078
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,080
I don't know about that.

1079
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,780
Actually, positive thinking is what got us where we are now.

1080
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:04,640
Positively.

1081
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,640
It's our own world.

1082
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,280
No, I like square edges.

1083
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,060
I like things that aren't too round and fuzzy.

1084
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,940
That's right, Virgil.

1085
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,900
That's right, 90 degree head.

1086
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,360
It's time for you to wear off the top of those spongy boxes

1087
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,300
and return your brain to its original condition.

1088
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,260
It's all in the balance, you know.

1089
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,000
Smooth as a noodle and paste.

1090
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,780
Ignore or deny every reality.

1091
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,260
Please.

1092
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,420
Get the bigger picture.

1093
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,120
As big as you fit some screen.

1094
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,900
Big, big, big.

1095
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,360
In your head.

1096
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,400
It's too big for my head.

1097
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,260
Señor.

1098
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,180
God made me do it.

1099
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,040
How often do you say that, friend?

1100
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:41,860
Is he pooping?

1101
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,400
Big for your head.

1102
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,160
It's way too big for my head.

1103
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,560
We have plenty more you can use for us.

1104
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,220
Oh, okay.

1105
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,380
Let me see some of those other ones.

1106
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:55,100
Here we can see the planes bringing in the shipments of giant heads

1107
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:01,340
for these poor bereft people, these humans down here with their small heads,

1108
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:08,180
their empty heads, their sad, troubled heads seen so far down below us.

1109
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,780
They look up at we who fly.

1110
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,880
They look up at we who fly.

1111
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,320
They look up at we who fly.

1112
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:13,320


1113
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:13,420
They look up at we who fly.

1114
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:22,020
Birdmen, junior and senior birdmen soaring so high above them in our slack and our self-professed

1115
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,600
superiority, yes?

1116
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,980
For we have the megaphone and are able to profess our superiority so much louder than

1117
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,060
all of the others.

1118
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,960
So much louder than ever before.

1119
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,120
That's what we mean by the conspiracy.

1120
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,180
The bully.

1121
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:38,780
That's right.

1122
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,640
The jerk.

1123
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,300
The ass.

1124
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:41,620
The ass.

1125
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,660
Pushing you around and never shuts up.

1126
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:52,560
Well, that party didn't have to end that way.

1127
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,580
No, it didn't.

1128
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:00,760
So many re-sculpted bodies, so much unused barbed wire, so many belts and gas bottoms

1129
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:06,200
and batteries that didn't fit in the wrong confusion holes, but that's their way of thinking.

1130
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,540
Those silly muscle men.

1131
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,980
How did they not...

1132
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,840
Why didn't they...

1133
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,420
They'll never, never know.

1134
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,900
It's very simple.

1135
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,080
Hi, embarrassing people stare at you without a face.

1136
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,900
The face terrified me.

1137
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,340
You just want to be normal.

1138
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,760
Suck the blackhead.

1139
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,140
Freeze, Bob.

1140
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,120
You have consumed enough alcohol for one eight-pack.

1141
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,500
It is wasteful and pointless.

1142
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,740
Obey and live, or disobey and die.

1143
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,000
I see no reason for violence.

1144
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,040
If, however, you are confronted, you may resort to the use of hypnosis.

1145
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,460
You know, God hates you.

1146
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,600
Stay away from him.

1147
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,400
Licentiousness, just unbridled, uncontrolled excesses.

1148
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,700
That was something he invented.

1149
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,900
And I say, as long as you're alive,

1150
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,120
Joe,

1151
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,340
don't make noise or whatever,

1152
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,440
because we'll...

1153
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,180
Freeze, Bob.

1154
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,260
You shut up like hell.

1155
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,540
That's utter nonsense.

1156
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,280
The future is always nonsense

1157
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,360
until it becomes the past.

1158
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,760
The American people have now spoken,

1159
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,360
but it's going to take a little while to determine exactly what they said.

1160
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,620
I'm afraid.

1161
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,480
I'm afraid, Dan.

1162
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:37,900
What's his name?

1163
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:38,920
Bob.

1164
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,300
Bob.

1165
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,420
Ain't that a bitch?

1166
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,680
Don't you worry about us, Lord.

1167
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,480
We may blow a few holes in your ceiling from time to time,

1168
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,980
but we give you fair warning before we blow up the whole house.

1169
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,940
Yes, fair warning before X-Day.

1170
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,360
We told you, July 5th.

1171
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,340
This year.

1172
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,300
This year might be 1998.

1173
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,460
It could be 2012.

1174
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,900
We have no idea.

1175
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,060
It could be.

1176
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:07,480
The records are all scared.

1177
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,760
It could be.

1178
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,160
But it seems like this is the year, is it not?

1179
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,520
Yes.

1180
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,620
This is the year in which the raptured or ruptured ones,

1181
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,400
excuse me, I'm so sorry, I'm confused with the other,

1182
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,360
but the ruptured ones are lifted up into space

1183
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,180
and whisked off somewhere, God knows who.

1184
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,940
That's what the fairy tale says.

1185
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,140
That's what the fairy tale says.

1186
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,960
It's what Bob said.

1187
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,680
The actual mythos of the...

1188
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,780
Well, I guess it goes back to Philodramond

1189
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,440
and Reverend Ivory...

1190
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,000
Ivan Stagg.

1191
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:35,740
Ivory Stinks.

1192
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,580
Ivory Stinks.

1193
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,300
Ivory Stinkytool.

1194
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,440
...description of his olfactory, what he gives off anyway.

1195
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,180
But in the first place, what we find amongst many of these culties,

1196
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,580
these Barbies, these followers,

1197
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:52,960
is an extremely detachment, a disassociation.

1198
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,840
An extreme...

1199
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,180
A flat A-spec.

1200
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,160
A flat A-spec.

1201
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,420
Yes.

1202
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,320
A null A sign on each one's forehead.

1203
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,360
Each one waiting the ride to Venus and it never happens.

1204
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:02,840
Yes.

1205
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,140
But some return every year.

1206
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,020
Then I thought, I could die doing this.

1207
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,720
I guess that this is going to prove myself once and for all that I'm down for Bob.

1208
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,580
I'll help him do anything.

1209
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,740
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1210
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,180
Maybe that's all Bob is.

1211
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,920
I'll say hello later.

1212
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,520
Shut up about Bob, will you?

1213
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,760
Go holly.

1214
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,380
Go holly.

1215
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,500
Just before Christmas, Bob followed through.

1216
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:34,980
He walked into this bank north of Seattle and left with nearly $26,000,

1217
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,500
which he stabbed...

1218
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,540
...in a child's trick-or-treat bag.

1219
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,140
Bob had good reason to smile again.

1220
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,920
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

1221
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,780
Give me slack, you frickin' lunatic.

1222
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,900
Stop, fucker.

1223
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,360
I'm out of frickin' slack.

1224
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,600
The lawless are on the loose,

1225
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,660
making it necessary for law-abiding citizens to make their own law.

1226
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,220
Yeah.

1227
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,600
See you in the new Jim Onyard TV.

1228
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,320
See you in the new Jim Onyard TV.

1229
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:07,980
See you in the new Jim Onyard TV.

1230
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,220
Don't sass me.

1231
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,400
Not only the marginally weird, but the entirely weird.

1232
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,140
Oh, yeah.

1233
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,540
Work them into the scope of the Church of the...

1234
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,320
Right, right, right.

1235
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:19,760
...Catholic.

1236
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:20,740
Right, right.

1237
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,920
So, yeah, we work them into the scope.

1238
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:31,440
And some are made to wear the bellboy attendant hats and suits that look quite strange to some of the younger members.

1239
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,460
It's a treat for some of the ones who've gone on, so to speak.

1240
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,660
Some have the bonsai.

1241
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,900
Some have shrunk quite, quite, quite far down.

1242
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:41,440
Yes, yes.

1243
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,120
You can hardly make them out without...

1244
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,040
And then some have the elephantitis.

1245
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,400
Yeah, well, those are the ones that are quite introspective.

1246
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,100
You see what happens.

1247
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:49,480
Yes, yes.

1248
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,100
The more they think, the bigger their heads get.

1249
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,960
And pretty soon, the calcium in the brain, not the brain, the...

1250
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,560
The nucleus.

1251
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,260
The nucleus.

1252
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,560
That's what...

1253
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,540
I have a question.

1254
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,480
I have a question.

1255
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,180
Is this show for, like, people who are on drugs?

1256
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,220
Oh, I...

1257
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,360
I hope not.

1258
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,740
That is a hot-button subject.

1259
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:15,860
I would hope that it would be the kind of thing that would replace the drugs, don't you see?

1260
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,460
Exactly.

1261
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,680
It's the repugnancy factor, Stang, is what we've been talking to.

1262
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,280
Rather than merely an enhancement.

1263
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,840
Listen to this.

1264
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,200
Who needs drugs?

1265
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,500
Well, you might need them as an enhancement for this show.

1266
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,240
I don't know.

1267
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,380
In order to make it more palatable.

1268
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:31,940
You may need a...

1269
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,800
Oh, poppycock.

1270
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,980
Or a doggy bag.

1271
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,540
Or a pair of hairy...

1272
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,260
That's a bunch of boobies.

1273
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,240
Or a swashly.

1274
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,560
To give it the semblance of social value or...

1275
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,020
Friends, if you want to know more...

1276
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,000
It gives you definitely a feeling that your mind is being monitored by the...

1277
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:57,760
Your mind can be further monitored if you will simply write for free information if you're interested in more about the Church of the Subgenius.

1278
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,640
You can get some by mail from Bob at...

1279
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,000
Well, actually, it's not Bob.

1280
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,520
That would be ridiculous.

1281
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,120
It's Jesus.

1282
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:05,980
At...

1283
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,180
Post Office Box 204206.

1284
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,040
Austin, Texas.

1285
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:12,960
78720.

1286
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,540
That's the business headquarters, you might say, of the Church.

1287
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,300
The second...

1288
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,140
Or what is it now?

1289
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,220
The fourth Megafist Temple Lodge.

1290
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,140
The spiritual headquarters is, of course, here in beautiful Cleveland, Ohio.

1291
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,860
You can send tapes and CDs and such like...

1292
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,660
To me.

1293
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,040
Reverend Stang.

1294
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,640
At subgenius.com.

1295
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,940
Post Office Box 181417.

1296
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,900
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1297
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,900
What's ours?

1298
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,360
It's...

1299
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,180
4-4-1-1-8.

1300
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:57,600
Yeah.

1301
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,000
4-4-1-1-8.

1302
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,480
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry.

1303
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,400
Hour of Slack.

1304
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,720
Number 942.

1305
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,040
There actually have been that many of them.

1306
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,700
Although a few of those, I guess, were reruns.

1307
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,600
The music in the background is the swinging love corpses.

1308
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:20,660
The collage of noises that we heard were sourced from...

1309
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,060
I got that stuff from all of the subgeniuses.

1310
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:31,620
A special thanks to New Monet, Fernand and Andy Lemur, and Artemia Salina, I think, for a whole lot of that.

1311
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,980
I organized them myself using the rules of chance.

1312
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,040
And I'm going to...

1313
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,100
Price Bob and stay out of...

1314
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,700
Asleep.

1315
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,040
Bob?

1316
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,400
Bob?

1317
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,040
Bob?

1318
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,940
The professional pessimist.

1319
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:04,740
In the past, he's been called the prophet of gloom and doom, the troubadour of trouble,

1320
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:05,960
the disciple...

1321
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,800
The disciple of despair.

1322
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,300
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1323
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,260
Bob.

1324
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,040
The unbalancing that happens when you work with these people makes you really question what you know reality is.

1325
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,360
Mom, Mom.

1326
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,600
Everyone wants it.

1327
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:29,960
Mom.

1328
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,180
Give me slack, you frickin' lunatic.

1329
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,620
Stop.

1330
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,260
Fuck off.

1331
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,680
You're

1332
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:57,620
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

1333
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,860
I know nothing, nothing.

1334
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,900
Doug's right, Virgil.

1335
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,740
We are different.

1336
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,240
Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies.

1337
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,980
Even Doug Smith.

1338
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:13,320
I'll admit, it's the good news, son.

1339
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,260
Cry havoc and let's split the dogs of war.

1340
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,860
My boy, we're pilgrims in an unholy land.

1341
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:32,860
Sex, sex, sex, 30, 30, sex, sex, pay $30 and get six sex free.

1342
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:39,520
Pills, pills, pills, bop, bop, pilly, bop, pilly, bop, those lads, those lads, those lads,

1343
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:39,960
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,

1344
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,860
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,

1345
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,460
bop, bop, zip it, bop, bop, bop.

1346
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,020
Hey, you smoking?

1347
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,440
No, but the pipe is.

1348
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,360
Good.

1349
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:46,860
Good!

1350
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1351
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,040
It's a plot by the government.

1352
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,040
Yes, dear.

1353
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:05,660
Thank you.

1354
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,620
Apparently, Bob came and...

1355
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,960
did something with all of us.

1356
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:12,820
Stop.

1357
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,760
My mind is going.

1358
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:16,680
Stop.

1359
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,560
My mind is going.

1360
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,380
Stop.

1361
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,260
My mind is going.

1362
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,540
My mind is not my mind.

1363
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,680
One look at them will tell you more

1364
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,260
than a thousand words of mine.

1365
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,040
Bob.

1366
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,160
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1367
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,580
and we're even more glad that some listeners

1368
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,980
have donated enough to help us keep on going

1369
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,520
for another couple of months.

1370
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,960
Not just this show, but subgenius.com

1371
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,560
and all the other archive sites.

1372
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,040
But if you truly love Bob

1373
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,620
and want some of that slack back to rebound

1374
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,600
to you,

1375
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,480
you should go to subgenius.com

1376
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,040
front page or especially the radio page

1377
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,100
or the catalog store pages

1378
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:17,420
and help out financially as best you can.

1379
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,920
Now, we know what it's like

1380
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,800
to be on the brink of total poverty

1381
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,800
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1382
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,440
to make their own situations worse.

1383
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,420
But some of you still have jobs.

1384
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,740
Even five bucks makes a big difference

1385
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,720
even if it's only once a month

1386
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,280
from enough of you.

1387
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,660
Fifty bucks makes a big difference.

1388
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:36,740
Even a little bit of money

1389
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,720
makes an even bigger difference.

1390
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,000
All we're saying is that

1391
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,400
blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs

1392
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,460
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1393
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,700
We also take checks and money orders

1394
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,960
to subgenius foundation.

1395
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:57,280
P.O. Box 181417

1396
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:03,680
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1397
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,220
Thanks for anything you can do

1398
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,640
to help let there be slack.
