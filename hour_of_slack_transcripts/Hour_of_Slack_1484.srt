1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,300
Test.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,340
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,160
I don't hear you. I don't think anything's going out.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,820
Yeah, our mics are on.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,040
Test, test.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,160
Are we on?

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,980
We're on? Oh, okay.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,560
Okay.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,600
Okay.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:28,980
Okay.

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,220
Let this music do its thing.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,800
Music which only you can hear.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,820
Oh, there it is.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,540
Oh, there it is.

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,620
Yes, in the jungle, the subgenius jungle,

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,580
old C-Quar sleeps tonight.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,160
They're going at the bottom of the abyss.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,060
Let us hope that old C-Quar sleeps peacefully and stays asleep.

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,700
Ever since Baby Bear found that ring attached to her toe in the pond,

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,020
the mysterious ancient ring,

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,400
I've been worried about what slumbers may have been disturbed.

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,280
But...

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,580
But that's okay.

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,020
It's okay, because Ema Sumac is warbling in the background,

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,920
and we are opening up again this Pandora's box called

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,420
The Hour of Slack.

27
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,420
Well, I met Wisteria Campground in Caffeina's Cafe

28
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,840
under partly cloudy skies.

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,340
And...

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,800
With chance of odd precipitation.

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,980
But the conspiracy tried to scare us away

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,560
by predicting that we were going to be in a cave.

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,460
And we were predicting 190 degree temperatures,

34
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,500
and it's actually been pretty nice.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,840
Thanks to Wisteria Campground for making this weather possible.

36
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,820
Because I think they have some ends with weather control.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,780
And, of course, all the people who work at Caffeina's also.

38
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,560
The fine, fine folks at Caffeina's.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,980
You know, one of them, Reverend Beth, was a subgenius before.

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,740
Yes, so I understood.

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,140
So they need your appreciation.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,720
Not to mention your tips.

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,880
And you also, friends, have to follow the rules,

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,400
including no pets.

45
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,360
And I'm afraid we have to, before we really get going on the show,

46
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,980
we have some unpleasant administrative business

47
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,260
that we have to discuss.

48
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,800
We'll get that out of the way,

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,080
and then we'll get back to the fun and merriment.

50
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,200
But first, this is a rather...

51
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,740
Well, you'd better tell them to stay.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,740
Well, remember yesterday,

53
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,360
we mentioned that a subgenius couple

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,840
had smuggled their pet into the campground.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,880
It's against the rules.

56
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,480
I thought it was just a little shih tzu dog,

57
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,380
but it was a very expensive, annoying, purebred shih tzu.

58
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,060
Old, smelly.

59
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,560
Yeah, and it disappeared,

60
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,860
and they wanted people to look for it.

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,600
And, well, somebody found little snuckles.

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,360
Little...

63
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,720
This is what happens if you break the rules.

64
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,940
Break the rules and don't leave your pet at home,

65
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,420
but this is really gross.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,080
I don't know.

67
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,740
If anybody wants to look, you can.

68
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,000
Dr. Howell.

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,460
Yeah, there's some fragments left of the creature.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
That's all right.

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,980
It smells awful.

72
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,580
The thing is, the creature has been destroyed

73
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,140
with incredible violence.

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,760
It's a...

75
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,340
Yeah.

76
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,660
Yeah, there's something...

77
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,640
This dog wasn't just run over.

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,120
And it was found down behind one of the toilets

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,520
down the far end of the road.

80
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,700
And, I mean, if one of you people did this to that little dog,

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,040
not that I can imagine how you would do it,

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,520
it's...

83
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,400
That's more like a wild animal.

84
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,600
It's nothing but a bag of hair,

85
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,020
and I don't know if you could see it,

86
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,980
but it's nothing but bones.

87
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,820
It looks like hamburger bones and hair,

88
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
all scrambled up together.

89
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,580
And whatever...

90
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,740
Most unappetizing.

91
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,820
That was not human, even...

92
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
Or subgenius.

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,740
No subgenius would do that.

94
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,160
Even a...

95
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,320
Not even Susie the floozy,

96
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,740
the biggest dog hater in the church,

97
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,240
I don't think even she would do that.

98
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,340
I don't think she could do it, physically.

99
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,140
It's almost as if every cell in the creature's body

100
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,200
had exploded.

101
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,040
And there was no blood.

102
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,980
Hardly any blood.

103
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,120
Just guts.

104
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,560
And those pathetic little bones.

105
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,340
Yeah.

106
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,520
So, you know...

107
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,000
So, there you go.

108
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,000
If y'all have any more pets,

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,960
please keep them in your car,

110
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,380
take them home, do something.

111
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,560
Even if you think it right

112
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,080
to bring an iguana or a gecko,

113
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,620
that probably wouldn't go either.

114
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,640
Or a crow.

115
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,020
A crow?

116
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,560
I've seen crows at least.

117
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,380
Trained talking crows.

118
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,220
People bring crows here.

119
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:20,580
Yeah.

120
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,180
Especially during Starwood, eh?

121
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,740
Yeah.

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,620
Yeah.

123
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,040
Yeah, so...

124
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,560
And people...

125
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,560
We were hearing some pretty strange sounds.

126
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,480
People have reported hearing crashing noises

127
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,540
nearby in the woods at night.

128
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,060
Moody noises, as they're called.

129
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,800
And all that mole stampede the first day.

130
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,280
That was just creepy.

131
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,480
Yes.

132
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,920
Moles without honor.

133
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,960
Cowardly moles.

134
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,840
Now, I don't want to be alarmist or anything about this,

135
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,560
but I found some weird things.

136
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,020
Footprints.

137
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,760
Oh, right.

138
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,320
There's several of them around.

139
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,860
I can take you to see them.

140
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,240
They're kind of hard to get to.

141
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,340
Actually, there's some right behind here.

142
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,300
They're hard to get to.

143
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,580
There's, like...

144
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,000
There are bears occasionally that come through.

145
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
Small black bears.

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,060
And, of course, then there's the rake bears.

147
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,620
But this looks more like a three-toed,

148
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,600
a big ostrich or a...

149
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
Like, you know,

150
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,280
Susie had fake dinosaur tracks here last year.

151
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,120
She had these dinosaurs.

152
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,200
Or shoes stomping around in the mud.

153
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,940
They made for some nice pictures.

154
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,840
But this is different.

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,100
This is like a Tyrannosaurus Marlock or something.

156
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,500
It walks on its toes,

157
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,280
and not all the toes may be contacting the ground.

158
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,360
But there are some...

159
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,960
There's one by the power box at the grindhouse.

160
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
And there are some right behind here.

161
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,260
I assume this thing, whatever it is,

162
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,520
has been stealing food

163
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,340
and hangs around the kitchen.

164
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,360
Well, bears do that.

165
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,140
I have some photos of the tracks.

166
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,920
I even put a ruler next to them

167
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,060
to show how big they are.

168
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,760
Oh, that's good.

169
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,200
And I'll put those on Facebook

170
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,100
later this afternoon or tonight.

171
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,500
I guess on the 17X Day page.

172
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,460
Well, once it's on Facebook,

173
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,020
it'll be real, I suppose.

174
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,000
Right, yeah.

175
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,080
Once something's on Facebook,

176
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,060
then you can believe it.

177
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,280
By the way, I heard that there's already

178
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,540
an 18X Day page.

179
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,740
Is that a faithless damn gesture or what?

180
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,180
Reverend Pease.

181
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,040
Really?

182
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,240
Yes, the new guy.

183
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,500
The smart alecky.

184
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,100
The no-shift key, shiftless Reverend Pease

185
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,080
who makes fun of me.

186
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,800
He calls me, he always refers to me as

187
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,660
the smartest sacred scribe that we have.

188
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,940
Or the wisest sacred scribe that we have.

189
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,380
He always adds the that we have part.

190
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,380
To qualify it.

191
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,320
I said, that's not saying very much.

192
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,240
And he goes, yeah, I know.

193
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,200
He's the guy who also always wants to know

194
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
what is the official church canned chili,

195
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,020
the official church soft drink,

196
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,400
the official whatever.

197
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,120
You should refer him to Undersecretary Rocknar

198
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,580
for the answers to all these things.

199
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,180
Why should you be troubled?

200
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,800
Well, Rocknar would give a different answer.

201
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,140
He would say ale eight for the official soda pop.

202
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,180
And he can have that.

203
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,320
He can own that, as they say.

204
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,380
But you see, you can also get Rocknar

205
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,740
to give the answers that,

206
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,820
that he claims to be searching for.

207
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,200
Well, he told everybody that you needed

208
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
350 bucks to pay for your plane ticket.

209
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,660
I don't know where he got that number.

210
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,360
That's actually only about,

211
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,740
it's less than half of what it costs.

212
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,760
Maybe he's thinking of 35 bucks

213
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,440
and then a plane ticket must cost more.

214
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,020
So he adds a zero.

215
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,260
Well, the funny thing is,

216
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,060
somebody did what he said.

217
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,000
So go figure.

218
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,480
Well, that is indeed unusual.

219
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,640
It shows that miracles don't only occur on Christmas,

220
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,300
I suppose.

221
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,280
All right.

222
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,600
Well, what's the next item on the docket?

223
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,700
Why, the official church flavor of Spam,

224
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,480
which would, of course, be the new jalapeno Spam.

225
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,840
I don't know if y'all knew that Spam now comes

226
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,780
in different flavors.

227
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,420
Yes.

228
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,880
Spam comes in designer flavors now.

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,120
It's a new world.

230
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,040
It's a brave new world, and I love it.

231
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,500
I love the Spam, the jalapeno Spam,

232
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,020
the hot pepper.

233
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,360
Spam, the hickory flavored Spam.

234
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,600
Hot pepper Spam and jalapeno Spam are actually different.

235
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,120
That is a curious qualitative distinction.

236
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,980
And wait until the Scrapple Spam comes out.

237
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,820
Or is that like a contradiction in terms

238
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,340
or an impossibility?

239
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,500
Could you make cheaper meat than Scrapple Spam?

240
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,880
No doubt they've tried.

241
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,340
We'll be, the Scrapple will be served

242
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,760
at the,

243
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,180
at the,

244
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,920
at the official pancake,

245
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,580
the holy pancake feast,

246
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,520
which I think is Friday morning.

247
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,260
I believe so.

248
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,520
I, I,

249
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,120
who, who pays any attention to those schedules anyway?

250
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,800
You have one right over there, don't you?

251
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,080
Well, I had one, but every,

252
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,920
but you and Princess We keep having to borrow it.

253
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,560
Because nobody reads the schedules

254
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,400
that I work so hard on.

255
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,700
Well, I don't know what to say.

256
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,000
With a hard on.

257
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,640
I, I, it's, uh.

258
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,020
The pancakery and pancookery feast

259
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,740
at Caffeina's noon tomorrow.

260
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,980
And later today,

261
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,260
the socialist social,

262
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,080
sponsored by the good or something,

263
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,160
Mr. Sister.

264
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,560
Oh, well, that's nice.

265
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,820
All the left-leaning people like Mr. Sister

266
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,680
can get together and hash over the latest.

267
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,140
And drink Bloody Marys.

268
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,180
And we've got, uh,

269
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,240
there should be plenty of blood to go around by then

270
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,920
if any more pets get killed.

271
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,960
Pardon me, Princess We?

272
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,960
She's saying the pancakery occurs,

273
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,300
tomorrow.

274
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,660
Right, noon tomorrow.

275
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,320
And, uh,

276
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,500
yeah.

277
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,820
Yeah, so.

278
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,040
Then, uh.

279
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,680
Okay, that's been this hour of slack.

280
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,500
I think we're done.

281
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,020
We've talked about the spam, the scrapple.

282
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,920
Done already?

283
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,160
That's not all anybody cares about anymore.

284
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,720
Why, we are, I thought, hardly begun.

285
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,520
And now we've already concluded?

286
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,680
Oh, no, we can keep, we can keep, uh,

287
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,480
uh, flogging and spamming things.

288
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,580
The Grindhouse is now,

289
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,120
now open.

290
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,480
Thanks to Wisteria's mighty tarps

291
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,920
providing just enough shade.

292
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,300
And, uh, I went down there a little while ago

293
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,920
to photograph the monster, the tracks.

294
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,760
I don't want to use the word monster.

295
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,640
That's crazy.

296
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,420
But, you know, some, whatever those funny footprints are.

297
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,100
Probably a prank.

298
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,120
Yes, let's keep the monsters confined to the Grindhouse.

299
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,940
But the Grindhouse at 11 a.m.

300
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,420
Wait.

301
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,560
July 3rd.

302
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,260
Is that now?

303
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,880
I said the, the, Ed, Ed Wood.

304
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,520
A tribute to Ed Wood,

305
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,100
including some I've never seen.

306
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,100
Crossroads of Laredo

307
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,180
and the Sinister Urge.

308
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,460
And I woke up early the day I died.

309
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,680
That, that reminds me of, uh, Bob's Lunch Hour.

310
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,820
You have seen Night of the Ghouls, I assume.

311
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,460
Yes.

312
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,040
Um, and Bride of the Monster.

313
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,320
Also on the menu.

314
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,760
Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda.

315
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,060
Everybody's seen those ten times.

316
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,880
Plus the Mystery Science Theater version.

317
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,360
Well, you never know.

318
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,120
Sometimes things that you think everyone has seen,

319
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,420
somebody hasn't seen.

320
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,600
When I walked down there a little while ago,

321
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,480
there was one of those Warner Brothers travelogue cartoons

322
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,780
that had hilarious, uh, Indian, American Indian stuff

323
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,060
that would now be construed as racist.

324
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,520
But I have to admit, I laughed.

325
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,300
The gags and those things are always offered

326
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,840
at a sort of a slow, steady pace

327
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,500
instead of an accelerated pace.

328
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,940
Well, what, you know, every now and then,

329
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,660
uh, interviewers, you know, Fox News, CNN,

330
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,180
those kind of people ask me,

331
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,380
Reverend Stang, what are your influences

332
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,140
expecting to hear something sensible

333
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,780
like underground comics?

334
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,240
But really, I would have to say

335
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,460
the Warner Brothers and MGM cartoons

336
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,340
of the 50s and early 60s

337
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,280
were the biggest inspiration for me

338
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,900
to not kill myself as a child.

339
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,560
And for John, I'm John.

340
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,780
Fortunately, they showed them

341
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,380
in that narrow window

342
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,960
before I gave way to...

343
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,600
Just when you get home from school.

344
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,640
Or if you toddled down the stairs at 6 a.m.

345
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,160
to warm up the primitive TV

346
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,300
and watch the early couple of hours of cartoons.

347
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,600
Well, yeah, that's right.

348
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,540
Back in the day, televisions took almost as long

349
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,700
to boot up as computers do now.

350
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,780
That's right.

351
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,680
First, there'd be a tiny white dot

352
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,120
and then that would disappear.

353
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,580
Then suddenly the sound and picture

354
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,420
would crash onto the screen.

355
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,680
Okay, so who's going to be

356
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
our sacrifice up here today?

357
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,840
Is it just going to be Dr. Howell and me?

358
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,340
The Howell and Dr. Howell?

359
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,300
Well, we can just hold our position here for a while.

360
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,840
Sure.

361
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,280
And root on the ordeal before us.

362
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,280
The Bob Dobbs theme.

363
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,380
The task which we must all do.

364
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,400
This is the church's new Bob Dobbs theme.

365
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,580
The relentless forward march of Dobbs.

366
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,560
Sweeping everything before him

367
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,680
with his whirlwind pipe.

368
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,940
And selling everything he has destroyed as he goes.

369
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,340
Funny how that works.

370
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,240
Yes.

371
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,840
Other...

372
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,140
Not at a loss either.

373
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,560
Right.

374
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,500
At premium price.

375
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,720
He destroys things.

376
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,280
But Bob sells things to people,

377
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
then destroys them,

378
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,080
then sells them,

379
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,340
and sells the destroyed version to them again.

380
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,580
That works especially well in the art world.

381
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,620
Yes, where there is usefulness,

382
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,480
there is defrayed value.

383
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,720
Puzzling Evidence said it very early in the game.

384
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,720
He said, first you make the art,

385
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,040
then you destroy the art,

386
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,100
then you collect the insurance on the art.

387
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,500
And that's the way you make the money on the art.

388
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,540
Well, that explains his approach to compositing audio.

389
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,120
If only Vincent Van Gogh had known that.

390
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,840
Yes, well, these art types don't have heads for business,

391
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,520
as you know.

392
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,600
How easily they are misled.

393
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,420
Because all they want to do is create their paintings,

394
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,660
like Charles R. Knight,

395
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,800
who could never be bothered about money.

396
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,240
Is that so?

397
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,320
Yes.

398
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,120
So he was a subgenius too, I suppose.

399
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,080
I would say he was.

400
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,240
Or what some would call a talented idiot.

401
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,920
Well, he...

402
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,420
An idiot savant.

403
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:54,520
Yes.

404
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,740
Who could paint dinosaurs like nobody's business.

405
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,500
Could paint all animals.

406
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,580
But he forgot to ask for pay, right?

407
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,680
Well, he would get it.

408
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,880
He would ask for it.

409
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,380
They were poor, but he wouldn't...

410
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,900
That wouldn't be what he was concentrating on.

411
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,040
Sad to say.

412
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,600
Friends, if you're a subgenius artist or rock star

413
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,100
and nobody is willing to even look at your art

414
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,540
or download your horrible band,

415
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,420
just remember,

416
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,720
just remember Vincent Van Gogh,

417
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,600
whose merest scribble sells for millions now,

418
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,420
but he couldn't sell a single damn painting

419
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
during his lifetime.

420
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,820
So just remember that.

421
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,200
And then you won't be depressed at all, right?

422
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,360
Just remember, you'll be famous after you're dead.

423
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,360
Knight was engaged in...

424
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,020
It won't make any difference to us, friends.

425
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,300
See, we're still thinking small.

426
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,200
We're still thinking,

427
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,540
oh, X-Day's just a metaphor.

428
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:53,920
No!

429
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,660
It is real, and it could happen right now!

430
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,120
Well, that would be premature, but it is possible, sure.

431
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,860
It would save us a lot of trouble.

432
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,060
Yes, it happens when ye know at least, apparently.

433
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:06,860
Right.

434
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,700
In an hour that ye know not,

435
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,400
Bob cometh like a rapist in the night.

436
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,900
When ye know not thy right hand from thy left,

437
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,640
or thy elbow from an ass on the ground.

438
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,280
We're not supposed to make funny jokes about...

439
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,160
Rape, and it's not funny at all.

440
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,740
Oh, you were the one who did it.

441
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,320
Now you are the one who can condemn yourself for doing it.

442
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,560
Then when you watch a subgenius attempt,

443
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,400
then that's when it becomes sadly funny.

444
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,340
So...

445
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,060
Apparently.

446
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,200
There, yeah, apparently.

447
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,220
The gales of laughter are heard off screen,

448
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,100
or added in post.

449
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,780
You know, I keep hearing a phone ring.

450
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,640
Oh, I hear that all the time.

451
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:50,920
And I'm in headphones.

452
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,540
And I'm...

453
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,120
There's no phone...

454
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm hooked up to this thing.

455
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,760
No, no, no.

456
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,560
That is the psychic phone.

457
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,300
You have several calls coming from the astral plane.

458
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,180
They've been recorded on an automatic message system

459
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,200
which no one ever listens to for all eternity.

460
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,120
Is that the astral plane or the asshole plane?

461
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,420
I think that's where they come in for us.

462
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,840
Well, you know...

463
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,900
My message machine at home certainly is evidence of an asshole plane.

464
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,640
But you saw the...

465
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,640
Then there's the Asperger plane.

466
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,080
Why don't you come up here?

467
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,740
Put something pretty in between Hal and me.

468
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,520
Yes, that's right.

469
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,080
We did locate the human soul, remember, in the body, physically.

470
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:41,460
It's not far from those regions of the organism.

471
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,840
Organism.

472
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,660
Oh, oh, here.

473
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,620
First you have to pot Princess Wee up.

474
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,700
Organism.

475
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,880
There we go.

476
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,120
Organismus.

477
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,360
I love it when you say organism.

478
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,580
Princess Wee.

479
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,340
Organism.

480
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,580
It's from Ren in Ren and Stimpy.

481
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,020
Really?

482
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,780
Yes.

483
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,000
Said the word organism in this space madness episode.

484
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,600
Another proto-subgenius expression.

485
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,940
His lips wiggle after he finishes saying the word

486
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,200
to indicate that he's kind of turned on just by that word.

487
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,060
They're still vibrating from the passion and intensity of his declaration.

488
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:23,740
Yeah.

489
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,420
Yeah.

490
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:34,080
Ren and Stimpy led the way to the gross and snarky cartoons of today.

491
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,460
For a generation.

492
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,760
That was a really new thing.

493
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,160
When that show came along, that was boogers on children's TV.

494
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,620
Well, a year or two after Ren and Stimpy was a hit,

495
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,260
there's boogers on every kid's movie.

496
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,620
Pee-pee jokes.

497
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,740
Doo-doo jokes.

498
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,620
And we have Ren and Stimpy.

499
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,400
Pee-pee jokes.

500
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,100
And John Kay to thank for that.

501
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,040
I'm not sure.

502
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,400
I think they were following along in a societal stream.

503
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,580
I would trace the beginning of it to a Japanese children's book

504
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,960
called Everybody Poops, which was insanely popular.

505
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,680
Yes.

506
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,180
It began a publishing phenomenon.

507
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,000
Yes.

508
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,400
Yeah.

509
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,460
Yeah, that's true.

510
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,760
My grandkids have that book.

511
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,320
In fact, the Terry Pratchett book I'm reading

512
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,940
makes reference to that sort of children's book.

513
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,140
Yes.

514
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,440
There's a...

515
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,620
The hero...

516
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:23,620


517
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,800
The hero's little six-year-old son has an endless stream of books

518
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,180
like Wee, Wee, Wee, and, you know, the Poo-Poo Story.

519
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,120
Uh-huh.

520
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,320
Yeah, I missed out on all of that as a child.

521
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:36,560
Thank God.

522
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,580
They wouldn't...

523
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,740
That can really warp you.

524
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,680
Well, they would arrest a children's author

525
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,160
for using the word fart.

526
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,040
Jovial adult toilet humor.

527
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,660
Absolutely.

528
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,220
Baby Bear?

529
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,880
Yes.

530
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,140
I brought two of your...

531
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,820
I brought two of your books here printed out.

532
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,900
Because I've been always ready to read them myself.

533
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,900
I might have...

534
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,260
I might have printed them out for myself to read later.

535
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,700
Yeah, those two.

536
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,780
Don't sell yourself short in another untitled one.

537
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,680
I thought I'd give you the chance to do it instead of me.

538
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,220
You can work your way up to it.

539
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,680
You can even just come and sit right here right now and read them.

540
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,260
Or read one of them.

541
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,720
I'm not ready.

542
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,600
No, that's why I'm mad.

543
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:23,600


544
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,000
I mentioned it.

545
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:29,080
You can ready yourself up and spritz your throat with whatever the ranters use.

546
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,620
Lemon juice and whiskey.

547
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,060
I just use gravel.

548
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,940
Yeah, those ones are good.

549
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,620
Those ones are good.

550
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,300
Yeah.

551
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,560
You see, when people post something that I think is doctrinally correct and well written

552
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,940
on Scrub Junior or anywhere, I copy them and save them and most importantly, print them

553
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,380
out because otherwise they're just in the ocean of God's forgetfulness.

554
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,860
And hard to find unless you name the file just right.

555
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:07,020
Whereas I have a drawer in my desk filled with the next subgenius book, which will probably

556
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,020
be self-published.

557
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,020
But I've got at least a book's worth of great rants by everybody else.

558
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,460
All the new folks.

559
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,380
Because the old folks, as you can see by this show, we're just burnouts.

560
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,360
Do you have a ton of books?

561
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,160
Do you have a title in mind?

562
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,180
Too many Burning Mans, too many X-Days, too many Starwoods.

563
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,640
Do you have a title in mind?

564
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,580
Too many book rings.

565
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,960
Oh no, a title for the fourth?

566
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,760
For the new...

567
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,860
It would be the Fourth Testament.

568
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,560
The new book.

569
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,160
Oh, yeah.

570
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,660
Well...

571
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,860
We already did the Bobliagraphon and the Bobapocraphon and the...

572
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,880
The Cyclopedia of Slack.

573
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,140
Yeah.

574
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,380
Princess We came up with that spelling, by the way, of Cyclopedia.

575
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,200
I liked it.

576
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,200
Anyway.

577
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,560
Yeah.

578
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,120
So, our new contest.

579
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,580
What's the title of the next Subgenius book?

580
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,340
It also occurred to me that we haven't put together a Subgenius songs album in about

581
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,260
five years.

582
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,480
And there is a Bob's Song 7 ready to...

583
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,780
And I've used it as Narrow Slack, but it's missing stuff.

584
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,640
I don't think...

585
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,100
It's like Monkeyhive isn't on any official albums.

586
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,720
Because Monkeyhive was such a baby, just born yesterday.

587
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,100
We need a new...

588
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,120
I'm going to give to the band that dare not speak its name.

589
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,120
We need an editor to organize this material.

590
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,020
Oh, that's me, unfortunately.

591
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,340
Actually, Suds has created several new albums worth of compilations.

592
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,140
He's been playing...

593
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,180
Yes, they've been playing at this particular X Day.

594
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:46,060
Not that I want you to quit playing them, but those things drive me half nuts because

595
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:52,080
I have specific, very specific memories attached to every one of those separate albums.

596
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,400
I've got a couple of separate cuts.

597
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,980
There'll be one from 1983 and then one from 2013.

598
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,180
And then it's...

599
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:05,080
And I can remember what I was doing when I first heard it and who sent it to me and

600
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,900
why we're not friends anymore or whatever.

601
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,060
Just it's...

602
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,100
I may have mentioned this yesterday.

603
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,940
If y'all are...

604
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,080
If we're sitting around talking and I suddenly stare out into space, it's not because I'm

605
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,580
bored with you.

606
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,060
It's because I'm remembering something that I've never done before.

607
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,060


608
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,260
It's because I'm remembering something that's playing in the background.

609
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,760
Remember.

610
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,000
He can't escape his complicated past.

611
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:27,920
Right.

612
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,760
Is that what I said?

613
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,140
Yes.

614
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,260
It's what you said on Scrub.

615
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,000
Is that where I said it?

616
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,260
Yes.

617
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,240
Remember.

618
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,560
And if I've already said what I'm saying before every day for the last three days,

619
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,140
please forgive me.

620
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,200
There is nothing new on the show.

621
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,660
Because I'm getting to the point where I do that real bad.

622
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,920
My kids started saying this a long time ago.

623
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,000
Dad, you told us this yesterday.

624
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,900
Luckily, I catch my kids doing that too.

625
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,000
My dad's been telling me the same jokes every day when I'm around him.

626
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,460
But they're still funny because they're new to me every day.

627
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,700
I don't remember that I already heard them until I hear the punchline.

628
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,360
And then I go, oh, I should try to remember that.

629
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,940
That's funny.

630
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,640
But as you can tell, I'm not very good with jokes.

631
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,220
Sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and get it.

632
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,900
That happens with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

633
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,520
I don't get anything he does while the show's going on.

634
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,480
It sounds like nonsense to me.

635
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,780
But then when I listen back to the tape and I'm not in the process of trying to think of how to answer Dave,

636
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,700
I can actually understand it.

637
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,940
So maybe I should listen better.

638
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Yes, but it's hard to do on the fly.

639
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,680
Yeah.

640
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,300
Hal seems to be able to do it better than most people.

641
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,860
Well, yes.

642
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
But he's not engineering.

643
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,600
See, I'm having to run the volumes and all of that kind of crap.

644
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,660
Well, I'm used to listening to what's happening in the headphones when I have headphones.

645
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,420
The invisible...

646
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,580
Something is throwing things around.

647
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,660
The invisible man just arrived.

648
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,800
Or a poltergeist-like force.

649
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,020
He knocks everything down and pushes over people on bicycles and cackles.

650
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,720
I certainly hear cackling a lot.

651
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,340
Well, I don't hear it now.

652
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,200
Of course not.

653
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,540
Me?

654
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:21,820
Cackle?

655
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,280
You haven't gotten cackling yet.

656
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,120
Oh, no.

657
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,440
That's a bad sign, you know.

658
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,480
When witches start cackling, they're gone over the edge.

659
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,920
Cackling is the first sign of dementia in a witch.

660
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,620
They don't all cackle at first.

661
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,600
They cackle when they're pleased with what they've done.

662
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,460
St. Andrew the Impaled is in the house.

663
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,660
There he is, folks.

664
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,160
Yay!

665
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,020
What is he doing in such a nice car?

666
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,360
He's a family man, dear.

667
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,320
I know, but he must have turned to crime.

668
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,720
He must be embezzling from that real estate company.

669
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,100
He sold a house to tentatively a convenience.

670
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,240
I'm amazed that tentatively could buy it.

671
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,480
And tentatively a convenience is one of the weirdest subgeniuses ever.

672
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,180
He was more of a 1980s subgenius.

673
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,660
Still around.

674
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:17,060
He brought us in the news, world news for the first time, with an art project he did involving two decapitated dogs.

675
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,000
They were already decapitated.

676
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,720
They were decapitated by a train.

677
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,500
But he turned them into artwork and made the news.

678
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,140
And people all over the world read that the church's subgenius made artwork out of killing dogs.

679
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,880
Which is not true, even though I've got this handful of bones from that little shitsy dog.

680
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,320
We didn't kill it.

681
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,500
We didn't do that.

682
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,320
Tentatively was just beating them, I think.

683
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,500
Tentatively is just unthinkably bizarre guy.

684
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,980
He went for a year without washing as a social experiment.

685
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,340
He made a suit entirely made of zippers.

686
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,740
That's all it is.

687
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,680
Zippers sewed to zippers in a suit.

688
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:07,280
The first time you may ever encounter him would be in Arise where his head is covered in moustaches.

689
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:15,240
He has shaved his head so that all that remain is fur in the shape of moustaches all over his head.

690
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,520
Yeah, he's the guy in Arise going, Bob?

691
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,960
Bob?

692
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,240
Bob?

693
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,800
He also has a brain tattooed to his skull, I believe.

694
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,880
Yeah, you can't see because he has his hair thrown in now.

695
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,700
If he shaves his head you see a skull tattooed, a brain tattooed to his skull.

696
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,380
And I believe he has one purple and green eyebrow tattoo.

697
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,440
Which facial tattoos are, I don't know, they're kind of in your face.

698
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,240
Yes.

699
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,780
And he's older than I am.

700
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,320
That's right.

701
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:54,960
I'm sorry, if tentatively was taken in for emergency brain surgery and they shaved his head, they'd go, hey, our work's already done for us.

702
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,600
There's the brain.

703
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:03,620
Anyway, what I was getting around to is Andrew the Impaled, believe it or not, has a job and a secret identity.

704
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,320
And he was a real estate guy.

705
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:12,540
He had a client who was looking for a cheap but large house in Pittsburgh, but there's plenty of those there.

706
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:29,020
And he got a sense that this fellow he was shopping for houses for, he was driving around with the guy, he caused Andrew to kind of quiz the guy, have you ever heard of the Church of the Subgenius?

707
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,040
At which point tentatively chuckled, I'm sure.

708
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,840
He said, heard of it?

709
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,120
Hell, I put its diapers on back in the day.

710
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,220
Said, that was a, it's a small world.

711
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:53,660
You never know when the pink you're just about to kill because he was a jerky real estate guy might turn out to be a fellow subgenius as weird or weirder than you.

712
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,600
That's right.

713
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:03,960
In fact, both of those guys have managed to do quite a bit of damage to their own bodies in the name of slack, their slack.

714
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,120
Tentatively and Andrew?

715
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,660
Yeah.

716
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,200
Andrew, when he was working with his partner, David Apocalypse, who I hope is still alive.

717
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,340
I hope he'll show up and may be with Andrew.

718
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,000
They were in a sideshow act called Circus Apocalypse.

719
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:28,400
And at the climax of the show, David would sew Andrew's lips shut with surgical needles and thread.

720
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,080
He did it right.

721
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,380
It was all, you know, they disinfected everything.

722
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,860
He also did it with surgical precision.

723
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,780
But it wasn't a fake.

724
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:42,200
And I, somebody would pass out at every show, especially if I was filming it and projecting it on huge screens.

725
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,200


726
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,100
And we have a lot of closeups of Andrew.

727
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,160
Tears just roll down his clown face.

728
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,320
He'd wear clown makeup.

729
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,600
He'd be crying, crying clown, getting his lips sewn shut.

730
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,980
And afterwards, he just looked with these big sad eyes.

731
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,800
Our friend Father Joe Mama witnessed this once.

732
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,540
He walked up to Andrew and said, seems like that would kind of hurt.

733
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,940
And Andrew goes, not enough to come.

734
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:24,960
He actually told me now, not that this would make it hurt any less, but he told me that he had piercings along his lip that allowed the needle to go through.

735
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,700
Gromit.

736
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,160
He did.

737
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,000
That's what he told me.

738
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,240
Oh, see, I asked him about that and he wouldn't let on.

739
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,300
Next we're going to find out that the screwdriver that he shoves into his face is retractable.

740
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,100
It's collapsible.

741
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,640
Yeah.

742
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,840
I don't think so.

743
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,520
But he always has people feel it, you know.

744
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,020
I don't think so.

745
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,960
I wouldn't touch that.

746
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,720
I wouldn't want the audience to mess with it.

747
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:56,340
You know, that's how sword swallowers and people like that get harmed by inept audience members selected to come up and participate in the act.

748
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:06,460
And then if it happens while I'm there, I always feel vaguely guilty as if I had something to do with it or was responsible simply because I was there.

749
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,080
So that sort of act doesn't provide ease.

750
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,280
It's not that it's intended to.

751
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,220
No, it's certainly not.

752
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:20,140
It's intended to make you horrified and shocked and thrilled to see somebody else do something crazy.

753
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,400
Those guys would also juggle knives, throwing knives at each other.

754
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,500
And the point of this act was they weren't very good jugglers.

755
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,660
So you always got to see some blood.

756
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,980
They were a hard-working team, Circus Apocalypse.

757
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,500
Yes, they were.

758
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,060
And when we were in Amsterdam, who was the guy who was sticking the knife in his face?

759
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,680
He was sticking nails in his nose.

760
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,780
Crazy Jim or Crazy Sean.

761
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,960
Crazy Sean.

762
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,940
Crazy Sean.

763
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,680
That's right.

764
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,060
You can look up Crazy Sean on the interwebs.

765
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,600
He's very bloody all the time.

766
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,440
Yeah, Crazy Sean doesn't have much of a nose left, but I think that's because of cocaine.

767
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,880
Oh, I would think not after all of that, yes.

768
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,780
But, yeah, we've met some interesting performers over the years.

769
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,400
That's true.

770
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,040
Yes, other entrants in the freak show, which the Church of the Subgenius is just about to do.

771
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,200
There's one sad booth in the Tin in One.

772
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,480
We could probably...

773
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,300
Depending on your look, how you look at it, I suppose.

774
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,380
We could probably remake Freaks.

775
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,040
Right here.

776
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,740
Right here at this campground.

777
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,960
It wouldn't be that hard.

778
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,300
Jane isn't here.

779
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,460
Right.

780
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,800
See, I'm already starting to cast it.

781
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,260
It would be harder without Jane.

782
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,520
There he goes.

783
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,020
We might have to make some alterations to a few subgeniuses.

784
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,300
I think the only way to get the Caterpillar Man.

785
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,060
But 808 has always been a good sport.

786
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,320
He looked like you talk him into chopping his long ponytail off one time.

787
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,840
Maybe I can talk him into letting us chop his arms and legs off.

788
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,940
That's one variation of that story.

789
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:01,800
He can be the Caterpillar Man and Gigglepuss can be the acrobat who's the villainous.

790
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,540
Well, if you expect 808 to be able to whip up anything, any time out of anything, you better not take off his arms and legs.

791
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,100
I'll play the...

792
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,220
I'll play the cuckolded midget.

793
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,260
The poor little midget who everybody gets revenge for him.

794
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,440
What was his name? Hans?

795
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,180
Heinz.

796
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,080
Yeah, I got it.

797
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,860
Heinz?

798
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,040
That's a hard movie for some people to watch.

799
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,340
Because of the midget action, you mean?

800
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,920
People are unused to hearing them.

801
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,680
They don't really exist anymore.

802
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,440
Their voices are high and strange.

803
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,300
Hearing who?

804
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,360
Midgets.

805
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,100
Oh.

806
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:53,780
Now, the midget that recently escaped from the San Francisco City Jail was only some evildoer named Midget.

807
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,300
Was not an actual midget.

808
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,360
You see, there aren't really any midgets anymore in the developed world.

809
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:00,960
What?

810
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,360
Although there was once, as you may know, a city of midgets in Florida.

811
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,380
Why do you say there are no midgets anymore in the developed world?

812
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,360
I know several.

813
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,240
Well, they can fix them.

814
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,600
I'm not talking about dwarfs, but...

815
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,140
Oh, okay.

816
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:23,580
The actual midget, like Harry Earles in Freaks or Billy Barty or someone, is an endocrine condition that now they can cure.

817
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,720
They can fix it.

818
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,980
And unless you wanted a midget for some reason, and people generally don't, they can fix it.

819
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,360
It's quite different from a pituitary dwarf like...

820
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,140
Well, you know, that was what I...

821
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,060
...Eanor Dinklage on Game of Thrones.

822
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,800
I understand.

823
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,780
That was what I thought most of my life.

824
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,400
And then somebody convinced me that midgets and dwarfs were the same condition, but just different varieties.

825
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,140
And I foolishly believed them, evidently.

826
00:35:51,400 --> 00:36:03,260
But the dwarf of the kind that remains, that still is to be found, the little people that we see, is a pituitary condition, particularly.

827
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,240
Anyway, it's all Google.

828
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,120
You can read about...

829
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,280
I was going to say...

830
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,220
...animals and curiosities of medicine.

831
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,340
I've got a pretty decent collection of midget porn.

832
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,340
So it comes to that.

833
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:17,800
Doesn't everybody?

834
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,180
Those ladies aren't...

835
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,980
And fellers aren't old.

836
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,020
They're probably in their 20s.

837
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,380
Are they Americans?

838
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,640
Yes.

839
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,860
There's a really cute dwarf lady.

840
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,120
A dwarf...

841
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,560
I guess it's a dwarf and a midget.

842
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,460
We're talking about dwarfs again.

843
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,380
Not the same.

844
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,160
What's wrong...

845
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,460
Well, I think there's like one of each.

846
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,840
A midget...

847
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,640
And they have a hippie for a boyfriend.

848
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,680
...as long as we must continue with the subject.

849
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,600
And they share the hippie boyfriend.

850
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,660
Fully proportioned.

851
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:48,840
And I'm jealous.

852
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,960
But just small.

853
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,860
A miniature.

854
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,220
Just like a miniature breed of any creature.

855
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,860
It is the same, but small.

856
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,880
A dwarf, on the other hand, has disproportionate reduction of the limbs.

857
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,960
And the head is the same size as the adult.

858
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,880
Echo bad as a midget?

859
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,100
Generally with a protruding forehead.

860
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,260
And what is our friend Jane?

861
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,320
She's a dwarf plus a whole bunch of other conditions.

862
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,280
And here is the documentary about Jane Hash.

863
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,800
Are we going to sell it at the subgenius auction?

864
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,600
Blame Jane, the shockumentary.

865
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,160
Yeah, it's in the Buldada auction.

866
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,500
And it's actually very well done.

867
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,280
And by the end of it, you'll want to party with Jane.

868
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,280
And you can, too, actually.

869
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,560
What, there's a special app on you?

870
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:41,660
She'll probably be at Starwood.

871
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,800
No, she won't be at this year's Starwood.

872
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,280
It was very difficult for her last year here because the grounds are so difficult for a wheelchair.

873
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,440
So she probably won't be back.

874
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,600
When they're wet and mucky, it's hard to get about.

875
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:54,780
It depends.

876
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,800
But we might mention that we're always ready to have things donated for the Buldada auction.

877
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:09,780
If anyone has anything, remember, this is the place to send those things to make it the most memorable Buldada auction ever.

878
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,020
Though that would be difficult by this point.

879
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:21,640
If anybody has any spare dwarfs or midgets, I'd like to start a collection.

880
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,080
That was what royalty used to do that in the olden days.

881
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,600
Kings would collect dwarfs, except for Peter the Great of Russia, who collected giants.

882
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:36,580
He would trade his court dwarfs for other kings' giants.

883
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,760
And the reason was Peter the Great was named that because he was really tall.

884
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,280
He was almost a giant himself.

885
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,380
He was 6'6", which in those days was real big.

886
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,520
So he liked to have giants around that made him look a little more normal.

887
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,300
How about those giants, huh?

888
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,520
How about those giants?

889
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,580
A nice name.

890
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:00,580


891
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,160
I think we're getting a submission for the auction, perhaps.

892
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,440
Dark Adventures Radio Theater.

893
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,600
The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society.

894
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:19,700
Here, you have to hold that up to his face when he does that.

895
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,300
The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society.

896
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:29,480
They produce radio shows based on Lovecraft's stories.

897
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,320
They've also done one of the best film adaptations I've ever seen of Lovecraft.

898
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,580
Oh, did they do that black and white amateur movie?

899
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,320
They did The Call of Cthulhu.

900
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,300
And they did it in the style of old silent film, like from the time when the story was written.

901
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,600
And it's probably about the most accurate Lovecraft story that's ever been put to film.

902
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,160
Yeah.

903
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:57,140
They did a great job of filming in their backyard boats going between the icebergs and cyclopean landscapes.

904
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:57,860
Yeah.

905
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,780
That's the way to do it.

906
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,760
Have you seen that film?

907
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,600
No, I haven't.

908
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,140
It's damn good.

909
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,500
Yeah.

910
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,200
It's called The Call of Cthulhu?

911
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,220
It's The Call of Cthulhu by the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society.

912
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,420
Right.

913
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,560
Made by all amateurs and basically in garages and backyards.

914
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,740
I mean, you can tell that it's stylized.

915
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,000
It's almost like having a Dr. Caligari.

916
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,320
I've seen the title card, which is very well done and in period.

917
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,720
Yeah, it's very well made.

918
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,680
It looks like a silent movie title.

919
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,400
But this is the complete series of radio programs that they did.

920
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:39,000
It's The Mountains of Madness, The Reanimator, Call of Cthulhu, Color Out of Space, Shadow Over Innsmouth.

921
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:47,440
The fact that there are now plush dolls of Cthulhu, does that mean that someday there will be plush dolls of Bob?

922
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,120
It might be.

923
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,460
You might be interested in these, Sud, since we're on Lovecraft.

924
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,660
Papa Joe Mama makes trading cards on the ship.

925
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,940
And he has just finished a new...

926
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,060
Oh.

927
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,800
Hold on.

928
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,020
What's going on?

929
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,800
What's this?

930
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,840
I'm so sorry, but we have to tell this story.

931
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,360
Wisteria would not listen to us.

932
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,180
All right, now please be calm.

933
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,540
What's going on?

934
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,840
Please simply be calm and relate this story in a calm manner.

935
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,400
Oh, brethren.

936
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,640
We drove off.

937
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,340
We drove off to the shower house last night.

938
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,820
Commandable.

939
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,600
Hygienic.

940
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,300
Yeah, we were too tired to walk, I admit.

941
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,480
But we were enjoying the crescent moon in the sky.

942
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,040
And we were sitting in the car before taking our showers.

943
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,060
And, well, we got caught up in a moment.

944
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,520
It was a passionate moment.

945
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,400
And one moment led to several other moments.

946
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,920
And the car was rocking in the moment of passion.

947
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,180
I can't say.

948
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,520
What happened next?

949
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,060
What happened?

950
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,620
Well, there's no need to be too confessional here.

951
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,540
Did rednecks attack you or something?

952
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,880
You know, in this sort of the afterglow moment, we realized the car still was rocking.

953
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,600
Good Lord.

954
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,860
There was...

955
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,260
Wait a minute.

956
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,160
Nobody came a-knocking, but the car was still rocking?

957
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,660
No, it was still rocking.

958
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,940
A localized earth tremor.

959
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,260
Our car.

960
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,200
It was horrible.

961
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:25,900
Well, I'm sorry.

962
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


963
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


964
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


965
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


966
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


967
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


968
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


969
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


970
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


971
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


972
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


973
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


974
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


975
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900


976
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,140
I'm sorry.

977
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:27,880
I'm sorry.

978
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,400
I'm sorry.

979
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,420
That was just...

980
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:28,780
The creature.

981
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,780
I think it was...

982
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:37,020
We could not see it clearly, but there was some hominid form, I think, raping my Camry.

983
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,000
I've only had that car for a short while.

984
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,540
It was raving.

985
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,160
He was raping the car.

986
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,560
Are you saying you claim to have seen some sort of monster?

987
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,200
What?

988
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,440
What?

989
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,900
It was...

990
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,060
It was...

991
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,420
Just, like, dubs.

992
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,040
It was just...

993
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,520
The gas tank hold things.

994
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:54,520


995
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,480
the gas...

996
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,120
Wow.

997
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,020
It was all mangled?

998
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,940
Did I improve the mileage?

999
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,520
I shouldn't be making jokes.

1000
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:02,880
I didn't feel...

1001
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,980
You guys are obviously pretty shook up.

1002
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,300
A creature.

1003
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,020
I can say with all honesty,

1004
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,140
she did not sleep at all last night.

1005
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,960
Boy, you know, that little dog got killed?

1006
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,700
You didn't get a chance to see this so-called monster's feet, did you?

1007
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,020
I did not, no.

1008
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,820
But it had to have been big enough to lift up and rock a four-door Toyota.

1009
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:28,760
Hmm.

1010
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,840
The center of gravity may have been high.

1011
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,700
Or somebody may have been.

1012
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,420
And we tried to tell the folks here at Wisteria,

1013
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,160
and they did not want to listen.

1014
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,620
We knew you would,

1015
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,740
and you would tell the truth to those who need to hear.

1016
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,180
All right.

1017
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,440
I've about had it with you crazy kids

1018
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,080
trying to prank the pranksters

1019
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,000
and have fun.

1020
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,620
I've had fun with the subgenius.

1021
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,020
We're no...

1022
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,760
Hey, I'm no kid.

1023
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,740
Maybe at heart.

1024
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,760
Well, we're all in the subgenius youth program together.

1025
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,160
Doctor Howie thought that you're the scientist.

1026
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,680
You would figure it out.

1027
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,840
Well, but where's your evidence?

1028
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,960
Where's your data?

1029
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,160
Where's your hard...

1030
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,140
Anyway, we will look into it.

1031
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,100
So you say you think you saw some sort of monster?

1032
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:23,560
It was big.

1033
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,840
It was a monster.

1034
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,140
It was.

1035
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,880
By comparison.

1036
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,960
Somewhere between here and the shower house.

1037
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,100
You will find evidence.

1038
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,560
I've known these kids a long time.

1039
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,340
Sure, they might have been drinking or something,

1040
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,080
but I don't think they'd just come up with a stunt like this.

1041
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,860
I've heard it had nothing to do with this.

1042
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,420
This is pretty serious.

1043
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,660
Well, it's your call, Sheriff Stang.

1044
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,100
I think you should interview Reverend Pickles as well,

1045
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,600
because...

1046
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,580
Oh, Pickles, eh?

1047
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,100
And Pickles?

1048
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,520
Pickles?

1049
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,120
Another one of these troublemakers.

1050
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,700
Came in yesterday at the gate.

1051
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,460
They asked to see his driver's license,

1052
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,700
and when he asked why, they said,

1053
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,640
in case you hurt any animals.

1054
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,060
So they know something is out there.

1055
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,360
They were here?

1056
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:07,960
Yeah.

1057
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,500
So a cover-up, maybe.

1058
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,800
If ever there was a cover-up.

1059
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,380
I'm going to have to talk to the Wisteria staff about this.

1060
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,760
You know, because the authorities, if there really is...

1061
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,640
I mean, look, I...

1062
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,400
Wisteria kind of rhymes with Wisteria.

1063
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,640
You know, the problem is...

1064
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:21,960
Yes.

1065
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:21,960


1066
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,060
Yes.

1067
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,080
Yes.

1068
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,080


1069
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,080


1070
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,080


1071
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,080


1072
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,080


1073
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,140
The cops, they go, yeah, church is a subgenius.

1074
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,500
They're always talking about monsters and UFOs

1075
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,740
and the world's going to end tomorrow.

1076
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:29,680
Lose ends.

1077
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,880
They're not going to listen to us.

1078
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,900
But that certainly would tie in with what happened

1079
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,860
to the couple's dog, Scruggles, or whatever its name was.

1080
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,100
Snuggle.

1081
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,160
They left, by the way.

1082
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,780
They took off.

1083
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,240
They were so distraught from what happened to their dog.

1084
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,100
Yes, it was terrible.

1085
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,820
Terrible.

1086
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,920
But we have their money.

1087
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,320
The dog that was...

1088
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,940
Oh, you want to see what's left?

1089
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,200
The dog that was left of the dog?

1090
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,520
Put those remains away.

1091
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,160
Go ahead.

1092
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,280
Take a good look.

1093
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,400
That used to be a very valuable and annoying shih tzu puppy.

1094
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,180
It was at death's door to begin with.

1095
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:04,500
Oh, God.

1096
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,900
It was trembling with age and palsied with eld to begin with.

1097
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,220
Well, everybody hated it.

1098
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,520
I'm glad it's dead, frankly.

1099
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,920
But no animal should have to go like that.

1100
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,880
That was hard.

1101
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,640
Just talking about something out of H.P. Lovecraft.

1102
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,320
A long and satisfying life.

1103
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:20,980
Yes, in fact.

1104
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:21,640
Thanks, folks.

1105
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:21,720
Lovecraft.

1106
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,760
Robin did describe the death of dogs in...

1107
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:32,260
Well, I hope you guys aren't going to let this affect your stay here next day.

1108
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,180
But keep your car locked by all means.

1109
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,520
Go forth and multiply, divide, add, and subtract.

1110
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:43,580
I wonder if there's any, like, fluid samples in the car.

1111
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,980
Now you've got staying going.

1112
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,500
In the gas tank.

1113
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,960
Well, you say it's in the...

1114
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,840
It was making...

1115
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,780
Having its way with the gas.

1116
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:50,980
Hmm.

1117
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,660
How about the...

1118
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,500
Tiger in the tank.

1119
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,220
The exhaust pipe.

1120
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,320
I did not...

1121
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,980
There might have been some kind of device over the...

1122
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,560
Like a catalytic converter thing or something?

1123
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,080
No, more like a condom.

1124
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,260
On the exhaust?

1125
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,460
Yeah, on the exhaust pipe.

1126
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,980
Because it was not making its typical sound when I returned.

1127
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,140
But the vehicle seems to run all right.

1128
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,160
Though traumatized.

1129
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,300
It was sputtering a bit, yes.

1130
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:14,660
Uh-huh.

1131
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,640
Didn't want to start up right away.

1132
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,300
This is just all too weird.

1133
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,860
That is really...

1134
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Well, thanks for your...

1135
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,560
Very strange.

1136
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,620
How do you handle something like that when you're having an end-of-the-world cult festival?

1137
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,540
You know, how do you get the authorities to take you seriously?

1138
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,860
We're going to have to see.

1139
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,600
Maybe Wisteria knows more about this than we've been told.

1140
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,780
Yeah, if they said something to Pickles...

1141
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:41,660
You know, because if word of some kind of murderous thing got out...

1142
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,340
Hey, wait a minute.

1143
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,700
You know, I just thought of something else.

1144
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,000
What's that?

1145
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,880
Nobody's seen Dr. Legume, right?

1146
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,300
No.

1147
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,640
Doesn't this all sound like...

1148
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,780
Doesn't this sound like the kind of thing...

1149
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,220
Well, I don't want to accuse anybody.

1150
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,120
He tramples little dogs and turns them inside out.

1151
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,300
But, you know, with the stories of old Sequa, you know,

1152
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:07,040
and the guy with the golden hook on his arm that lived around here...

1153
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,600
Old Sequa leaves drag marks and gel tracks and so forth.

1154
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:12,960
Right, right.

1155
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,960
Old Sequa wouldn't be able to do that to that dog.

1156
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,600
He would just swallow it.

1157
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,700
No, just snap it up.

1158
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,460
It was more like this thing.

1159
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,040
It had been...

1160
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,920
I just...

1161
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,680
I can't even...

1162
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,140
I mean, it's...

1163
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:31,260
As if the cells had exploded from the inside out and the bones had been disarticulated and pulverized.

1164
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,000
Almost like it had been microwaved.

1165
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,540
Well, we just have to hope that nothing else happens.

1166
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,020
Although, you know, it would be great...

1167
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,080
Isn't that enough?

1168
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,040
Is it Reverend Bastard around here?

1169
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,520
No good.

1170
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,440
Yeah, he's no good.

1171
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,940
Remember that asshole last year?

1172
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,400
Reverend Bastard.

1173
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,940
Well, he was trying to get...

1174
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,540
We try not to...

1175
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:51,560
We try not to...

1176
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:51,560


1177
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,380
He was trying to get in.

1178
00:48:53,780 --> 00:49:01,560
And somebody said they saw him this morning pass out standing against a tree, sleeping,

1179
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,260
with his head against a tree, asleep.

1180
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,600
That's a good trick.

1181
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,620
So, maybe we can use him for bait.

1182
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,280
That would be cool.

1183
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,520
He may not want to lie down with the ants, the Emmets, and the Pismires of the ground.

1184
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,940
Man, all I know is this is one weird campground.

1185
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,760
You're telling me.

1186
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,880
This is one weird bunch of people.

1187
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,460
It is.

1188
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,080
Frankly.

1189
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,880
But, you know, we've said, exploit your abnormality.

1190
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,080
That's a compliment here.

1191
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:29,800
Yes.

1192
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,800
Be weird.

1193
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,260
Really.

1194
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:37,660
Indulge your weirdness, your fetishes, your perversions, because that's what makes you you.

1195
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:44,860
What if your idea of slack is turning a little expensive shih tzu dog inside out?

1196
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,000
Is that still cool?

1197
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,640
I'm surprised anyone has the energy for such an elaborate...

1198
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,380
...procedure.

1199
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:52,820
Hmm.

1200
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:58,580
Well, like I say, I don't think that a person could do a thing like that.

1201
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,020
What was that, Fightsy Taj?

1202
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:05,120
Maybe it was done by one of those weapons from Machete Kills last night.

1203
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,740
Maybe it was done by one of the weapons from Machete Kills last night.

1204
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,860
Specialized weapons.

1205
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,360
They did turn people inside out, you may remember.

1206
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,240
Oh, is that what was going on?

1207
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:15,540
Okay.

1208
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:16,620
Yeah.

1209
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,480
Yeah, I heard him say that in that line.

1210
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:18,760
Wow.

1211
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,000
What a coincidence.

1212
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,020
It was dope.

1213
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,160
They had a movie where we had weapons that turned people inside out, and then there's

1214
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,600
this dog turned inside out.

1215
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:35,500
And in the same movie, cult dupes got into a spaceship to take off at an apocalyptic event.

1216
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,380
Coincidence or conspiracy?

1217
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,000
Coincidence or ellipsis?

1218
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,280
Something like that.

1219
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:43,400
Dog, dog, dog.

1220
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,380
Pre-figuring.

1221
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:45,860
Man.

1222
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,240
Yeah, sometimes life imitates art, I guess.

1223
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,320
All the time.

1224
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,080
An endless serpent chasing its tail.

1225
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,320
Like that one hour of Slack fan.

1226
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:57,900
An aerobarist.

1227
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,040
Well, he was more of a Puzzling Evidence fan.

1228
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,320
Paul Elliott, that kid that shot up all those people in California.

1229
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,560
When did that happen?

1230
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,320
He said he was inspired by your show.

1231
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,300
I don't remember that.

1232
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,400
He was the kid who videotaped himself going, all the normal people and the handsome and

1233
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,240
attractive people that get to have sex and have relationships.

1234
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,040
And I am so cool.

1235
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:19,600
But yet.

1236
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,080
I've never even been kissed by a girl.

1237
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,360
Oh, and on the day of retribution, I shall make them pay.

1238
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,040
Oh, yes.

1239
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,100
He looked to sound like, you know what I'm talking about.

1240
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:35,540
That last month's mass killer crazy guy.

1241
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,680
Yes, but that was no subgenius.

1242
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,480
No, he was the worst kind of Bobby, you know, who takes this stuff at face value and goes,

1243
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,960
ah, normals are all bad.

1244
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,100
I'm going to go kill them all.

1245
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,840
It's like that guy was the most normal.

1246
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:53,340
He's like a, he'd be a, he'd be a reject from churches.

1247
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:59,000
If he showed up on any of our forums, he'd be the butthurt guy that leaves after two

1248
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,440
minutes.

1249
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,280
As soon as somebody questions his spelling or something.

1250
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,620
So you guys ought to be more careful about what you say on your radio show, because I

1251
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:13,360
think you're inspiring all kinds of deadly crazed killers out there in California on

1252
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,320
the West coast.

1253
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,120
I don't have the bleepers post on that show.

1254
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,820
Only on my own.

1255
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,100
People are much more stable here in the Midwest.

1256
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,240
Well, so you say.

1257
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:23,960
Except maybe for Michigan.

1258
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,480
Yes.

1259
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,480
So you say.

1260
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:30,420
We'll see how stable it all is.

1261
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,340
This is Ohio.

1262
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,380
Crazy stuff doesn't happen here.

1263
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,760
When push comes to shove.

1264
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,420
You got to go over to Mount Point, is it Point Pleasant over in West Virginia to see the

1265
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,120
crazy stuff.

1266
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,680
Don't you occasionally experience localized earth tremors?

1267
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,680
No.

1268
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,220
We do.

1269
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,820
They're, they say that they're causing a lot of trouble.

1270
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:48,820


1271
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:48,820


1272
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:48,820


1273
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,460
They're caused by our local nuclear plants.

1274
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,540
I thought that was indigestion.

1275
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,180
No dear.

1276
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:00,540
There have been actual earthquakes in Northeastern Ohio.

1277
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,700
Earth movement.

1278
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,540
Well, that can't happen.

1279
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,520
There's a nuclear power plant out there.

1280
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,400
That Perry power plant.

1281
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,500
They can't have an earth place.

1282
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,860
That's why we have the earthquakes.

1283
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:09,580
That would be crazy.

1284
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,520
That'd be like building nuclear plants right in the middle of fault lines.

1285
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,600
The power plants cause the earthquakes.

1286
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,360
Speaking of West Virginia.

1287
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,780
Now say what?

1288
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,940
Speaking of West Virginia.

1289
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:17,720
Yeah.

1290
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:18,760
Wow.

1291
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:18,820


1292
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:18,820


1293
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,880
I stopped on the way here.

1294
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,760
I stopped for gas and they had this magazine on sale at the gas station.

1295
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,820
Who's in jail?

1296
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,100
Who's in jail magazine?

1297
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,140
Who's in jail?

1298
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,320
It's got pictures of the mug shots and everything.

1299
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,120
Oh, those are great.

1300
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,360
Yeah.

1301
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,660
I buy those every day on them because they're kind of humorous.

1302
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:41,140
The last time I bought one, the guy behind the counter said, sir, you know, that's not

1303
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,140
exactly news.

1304
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,440
And I said, I know, I know.

1305
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,620
I got to get it because it's funny.

1306
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,740
Actually, I told him, well, I wanted to see if my friends were in here.

1307
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,840
And sure enough, there was old Reverend Funny Man.

1308
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,680
I just thought, I meant to mention that yesterday when I was up here, but I forgot about it.

1309
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,100
How interesting.

1310
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,340
You know, back home, we just got the guy to, you know, bite goats in the lawn and stuff

1311
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:03,560
like that.

1312
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,760
There's some communities or there's some magazine company that just prints mug shots for different

1313
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,220
cities.

1314
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:16,200
There's like a Dallas version and a Houston version and a Cleveland version and so forth.

1315
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,180
I guess there's a, you know, Podunk.

1316
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:18,500
Yeah.

1317
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:18,700


1318
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:18,720
Yeah.

1319
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:18,720


1320
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:18,720


1321
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:18,720


1322
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,300
West Virginia.

1323
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,300
Why not?

1324
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,580
Well, I thought that was quite interesting.

1325
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,520
I almost picked it up.

1326
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,760
I have to watch my finances on this trip.

1327
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:25,880
Yeah.

1328
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,060
It's so that criminals can laugh at other criminals.

1329
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,280
Who's in, who's out.

1330
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,080
That's why I bought it.

1331
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:31,940
What's my crime?

1332
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,400
It's like your family reunion newsletter, you know?

1333
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,240
Right.

1334
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:39,180
But it'd be more like your family reunion newsletter from what you've told us of your

1335
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:39,540
family.

1336
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,340
It'd probably be true.

1337
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,800
Hey, wait a minute.

1338
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,960
You didn't bring that brother of yours here.

1339
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,160
No, no, no, no.

1340
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,280
Because that would explain everything.

1341
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,060
Yeah, it would.

1342
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:46,680
That would explain everything.

1343
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,720
I got him chained down in the basin with the Mormon newspaper.

1344
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,160
Missionaries.

1345
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,760
Yeah.

1346
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,920
You know, like, Ian had a weird relative that was chained up in his home.

1347
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:55,640
Well, yeah.

1348
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,140
Really did.

1349
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,380
Jane Eyre style.

1350
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:58,920
Wow.

1351
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,900
Well, mystery upon mystery.

1352
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:08,660
It gets thicker and deeper like bullshit often does.

1353
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,940
Like oily ooze from the bottom of time.

1354
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,540
You want to hear my David Black imitation?

1355
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,960
Yeah, I think this is just the time for it.

1356
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,760
That's bullshit!

1357
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,480
Yeah.

1358
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,180
That's a bunch of bullshit!

1359
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,080
That's my David Black imitation.

1360
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:23,740
It's all dead.

1361
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,820
Former so-called Pope Black.

1362
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,100
Yeah.

1363
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:26,800
Yes.

1364
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,300
He was defrocked and we made a little German dog Pope of all Europe instead.

1365
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:31,860
Instead.

1366
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,380
I wonder, I bet Pope Pedro is gone by now.

1367
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,040
Probably.

1368
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,200
He was really old.

1369
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:37,820
He also was old.

1370
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,520
Old, I tell you.

1371
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,320
Hey, wait a minute.

1372
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,900
I know of another ageless animal we could make Pope of all something.

1373
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,000
Your newt.

1374
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,820
Princess Wee has a newt that I swear.

1375
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:54,800
On a stack of Book of the Subgeniuses is at least, what did he figure, 37 years old?

1376
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,080
He's about 37 now.

1377
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,060
But we don't know how old he was when she got him at the pet store.

1378
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,400
This thing, I mean, newts aren't supposed to live more than about 10 years.

1379
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,100
This thing's only this long.

1380
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,740
It's like three inches long.

1381
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,060
It's the oldest thing around.

1382
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,660
Easy to maintain.

1383
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:11,940
Right.

1384
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,720
Yes, he just eats a little nugget of, what are those things?

1385
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:16,880
Brine shrimp.

1386
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,660
Brine shrimp each day.

1387
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:18,820
Brine shrimp each day.

1388
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:19,400
That's it.

1389
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:27,780
Yeah, and we decided that he was being kept alive by frop particulate matter in the air.

1390
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,940
And orgasmic radiation.

1391
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,480
It could just be.

1392
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:33,840
So.

1393
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:38,640
But it might also be lasting and lasting because he's not too complicated.

1394
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:44,940
So he's easy to maintain and repair his little cells and keep his little metabolism going.

1395
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,800
He's not hundreds of miles of tubes.

1396
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,020
And giant hearts and body heat and so on.

1397
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,760
He's just this little blob that sits there and.

1398
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,920
And sheds his skin all the time.

1399
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,900
So he's constantly renewing himself.

1400
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:58,680
Yeah.

1401
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:02,720
He sheds his skin and then he eats his skin after he sheds it.

1402
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,640
That's parsimonious with protein.

1403
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,520
I've heard that Bob does that.

1404
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,740
That JR Bob does.

1405
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,240
And it's a big meal.

1406
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,580
You know, skin is the biggest organ on your body.

1407
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,640
Bob sheds his skin and then eats it.

1408
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,520
And that's why he looks so young.

1409
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,180
All the time.

1410
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,200
I mean, he's got to be in his eighties and yet look at him.

1411
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,920
You know, the earth does like a snake renew its winter weeds out one.

1412
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,980
I'm going to do something amazing for the first time.

1413
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,080
This is a historical thing.

1414
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,000
Reverend Spike.

1415
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,720
I remembered your name this time.

1416
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,480
Bum bum bum.

1417
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:35,960
Yeah.

1418
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,300
Yeah.

1419
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:36,860
Yeah.

1420
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,380
Yeah.

1421
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:37,820
Yeah.

1422
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,040
Yeah.

1423
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,440
Finally.

1424
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,600
Well, there you go.

1425
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,380
Reverend fight.

1426
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:46,020
See, Todd had to tell me four x rays in a row where his name came from.

1427
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,600
And each time it was like the first.

1428
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,360
After the fourth time it stuck.

1429
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,080
We finally got it.

1430
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,880
In case you don't know it's the, it is, it spells out.

1431
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,300
Fuck them.

1432
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,420
If they can't take a joke.

1433
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,640
It's one of those things like the one three Oh one three.

1434
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,820
It's sometimes takes people years to see why that is special.

1435
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:14,020
And every month or so, somebody catches on that.

1436
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,920
Her name.

1437
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,360
We are dough kind of says.

1438
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,420
Weirdo.

1439
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,100
No.

1440
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,240
Yeah.

1441
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:20,780
Wow.

1442
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,400
I.

1443
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:23,960
What it took.

1444
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,360
Some people don't notice that right off the bat.

1445
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,680
There's quotes on the R like in toys are us.

1446
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,760
And officially the R is reversed.

1447
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,940
Well, now it's getting complicated.

1448
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,060
Yeah, that's.

1449
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:35,640
Yeah, that was.

1450
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,800
You can't hear the background.

1451
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,800
I mean, the front ways and sideways of the orthography.

1452
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,100
What?

1453
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,220
A Mavridis reversed the R.

1454
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,200
Yes.

1455
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,180
As in toys are us.

1456
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,340
Yes.

1457
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,420
Oh, we are.

1458
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,740
But with the R backwards.

1459
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:51,260
Yeah.

1460
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,280
Nothing is good enough.

1461
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,660
That was a Palmer addition.

1462
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,140
Yes.

1463
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,780
Nothing is good enough until Paul has fixed it.

1464
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,520
There is an illustration, folks.

1465
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,820
Right then and there.

1466
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,640
So genius process.

1467
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,740
What is this music?

1468
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,260
Glorious climax of this part of the show.

1469
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,200
Thank you.

1470
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,020
Thank you very much.

1471
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,560
Hey, that actually that is an hour.

1472
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,160
It's exactly an hour on this recorder.

1473
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,900
It when I look down, I'm not I poop you not.

1474
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,940
I look down and it said one.

1475
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1476
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,020
And then it changed to one.

1477
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,120
Oh, oh, oh, one.

1478
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:36,740
And that's my cue to stop and then start this again.

1479
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:41,880
I'll be able to make a CD copy because it won't be two hours long like yesterday.

1480
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,920
And so I'm stopping now.

1481
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,620
Don't say anything.

1482
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,440
No, no, no.
