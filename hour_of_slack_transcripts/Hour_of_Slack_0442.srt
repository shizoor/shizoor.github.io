1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
What the hell do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,720
Dragging your butt through the day, selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,160
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them?

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,080
Tired of getting all of the guilt, but none of the sex?

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,180
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,020
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:29,420
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master in his church of the subgenius.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:41,120
For Bob comes to justify our sins, to unmask the conspiracy, and to get us back the slack they stole away.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,980
It's us versus them.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Are you going to fry in hell on earth alongside the pink boys?

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,240
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes and accept Bob into your mind?

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,140
Repent, quit your job, slack off, and praise Bob!

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,940
Church of the subgenius.

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,680
Eternal salvation.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,840
Or triple your money back.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,380
Oh yeah!

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,540
If I'd be old, I'd die in religion.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,080
If I'd be old, I'd die in religion.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,440
If I'd be old, I'd die in religion.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,340
Cause if it's good enough, alright.

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,040
If it was good for Moses and Aaron.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,620
If it was good for David and Solomon.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,180
Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,860
Alright, Dallas.

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,520
The subgenius.

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,000
Hey you!

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,500
Hey you!

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,100
Day by day, you will become more and more relaxed.

30
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:51,580
Each day you will experience a new, delightful sense of quiet peace and perfect contentment.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,320
This enjoyable sensation will launch you into...

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,860
The subgenius!

33
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,340
It's our house.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,240
What?

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,820
It is showtime.

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,020
And it is your time.

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,800
And the show must go on, baby.

38
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,880
Come with me and you will see.

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,780
We are stepping high.

40
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,860
What is the name of our show?

41
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,960
Subgenius Radio Ministry.

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,640
Hour of Splat.

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,940
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:41,040
Now, boys and girls, let's feel we can dance to the rhythm of stepping high.

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,100
If you are ready, let's go and dance.

46
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,460
Let's do that time step and dance.

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,200
Here, Bob, here's your hat. Put this part on.

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,360
Here we go.

49
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,400
Now, drive this station down.

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,040
Shaddock Avenue.

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,400
There's never gonna stop.

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,580
Ain't got no spare.

53
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,700
We haven't got a spare for this program.

54
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,640
We don't have a jack for this program.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,180
We don't even have any hydraulic foil for this program.

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
We're just gonna drive until this program caves in.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,100
Go and go and go.

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,680
Good. This is Rand Hoark.

59
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,780
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Rand and Stimpy Show.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,360
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

61
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,380
Keep listening, you idiots.

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,800
Else I shall kill you.

64
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,940
This constant barrage of sex and nudity by the media,

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,600
which Mary was alluding to, that there's just so much of it now

66
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,900
when you look at the movies that they have and just what's on TV, it's unbelievable.

67
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,220
And it's been deemed that anything not good for you is bad, hence illegal.

68
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat.

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,280
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

70
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,800
Swatch.

71
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,440
Swatch.

72
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:58,620


73
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:58,620


74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,660
Toys, chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys, and anything spicy.

75
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,620
Abortion is also illegal, but then again, so is pregnancy if you don't have a license.

76
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,280
Caveman, let's finish with all the Rip Van Winkle and get moving.

77
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,120
All right.

78
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,520
Job is a job.

79
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,340
Accordingly, we feel it to be most appropriate to pay homage

80
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,020
to this most auspicious and solemn occasion.

81
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,660
Reverend Susie,

82
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,620
this most auspicious and solemn occasion.

83
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,520
In which to acquire the proper frame of mind and spirit,

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,560
all subgenius divivals have begun in this solemn traditional manner.

85
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,480
Since the beginning.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,120
We invite everyone listening to join with us now in a sacred moment of

87
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,600
No!

88
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,680
No!

89
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:53,920
No!

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,280
No!

91
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,980
No!

92
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,860
No!

93
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:56,860


94
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,060
No!

95
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,400
No!

96
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:57,880
No!

97
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:57,880


98
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,140
No!

99
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:58,620
No!

100
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:58,680
No!

101
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:58,740
No!

102
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,160
No!

103
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,760
No!

104
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:00,760


105
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:00,760


106
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:00,760


107
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:00,760


108
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:00,760


109
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:10,360
Join with us to destroy all normals.

110
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:22,140
Join with us once again, because it's time for Bob and Connie Face Life.

111
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:23,700
Yes.

112
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,960
It's that magic moment.

113
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,340
That instant of ooze.

114
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,440
That second of squirt, where the squirt meets the ooze and the spew meets the road.

115
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:46,420
Dear friends, this is the ever-present, ever-effervescent Atlanta subgenius radio ministry.

116
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,160
And a mighty radio ministry it shall be.

117
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,140
Yes, dear friends, a mighty hot dog is our ministry.

118
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,500
And it is here, it is here on this station at this appointed time each week.

119
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,660
Praise Bob!

120
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:11,840
That the Reverend Susie the floozy and I, your obedient sea serpent, the Reverend Mike Ruffon, shall stand in judgment.

121
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,880
Ranting and raving to the rude rooftops, screeching our tires and our voices against the all-powerful,

122
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,940
often subtle and ever more relentless onslaught of the norms.

123
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:35,240
The normal conspiracy, the nude world order, them, the pink boys and girls who stole your slack away.

124
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:46,900
On the very day you are bored into this veil of tears, in your ears dripping in your beers, it's us against them.

125
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,540
And Bob is on our side, dear friends.

126
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,060
Praise his sweet name, J.R.!

127
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,520
Bob Dobbs, the living slack master.

128
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,180
So until the exist saucer fleet arrives, four and one half years from this day,

129
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:14,680
to totally subjugate this pitiful planet and to usher all the card-carrying members of the mighty church of the subgenius

130
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,780
on board those fantastic escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

131
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,020
we shall be here, dear friends, manning the barricade.

132
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:30,760
Spanning the virtual globe to bring you the constant variety of butt-kicking weirdness and brazen bull-dotter

133
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:37,040
you have come to expect from that wildly hilarious, yet somehow deeply inspiring,

134
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,900
world-wide beacon of slack that is the church of the subgenius.

135
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,200
Praise Bob!

136
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,100
The end.

137
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,100


138
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,100


139
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,840
Oh, yeah.

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,880
No kidding.

141
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,140
You gotta try this thing.

142
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,940
Yeah, you gotta.

143
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,880
You won't believe this thing.

144
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,000
This thing.

145
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,500
If you really want to.

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,180
Oh, but only if you really want to.

147
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,560
Well, uh, yes, praise Bob.

148
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:39,880
Bob, and that was Reverend Microphone there with that introductory rant from the very first broadcast in Atlanta of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse show.

149
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,580
They're on Noble Station, WREK.

150
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:53,300
That Reverend Microphone shares that show with the lovely and infamous Reverend Susie the Floozy.

151
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,200
Yes, dear friends, we're trying to get used to some new equipment here tonight.

152
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,780
Slightly different show situation.

153
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,160
But I did want to share with you some mail.

154
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,760
We rarely do that.

155
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:17,260
Actually, we get an awful lot of letters and mail here at the Subgenius Foundation headquarters.

156
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,800
But this one might be more important than most.

157
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,860
This came, was written anonymously, was mailed from somewhere in North Texas.

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:39,860
But it says here, Dear Reverend Stang, I write this letter from the confines of the

159
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:47,440
cell hidden deep in the desert of Nevada, or so I am told to believe.

160
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:57,100
I was a uncover, a spy revealing the truths hidden by our government.

161
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:08,260
Recently, I had set upon the most hidden secret of the U.S. government, the Omniret anti-contra fission bomb

162
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,880
encased in a missile hidden within the leather straps of the Bible Belt.

163
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:28,360
This supposedly religious community, Johnstown, Missouri, is actually a secret military base set up to ready and maintain this missile.

164
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:37,700
This missile is set to launch at a location only my rod of feet away, the center of modern day America.

165
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:47,720
This missile is set to destroy all of the, quote, united, unquote, states in one giant mushroomic explosion.

166
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:58,700
When the grand revolution expected by the government to happen at any time, caused by any one of the many revolutionary organizations such as yourself, period.

167
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:07,680
The most horrid part of all is the fact that the launching is controlled by the president's order.

168
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:18,040
At any time, he could blow the entire America to oblivion while he and his communistic lackeys hide in underground bomb shelters.

169
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,760
I send this letter to you through a line of friends, a secret network.

170
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,180
I feel your media broadcast of this doomed future may beat out the missile itself.

171
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,080
We need action now!

172
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:47,880
This is my last contact with the outside world as I fear my destruction is currently being breathed in the disgusting placenta of the governmental cover-up.

173
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:59,680
So I would like to tell everybody listening, if you've got a chance, join the communist party and fight the secret Nazis in Washington, D.C. and around the United States and in the West.

174
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,060
The underground are coming.

175
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,660
The communist underground is directed by General Douglas MacArthur and Charles De Gaulle and his staff in heaven.

176
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:26,480
You will be rewarded on earth and in heaven if you join the communist party which is underground for fighting the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan and all these right-wingers who don't believe in freedom for anybody but the white people.

177
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,360
Oh, thank you, Dan Ashwander.

178
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,800
And this letter here, dear friends, yet another letter that I think could be important.

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,640
Reverend Stang, this envelope should have a dollar in it. I think it did.

180
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:51,120
Send nothing in return but tell Bob I'm keeping the faith alive. Feel the word, feel the world.

181
00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:00,340
But honestly, why is the average Ameri-schmuck an unknowingly nihilistic host body to a vampirizing Nazi?

182
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:08,860
A dancing techno-phantom in an invisibility three-piece suit while at the same time believing in some TV dream of glory, righteousness and greatness?

183
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:26,360
Everything in the culture is fading right out into cheap machine-gun giggle and square-jawed Gestapo freaks glorified by primetime pimps and cool bodies at retail prices and Prozac come-on lines.

184
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:43,320
In a shock-proof manner, another generation, the millennium generation, is about to enter and be forged, decanted into one body under invisible technocrats who speak in binary love poems that mean nothing.

185
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,220
As if it doesn't happen all the time, right? Can we lock up our daughters? No?

186
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:55,220
Well then, what shall it be? A red-hot poker up the place where Bob don't care to look?

187
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,940
And two grams of Soma-Prozac. Sincerely, Reverend Michael Now.

188
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:13,760
Well, Reverend Now, you're right. Things aren't looking up and we're in serious, serious trouble.

189
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,960
Sometimes I wonder if I know where I'm going.

190
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,680
I go for a walk like this.

191
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,100
And it seems...

192
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,600
I have been walking for years and years and years.

193
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,140
And I don't know where I'm going.

194
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,920
I hear the sound leading me on.

195
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,420
And I don't know where it is taking me.

196
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,600
I see people rushing someplace.

197
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,960
They seem to know where they're going.

198
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
And they're getting there in such a hurry.

199
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,160
But where am I going?

200
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,940
You know where you're going.

201
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,700
Maybe you could tell me.

202
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,500
And then I could go along with you.

203
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,440
What's the matter with you, bud? You in a fog?

204
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,300
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,740
I figure that...

206
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,180
someday everything will clear up.

207
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,440
And then...

208
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,560
I'll know where I'm going.

209
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,280
Sometimes I feel as if I'm getting closer.

210
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,000
Like now.

211
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,700
Yes, I am getting closer.

212
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,380
You hear?

213
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
The sound is getting louder.

214
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,440
Yes.

215
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,780
But it's getting blacker.

216
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,560
And blacker.

217
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,380
And blacker.

218
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,140
Help!

219
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,400
Help!

220
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,900
Help!

221
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:16,980
Help!

222
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:16,980


223
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,660
Help!

224
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:18,980
Help!

225
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,260
Help!

226
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,420
Help!

227
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,100


228
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,220
Help!

229
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,460
Help!

230
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,240
Help!

231
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,240
Help!

232
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,700
Oh, dear friend.

233
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,800
Sometimes I know just how...

234
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,820
Ken Nordeen feels there.

235
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,880
I gotta admit it.

236
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm doing the show in a new and strange place.

237
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,020
I'm not used to it.

238
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,920
It's not the...

239
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,700
studio of K-N-O-N.

240
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,820
The Dallas station where this show used to originate.

241
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,120
No...

242
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,800
No far from it.

243
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,820
I'll attempt to describe to you the room I'm speaking from.

244
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,340
It's...

245
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,560
It's vast.

246
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,400
Like a...

247
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,420
cross between Grand Central Station and some...

248
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,540
measureless cavern.

249
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,920
Control processor on.

250
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,760
Airlock's closed.

251
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,300
Airlock's closed. Okay.

252
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,280
The...

253
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,900
The ceilings here must be...

254
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:16,900


255
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,100
...must be at least fifty feet high,

256
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,660
arched and...

257
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:20,860
Arched and...

258
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,120
arched and... life-supporting systems.

259
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,160
arched and... life-supporting systems.

260
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,860
vaulted like a cathedral.

261
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,300
vaulted like a cathedral.

262
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,340
You're welcome.

263
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,540
Uh, there's, uh...

264
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,820
And there's...

265
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,100
slack-jawed and...

266
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,780
... slack-jawed and...

267
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,020
and oddly blank-faced people

268
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,820
and oddly blank-faced people in filthy uniforms

269
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,220
shuffling to and fro and

270
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,540
pushing carts of what looked like

271
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,320
pushing carts of what looked like

272
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,440
mailing envelopes

273
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,480
and cancelled checks

274
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,900
and audio tapes.

275
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,700
A kind of cyclopean altar dominates the room.

276
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:59,640
Robed priests and mendicants scurry about with collection plates beneath the gigantic statue of a smiling man with a pipe.

277
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,220
The section where I'm sitting now is ringed with electronic equipment stacked high.

278
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:13,760
There's screens, keyboards, amplifiers, and other machines whose true functions can only be guessed at.

279
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,960
Even this microphone I'm using is of some unearthly design.

280
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:29,980
The headphones possess an alien sibilance, as if the atmosphere here was somehow rarefied.

281
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,200
You can probably faintly hear the nuclear-powered church air propagating.

282
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,180
The processing device throbbing and humming in the background.

283
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:47,260
And the huge robo-guard dogs out in the parking lot barking at some intruder or Jehovah's Witness.

284
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,940
We're doing the show from Subgenius Foundation headquarters, dear friends.

285
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:05,920
For it seems the homey little public-supported station in Dallas, the K-N-O-N, is no longer there.

286
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,060
At least the old station manager is no longer there.

287
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:17,300
And the new station manager doesn't feel that the church of the subgenius properly, as he puts it,

288
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,060
doesn't properly empower low and moderate income people, as they say.

289
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
Uh-huh. Well, yes.

290
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,680
So they don't want us to do our show at their studios anymore.

291
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,840
Last week was the last hour of Slack show.

292
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,620
And Dallas subgenius has gone to hear, well, that's just fine.

293
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,620
They won't have Reverend Stang to kick around anymore.

294
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,200
Yeah.

295
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,360
But, but they cannot stop us from doing our show.

296
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,680
They can stop the people in Dallas from hearing it, but they cannot...

297
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:06,200
Well, I concede that they could also stop people from hearing it in Cleveland and Atlanta and Northern New York.

298
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:17,180
And New Jersey and New York and Chicago and Stanford University and in Madison and in Detroit and Windsor, Canada and in Los Angeles and Philly and Houston.

299
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,380
But they can't stop us from doing it.

300
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,440
And we'll keep doing this show even if the only people that hear it are us.

301
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,500
Me and the dog here and you.

302
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,800
This, this I vow, my friends.

303
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,480
Bob them. Bob them.

304
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,060
For they...

305
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,280
Could not take the joke.

306
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:47,560
And it doesn't matter one whit, not one jot, nor tittle of difference to show output.

307
00:20:47,780 --> 00:21:00,180
Except that from now on, I'll have to imagine the psychic feedback of listeners rather than experiencing it and feeding off of it directly.

308
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,920
Well, anyway, I'm going to quit talking about it now.

309
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,660
It's no big deal.

310
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,080
It's no skin off of my teeth.

311
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm just going to run all these wonderful tapes and independent CDs that we have stacked up around here like normal.

312
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,420
I promise I won't keep bitterly griping about getting canceled in Dallas anymore.

313
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,320
I don't want to be accused of having the Stern Syndrome.

314
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,100
This is a church, not a personality cult.

315
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,340
Or rather, it's a personality cult.

316
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,820
For Bob.

317
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,880
Was it good for you?

318
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,680
Ah.

319
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,260
Oh, let's get back on the, haha, beaten track.

320
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:55,860
Yeah, unless you get the idea that the Church of the Subgenius is but a pocket of crazies in Dallas, this show should dispel that wild fancy.

321
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,020
Subgeniuses are all over the damn place.

322
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,580
They're coming out of the woodwork like worms out of a hot cheese log.

323
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,020
And it's not a sudden thing.

324
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,780
I joined the church back in 81.

325
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,520
And for a dozen years, I've been witlessing for Bob.

326
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:19,440
Oh, I've had to single-handedly perform a heap of smitens and deflowering since I became an uber-woman of the cloth.

327
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,680
And not much cloth, either.

328
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,520
Oh, honey, I think you need to turn up the synths around right now.

329
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,900
An aerobicized of Francis Cannon, the singing psychic.

330
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,000
As she predicts the past that could have happened back in 87.

331
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,700
She may not be on key, but she's damn sure in tune with the cosmos.

332
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:43,820
Woo!

333
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,100
Woo!

334
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,160
Woo!

335
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,420
Woo!

336
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,400
Woo!

337
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,240
Woo!

338
00:22:59,500 --> 00:22:59,500


339
00:22:59,760 --> 00:22:59,840
Woo!

340
00:22:59,920 --> 00:22:59,920


341
00:22:59,920 --> 00:22:59,920


342
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


343
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


344
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


345
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


346
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


347
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


348
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


349
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


350
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


351
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,040


352
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,340
Woo!

353
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,360
Woo!

354
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,260
Woo!

355
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,120
Woo!

356
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:05,800


357
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,080
Woo!

358
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,160
Woo!

359
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,140
Woo!

360
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,800
Woo!

361
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,260
Woo!

362
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,260


363
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,280
gray-capped弽

364
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,540
RAWbit

365
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,480
It's waitingρ

366
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,920
You wanna dance here together on UBSーメ

367
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,240
Come back here.

368
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,740
Yeah, you can also fly.

369
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,600
I think I could play it alone.

370
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,600


371
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,600


372
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,600


373
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,600


374
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,600


375
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,600


376
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,600


377
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,600


378
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,620
Woo!

379
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:24,620


380
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:24,620


381
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,080
and follow her.

382
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,080


383
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,760
Keep advinangْ

384
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:26,760


385
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,300
Come on.

386
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,660
and all of you einglai.

387
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,120
Thank you.

388
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,260
Thank you.

389
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:39,580
Down in Mexico I hear another earthquake coming, oh no.

390
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,700
Better get ready.

391
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,640
In 1987, in December, California's gonna shake.

392
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,580
Oh no, I think the land is just rebelling

393
00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:00,340
from all this junk we've been putting down in our earth.

394
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:06,400
When I look around I see South America

395
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,920
just shaking and grumbling all about.

396
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,580
Mount Helen's gonna really view her top.

397
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,280
She's gonna blow it big, she's gonna roll in thunder.

398
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,660
Mud is going to fly and rocks are going to fly right out.

399
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,340
And when I look about I see

400
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,260
that Alaska's going to become a warmer state.

401
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:57,420
By 1988 we better really hold our breath.

402
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,440
I'd rather not do bad or just pray real hard

403
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,060
that our land will change,

404
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,700
and that the earthquakes won't be so bad

405
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,780
as I see them in myself.

406
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:23,020
When I look around, I hear all the grumbling going on ..

407
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,320
In Europe all around, it's been good.

408
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,320


409
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:41,300
It's gonna be a very big year for earthquakes, for earthquakes coming in this year.

410
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:06,280
Oh boy, Francis Cannon, the singing psychic.

411
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,240
Oh, I love that woman's atonal nasality.

412
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,980
Huh.

413
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,900
Oh, so how are we doing, Mike?

414
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,300
Uh, maybe I've had it backwards all along.

415
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,260
Maybe I've had it all backwards all along.

416
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,860
Let's just look at what I played on that last hour of slack.

417
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,700
The last show, done just before we got canceled,

418
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:39,240
happened to be a show on which we played two songs that made fun of liberals, yes?

419
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,180
Of course, for nine years.

420
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,320
We always made fun of the conservative fundamentalist idiots,

421
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,060
but not quite as often, not often enough,

422
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,560
have we made fun of the liberal idiots.

423
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,180
The liberal Nazis.

424
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,760
And we did that.

425
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:03,240
And why, the next thing we know, we've been canceled from this liberal radio station.

426
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,100
Could it be?

427
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,500
No.

428
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,960
No.

429
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,540
And it's been a year.

430
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,240
And it's been a year.

431
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,000
And it's been a year.

432
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,920
And it's been a year.

433
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,740
Oh, no.

434
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,700
I guess the next thing that happened was when the television set in Melbourne.

435
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,400
Stan got upset, and rightly so.

436
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,960
I tried to think of a valid reason for subjecting myself to this kind of experience once.

437
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,240
It must have been the peer pressure.

438
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,520
No fun at all.

439
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,460
No fun at all.

440
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,400
Been no fun at all.

441
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, shit.

442
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,740
Ho, ho, ho.

443
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,960
Well, now we have to start doing this show in the car.

444
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,280
Huh?

445
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,980
Oh, is that your mace?

446
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,700
Yep.

447
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,480
Well, hey, no, seriously, we've got to do this show now in the car.

448
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,000
This is the way we're going to have to do this show from now on.

449
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,140
Ah, yes.

450
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,340
Hey, don't start, you're starting, don't burn up the front seat.

451
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,660
It's not that cold.

452
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,060
Actually, that's not a real fire, folks.

453
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:10,940
That's a sound effect caused by a bag full of bags, plastic bags that we're taking back

454
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:10,940


455
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:10,940


456
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,040
to the supermarket to be recycled.

457
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,600
But it sounds just like a warm crackling fire, doesn't it?

458
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,920
Yes, by the magic of you, Dwight, you would think we were recording this in the car on

459
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:32,400
a broken, handheld little Radio Shack deck with only one microphone working, the one-eared

460
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,460
Cyclops deck.

461
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,940
And this is the new studio for the subgenius radio ministry.

462
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,040
Our of Slack.

463
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,640
Now that radio station KNON, where we used to originate the show, is suddenly, as of

464
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,140
about an hour ago, no more.

465
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:03,100
We yet strive to continue to bring the word of Bob to you, our beloved listeners, our

466
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:09,640
dear, dear friends, those who have supported the word of Bob.

467
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,120
Our dear friends.

468
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,000
Our radio ministry.

469
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:18,720
Our outreach through the years on all these other far, far nobler stations.

470
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,820
Well, I shouldn't say that, actually.

471
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,860
KNON was a great station.

472
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:32,740
It was truly a beacon of Slack in the murky airwaves of the modern world.

473
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,780
But it is no more.

474
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,140
And so without background.

475
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,880
Well, we could have background music.

476
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,900
We don't, we can't do fancy mixing, but we couldn't do very fancy mixing before.

477
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,600
Let's turn and see what's on KNON.

478
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,760
That's ironic.

479
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,120
These are goodbye shows.

480
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,120
We've got to do some music.

481
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,120


482
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,120


483
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,120


484
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,120


485
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,120


486
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,120


487
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,800
These are people's last shows.

488
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,480
I ought to be tape recording this.

489
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,780
You know, it's a good thing they didn't tell me that it was my last show.

490
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,800
I would have done things the FCC would never, ever forgive.

491
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,740
They wouldn't be able to come up with a fine large enough to handle the things I would

492
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,660
have played and said on our last show.

493
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,700
We're going to do a little bit of a dance.

494
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,640
We're going to do a little bit of a dance.

495
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:38,640


496
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:38,640


497
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:38,700
We're going to do a little bit of a dance.

498
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,480
Yeah.

499
00:30:46,140 --> 00:31:08,680
If that works.

500
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


501
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


502
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


503
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


504
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


505
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


506
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


507
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


508
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


509
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


510
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,680


511
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,500
Those probably are his songs, but it's not him doing them.

512
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,260
I've got Charlie Manson doing his songs.

513
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,540
You know what?

514
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,440
I've got a lot of Charlie Manson stuff.

515
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,320
Yeah, today in Mr. Barnett's class, one of my friends goes,

516
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:54,360
Mr. Barnett said something like blah, blah, blah, blah, and Charlie Manson.

517
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,880
Then one of the kids in my class goes, Charlie Manson's my hero, man.

518
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,420
He's cool.

519
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,600
Seventh graders.

520
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,380
Mr. Barnett goes, it's one of the kids.

521
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,420
I knew from Lipscomb.

522
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,860
Mr. Barnett goes, if you think that you're sick.

523
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,260
I almost said, my dad says to free Charlie Manson.

524
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,380
We're going to free him, man.

525
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,420
Before we go shopping, let's go free Charlie.

526
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,140
No, we better go shopping first.

527
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,060
Then we go free Charlie Manson.

528
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,340
We got to free Charlie, man.

529
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,760
We'll get some bourbon.

530
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,240
Yeah, we'll get some bourbon.

531
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,580
We'll go over to Poteet High School and get some of the boys.

532
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,280
We'll go free Charlie Manson.

533
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,940
And we won't turn the videotape in on time.

534
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,400
We'll free Charlie instead.

535
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,160
No, no, no, I know, I know.

536
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,880
We won't rewind it.

537
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,020
Yeah.

538
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,660
Yeah.

539
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,120
Now let's see how this.

540
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,840
Whoa.

541
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,600
Let's see how this mixes down in the back.

542
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,480
You see, it's in, there's been some, the biggest hassle is, like, I don't know, I don't

543
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,480


544
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,480


545
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,760
want to say that, but I had to change my technical setup, friends.

546
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:13,040
K&ON did have better equipment than we have here.

547
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:19,320
We've had to take this ancient, Spider Egg bee-fowled four track reel to reel deck purchased

548
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:26,800
from a junkie in 1984 and figure out how to convert its four noisy volume pots into a

549
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,700
mixing device.

550
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,380
And what secondary playback deck do I use?

551
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,320
Do I even have a secondary playback deck?

552
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,460
No.

553
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


554
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


555
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:41,740
deck that works worth a flying hooey? These are all questions that we're about to try to answer.

556
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,640
I'm gonna go on down to Radio Shack and see, I don't know, I just have to before I set up my,

557
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:56,680
reset up and reconfigure my editing system to become a mixing system. I just have to see what

558
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:04,780
my options are. That's all, I just want to see what the options are! I mean, for all I know,

559
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,620
the mixer down there is on sale! Maybe it's not a hundred dollars, maybe for some reason they've

560
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:15,340
got a floor model, it's, they're trying to get rid of for 25 bucks, and maybe that's, maybe it's

561
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,900
down there, and I'd be stupid not to go down there, so of course I've got to go down there

562
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,840
and try to improve my studio situation here.

563
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,940
And, uh...

564
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:46,080
We're gonna turn this stupid piece of junk into some kind of a half-butted radio studio!

565
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,620
Will! Knock down that retaining wall! I want that down to two o'clock!

566
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,340
Tevis! Tevis!

567
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,080
What?

568
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,940
I want you to line these walls with your collection of egg cartons and stuffed animals!

569
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,500
And I want every square inch of surface covered!

570
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:15,080
Doug! I'm afraid you're gonna have to put your precious dogs to sleep! They might bark while I'm ranting!

571
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,900
Will, call Connie! Will! Call Connie on the hotline and see if Bob's back planetside yet!

572
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,400
Yes, sir!

573
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:36,500
And tell those outraged Dallas listeners outside that they can start pledging to me instead of the station if they want their weekly dosages!

574
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,600
I'm damn glad to do everything around here!

575
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,060
Where's the, what's this tape? This tape isn't even labeled!

576
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,920
What good is an unlabeled tape? It might as well be blank!

577
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,420
You fools! You insipid fools!

578
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,260
Give me that! Give me, let me show you how to cut a damn tape!

579
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,420
No.

580
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,560
Well, see, it works pretty good right now.

581
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,320
I mean, it's not really all that bad if you want to yell and scream and do a show to a Michelle!

582
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,740
You can do it from over here, I guess!

583
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,300
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it!

584
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,100
But then if you have to get quiet, you don't need to do it a little bit more like this.

585
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,120
Then you get to stand back and yell like this!

586
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,440
Then you have to get in like this.

587
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,180
Oh, you're doing it here, sir.

588
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,540
Can I hear myself at all?

589
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:18,900
Really?

590
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,600
I don't know.

591
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:21,660
Really?

592
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,160
Yes.

593
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,040
Does one thing on the machine?

594
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,180
And it does another thing on the other machine.

595
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,240
It does another thing on the other machine.

596
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,060
It's out there.

597
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,960
We shut that off.

598
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,320
The background's okay, but I'm noticing a dip on the left channel now.

599
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,240
What happens if we wiggle this around a little bit?

600
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,120
Well, it's all staying right in the middle.

601
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,040
Jack with my...

602
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:53,440
It's that left, that upper left output has been bad, bad, bad.

603
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,880
Now the right is bad.

604
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,400
Oh, okay.

605
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,820
It's judicious twisting of the...

606
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,500
Why does it do that sometimes?

607
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:07,900
Myself.

608
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,980
Now what happens if we wiggle this over a little higher?

609
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,660
Because, friends, I'd be doing this show in some kind of a loud voice.

610
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,500
And I'd need to be able to hear my background music.

611
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,660
I actually can hear my background music, but I don't know if it's right.

612
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,520
I just don't know.

613
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,580
Twisting.

614
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,580
I don't know if it's right or wrong.

615
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,900
Everything's different.

616
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,540
Change the volume on that background music.

617
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,060
You can do that.

618
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,400
I can actually reach over there and do that.

619
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,580
Bring it up like that.

620
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,100
Bring it right back down.

621
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,480
Balance it up.

622
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,900
Turn that up.

623
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,620
It hurts.

624
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,300
Okay, I'll get that balanced.

625
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,060
Hey, it's the equipmentless creature.

626
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,240
It's the

627
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,180
I don't have to.

628
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,600
That's the problem.

629
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,480
I now have the hated option of a take two.

630
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,140
I don't want the option of a retake.

631
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,740
I want to have to rush to put the show together by a certain time.

632
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,660
I want to know that there are thousands of people out there.

633
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:32,840
Thousands of years listening at that moment, ready and eager for me to screw up royally.

634
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,740
Some stupid mistake that they can pounce on as a sign of weakness.

635
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,720
I'm an emergentile subgenius.

636
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,640
I enjoy that feeling of panic.

637
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:51,160
For I am committed to proving that I, as a subgenius and a child of Bob, do not care what you think.

638
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,560
Now I want to entertain you and educate you in the ways of slag.

639
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,500
And certainly we want to sell you Bob's wisdom.

640
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,880
But so badly do I want to prove to you that I don't care how stupid you think I am.

641
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,260
That I'm going to try to deliberately continue to do these shows in one take.

642
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,740
Even if it means you hear me screw up.

643
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,600
Because otherwise it isn't radio.

644
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,920
It's just recording.

645
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,500
And there's a difference.

646
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,400
We're going to keep it that way.

647
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,540
And Bob them if they can.

648
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:26,540


649
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,260
Take a joke.

650
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,000
Uh, yes ma'am.

651
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,960
I'm, uh, this is Dr. Wadlington.

652
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,580
I'm trying to reach Moo, Dr. Gray.

653
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,160
Did, uh, Roland leave word where he was going to be?

654
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,940
Uh, Dr. Gray is not on call.

655
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
He's not on call.

656
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,020
Okay, well I'm Moo over here at the hospital.

657
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,220
And we, uh, there's a new case of his.

658
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,460
Um.

659
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,000
And I, I really Moo need to talk to him.

660
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,340
He doesn't answer Moo at home.

661
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,900
Okay, you called him at home.

662
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,320
Yes, Moo.

663
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,620
Huh?

664
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,100
Uh, yes I did and there's no Moo answer at home.

665
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,900
No Moo answer?

666
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,180
I'm sorry ma'am.

667
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,760
Well I called him several times.

668
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,640
Moo, there was no answer.

669
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,540
Did he move?

670
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,220
Did Moo leave word where, uh, he was going to be later this evening?

671
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,140
Uh, no he's, they don't call in if they're not on call.

672
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,720
But he hasn't Moo called in at all Moo tonight?

673
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,200
Uh.

674
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,360
Ma'am?

675
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,760
Uh, no I haven't talked to Dr. Wadlington.

676
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,460
I mean Dr. Gray.

677
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,020
Yeah, this is Dr. Wadlington.

678
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,460
Yeah.

679
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:56,660
Yeah, Moo.

680
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,880
I'm, uh, Moo have you heard?

681
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,600
Moo, uh, Dr. Doak?

682
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,780
Cause I'm the only one on call tonight Moo.

683
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,900
Is Dr. Doak on call?

684
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,200
Is, uh, Bill on call?

685
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,560
Yes, Dr. Doak is on call.

686
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,200
Moo, um, well that's funny.

687
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,480
I tried calling Moo, Bill, uh, about half hour ago.

688
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,840
And, uh, he wasn't there.

689
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,340
Moo, do you have his?

690
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,880
What, what is Moo?

691
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,060
You keep saying Moo.

692
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,700
What is Moo?

693
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,560
Uh, I'm sorry.

694
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,540
I'm just trying to reach, uh, either, either my partner.

695
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,120
I'm not saying Moo.

696
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,760
I'm trying to figure out why you keep calling me Moo.

697
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,040
Excuse me, ma'am?

698
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,100
Huh?

699
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,480
What's that?

700
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,600
Uh, you keep saying Moo.

701
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,440
Well, I'm in the hospital right now.

702
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:05,980
Uh, we have a, uh, very sick, uh, little girl here on Moo trying to reach, uh, either, either the, uh, doctor's Moo.

703
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,220
Because I haven't worked with this Moo patient before.

704
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,780
Just a moment.

705
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,080
Just a moment.

706
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,600
Okay.

707
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,160
Just a moment.

708
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,560
Just a moment.

709
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:23,620
Okay.

710
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,420
Just a moment.

711
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:24,420


712
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:24,420


713
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:31,100
Just a moment.

714
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,100


715
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,100


716
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,100


717
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,120
Just a moment.

718
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,120


719
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,120


720
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,120


721
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:31,740
Hello, sir?

722
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,500
Moo, yes.

723
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,360
You, you're Dr. Wasington?

724
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,480
Moo, yes.

725
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,840
Yes, I'm trying to reach Moo, uh, either of my Moo partners.

726
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,620
Uh, here, this is Dr. Stokes.

727
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,060
Hello?

728
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Moo, Bill.

729
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,320
Hello, here, this is Dr. Stokes.

730
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,400
You don't, you don't have a phone.

731
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:54,400


732
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,420
It's Dr. Wadlington.

733
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,840
Uh-huh.

734
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,360
You know that girl you were treating yesterday?

735
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,060
Who are you talking about?

736
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:20,360
I believe a Stinson girl. She had some kind of ulcer, herniated thing or something.

737
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,060
No, I don't know about that. It's Dr. Cook.

738
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:37,080
Yeah. Well, Moo, I'm trying to figure out what drugs were moved.

739
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,460
I think actually Moo, it was Dr. Gray that was handling that.

740
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,760
No, I don't know. I don't have any information on that.

741
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,340
Okay.

742
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:57,860
Well, Moo, you didn't, Moo, handle any of that.

743
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,020
No, no.

744
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,460
Son.

745
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,280
Mom.

746
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:09,120
Son, just please, Moo, bring me a cup of tea.

747
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,340
Moo, all right.

748
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,920
Moo, Moo, Moo.

749
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:19,360
And that's the Philly, or the Pittsburgh, I guess, the Pittsburgh Fightsters.

750
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,340
Yeah.

751
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,360
The mighty Fightsters.

752
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,540
The mighty Fightsters.

753
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:30,020
Telephone art submitted, in this case, by our good friend, Lou Minotti.

754
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,740
We hope to bring you more of the Fightsters and their ilk as timers.

755
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,860
Stay tuned.

756
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,200
We're serving by reference.

757
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,140
Don't miss it if you can.

758
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,500
The new caller comes into view.

759
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,420
If I just have one question, please, to ask you.

760
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,000
Yes?

761
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,340
If I just have one question, please, to ask you.

762
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


763
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


764
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


765
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


766
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


767
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


768
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,460
Oh, that's it.

769
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,140
Thanks a lot.

770
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:58,500
I want to ask you, when people pay money to your station, why do you just play on the

771
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:58,800
radio?

772
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,700
Why do we just play on the radio?

773
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,100
Yes.

774
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,080
People give their money to your station, and you act like you're, you know, babies

775
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,660
or something.

776
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,580
It's our religion that makes us act this way.

777
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,060
Might have a problem checking that very thing out.

778
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,740
There's one now.

779
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,060
Now, you see right here?

780
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,120
See, this thing's too small.

781
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,040
Look on the projector, sir.

782
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,620
Can't do that.

783
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,660
Now, you see right here?

784
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,200
See this thing?

785
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,980
Can you see there on projector number two?

786
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,580
Oh, the acupuncture of the baby is now taking place.

787
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,320
Just because of the baby.

788
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


789
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


790
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


791
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,980
That's the kind of thing our religion does for us.

792
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,160
It really makes us feel alive.

793
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,860
Ah, yes.

794
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,320
Do you have another question, sir?

795
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:38,880
Oh, he's gone.

796
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,320
Well, in true form, anyway, some of the foundations have given up trying to talk because of the

797
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,140
current atmospheric condition.

798
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,560
You know, it's true.

799
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,460
All right?

800
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,080
Good.

801
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,780
Well, nothing's happening here.

802
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,980
The prayer session has started, and the interior mode has begun.

803
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,100
All pervading sadness.

804
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,000
It's not anything you've done.

805
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,540
It's nothing in a bad or negative reflection of the world.

806
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:19,540


807
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,120
It's nothing in a bad or negative reflection of the program.

808
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,400
It's just that, to be honest with you, brutally, in that two things are at work here.

809
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:31,340
Number one, addressing the needs and empowering the lowest moderate income constituency of

810
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,620
what we're talking about, our listening area.

811
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,220
And then secondly, supporting it to make that mission work.

812
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:38,920
Okay?

813
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,700
These are the two things, period, that I'm dealing with right now at the direction of

814
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,040
the board.

815
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,420
But I'm the mechanic.

816
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,520
I've got to make it work.

817
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,420
They're telling me what I've got to do.

818
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,520
I've got to be very proactive.

819
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,520


820
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,520


821
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,520


822
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,520


823
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,520


824
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,520


825
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,520


826
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:49,660
I've got to be very prudent.

827
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,300
I've got to be very prudent.

828
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:55,540
I don't see how I can justify what you're doing as a low- and moderate-income empowerment

829
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,120
program.

830
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,080
But change, for the betterment, is going to cause tension.

831
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:07,040
And nobody's going to agree.

832
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,760
You have fun with it.

833
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,840
Thanks a bunch.

834
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,780
Relight me now.

835
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,760
I just will.

836
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,040
Bye.

837
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:13,640
All right.

838
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,620
Mr. Smith.

839
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,140
Mr. Smith.

840
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,160
Mr. Smith.

841
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,840
Mr. Smith.

842
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,200
Mr. Smith.

843
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:16,340


844
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,500
Mr. Smith.

845
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:17,500


846
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:17,500


847
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:17,500


848
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:17,500


849
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,360
Mr. Smith.

850
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:18,920
Mr. Smith.

851
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:18,920


852
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:18,920


853
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:18,920


854
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:18,920


855
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,340
Mr. Smith.

856
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:23,900
It may have been the way it happened, Mr. Stang, but suppose it wasn't?

857
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:32,520
You've got to trust us when you need a friend to find us.

858
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,180
You've got to look within.

859
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,360
You've got to trust us.

860
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:44,560
You've got to trust us before you turn to dust.

861
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,500
Before you turn to dust.

862
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,140
You've got to see it.

863
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,060
Before you see.

864
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,920
You've got to see it.

865
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,960
Before your feet.

866
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:53,840
Ah!

867
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:59,060
We ain't the dead preachin' preachers, dead preachers preachin' dead sermons to dead congregations!

868
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,880
They're tired of cold services and cold churches!

869
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,460
This world is hungry for reality!

870
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,320
They've had enough of Hollywood.

871
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,300
They've had enough of Nashville.

872
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,540
They've had enough of show business!

873
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:19,040
And now, the soft genius, Howard Ross.

874
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,520
I bet you he forgot a couple of words, though.

875
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:19,520


876
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:19,520


877
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:19,520


878
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,700
I'm very brutally honest with you.

879
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:30,500
I don't see how I can justify what you're doing as a low and moderate income empowerment program.

880
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:39,740
And this comes from a couple of sources, not just me, but I also deal with the media committee appointed by the board

881
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,300
to also oversee what it is that the community may or may not want.

882
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,040
And that's really what it comes down to, what the community representatives say they may or may not want.

883
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,220
I'll wait around the train station.

884
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,840
Wait for that train.

885
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,980
But take me away.

886
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,500
Lord, take me the hell away from here.

887
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,640
Take me from this lonesome town.

888
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,680
Too bad you don't have a mother.

889
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,900
Too bad you don't have a mother.

890
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,100
Too bad your people.

891
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:20,860
Too bad your people.

892
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:28,380
I look for rainbows and all I see is pink blue.

893
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,800
Look for flowers.

894
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,260
I see crap all over the oval room rug.

895
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,960
I look for father figures and I get Richard Milhouse, Nixon, and Spiro Agnew.

896
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,280
I look for love and all I get is napalm.

897
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,940
Too bad, man.

898
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,260
Too bad about that napalm, daddy-o.

899
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,580
Too bad about that napalm, daddy-o.

900
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,280
But I think we're gonna just relax back here and see how this works.

901
00:49:53,380 --> 00:50:00,780
See how this particular little microphoning situation really works.

902
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:07,440
I'm not sure that it works with a lady who's a poet.

903
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,180
Or is she?

904
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,800
Go ahead.

905
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,560
Okay.

906
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,920
An explanation, and I think you do this.

907
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,900
I mean, it's not anything you...

908
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,020
I mean, it's not anything you...

909
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,020


910
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,100
It's done.

911
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,160
It's nothing in a bad or negative reflection of the program.

912
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,360
That's not true.

913
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:31,080
And the two things are done and empowered the low and moderate income constituency of what we're talking about.

914
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:31,920
I'm thinking it.

915
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,040
Secondly, it's important to make work.

916
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,300
And the programming's gotta conform with...

917
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,680
The programming's gotta conform with...

918
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,140
The programming's gotta conform with...

919
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:38,520
The programming's gotta conform with...

920
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,340
It's gotta conform with a low and moderate income empowerment program.

921
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,940
I don't see how I can justify what you're doing as a low and moderate income...

922
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,000
Empowerment...

923
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,440
Empowerment program.

924
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,700
Empowerment program.

925
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,780
Empowerment program.

926
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:07,780


927
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,940
Empowerment program.

928
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,440
Empowerment program.

929
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,440
Empowerment program.

930
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,460
Empowerment program.

931
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,460


932
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,460


933
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,460


934
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,460


935
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,460


936
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,460


937
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,460


938
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,000
Empowerment program.

939
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,700
guitar solo

940
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,980
guitar solo

941
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,980
guitar solo

942
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,780
guitar solo

943
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,740
guitar solo

944
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,020
guitar solo

945
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,780
Well, I'm sorry, my friends,

946
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,500
but we aren't going to spend our precious

947
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,780
slack-powered show whining about

948
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,960
unfair housing. No, we're

949
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,640
going to spend it whining about

950
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,960
unfair radio.

951
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,560
We're here to do radio.

952
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,160
Real radio.

953
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,800
We try to give you something to

954
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,840
imagine.

955
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,720
Not just the

956
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,440
Limpolly and Sternonian

957
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,760
commentary. Nay!

958
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,780
Nor even mere interactive comedy.

959
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,140
But radio!

960
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,180
While you invoke

961
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,740
the imagination.

962
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,760
Dramatic radio!

963
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,600
Yes, that's the way

964
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,820
that we should handle the show tonight.

965
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,900
Yes, not in bitter hate.

966
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,820
It's not like we haven't been expecting

967
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,840
something like this every week for the last

968
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,040
nine years, though.

969
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,960
To tell the truth, I consider

970
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,980
it a miracle that any hours

971
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,680
of slack ever got broadcast

972
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,460
anywhere, much less

973
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,200
441 of them.

974
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,860
But that's

975
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,540
okay. It's no big deal.

976
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,660
It doesn't hurt my feelings that they

977
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,320
canceled the show in Dallas.

978
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,480
I'm above all that petty

979
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,280
bitterness and mere

980
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,420
hume anger.

981
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,800
Let's get back to this nice, light

982
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,580
entertainment here, friends.

983
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,600
...

984
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,780

00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,180

992
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,600

993
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:42,600


994
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:42,600


995
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,000

996
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,000


997
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,000


998
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,540

999
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:43,640

1000
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:43,640


1001
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:43,640


1002
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:43,640


1003
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:43,640


1004
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,340
...

1005
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:47,980
...

1006
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,320
...

1007
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,000
...

1008
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:57,340
...

1009
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:00,940
...

1010
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:00,940


1011
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:08,180
...

1012
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:08,320
...

1013
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:08,340
...

1014
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:08,360
...

1015
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:08,380
...

1016
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:08,400
...

1017
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:08,420
...

1018
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:08,440
...

1019
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:08,460
...

1020
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:08,480
...

1021
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:08,500
...

1022
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:08,520
...

1023
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:08,540

1024
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:08,560

1025
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:08,580
...

1026
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:08,600
...

1027
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:08,680
...

1028
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:08,700
...

1029
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:08,720
...

1030
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:09,940
...

1031
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:13,440
Come back and buy this thing, buy this thing

1032
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,920
Come back and buy this thing

1033
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,040
And put it all in my shoe

1034
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,000
In my shoe

1035
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,940
Put, put, put

1036
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,520
No

1037
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,120
No

1038
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,880
Dear friends, I think I can tell

1039
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,680
That the old four-track deck here ain't gonna do it

1040
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,000
We're gonna have to go out and get a proper mix board somehow

1041
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,640
By hook or by crook

1042
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,520
I'll admit it

1043
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,920
I can't wait to see what they play tonight in Dallas

1044
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,120
In place of Hour of Slack

1045
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:02,220
What the Hour of Slack listeners will tune into and be disappointed by

1046
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:02,580
Yeah

1047
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,560
You know, of course, the problem with all this is

1048
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,940
What if, what if the listeners aren't disappointed by that?

1049
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,940
What if the replacement show is better?

1050
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,560
Some other weird show

1051
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:20,140
What if it's the Hour of, uh, laxness

1052
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,900
And it's better?

1053
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,400
What if they were right to cancel the Hour of Slack?

1054
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,420
No, no, no

1055
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,400
Even

1056
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:32,700
Even

1057
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,380
Even

1058
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:33,500
Even

1059
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1060
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1061
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1062
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1063
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1064
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1065
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1066
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1067
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1068
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1069
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1070
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,640
It does get me spittering and sputtering, friends

1071
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:44,680
But I must remember that people will be praising Bob for long, long after these villains are dust

1072
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,120
Forgotten and moldering in their graves

1073
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,160
In fact, I believe

1074
00:57:52,440 --> 00:58:01,220
Strongly believe that people will be praising Bob long after you or I are collecting dust on some alien's shelf

1075
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,160
Uh

1076
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,480
I don't know

1077
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:03,500
I don't know

1078
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:08,320
ruptured into the escape vessels the next day and after 500 or a thousand

1079
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:15,640
years we decide to vacate our bodies and our bodies become some curio on some

1080
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:22,840
alien beings knick-knack show as good a fate for a body as any I suppose if

1081
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:29,000
you're not in it anymore who needs it oh well somebody sick might need it that's

1082
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,700
why I signed that thing on my driver's license that says if I'm suddenly dead

1083
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:41,140
yes you can have my eyes and my skull yes the mortician students can play with

1084
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:45,840
my body and the medical students can form my fingers into obscene gestures

1085
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:51,880
while I'm laying there dead I don't care I give my eyes to some blind man stick

1086
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:57,940
him in that blind man and he'll go whoa whoever own these eyes before me he was

1087
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:58,980
either a very lucky man or a very lucky man

1088
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:05,740
or he had a hell of an imagination he'll say praise Bob I can see again but what I

1089
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:13,520
can see I'm shocked and some deaf fella can have my ears and he'll hear nothing

1090
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:20,380
but the hour of slack superimposed over everything all his life oh yeah oh go

1091
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:26,340
ahead you can have everything take the whole church mr. conspiracy but there's

1092
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,220
one thing you can't ever get

1093
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,280
there and alien

1094
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,840
no I don't know what that is actually I was hoping that I think of something

1095
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,700
inspirational and clever but but actually the fact is they could get

1096
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:44,900
everything friends if they wanted to they could get everything now I can still do the

1097
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,360
my show, but my friends here in my hometown can't hear it.

1098
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:54,360
They could just donate their pledge money directly to the church, and they'd get a cassette,

1099
00:59:54,780 --> 01:00:03,780
but, uh, eh, the meanwhile, friends, the conspiracy has the show hostage in Dallas.

1100
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:12,580
Oh, and one last thing about having to do this show here at the studio, at home, in

1101
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:18,440
the office, the subgenius office, this way I have the unwanted option of doing two or

1102
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,800
three shows at a time.

1103
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,960
For instance, I'm not really here this week, I'm really in Chicago being an actor in some

1104
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:33,800
completely bizarre CD-ROM virtual reality movie game with a cast of other obscure weirdos,

1105
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,840
but that's another story.

1106
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,400
Anyway, I didn't do this show today.

1107
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:42,460
I put all this stuff on tape a week and a half ago when I did the previous show.

1108
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,660
The one you're actually listening to now.

1109
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,220
Do you see what I mean, my friends?

1110
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,280
Oh.

1111
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,280
Oh.

1112
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,780
Zug's riff there in the background.

1113
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,420
Off of his, uh, CD.

1114
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,900
What CD is that?

1115
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,280
It's about, uh, Villagers, I think is the name of it.

1116
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,460
It's about the only one you can get.

1117
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,960
Eh, well, friends.

1118
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,480
It's been an interesting show.

1119
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:18,080
And we hope that we can get our technical act a little bit better down next week.

1120
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,220
Eh, same Bob time, same Bob.

1121
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,880
Friends, you need to write for more information about the Church of the Subgenius.

1122
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,640
And I'm about to give you that box number you can write to.

1123
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,460
It's a short one, a simple one.

1124
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:38,020
You can just address that letter or card to Bob.

1125
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,260
That's right, just Bob.

1126
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,240
Bob.

1127
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:42,380
Bob.

1128
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:42,500


1129
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:46,820
At Post Office Box 140306.

1130
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,520
In lovely Dallas, Texas.

1131
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,280
75214.

1132
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,200
Once again, friends, that's Bob.

1133
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,740
At Post Office Box 140306.

1134
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,420
Dallas, Texas.

1135
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,580
75214.

1136
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:11,900
And...

1137
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,620
And we love you, dear friends.

1138
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:20,220
And we hate you in that strange way that Bob teaches us all.

1139
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:33,360
Listen to those little bad four-track neck volume pots.

1140
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,060
Turn up the volume.
