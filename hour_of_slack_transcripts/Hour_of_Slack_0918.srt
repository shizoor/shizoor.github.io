1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Stir it up!

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,180
At last I have control of your radio tubes!

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,740
And I do too!

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,280
Good! This is Ren Hoak!

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,360
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show!

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,960
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack!

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,700
And keep listening, you idiots!

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

9
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,120
Else I shall kill you!

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,660
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,220
Tonight we add another name to the long list of those we have honored.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,460
The truth that I'm about to give you has exploded.

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,140
In power!

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,140
Woo!

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,340
Woo!

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
Thank you, though, I'm enjoying this.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,700
Buried within the uncharted depths of waters surrounding a group of islands off the 50th parallel

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,160
lies man's most formidable challenge.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,360
The awesome awakening of prehistoric monsters longed for extinct.

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,860
Savage and deadly,

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,340
their one hope is to rule our planet,

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,220
as they once had thousands of years back.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,520
And that ain't all!

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,180
Shit!

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,500
Science was baffled and powerless.

26
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,320
This is confusing!

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,920
A terror-stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,580
Heh heh heh! Well, things are looking up!

29
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,480
Ha ha ha ha ha!

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,980
A once proud civilization now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla and his powerful ally,

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,700
Bob.

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,020
Bob.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,520
Titan against Titan.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,020
Giant against giant in the most spectacular battle yet.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,660
But things weren't normal.

36
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,640
There were changes.

37
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,180
Ah!

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,060
Ah!

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:08,700
Ah!

40
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:08,760
Ah!

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,040
Your mother bit me!

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,840
I never saw him by like that.

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
It's a beautiful sight!

44
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,700
Strange, frightful changes.

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,160
That night, it all started.

46
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,500
Stop doing that.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,480
Ah!

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,500
This was the Night of the Crawling Terror.

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,220
American International presents...

50
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,640
The Subgenius Hour of Swatch!

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,100
Hosted by your friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,260
Uh, yes, uh, thank you, Joe.

53
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:56,440
Uh, joined tonight, dear friends, by Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence, yes, and of course, uh, Reverend Joe Riley,

54
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:04,920
whose, whose, uh, brand new media barrage tape will be hearing the cuts of...

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,940
Have the technology, have the tapes.

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,180
Bob told me to make this.

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,000
Not gonna resist.

58
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,040
And if during the proceedings a small chlorine-oxypropylene bag should drop down,

59
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,800
open the receiving flap and inhale deeply.

60
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,720
Don't ask questions.

61
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,520
Prepare to have your mind scanned for possible bozosaurian traces.

62
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,520
Scanning now.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:30,900
Continuing.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,340
Take notes if need be.

65
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,180
Call for assistance.

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,600
Operators are standing by.

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
Forward when notified.

68
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,420
Void when prohibited.

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,300
Visitors only.

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,120
Ten minute parking.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,700
Do not fold, spindle, or mutilate except in the presence of Krishna, Muhammad, Buddha, Jehovah, Vincent Price, or Bob.

72
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,600
Ah, yes, dear friends, and tonight, it's a re-run.

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,860
From nineteen and ninety-seven, I calculate.

74
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,760
This cassette master here says,

75
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:13,160
Hour of Slack, 356, Joe Riley barrage, and KPFA with Stang,

76
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:21,460
which means I must have been in, uh, California and done a, a show at, uh, KPFA in Berkeley with puzzling evidence and all them,

77
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,080
and, and I know that Joe Riley did this incredible, uh,

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,340
but, barrage, sort of a, a collage, a media barrage tape.

79
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,720
In fact, my, it says here, some sort of note that I believe this is a re-run of a re-run,

80
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:46,220
because it was run as Hour of Slack 681, now being Hour of Slack number nine hundred and eighteen.

81
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,740
Uh, oh yes, yes, yes.

82
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,040
It's Candy Frappy.

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,300
It's Frappy Candy.

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,180
Stop.

85
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:03,520
Eh?

86
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,820
You're both right.

87
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,780
Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

88
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,260
Stripes and stripes and stripes of colors, colors, colors, colors and colors.

89
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,160
Colors that go below infrared and way above ultraviolet.

90
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,120
And the taste?

91
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,200
Yeah, Frappy Candy, Candy Frappy.

92
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,500
Well, I can see these two won't need any words or worms for several days now, I should say, I think.

93
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,420
So don't forget.

94
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,420
That's new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

95
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,920
Now with extra dimension, Love Hamster 16.

96
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,680
Habitual not included.

97
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,160
Tell Jeff and all your Acer friends, this one's the beans for maximum best fun.

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,380
Candy Frappy Frappy Candy from Squidco, the Gobi Bar people.

99
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,200
The preceding tape will cause brain damage.

100
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,540
Nothing to fear.

101
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,800
Buy something and inhale its fumes.

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,920

105
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,980
Wiping the area with a lint-free cloth can cause extreme visions, such as these.

106
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,960
Lord God, help us obey authority.

107
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,460
Bless our leaders for making us what we are.

108
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,420
This is your word, O Lord, of heaven above earth.

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,280
Bless our overlords for protecting us from our wretched selves.

110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,020
May we be blessed with a lust for submission and guidance.

111
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,040
May we think of the Lord and not of pain.

112
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,840
Authority is great.

113
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,220
Ignorance is bliss.

114
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,960
Peace is war with the devil.

115
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,580
This is the word of the Lord.

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,720
Amen.

117
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,140
Welcome to yet another Bulldog.

118
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
It's another Bulldog.

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,880
Volume 1 couldn't possibly hold all the eclectic propaganda needed

120
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,100
to become a complete raving lunatic for Bob.

121
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:44,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

122
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

123
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,280
The Bulldog's Ara монasteries.

124
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,280


125
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,280


126
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,440
The National News Matthias.

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,440


128
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,500
CHAPTER 22 And it's marked by done with a float.

129

The Proph benefit reрашigki, Evaıyor200 Without suite.

132
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,340
On this tape, you'll hear rantings from every two-bit B-movie actor ever born,

133
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,880
cold, precision auto monster boys,

134
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,380
and from hundreds of dysfunctional infortunates across our globe.

135
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,900
Oh, hi there.

136
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,400
How do you do?

137
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,460
I'm your new neighbor, Herman Munster.

138
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,200
Thank you.

139
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,180
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.

140
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,720
What the hell are you doing, Lee?

141
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,660
I'm watching Bob.

142
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,700
You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be.

143
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,980
You backstabber, you traitor, you...

144
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,220
Snap out of it, Bart.

145
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,580
Um, I lost my job.

146
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,380
I had a job.

147
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,900
Now I don't...

148
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,820
Ah!

149
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,060
I want you to be like me.

150
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,180
I want you to worship me.

151
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,780
I want you to feel like I am.

152
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,920
I want you to enjoy the fearlessness that I have,

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,320
the courage that I have,

154
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,860
the compassion that I have,

155
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,120
the love that I have,

156
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,520
the all-encompassing mercy that I have.

157
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,640
I want you to be what I am and something greater.

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,060
I want you to give you more than I have.

159
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,980
I want you to be greater than I am.

160
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,740
And if you don't want to go this route,

161
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,440
then go to hell where you want to, but don't bother me.

162
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,820
I really didn't realize it.

163
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,940
I told you, heal my back, heal my bottom,

164
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,880
but don't you heal my mind, because my mind is too sick.

165
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,320
Christianity was never based on the idea of an unknown God.

166
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm going to cause you to know that you are what Jesus was.

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,620
Jesus said that every human being was a God.

168
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,020
It is written that you are God.

169
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,220
I'm a God and you're a God.

170
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,540
And I'm a God and I'm going to stay a God

171
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,360
until you recognize that you're a God.

172
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,100
And when you recognize you're a God,

173
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,740
I shall go back into principle and will not appear as a personality.

174
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,120
You are God.

175
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,720
And until I see all of you know who you are,

176
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,660
I'm going to be very much what I am.

177
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,220
God almighty God.

178
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,720
Call the next defendant.

179
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,580
Kay Bridges to the bar.

180
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,640
The End

181
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,160
The End

182
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,240
The End

183
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,500
The End

184
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,500


185
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,620
The End

186
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,400
The End

187
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,400


188
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,400


189
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,440
The End

190
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440


191
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440


192
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440


193
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440


194
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440


195
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440


196
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440


197
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440


198
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440


199
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,660
Silence, Kay.

200
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,580
Yes, your hands are covered with the blood

201
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,280
of the thousands of souls that you have murdered.

202
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,140
Murdered?

203
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,740
But I never murdered anyone.

204
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,660
Not with a sword.

205
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,760
But you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell

206
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,380
with your malicious tongue.

207
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,400
It would have been a thousand times better

208
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,740
had you murdered them with a sword.

209
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,360
Oh, no.

210
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,420
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.

211
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,420
I only spoke the truth.

212
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,840
No, Kay.

213
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,680
You spoke that which you wanted to be true.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,540
But granting that you did only speak the truth,

215
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,020
who gave you license to defame and destroy the character of others?

216
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,940
The serpent with his venom and his ire,

217
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,760
with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,

218
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,900
with his deadly call and fatal fang

219
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,700
is the only fit emblem

220
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,340
of the world.

221
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,660
Of the man or woman

222
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,640
who stabs and kills the character of another.

223
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,480
Let your own words condemn you.

224
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,460
May 10th, 1973.

225
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,040
Linda's been such a good friend in spiritual health.

226
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,040
Well, when you've known her as long as I have,

227
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
you'll really get to know her.

228
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,420
What do you mean?

229
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,540
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life as you think.

230
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,220
She's just a good friend.

231
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,500
But I'm not one to say anything.

232
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,060
You just call me when you need advice.

233
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,080
Well, I've got a lot to do.

234
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,680
I have to go.

235
00:11:59,540 --> 00:11:59,940
Goodbye.

236
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:02,920
Goodbye.

237
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,840
Oh, no.

238
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,340
Well, I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that.

239
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,060
I don't believe I want any part of it.

240
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,560
Oh, no.

241
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,520
Oh, my God.

242
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,380
My God, have mercy on me.

243
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,720
I never realized.

244
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,160
Have mercy on me.

245
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,340
You, Kay, with your gossipy tongue,

246
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,060
have driven the babes away from my church.

247
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,640
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock.

248
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,440
You never knew what it meant to show mercy.

249
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,960
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?

250
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,240
There is no mercy for you.

251
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,600
You are sentenced to hell where you will be haunted forever

252
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,340
by the souls you sinned.

253
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,840
Oh, no.

254
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,080
I don't want to go to hell.

255
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,640
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know.

256
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,880
I didn't know.

257
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,880
I only repeated what I heard.

258
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,780
You didn't know that the most fearful of all crimes

259
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,620
is the crime of gossip.

260
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,000
Your record will speak for itself.

261
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,600
Oh, no.

262
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,640
But yes, friends, send in that love offering, that check,

263
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,720
addressed to Tammy Faye Dobbs,

264
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,800
daughter of Connie,

265
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,580
and the wife of my son,

266
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:19,580


267
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,980
Oh, that felt so good.

268
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,820
I forgot.

269
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,180
Oh, look out!

270
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,500
Evelyn Donut.

271
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,380
Call her!

272
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,360
Well, call her right outside the building.

273
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,740
Come on.

274
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,740
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence you had there.

275
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,500
It was almost a half second.

276
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,660
That will last forever in my memory.

277
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,780
First time ever.

278
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,760
Okay, no.

279
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,580
Oh, we got some more.

280
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,340
Why do I?

281
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,200
I feel that they're...

282
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Bergman knew how to use silence.

283
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,840
The silence of the soul.

284
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,160
Sure is nice out here.

285
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,080
I hope the boat comes, though.

286
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,060
Fellini knew how to use silence.

287
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,180
But that horrible boatman with his grisly hands.

288
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,840
Yeah, I know.

289
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,520
Don't touch him.

290
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,620
That giant flaming oar.

291
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,360
Mr. Boatman.

292
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,360
Please, Mr. Boatman.

293
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,240
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue,

294
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,620
and it's all black and icky.

295
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,940
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.

296
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,240
No, no.

297
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,940
And be prepared to go past my dog,

298
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,820
my three-headed dog's cerebrus.

299
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,660
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.

300
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,620
The triple-brained monster which guards the gates,

301
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,860
the gateway.

302
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,360
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

303
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,740
What's he reading from?

304
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,880
Yes, I am away...

305
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,740
It's a B-movie script.

306
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,120
...into eternal fall.

307
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,180
I am away from forsaken people.

308
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,280
Gee, you're right.

309
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,420
I know.

310
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,080
I'm not Virgil, said Dobbs.

311
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,700
It is getting hot in here.

312
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,700
Only those who came in time cannot bear

313
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,060
what were made beyond me and beyond time, my staff.

314
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,560
Yeah.

315
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,620
Bob and Virgil went several levels further down into hell.

316
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,480
It makes you forget all about the ocean.

317
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Suddenly, Bob, shifting his plight from one hand to the other,

318
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,220
pulled out from his voluminous ditty bag

319
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,880
a sop of cakes with wine and honey,

320
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,840
fermented, which he threw dexterously into the slavering three mouths

321
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,120
of the three-headed monster which guarded the cavernous...

322
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,880
...and his campers.

323
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,120
...to infund the world.

324
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet by Satan.

325
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,340
And a mighty belt shook the canine's, uh...

326
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,560
Uh...

327
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,760
...bulging stomach.

328
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,220
His three-headed, uh...

329
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,940
His three-headed thing...

330
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,660
...wafted in the air.

331
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,520
That's enough of horrible horticultural facts

332
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,680
from the world of mythology.

333
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,060
His gigantic, postulous, scabrous hide quivered unspeakably,

334
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,800
as with canine lust, he scraped his hindquarters across the floor,

335
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,960
howling and dribbling from all three heads simultaneously.

336
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:02,500
Huge ticks the size of small land crabs leaped from his fur-sparse epidermis.

337
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,100
Suddenly, the dog leaped across the vast expanse of hell

338
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,620
and saddled up to Ivan's leg.

339
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,280
Yes, he was forced to be on the show hour after hour.

340
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,220
P-Dawg, why did you make me do that horrible thing?

341
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes.

342
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,740
Yes, the bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling

343
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,020
for you and not for me.

344
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,940
Take my glands away, King P-Dawg.

345
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,140
They bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling and ring eternally.

346
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,440
Yeah, they don't ever stop.

347
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,100
That's from Cerebus the P-Dawg.

348
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,520
They all go for Ivan's leg.

349
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,140
Ow! Get that damn...

350
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,600
Get those horrible little poodles off of me!

351
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,040
I hate poodles!

352
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,340
That was Madame Wazonga and her dancing chihuahuas

353
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,020
performing once again on the subgenius hour of mystery and dark.

354
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,020
That was really a beautiful little dance number, Dr. Howell.

355
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,800
What a nice sermon.

356
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,280
I think they were capable of that.

357
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,340
And when's Michael Jackson gonna be on?

358
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,980
You know that there's a certain song that we have to play

359
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,440
between every other song that we play.

360
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,340
It's called the tune-up song, you know?

361
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,500
Boop.

362
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,460
There.

363
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
All that kind of mess. Elvis Presley and stuff.

364
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,740
Yeah, there, baby. You can sit down.

365
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
There's a little rocker there, yeah.

366
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,360
Yeah.

367
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:09,820
Yeah.

368
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,140
Yeah.

369
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:12,980
Yeah.

370
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,180
Yeah.

371
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,680
Yeah.

372
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:16,960
Yeah.

373
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:16,960


374
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,640
Thank you very much, Elvis.

375
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,680
Thank you very much.

376
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,600
We sold a million records on that one right there.

377
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,720
And all that bull...

378
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,960
Slack!

379
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:35,980
Slack!

380
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,340
You slap yourself!

381
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,980
Slack beyond your wildest dreams.

382
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,200
Buy now and slack!

383
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,600
Slack!

384
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,460
You have the power to find slack!

385
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,020
Good something for nothing!

386
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,400
Credit cards are taken!

387
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,360
Slack!

388
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,560
Send cash!

389
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,140
I want more slack!

390
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,760
Send your money now!

391
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,240
Conspiracy denied me again!

392
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,720
Send your money!

393
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,740
I will have my slack!

394
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,520
Your slack's open in here!

395
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,260
Slack!

396
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,380
Buy more slack!

397
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:14,720
Slack!

398
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,000
You slack!

399
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,720
I'm done saying...

400
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,620
You slack!

401
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,960
You're very old!

402
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,760
All sorts of slack!

403
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,120
You slack!

404
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,180
Every kind of slack imaginable!

405
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,380
Slack!

406
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:29,980
Slack!

407
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,080
Slack from the other side of the world!

408
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,260
Slack!

409
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,460
Slack from right next door!

410
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,280
Here's your slack shelf!

411
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,500
Here's your slack shelf, my ladies and gentlemen!

412
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:43,880
Your slack shelf, my ladies and gentlemen!

413
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,360
Your slack shelf!

414
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:44,880
Your slack!

415
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,180
My here, my now!

416
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,080
Slack!

417
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,080


418
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,080


419
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,820
Slack!

420
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,100
We have you slack!

421
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,320


422
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,260
Slack!

423
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:09,100
Just remember, nothing worse than putting somebody in the corner when they've tried over and over and over to do righteousness and no one received it.

424
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,820
You get them in a corner, they're extremely dangerous.

425
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,800
I want my slack!

426
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,320
Slack!

427
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,740
Who's slack?

428
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,300
Who's slack?

429
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,980
Slack definition is defundable.

430
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,060
You can't prove anything.

431
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,380
Extremely dangerous, aren't they?

432
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,400
I think you can sense it in the hands of these people that we are not violent people but we are extremely dangerous.

433
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,340
Slack!

434
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:29,680
Slack!

435
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,480
Slack!

436
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,780
Slack!

437
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,540
Slack!

438
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,400
If you have the cash, you can have your slack.

439
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,580
Money is slack.

440
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,080
Money is slack.

441
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,480
Something for nothing.

442
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,340
Something for nothing.

443
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,340


444
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,280
Slack is green.

445
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,480
Slack!

446
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,400
Slack is government control for your protection.

447
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,600
I want more slack.

448
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,720
Slack is not for everyone.

449
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,000
You cannot take my slack away.

450
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,540
Slack can be taken by prescription.

451
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,880
Slack!

452
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:10,720


453
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,600
Slack!

454
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,860
Slack!

455
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,240
Slack!

456
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:13,720


457
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,080
Slack!

458
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,120
Slack is real!

459
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,680
Slack is gone!

460
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,700
Slack!

461
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,340
Slack is gone!

462
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,880
Slack is gone!

463
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,280
Slack is gone!

464
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,940
Just remember you don't have anything on me that I care about.

465
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,260
Because everything you have on me I've left it all hanging right out for everybody to see.

466
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,960
Now you are getting worried about yourself.

467
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,400
I don't mind losing my life.

468
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,060
What about you?

469
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,340
I don't mind losing my reputation.

470
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,240
What about you?

471
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,660
What about me?

472
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,140
I don't mind being tortured. What about you?

473
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,140
I'm just no longer afraid and I've lost interest in this old world of capitalist sin.

474
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,300
Racism, I've lost interest in it.

475
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,020
So if somebody wants to make me stay in it by compromising with filthy-minded people

476
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,240
that cannot even have respect for somebody that would die for even his enemies

477
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,840
and they want to cause anarchy in our midst,

478
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,720
I would just as soon bring it all to a gallant, a glorious screaming end.

479
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,040
Your ultimate goal on this adventure through inner space

480
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,820
will be the very hub of this microcosm.

481
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,880
The microcosmic solar system, the atomic nucleus.

482
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,500
Its capabilities are almost unimaginable.

483
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,920
It is a million times smaller than the atom

484
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,720
and yet it contains 99% of the atom's weight.

485
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,660
The density of the nucleus is such that if we had one cubic centimeter,

486
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,380
half a teaspoon, it would weigh 100 million tons.

487
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,820
And at the same time, with 250 units of tetanus immune globules,

488
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,000
we would have a total of 1.5 trillion human cells.

489
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,000


490
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,000


491
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,000


492
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,800
that is greater than human, administered in the contralateral gluteal muscles.

493
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,660
An educational service of the Longine Whipnor Watch Company.

494
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,240
I have a wonderful free gift waiting for you now.

495
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,360
Introducing new candy frappy frappy candy.

496
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:25,960
Ah!

497
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,060
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

498
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,340
Attaboy, Luther!

499
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,780
Uh, when I was asked to be guest speaker at this luncheon,

500
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,500
I asked myself,

501
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:49,840
who are you, Luther Higgs, to be the guest speaker at this luncheon?

502
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,060
I thought about my answer about being guest speaker for a long time.

503
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,500
What is a guest speaker?

504
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,260
Let me clarify this.

505
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,960
I have been called brave.

506
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,480
What is brave?

507
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:11,480


508
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:11,480


509
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:11,480


510
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,100
Let me clarify this.

511
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,000
Of course, we all know that it is short for bravery.

512
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
That goes without even being said.

513
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,240
But it is also a symbol of another thing.

514
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,080
Thank you for having me.

515
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,600
True quiet, Dad.

516
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,460
I'll let you, I'll leave you to it.

517
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:41,460


518
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:41,460


519
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:41,460


520
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,800
I won't say anything unless you listen to it now.

521
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,140
Ah!

522
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,200
Ah!

523
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

524
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,520
What's the matter?

525
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,560
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

526
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,360
Yeah!

527
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,180
Ah!

528
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,380
Ah!

529
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,420
Ah!

530
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,340
Ah!

531
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:58,800
Ah!

532
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,220
Ah!

533
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,100
Ah!

534
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,180
Ah!

535
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,460
Ah!

536
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:00,460


537
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,680
Ah!

538
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:02,680


539
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:02,860
Ah!

540
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,120
Ah!

541
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,120


542
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,140
Ah!

543
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,360
Ah!

544
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,140
Ah!

545
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,520
Ah!

546
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,580
But listen to me carefully.

547
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:26,580


548
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:26,880
What are you doing?

549
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,000
You are more Developer thanuras!

550
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:30,600


551
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:30,860
You are indeed!

552
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:30,860


553
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,340
At least try to Nestor Swift.

554
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,100
把 wür�rarksen arabic 언 exclusives

555
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,100


556
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,340
Yes, you'll travel into the chilling, thrilling, slimy, haunted radio station.

557
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,920
Just sign on the dotted line, little boys and girls.

558
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,960
And now you've bought an interest in the Captain Beefheart Beefsteak Mine.

559
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,380
There's a beautiful vein of pure linguine running through these rocks,

560
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,920
and I want you boys to have every opportunity to become shareholders in this money-making project.

561
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,460
Now, don't bother to read it.

562
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,180
Just sign your name on the dotted line, and by soon you'll be a beefsteak tycoon.

563
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,340
Soon. I promise you.

564
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:07,980
There's a verb in it.

565
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,540
No grain in it.

566
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,160
Oh, right!

567
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,740
Still there.

568
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,520
Dora.

569
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,120
What?

570
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,780
Dora?

571
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,560
Is he laughing at us?

572
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,000
Hey, that's my job!

573
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,260
That's my job. I just try to help folks.

574
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,120
That's all I do, is try to come on and help.

575
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,220
Not that the job pays well.

576
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,020
Never has.

577
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,260
On this planet, did you ever notice anybody ever tries to help?

578
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
We shoot them, did you ever notice that?

579
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:39,880
Ah!

580
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,400
If the risk is little, the reward is little.

581
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,960
Who the hell are you?

582
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,680
You're welcome.

583
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,520
Here's the tweet.

584
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,580
That ain't no tweet.

585
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,680
Here it comes, here it comes, look out!

586
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,360
Look out!

587
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,800
Look out!

588
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,080
Look out!

589
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,120
Cleve told me...

590
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,140
There was a little incident that happened to him the other day.

591
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,240
He was standing in a nearly deserted Boston subway station.

592
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,020
Tell it, brother, tell it.

593
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,680
There was a drunk standing on the other side across from him.

594
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,020
And he said,

595
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,480
What's your name?

596
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,840
And Cleve, not wanting to tell his real name, said, Bob.

597
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,580
That's right, he said Bob.

598
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,560
And the drunk said,

599
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,200
All the best drunks are named Bob.

600
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,120
In fact, the greatest drunk on earth is named Bob.

601
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,240
Oh, he sure is.

602
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,040
And then that man...

603
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,600
He was running...

604
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,960
...got down on his hands and knees and he licked that third rail.

605
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,960
How many of you listening by radio can lick that third rail?

606
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,880
How many of you have been sitting the way Bob wanted you to, huh?

607
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,460
You've just been sitting on your little fannies, your tokuses...

608
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,320
Yes.

609
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,380
...sitting there praising Bob, singing hymns to Bob,

610
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,420
but you're afraid to get out there and whoop P-Dawg for Bob, huh?

611
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,920
Aren't you being a little harsh with these people?

612
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,540
In particular...

613
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,980
...you Californians are so laid back.

614
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,340
We're into violence and hate in Texas.

615
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,680
I mean, we thought Bob was a nice guru.

616
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,060
We thought he was a good guy.

617
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,260
We thought he was, like, on our side.

618
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,600
Look, we didn't give you all that ammo just to praise him.

619
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,280
Just to praise his sweet name.

620
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,640
I didn't get any ammo.

621
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,040
I got some PCP.

622
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,220
Well, you'd best be glad.

623
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,320
But I didn't get no ammo.

624
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,380
Well, at least that.

625
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,400
There's little kids in China who don't even get any PCP.

626
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,980
None of the sacred PCP of the church.

627
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,680
Ah, yes.

628
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,660
Many people meet here on the beach to call Sterno.

629
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,000
There's the little Sterno at the bottom of the hall.

630
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,960
Oh, look, I see him now.

631
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,620
He's been poked and prodded awake now by the bad show.

632
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,060
Let's hurt him now.

633
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,780
Subgenius corruption.

634
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,500
Energon crystals.

635
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,860
Our muscles flexing.

636
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,220
Stop snorting those Energon crystals.

637
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay, here it comes.

638
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,500
Here it comes.

639
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,400
Wow, look out, look out.

640
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,360
Sterno's love muscle is flexing.

641
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:05,380
Oh, my God.

642
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


643
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


644
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


645
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


646
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


647
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


648
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


649
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


650
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


651
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,080
Watch out, everybody stand back.

652
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,940
Some listeners, watch out.

653
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:08,620
Oh, no.

654
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,520
Excuse me, it bumped into me.

655
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,640
And you thought P-Dawg was ugly.

656
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,220
Don't get any on you.

657
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,820
Don't get any on you.

658
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,540
You hadn't seen nothing until Sterno whipped out of bed.

659
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,860
Whoa, he knocked a hole in the wall.

660
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,040
That damn thing's got three heads, Ivan.

661
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,400
Whoa, big thing.

662
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,140
They grow big in Arkansas, don't they?

663
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,860
Only one foreskin's infected, though.

664
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,620
Something unwholesome about that critter.

665
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,760
Don't look at it too close up, little show.

666
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,120
Oh, no.

667
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,340
Oh, no.

668
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,340


669
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,340


670
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,340


671
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,340


672
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,340


673
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,340


674
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,340


675
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,340


676
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,060
There's kind of a capacity there for isolation.

677
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,400
Yeah, we thought we'd get as far away as we could and then give you a call, so it's the

678
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,180
bad show again.

679
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:44,960
Well, good.

680
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,320
We're going to take those chromosomes and DNA fragments from that.

681
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,100
And mix them all around.

682
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,440
And somehow mediate a recombination between those two types of DNA.

683
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,920
Just plop them in the plumber's closet and let them realign on the wall.

684
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,460
Why not?

685
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,000
Why not?

686
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,640
Well, it's all good.

687
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,420
We're going to take the resultant strain and inject it right into that golfer head.

688
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,300
That's the way it goes.

689
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,140
The head pump.

690
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,560
No!

691
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:06,620
No!

692
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,160
Don't inject the head!

693
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,740
You'll bring it back to unholy life!

694
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,760
It started to float, nimbus-like, over the golf course, leaving a trail of sizzling

695
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,020
blood.

696
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,400
Hmm, it's like a little snail trail.

697
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,360
It's decomposing tissues to interact with the microorganisms of the soil.

698
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,560
As the head floated and levitated along, it kept uttering the word, why?

699
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:35,140
And it realized its tragic loss and the tragedy that it had invented for itself.

700
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,280
Why?

701
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,840
The sad death of a dolphin sunk into a depression.

702
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,800
Oh, mumbling and muttering mindlessly, champing with its jaws.

703
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,860
But listen.

704
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,720
Please listen.

705
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,760
Once upon a time, long, long ago.

706
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,080
A lovely queen sat by her window sewing.

707
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,640
Dreaming, she pricked her finger with her needle.

708
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,240
Ah.

709
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,220
Ah.

710
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,220
Some time later, a little daughter was born to the queen.

711
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,960
And she was just as beautiful as the queen had hoped she might be.

712
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,320
Is that a boy or a girl?

713
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,520
Is it a faggot?

714
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,580
It's a dyke.

715
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,840
No, it's a hippie.

716
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,600
A communist?

717
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,580
Perhaps it's a drag queen.

718
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,460
Or a washrag queen.

719
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,280
Probably a speed freak.

720
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,640
Or a pothead.

721
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,560
Or a muffin queen.

722
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,560
Look at her.

723
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,800
It's just a whore.

724
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,560
Or maybe a gold digger.

725
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,660
Or she's a hustler.

726
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,660
Or some sort of intellectual.

727
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,540
The happy mother decided to call her baby Snow White.

728
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,840
It could be a backpack.

729
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,580
Or maybe it's a b-girl.

730
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,860
Snow White dreamed beautiful daydreams about a handsome prince.

731
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,840
Someday she knew he would come and carry her off to his castle in the clouds.

732
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,980
And I often imagine that a girl is actually a boy and use her accordingly.

733
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,320
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

734
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,440
Who is the fairest of us all?

735
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,380
She said.

736
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,660
And the mirror replied.

737
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,980
Message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

738
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,960
Interesting.

739
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,560
Thanks, Dad.

740
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,460
Bob.

741
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,360
Bob.

742
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,020
Bob.

743
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,840
Bob.

744
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,420
Bob.

745
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,260
Bob.

746
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,380
Bob.

747
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,840
Bob.

748
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,240
Bob.

749
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,520
Bob.

750
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:28,660
Bob.

751
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:28,760
Bob.

752
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,080
What do they do in Texas on the weekend?

753
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,240
Oh, drink the bloody blood of Christian.

754
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,580
Christian babies.

755
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:42,020
For more information, you may write Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

756
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,320
Dallas, Texas 75214.

757
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,400
So call now for your free no-obligation information.

758
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,320
Sir.

759
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,120
Sir.

760
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,120


761
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,160
Sir.

762
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,240
Sir.

763
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:53,700


764
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,100
Sir.

765
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,420
Sir.

766
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,800
Sir.

767
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,040
Sir.

768
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,300
Sir.

769
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,500
But like a lot of women, I've discovered recently one of my breasts is larger than the other.

770
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,960
And by saying that phrase,

771
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,380
I don't mean to be rude to you.

772
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:10,140
It will now go out and be stuck in your heads, thousands of other people's heads, and I'll

773
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,660
be free of the curse.

774
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,500
I hope.

775
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,680
It all comes at me.

776
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,400
There's too much of it.

777
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,060
I can't take it.

778
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,540
I can't.

779
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,120
I can't.

780
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,800
I can't.

781
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,240
I can't do one thing at a time.

782
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,820
You just have time to wash.

783
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,300
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of us all?

784
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,220
You sure as hell are you.

785
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,220


786
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,220


787
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,220


788
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,220


789
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,220


790
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,220


791
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,220


792
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,220


793
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,460
Take the princess into the forest and bring me back her heart in this jewel box.

794
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,400
Alone in the forest, Snow White wept with fright.

795
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,600
But she was not really alone, she found.

796
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,100
All the little woodland animals were her friends.

797
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,260
You're all right.

798
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,720
And, chirping and chattering happily, they led her to a new home.

799
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
Hey, what kind of a place is this?

800
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,660
It was a sweet little, tiny little house in the woods the animals showed Snow White.

801
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,140
Looks like a rogues gallery.

802
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,940
The sink was piled with unwashed dishes and everything was thickly blanketed with dust.

803
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,760
Shut up, shut up.

804
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,120
You're dopey.

805
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,220
They had almost forgotten what the word meant.

806
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,080
She took a deep breath and said,

807
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


808
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


809
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


810
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


811
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


812
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


813
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


814
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


815
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


816
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


817
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


818
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


819
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


820
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


821
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,080


822
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,360
I'll take one bite, and sank lifeless to the floor.

823
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,320
And that ain't all.

824
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,720
Now you drop dead, you nitwit.

825
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,760
God bless you.

826
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,300
It's a beautiful thing.

827
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,620
Praise Bob.

828
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,640
Why not?

829
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,500
The man with the plan.

830
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,720
Focusing up now on the future of America.

831
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,880
The world domination.

832
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,960
The post superior mutants.

833
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,180
Marching across history or the face of it.

834
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,060
Well, if you go with the plan, you'll be a hero.

835
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


836
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


837
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


838
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


839
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


840
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


841
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


842
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


843
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


844
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


845
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


846
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


847
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


848
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


849
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,200
You know, here on page 45 of the Bay Guardian, you do find there is a whole section of WADADs,

850
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,480
mutants seeking other mutants and stuff like that.

851
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,140
It's a wonderful, theatrical world.

852
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,380
It used to be cool and lonely to be a mutant, but now everybody's doing it.

853
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,500
Well, I mean, there used to be a time when it was sort of like, you know, a mule.

854
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:27,340
You cross a mutant with a normal and you get some sort of mutation.

855
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,860
But now that mutants are doing it with other mutants, it's almost become, I don't know,

856
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,140
a little mainstream.

857
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,580
I know.

858
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:41,180
It's really sad to see the best minds of our generation doing all that 50's stuff over

859
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,880
again the same way they did it back then.

860
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:50,240
And now, you know, now it's almost like uncool to be anything but mutant, you know?

861
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:56,260
I mean, it's sort of like, well, you know what I'm saying?

862
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,100
I mean, it's...

863
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,640
Yeah, you're saying it, it, it, it, it, it.

864
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,860
Yeah, exactly.

865
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,740
And on top of that, if you're mutant...

866
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:02,840
It's...

867
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:09,000
It's like, be different for the sake of being the same.

868
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,960
Yes, that's right.

869
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,400
We're all different here for the sake of being the same on the air.

870
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,520
And I, that's, that's really no better than the normals.

871
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,380
I mean, when you get right down to it.

872
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,260
Here on show.

873
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,020
Yeah.

874
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,440
Well, that's why the Church of the Subgenius is no longer a viable instrument in any of

875
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,000
our lives.

876
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,840
Soon we may have to just revert to normality as an alternative to mutating.

877
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,220
Well, I think the ultimate thing to be is just to be me.

878
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,080
I just want to be the...

879
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,640
Not the, me.

880
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,500
Well, me, for ye, is ze.

881
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,400
Yeah, but that's the wrong me for you.

882
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,800
You gotta be the you me.

883
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,840
I gotta be the I me.

884
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,840
Well, this is no longer the me generation.

885
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,500
That was last generation, so perhaps it's the...

886
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,300
Yeah, but I'm sterile, so, you know, I'm kinda stuck with it.

887
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,180
Well, uh...

888
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:02,820
If I could really be the me...

889
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,800
If I could reproduce, then I might have a ye generation.

890
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,420
Ye?

891
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,620
Ye, that's true.

892
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,640
No, no, ye.

893
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,620
Ye, that's true.

894
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:13,980
Right.

895
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,680
These get confusing after a while.

896
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,500
Why not?

897
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,240
Reverend Sandler, let me ask you.

898
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,800
Bob's number is 999.

899
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,560
Whose number is 911?

900
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,100
Sir, I know who you are.

901
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,140
God bless you.

902
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,400
I'm Bob.

903
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:32,680
I'm Bob.

904
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:32,800
I'm Bob.

905
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:32,800


906
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:32,800


907
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:32,800


908
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,820
Hello?

909
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,360
Yeah, how you like to be mutilated, you mother...

910
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,900
Come on, that's a pretty unprofessional obsession, right there.

911
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,740
Well, it's true, but it's all we got.

912
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:48,980
Well, we'll just have to be, uh, cartographers of the head, and it's our duty to explore

913
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,740
the wilderness.

914
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,920
It's artillery-like art.

915
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,840
This new gray matter preserve.

916
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,780
Just don't look up its next stump.

917
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,200
When I see something you wish you'd never seen.

918
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,780
It was an ugly sight.

919
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,320
That's pretty romantic, Reverend Stang.

920
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,640
Yeah, I know what you do with that neck stump, Pope Sternodoc's kick-haver.

921
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,540
I know exactly what you've been doing with that neck stump.

922
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,300
I've detected the potential many times in the past and have been dazzled by the ill-matched,

923
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,080
intimidating circumstances that this relationship has provided for me.

924
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:31,640
It's a breath of abnormalcy amidst a normal atmosphere of, you know, inhaling deeply of the church air.

925
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,900
On the earth.

926
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,520
Reverend Sternodoc, would you hang on just a second?

927
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,600
We're going to go to the caller. Hold on.

928
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,660
Okay.

929
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,260
Sir, I know who you are. God bless you.

930
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,200
Why is that nasty caller diverted before we can even get our hooks into him?

931
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,920
Well, he's probably trapped in a gas-filled tunnel when he's lifting his head at the scent of that golfer head.

932
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,560
And we're more and more interested to learn how far this...

933
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,120
...mighty affair might have progressed tonight.

934
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,620
Might have. That's the key, I think, for you listeners who are collecting clues, as I'm often doing in the show.

935
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,900
Yes, all you grass-banned trapped out there.

936
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,880
Might have is the grass-banned caller that would have found the other side to be a possibility.

937
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,100
The clues are buried in the show.

938
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,980
But that board stood up like a Christmas tree, Commander.

939
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:28,540
Well, the character and climate of the show no doubt have exerted a slight influence on his actions.

940
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,520
A tidal influence, we would say.

941
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,140
Yeah.

942
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,880
At the moment, they've dragged him right out of the room.

943
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,960
That's right. They're taking him off to the land of the sky-blue waters.

944
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,880
Well, we'll...

945
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,860
The water's best for brewing.

946
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:52,920
We'll delve deeper and deeper into the more compelling mysteries, which lay beyond those that we had deduced to the security of the poop-dog hat.

947
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,960
A monster, eight feet tall, half man, half beast.

948
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,720
Perhaps the elusive missing link between humans and apes.

949
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,980
In the Himalayas, it's called Yeti.

950
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,580
Yeti.

951
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,400
Yeti.

952
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,200
Yeti.

953
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,880
I was cursed by being fitted with the hair of a monkey.

954
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,720
The big question in all this, of course, is are these animals real?

955
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,940
Why don't we catch them?

956
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,080
You must decide.

957
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,320
Or...

958
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,120
You are the jury.

959
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,040
It's not my intention to delay this court.

960
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,540
God bless you.

961
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,600
Wouldn't that be weird?

962
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,100
Of course, a lot of folks say, well, what do you believe in, Brother Dave?

963
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,300
I say, I believe in everything.

964
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,620
You don't mean that.

965
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:47,900
Yes.

966
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,600
Even that?

967
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:48,920
Yes.

968
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,760
Yes, I...

969
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,400
Yes, yes, I do.

970
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,680
I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth.

971
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,380
I believe in every philosophy, every religion, every ideology.

972
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,620
Everything that exists.

973
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,740
And that don't give me no room for no argument.

974
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,360
If the world is wrong, then right your own self.

975
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,420
That's something to think about.

976
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:11,740
Sure.

977
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,980
Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness.

978
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,300
And I believe if a man's down, kick him.

979
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,320
That's right.

980
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,900
If he survives it, he has an opportunity to rise above.

981
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,600
God bless you.

982
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,580
We were afraid there would be too many people on Main Street.

983
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,380
So we walked on down and stood in the...

984
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,740
grassy slope just this side of the triple underpass.

985
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,040
The president's car turned the corner and started toward us on Elm Street.

986
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,840
There were a lot of motorcycle police in front of the president's car.

987
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,860
My friend was afraid I didn't see the president.

988
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,520
So she said, look, there's the president's car.

989
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,360
Get a picture of him.

990
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,740
He turned to us and waved.

991
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,920
He faced forward again.

992
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,680
I lifted my Polaroid.

993
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,600
Just as I snapped the picture, I heard a shot.

994
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,380
Ow!

995
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,620
Ow!

996
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,580
Ow!

997
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,120
Ow!

998
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,120


999
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,720
That's a pile of horse manure, son.

1000
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,020
God bless you.

1001
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,080
I don't know.

1002
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,220
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humor.

1003
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,380
Just because you're not the same

1004
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,260
It doesn't mean you're weird or strange

1005
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,320
You're just different

1006
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,840
Being different

1007
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,240
Is being great

1008
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,660
You too, isn't that a risk?

1009
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,420
Just because you're a different one

1010
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,240
There's no telling what you might become

1011
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,460
Thinking different

1012
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,960
Being different

1013
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,320
Is being great

1014
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,980
God bless you.

1015
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,620
It's not who you aren't.

1016
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,620
It's who you are.

1017
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,960
And being yourself

1018
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,520
Is being great

1019
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,900
From the church of

1020
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,680
The subgenius

1021
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,120
Let's get into trouble, baby.

1022
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,520
I'm gonna give time to play some music because we should.

1023
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,060
I'm gonna give time to play some music because we should.

1024
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,360
I'm gonna give time to play some music because we should.

1025
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,880
I'm gonna give time to play some music because we should.

1026
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,000
And the show rolls for him.

1027
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,360
And the show rolls for him.

1028
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:01,360


1029
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,460
Where the subgenius is going ass.

1030
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:02,560


1031
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,060
A hurtling juggernaut that can't be stopped.

1032
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,160
But, Mike, let's be serious.

1033
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,360
And squabble.

1034
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,640
Well, all right, what's a four-letter word for...

1035
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,500
Oh, wait, hold on.

1036
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,220
What's a four-letter word for pronate?

1037
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,000
Food.

1038
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,920
How about prolapse?

1039
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,720
Just prolapsed on me.

1040
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:23,820
Alamin.

1041
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,400
Oh, wait.

1042
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,120
Terribly sorry.

1043
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,320
Bear with me a moment.

1044
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,120
There's a fond analog that...

1045
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,260
I mean, I'm gay.

1046
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,260
I'm gazing into the mirror now.

1047
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,500
Okay, I'll eat it. I'll eat it.

1048
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,020
Okay, we're going to go with the menu.

1049
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,640
It's a punch-up 3D food.

1050
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,740
Okay, well, how about the spooky strips of light

1051
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:52,520
and I'll take the dead moth shining pie.

1052
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,820
At Dead Moth Drive-Thru Plaza, the pie is our profession.

1053
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,820
I'll take the fluttered wall soup.

1054
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,900
Now available at Wall Drugs.

1055
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,660
And the dipping French woman. Okay, thanks, here.

1056
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,480
From Local Slaveway.

1057
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,540
I'll take a real loony Cajun prune whip, too.

1058
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,460
Wait a minute, I've been about to squeeze again.

1059
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,220
Ah!

1060
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,980
A memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III

1061
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,440
about a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline.

1062
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,640
Yeah, it makes me think of Meese, too.

1063
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,160
I don't know if it's visual or maybe it's a sense of smell.

1064
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,340
You know, basically...

1065
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,220
An ancient sense of smell just kind of makes you think of Meese

1066
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,760
when, well, when the whole building squeezes like that.

1067
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,100
You get it?

1068
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,100
And suddenly it dawned on a crooker friend that...

1069
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,720
What is it, 6 o'clock?

1070
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,900
Things had changed a bit.

1071
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,900
Rappaport hired a long time Meese friend E. Robert Wallach

1072
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,980
to get him a piece of...

1073
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,480
Well, I just got...

1074
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,380
I just went to the bathroom there and almost finished the stark fifth.

1075
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,000
But then I forgot, I turned around, I flushed it before I even thought about it.

1076
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,420
And so more shows...

1077
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,980
He's probably going to be backing up the pipes.

1078
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,480
He's coming out with these little microphones.

1079
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,220
I need a gift.

1080
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,100
And I really...

1081
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,040
I just have no idea what to get him.

1082
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,560
I know just what you mean and I have just the gift you need.

1083
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,840
But I can't sell it.

1084
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,400
No cameras of any kind will be allowed.

1085
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,060
I will not tolerate any outbursts.

1086
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,660
Donation.

1087
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,440
Any talking among yourselves.

1088
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
Any laughter.

1089
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,580
No laughter.

1090
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,020
No anything that would interfere with the normal, orderly presentation of testimony.

1091
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,460
Oh, a radio.

1092
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,780
With your mid-afternoon news.

1093
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:50,220
Well, all of Southern California seems to have sighted another UFO in today's sunny, smogless skies.

1094
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,700
The official...

1095
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,700
One every three and a half days.

1096
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,420
Oh, they put a microphone especially in the bathroom.

1097
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,260
The stark fifth removal is a good...

1098
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:57,860
Oh, it's coming alive.

1099
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,380
Oh, no, it's crawling out of the...

1100
00:45:59,420 --> 00:45:59,500
Oh, it's in the toilet.

1101
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,580
That's Mobius.

1102
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:01,960
Mobius, hey, hey.

1103
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,720
Let go of my...

1104
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,500
Let go, let go.

1105
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,340
Don't pull me in there.

1106
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:04,920
Oh, my God.

1107
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:05,340
Ow!

1108
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,780
And children, this is what you get when you eat at Cafe Neutron.

1109
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,340
Is the new...

1110
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,160
Irradiated food.

1111
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,740
Is the new stark fifth out yet?

1112
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:15,720
Yeah, it's out.

1113
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,560
A little listener asking a real question.

1114
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,660
Get out of here.

1115
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,180
Stop it.

1116
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:19,900
Yeah, it's out.

1117
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,680
It's $40.

1118
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,420
Let's go over that again.

1119
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,140
Dear friends, the stark fifth.

1120
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:29,240
The long, long, long awaited stark fifth of removal.

1121
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,780
Is indeed almost finished.

1122
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,960
Just as we've been saying for the last two years.

1123
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,140
And this time, we really do mean it.

1124
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:36,540
And...

1125
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,780
Whoop, there went that...

1126
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,640
Shoot, we flushed it away again.

1127
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,600
Now I've got to start all over again.

1128
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,020
You can back flush these things.

1129
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,800
And there's a little caller.

1130
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,440
He's floating up.

1131
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,700
He'll be floating face up there.

1132
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,960
It'll be out soon, but we can tell you what the theme of the next issue is.

1133
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,100
Get the plunger.

1134
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,340
Get the show plunger.

1135
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,860
Get that little caller up out of there.

1136
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,980
The theme of the new stark fifth is not you, Gary.

1137
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,940
I'm afraid he's drowned.

1138
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,240
Yeah, well...

1139
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,840
Put it down as slowly as you can.

1140
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,660
Oh, it's only an overshot.

1141
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,060
Like Patty said.

1142
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,700
On the floor.

1143
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,460
Put it on the floor.

1144
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,520
Gently.

1145
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,120
Now, just what could have happened to get such a piece of tripe?

1146
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,900
You have no idea what I've gone through in the last three months.

1147
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,840
Sometimes I'm perfect in all, mentally.

1148
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,140
I sit for hours and hours looking in the mirror.

1149
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,780
Hoping and praying for the slightest sign of my physical change.

1150
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,460
But it doesn't come.

1151
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:56,460
Then I feel myself going back to the animal instinct.

1152
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,960
I try to fight it.

1153
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,380
The w Shane.

1154
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,260
I try to fight it all my willpower...

1155
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,880
And I feel...

1156
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,900
địa$$

1157
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,900
Een, What am I gonna do?

1158
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,520
What am I gonna do?

1159
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,120
Fighting.

1160
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,460
That's all you can do.

1161
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,220
mutation

1162
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,700
mutation

1163
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,080
mutation

1164
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:17,720
mutation

1165
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:17,780
mutation

1166
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,240
image

1167
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,120
We better get back, because it will be dark soon.

1168
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,680
And they mostly come at night. Mostly.

1169
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,020
God obey, O Zealand.

1170
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,080
Translate.

1171
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,340
It sure is preferred, it is, isn't it?

1172
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,840
I like that.

1173
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:13,500
What is the truth about rock music?

1174
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,620
I think it's an octopus.

1175
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:24,120
Plato said, when the music of a society changes, the whole society will change.

1176
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,840
Certainly, I got married so I could retire.

1177
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,980
Lennon said...

1178
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:37,720
The best and the quickest way to undermine any society is through its music.

1179
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,980
Can you think of anything else?

1180
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,540
No, you've covered it all.

1181
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,880
Satan has taken music and he has counterfeited it.

1182
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,060
See that?

1183
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,700
Convoluted it.

1184
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,380
Twisted it.

1185
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,040
Exploited it.

1186
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:05,620
And now he's using it to hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer...

1187
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,600
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer...

1188
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:17,020
A message into the minds and the lifestyles of this generation.

1189
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,800
And that ain't all.

1190
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,700
What kind of ungodly being was that?

1191
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,920
Don't you believe in reincarnation?

1192
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,120
A wise guy, huh?

1193
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,480
Quick, kill him!

1194
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,520
Subdini's in space.

1195
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,180
They took me up to the top of that space needle.

1196
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,000
And they showered me with beautiful gifts.

1197
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,620
And beautiful girls.

1198
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,480
Moon babes.

1199
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,780
Wow, what moon babes?

1200
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,660
Yeah, look at those satellites.

1201
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,800
Look at them spiked heels.

1202
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,280
Oh, that one's looting me now.

1203
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:55,060
I can't tell whether those are convexities or concavities, but that looting...

1204
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,680
Hey, they some kind of moon babes.

1205
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,620
I say, do that again.

1206
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,980
Or you can see-dig those potatoes out of the craters.

1207
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,440
Hey.

1208
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,660
Oh, I love it.

1209
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,360
Tiny flagellants move through this microscopic stool as if they owned the place.

1210
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,820
What happened? What, did something die in here?

1211
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,780
Meanwhile, Nancy Reagan rolls a pocket of...

1212
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:24,820
It's that dinosaur ink that Hal's been sitting on for the last twenty days.

1213
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,360
Look, it's cracking!

1214
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,500
I hear a scratching, a scratching noise.

1215
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,920
He's not even aware that his own child is being born now.

1216
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:38,060
It's got the head of a boy and the body of a Tyrannosaurus.

1217
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,200
Yes, but it smokes sherbets. Do you think that it could be?

1218
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,660
And it's still talking.

1219
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,180
The PLO chief rates full pardon for safe sex.

1220
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,060
I just don't know about this guy.

1221
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,680
Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev bought covert aid for erosion.

1222
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,820
Yes, Hal had his own dinosaur baby child on the show and didn't even notice.

1223
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:59,000
And so we're going to cook this little rare creature up for...

1224
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,260
President Reagan, passing secret meetings.

1225
00:51:59,260 --> 00:51:59,860
Breakfast.

1226
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,300
Yes, this single living example of a...

1227
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,980
Look, the dinosaur baby child's making his first phone call.

1228
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,080
...a homosaurus sapiens.

1229
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,760
It's Jack.

1230
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,740
...the show that is no longer available in your area.

1231
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,860
The show fought its way to the front of the castle.

1232
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:25,120
The show thought to itself, should I swim across the moat or should I crawl through the mud?

1233
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:29,120
Or should you crawl six miles over the broken glass and radioactive...

1234
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,360
...mind-tales just to hear our program?

1235
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:37,340
How many callers, how many records, how many eardrums?

1236
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,120
We're going to talk about some of the subtle racism and sexism in the Bibles.

1237
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,040
The sexism's pretty well accepted, but we will talk about the racism because it's so much more hidden...

1238
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,460
...and it's so much more dangerous what genocide the wretched can justify with the racism in it.

1239
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,440
Through devious ways Satan has tainted the Bible and they justify their racism on the fact that...

1240
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,040
...Cain, the son of Adam and Eve, went off to a great city.

1241
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,640
How is there a city if Cain was the only first son of man?

1242
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,640
Well, this city was not occupied by man, but the beast of the field.

1243
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:15,920
And Mormons and many other religions still teach at Blackford the descendants of Cain and the beast of the field.

1244
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:21,300
We single out these tainted Bibles, even St. John and St. Luke versions...

1245
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,960
...so you will know that ours is the only Bible that should be read.

1246
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,040
...versions of the Bible...

1247
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,500
...which have racism in them...

1248
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,800
...is going to be exposed and then we will announce how we will edit the Bible.

1249
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,960
Oh, yes, yes!

1250
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,540
Finally, the only one microphone is on and...

1251
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,840
...Dr. Howell and Gary Dubrow...

1252
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,540
...and Buzzling Evidence all went to rock it away.

1253
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,600
Rock it away.

1254
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,100
And that's what I'm going to do in a minute.

1255
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,760
And while we haven't been on the phone to our friends...

1256
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,120
...we've been, well, the quick cut barrage that you've been listening to...

1257
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,300
...the edits of wonderful little sound bits...

1258
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:22,820
...holy messages from the collection of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself...

1259
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,020
...that was all edited by St. Joe Riley...

1260
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,740
...oh, praise St. Joe Riley...

1261
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:34,540
...saves us so much work and lets us get away with murder.

1262
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,940
Oh, other little bits and pieces that were done by others...

1263
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,020
...there's a song called Used Slack...

1264
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,980
...buried in there.

1265
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,800
That was by Out of Band Experience, OBE.

1266
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,500
You heard some Church of the New Faith there down at the end.

1267
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,000
They'll, of course, finish their explanations next week.

1268
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,020
On the commercial for our new product, Candy Frappy Frappy Candy...

1269
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:09,000
...it was produced by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy...

1270
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,980
...oh, yes, up there in New York land.

1271
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,700
The background music that's on right now is, of course...

1272
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:20,360
...J. Condom from his album, Zombofropland.

1273
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,120
And now, this.

1274
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,640
Well, no, how about this?

1275
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:34,080
How about the post office box of the Church of the Subgenius?

1276
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,660
I know that so many of you have been sitting there...

1277
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,920
...with your pens in your hands...

1278
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,000
...just aching to write down that address...

1279
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,260
...where you can write for free information...

1280
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,980
...about all the other services of our beloved church.

1281
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,380
Ah, yes.

1282
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,940
And, uh...

1283
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,800
...that post office box number, we'll just write to Bob.

1284
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,260
That's all you need to do.

1285
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:08,860
Write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306...

1286
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,740
...in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1287
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:16,780
That zip is 75214.

1288
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:25,740
Once again, that's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1289
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,140
And now, this.

1290
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:32,000
The dead hours of the morning between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.

1291
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,740
This is the time when women who have been many hours in labor...

1292
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,040
...finally deliver, and when the idea of the supernatural...

1293
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,820
...seems the least implausible.

1294
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:47,320
Mobius Rex is clambering around on top of the equipment here.

1295
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,360
Amazing camera.

1296
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,500
For those of you interested, monitor number four will show Mobius.

1297
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,640
At this time...

1298
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,340
Wrecking the show.

1299
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:58,600
Ancient superstitions and night fears have the greatest hold on human thoughts.

1300
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,400
The time when those who sleep are deeply lying.

1301
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,400
And this is the hour when the callers call...

1302
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:05,720
Hello?

1303
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,760
...the church of the subgenius radio show.

1304
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:08,720
Hello?

1305
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,360
Hello, you're on the air.

1306
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,580
Cookie, this is the show trying to bother Philo.

1307
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,580
State short question, please.

1308
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,760
What's for breakfast, Cookie?

1309
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,740
Cookie, this is Ivan.

1310
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,260
You have to wake up Dr. Drumwock.

1311
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,220
Hey, hey, hey, I gotta go.

1312
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,320
So we can hurt him.

1313
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,460
How many presidents does it take to screw in a light bulb?

1314
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,120
No, no, wait, wait.

1315
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,240
What's the most beautiful sight in the world?

1316
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,000
A busload of presidents going off a cliff.

1317
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,840
Get it?

1318
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,140
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1319
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,140
Spooky bad show.

1320
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,160
Cookie.

1321
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,080
Oh, no.

1322
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,360
Can we talk to little dude?

1323
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,900
Don't listen to these men.

1324
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,440
Not unless you have a connection to dog heaven.

1325
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,880
Oh, no.

1326
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,260
Friends, this is dog heaven.

1327
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,440
And this is Philo Drumhead.

1328
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,180
Hey, dog heaven.

1329
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,260
Philo Drumhead.

1330
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:58,100
We've woken up just to be here entertaining you in all of Northern and Central California.

1331
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,220
No, I'm still asleep.

1332
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,500
You are going to save the universe this time.

1333
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,260
Yeah, that's right, Philo.

1334
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,920
You have a link up to the sleep.

1335
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,340
Be of good cheer.

1336
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:14,140
Well, just tell us what you're dreaming about and we'll let you go eventually.

1337
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,100
I'm dreaming about little dude.

1338
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,800
Your dog?

1339
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,660
Your dog that you had five years ago?

1340
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,120
Yes.

1341
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,180
I've never forgotten the little chap who was so dear to us.

1342
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,720
Still running out there in the fields of toxic substance.

1343
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,680
That's what it is.

1344
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:37,500
He's prancing and dancing through the fields of clover and dioxin.

1345
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,060
In that land where no cars are.

1346
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,660
And the smell of good clean earth under his nails.

1347
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,900
The only cars that are there are those that are run over by dogs.

1348
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,160
Yeah.

1349
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,560
Little dogs.

1350
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,640
Well, we're all going to meet at the Jefferson Memorial Fair.

1351
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:51,640


1352
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,220
We're going to be there for something later.

1353
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,360
So we just wanted to call you up.

1354
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:53,580
Yeah.

1355
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,260
I'll be down there.

1356
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,720
Don't order anything before I get there.

1357
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,040
Okay?

1358
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:57,260
Okay.

1359
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:05,620
That's Salvation and Infotation at www.subgenius.com.

1360
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,940
Or, got that pencil ready?

1361
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:07,820
P.O.

1362
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:14,100
Box 204206, Austin, Texas 78720.

1363
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,780
That's the Subgenius Foundation.

1364
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:21,620
Or me, Ivan Stang at Post Office Box 18147.

1365
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:21,620


1366
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:26,240
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.
