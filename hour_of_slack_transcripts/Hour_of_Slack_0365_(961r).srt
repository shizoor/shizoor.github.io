1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:01,980
Yeah, okay.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,680
I'll tell you what, we're going to get into all that.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,360
Don't worry, man. Don't worry. You don't have no program.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,900
Just relax.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,880
When I say toilet paper, that's when you come rolling out, okay?

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,580
We're going to continue on with the thing recorded in 1738 in the Benjamin Franklin Studios.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,480
Some of my friends have prepared a song that they desire you to hear.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,360
And I would appreciate it if you would listen to it.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,600
Also, please play it for your friends.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,160
And even after election day, please run it off once in a while

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,380
to remind you that I am in Washington and will be watching out for your interests.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,340
The song will now be sung by the Lang and Glee Club.

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,680
Are you a vampire, Melvin Laird?

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,620
Are you a blank vampire?

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,120
Are you caught?

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,780
In the Transylvanian transvestite time trap, Melvin Laird?

17
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,340
Honk, honk, oh the geese of Canada

18
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,660
Quack, quack, oh the ducks of derision

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,720
Late at night

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,740
When the moon is full

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,060
Do you creep from the crypt

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,700
And flit from throat to throat, Melvin Laird?

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,840
Cause I saw you grinning with a drool a-dripping on the TV screen

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,920
Testifying with your vacant voice for the ABM machine

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,140
I could swear I saw two fangs touching the microphone

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,840
So I'm carrying my wafer, I'm carrying my cross

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,160
Just in case I find you breathing down my neck

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,780
In the silent halls of Congress, Melvin Laird

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Are you a vampire, Melvin Laird?

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,620
Are you a blank vampire?

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,140
And it's starting with verse 1 of chapter 4.

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,440
It says,

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,700
Dear friends, do not believe every spirit,

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,380
but test the spirits to see whether they are

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,500
from God, because many false prophets

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,900
have gone out into the world.

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,400
It is a quest.

38
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,220
It's a quest for Bob.

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,160
We're going to Bob the entire Cleveland area tonight, yet again.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,800
Yes!

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,280
We are Uber women going into Kinko's to make thousands of Bob faces.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,260
Thousands and thousands and thousands of Bob faces.

43
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,980
Billions upon billions.

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,500
And then we're going to scatter them.

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:25,880
Yay!

46
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,240
Unto the masses.

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Unto the masses.

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,580
And 1 Timothy 4.1 says that there are false prophets

49
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,620
that go around teaching doctrines of devils.

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,980
This is a doctrine that I feel are the devil.

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,620
2 Chronicles 11, 14-15 says,

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,660
it says,

53
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,780
Don't be surprised because the Satan will appear as an angel of light.

54
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,400
I know you think, well, it's just an innocent, fun little holiday

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,000
for kids to go out and dress up.

56
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,820
Well, we need to really investigate and find out what the origins are.

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,880
And we need to be honest with ourselves and say,

58
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,580
we're nothini 621.

59
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:12,480
Come no, find us, me.

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:21,900
I hope you saved Alrighty Where.

61
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:22,900
00.

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,860
I'm telling you thatặ 시ce I can try this later.

63
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:25,860


64
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:25,860


65
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:25,860


66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:25,860


67
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:25,860


68
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,720
a punk rocker, or whatever you are again, it just never fails.

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,300
That's the way they want you.

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,260
They want you a bum.

71
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,200
Lose your job, lose your car, just like it used to be when you ran around with them,

72
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
and you're starting the same thing again.

73
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,120
So I'll tell you what, the best thing for you to do is keep away from me

74
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,080
because I don't want no part of it.

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,360
Until you can shape up, change your look, get rid of that blonde hair,

76
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,120
go back to normal, and get off the drugs and the booze

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,840
and quit running around with those kind of girls you ran around with.

78
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,820
What? Who am I?

79
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,520
I'm the record.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
Genie the record.

81
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,040
Genie the magic record.

82
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,580
Why, I can do anything.

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,460
Oh, you don't think so?

84
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,240
Well, I'll prove it.

85
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,540
Alakazoot, I'm a whistle.

86
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,160
That was easy.

87
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,980
Alakazing, I'm the subgenius.

88
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,680
Our host.

89
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,560
Watch.

90
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,120
Here's your host.

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:44,540
I was shown on my inner eyelids the true history of this planet.

92
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,320
It is one.

93
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,340
Of an amazement.

94
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,800
And it's gold.

95
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,100
Yes, I said gold.

96
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,500
It's gold.

97
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:08,040
It's more impressive and more wonderful than any, any, any religious

98
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:16,800
or any superstitious nonsense that has been propagated to keep the hybrids going.

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,060
To keep them pointed in one direction.

100
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:43,360
We Canada has lost since 1992,

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,080
and now, in a series of

102
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,080


103
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,080


104
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,580
Is in many but would not be.

105
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,060
The surname jerk.

106
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,480
Yeah.

107
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,520


108
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,920
It must be true slack, not the bad slack of the conspirators.

109
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,140
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang,

110
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,340
and I was sitting down getting ready to do Hour of Slack number 961,

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,920
and oh, there was so much to choose from.

112
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:16,980
A newly-mer collage, an ancient, rare fire sign theater, puzzling evidence all new,

113
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,940
and there's some synesthesia call-ins at Starwood.

114
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,380
More of that Onan on Mars, all kinds of stuff.

115
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,100
But I got to digging around in my old box of shows, old shows,

116
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,400
from when we had that one brain cell.

117
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:43,780
And I pulled out one labeled Pre-Election Pledge and Vote Drive.

118
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,000
And I listened to it a little bit, and my gosh, I think I'm just going to run that whole show

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,500
because it goes on.

120
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,500


121
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,840
It kind of puts things into perspective due to its incredible age.

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,120
Even though Hurricane Ivan is so current, yet this ancient show.

123
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,220
Well, you'll see.

124
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
Hour of Slack number 365.

125
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,760
Well, we're on number 961.

126
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,440
That's about 600 shows ago at 50 shows a year, 12 years ago.

127
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,280
That would make this about 1992.

128
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,680
And yet, it seems like yesterday.

129
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,300
And that's the horror.

130
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,100
I'm sure of it, too.

131
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,520
It's also during a pledge drive, which is also rather timely since we've all gone broke.

132
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,500
So, friends, ignore all phone numbers and station IDs that I might have accidentally left half audible

133
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,160
in this ancient, ancient show.

134
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,420
Praise God.

135
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,680
And it's ludicrous.

136
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,460
It is absolutely crazy.

137
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,340
How can we, as, I mean, we look back,

138
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,500
and we look back, and we look back, and we look back, and we look back, and we look back,

139
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,740
and we think, you know, where they were primitive people, you know, they were practicing these crazy rituals,

140
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,080
and, you know, and these crazy traditions of spirit worship and things.

141
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,440
Hey, man, wake up.

142
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,760
Nothing's changed.

143
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,680
You go to MJ Designs, and you've got four aisles full of ghosts, goblins, witches, and, you know, and death and gloom.

144
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,400
And, you know, and what is going on here?

145
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,920
We need to realize that all we've done is just become more sophisticated in the same area.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,240
We need to stand up against it.

147
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,440
Right.

148
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,740
We need to say no.

149
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,280
I know this day.

150
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,200
He didn't leave with Lucevac.

151
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,100
Telephone rang.

152
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,520
It would not stop this President Kennedy calling me up.

153
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,480
He said, my friend Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?

154
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,860
I said, my friend John.

155
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,480
The South Virginia must have flat.

156
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,200
When you look down the street, it's like, it's like the city's getting ready for a Bob Parade or something, man.

157
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,120
I mean, there's like, you just look down the street and there's like, there's Bob.

158
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,820
Bob.

159
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,680
Staring at you.

160
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,260
He's giant Bob heads everywhere.

161
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,420
And we telephone Paul.

162
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,060
And we made him in Dayglo colors.

163
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,360
Big orange colors.

164
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,120
Yeah, and they look like Halloween Bobs.

165
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,620
And pink.

166
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,000
You can see the pink ones really well, too.

167
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,980
Yes.

168
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,740
Oh, God, they're great.

169
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,720
And then, and then I saw her.

170
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,180
She was a bright red 64 GTO with 50.

171
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,380
And that's awesome.

172
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,180
And then I saw some of the fins and gills like some giant piranha fish.

173
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,560
I'm obscene phallic symbol on wheels.

174
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,860
Little rivers of anticipation ran down.

175
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,940
I can see that I can go 500 Italian forces into life.

176
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,220
Reality behind me.

177
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,140
Inside the belt of my trousers.

178
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,540
And then we hit the magic.

179
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,220
Yes.

180
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,700
Yes, my love exploded over her bright pink leather interior.

181
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,140
And at that moment, I thought of my mother.

182
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,020
That was easy.

183
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,000
Alakazing, I'm a telephone.

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,300
Telephone.

185
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,700
You don't have to answer that.

186
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,940
It's only me.

187
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,680
I'll make you smile and I'll make you laugh

188
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,760
as I spin around on your pornograph.

189
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,000
Round and round I go.

190
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,580
Ouch! Oops!

191
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,640
Be careful with that needle.

192
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,660
It scratches.

193
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,220
I'm sure glad you turned me over.

194
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,020
That fuzz on the phonograph tickles.

195
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,180
I'll bet I can sing Farmer in the Dell faster than you can.

196
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,440
The farmer in the Dell, the farmer in the Dell.

197
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,200
Stop, stop.

198
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,080
Did you sing it that fast?

199
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,860
Oh, you did.

200
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,640
Well, I bet I can sing it even faster than that.

201
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,400
And there was no sound at all.

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,780
Put the clock upon the wall.

203
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,260
And the door burst open wide.

204
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,220
And my daddy stepped inside.

205
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,760
And he kissed my mama's face.

206
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,740
And he brushed her tears away.

207
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,300
That's right.

208
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,440
It's the Princess Wee and Sister Mary Square Show.

209
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,340
That's right.

210
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,280
Chick is twisted.

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,460
Crazy.

212
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,180
Oop-a-shooby.

213
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
Hip-lip city.

214
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,620
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head.

215
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,900
But I said, dear doctor, I think that it's you instead.

216
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,400
Because I have got a thing that's unique and new.

217
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,860
To prove it, I'll have the last laugh on you.

218
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,100
Because instead of one head, I got two.

219
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,060
And you know two heads are better than one.

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Hey, man, don't badmouth the head.

221
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,400
Hey, we got a reward.

222
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,700
The head is cool.

223
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,320
I do not wish to appear stupid.

224
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,380
I do not wish to appear stupid.

225
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,420
Inside my steamer trunk, my eight-year-old son was losing his hair.

226
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,040
What shall I do?

227
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,340
What shall I do?

228
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,520
I do not wish to appear stupid.

229
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
So for all I know, maybe these...

230
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,100
Ah, yes.

231
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,940
Oh, my God.

232
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,400
This is one of the callers that wanted to meet Reverend Stang at a cheap motel.

233
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,980
That's a good one.

234
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,640
He comes with a $200 plan.

235
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,100
Sire, there is no more money.

236
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,620
We gotta get some money.

237
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,140
That dirty, purgish, hard-to-back, black, important...

238
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,780
Well, tonight, dear friends, we're going to try a new money-raising technique.

239
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,080
It's real simple.

240
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:11,000
The more you pay us, the funnier and yet more biting and trenchant and perceptive

241
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,320
our wonderful show will be.

242
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,900
Now, so far, only a few people have called in, so the show is still fairly silly and

243
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,540
immature, although still, no doubt, better than anything on television.

244
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,300
Eh?

245
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,240
Uh, what now?

246
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,160
Wait a minute.

247
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,820
Hi, Waldo.

248
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,840
How the hell are you?

249
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,600
Gosh, Rudy.

250
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,900
I sure am hungry.

251
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,120
Well, don't have a cow, Waldo.

252
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,140
Let's you and me go see what's cooking up at Bud's.

253
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,980
You mean where the corn dogs are puffing?

254
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,920
Hot charred.

255
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,840
That's right, Waldo.

256
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,400
Are you ready?

257
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,140
Yep.

258
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,580
Nope.

259
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,160
I'm afraid...

260
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,300
I'm afraid...

261
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,300


262
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,300


263
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm afraid, dear friends, you aren't ready.

264
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,780
That one, that one's just...

265
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,800
We haven't even reached that level of intelligence yet because you haven't paid enough.

266
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,860
As more people pledge, the material in the show will gradually become more relevant,

267
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,860
more timely, more sophisticated.

268
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,900
And when we've raised 500 bucks, we'll turn the wit factor up to .5 degrees.

269
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,120
At $700, we'll achieve pithiness.

270
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,280
Let's go.

271
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,940
We'll get to a level that's above, well above, 97%.

272
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,600
And when we reach, dear friends, when we reach our goal of 1,000 American dollars tonight,

273
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,760
when we reach that point, if we can reach that tonight, by then, it will be the greatest

274
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,820
audio production in the entire universe.

275
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,520
For now, it's still pretty stupid, I guess.

276
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,120
Because we're not going to be smart for nothing, friends.

277
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,100
We're sub-geniuses.

278
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,740
We must have slack or money.

279
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:57,300
Because, well, for instance, as it says here in Slackalonians 4.25, he was delivered,

280
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:06,460
de-kidneyed and eviscerated for our sins and was regurgitated from the gorge of living

281
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:12,900
death, even for the justification of these, our grins.

282
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,080
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,080


284
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,080


285
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,320
And I can't think of a better way to put it, well, we saved my ass.

286
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,320


287
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,160
It certainly had to be stale.

288
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:36,760
But the reason that this again I'll be making a video about how the He specby took care

289
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,400
of yourself, and what happened, I'm not sure.

290
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,280
Is the Bible such a Roman notified things to you?

291
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,560
Your eyes, you eyes?

292
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:42,560


293
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,060
You're half-me.

294
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,360
and knowledge, and you, speaking to the people of Dobstown, even with the second helping

295
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:56,280
of Rugo's pinkish-eyed ones, put him to debt by nailing him to the crosshairs of Wellman's

296
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,160
gun site.

297
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:10,020
For Bob so shoved the world that he gave up his only besotted Sunday supplement subscribers

298
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:18,520
that he, rather than they, should have the effulgence of slack unending, in order that

299
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:27,780
they be sure to endure eternal life, yea, to itch his own even unto the hind end of

300
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,740
the world.

301
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:39,040
Yet Dobbs regurgitated, freeing his epoptitude from the agony of slacklessness, for it was

302
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,420
impossible.

303
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:48,040
For knee-gee, whose grunt is knee, to keep his hold on him, Dobbs went out on stage throughout

304
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:57,140
the night of slack for ye and everyone to prepare the way for us to leave the house.

305
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,420
Moronicus 2, 611.

306
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:06,000
Bob, who being in very nature Dobbs, did not consider equality with anti-Bob something

307
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,820
to be grasped, clutched, or palpated.

308
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,740
But rather...

309
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:17,640
Smoked in his living pipe, like a fine burly or rum-soaked shag, he himself nothing taking

310
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:25,220
the very nay, sure, taking instead the very nay-ture of a salesman, never taking no for

311
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,980
an answer.

312
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:35,020
And being in appearance as a man, he fumbled himself in the dark, staining the sheets,

313
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,780
and became obedient to entropy.

314
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,840
And.

315
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:47,000
Therefore God exulted and chortled to himself, but we gave Dobbs the name that is above every

316
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,720
name, Salesman of the Year, that at the word of Bob every knee should water, and each hew

317
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,900
man soil the tops of his shoes.

318
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:05,640
And now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether this cult, that cult, or for

319
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,040
that matter any cult, should so long endure.

320
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,380
We are met!

321
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,380
On a great potter's field of that war!

322
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:20,160
These bland pinks, living and dead, shall little note nor long remember what we do here.

323
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,040
By the way, I forget, what is it that we are doing here?

324
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,960
Oh yeah, it is for we the living to confess that J.R. Bob Dobbs is dead to the infinite

325
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,340
gratification of Jehovah One, the Father, senile, infinitely maligned space god.

326
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,360
Jesus can't be saved.

327
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,360


328
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,380
He came here as a servant, but Dobbs came as a salesman.

329
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,500
Prescriptures 2019.

330
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:53,760
And he came unto the daughters of the farmers, and knew them well, when there was no room

331
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,780
for him to be by himself during the night.

332
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,800
And in the morning before the sunrise he continued travelling upon his route, so that the franchise

333
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,260
might not be usurped.

334
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,240
Yes?

335
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,040
And to this day it never hath been so.

336
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,020
Bobbs is still the route.

337
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,260
Bobbs is still the franchise.

338
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:25,560
And now dear friends, as Sister Basilica passes out among you, as she sniffs the contents

339
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:31,120
of the collection plate, each and every one of you dear friends should reach down, deep

340
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,660
down and give to the church of the powerful blinding apostasy.

341
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,220
Dear friends, give!

342
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,900
There is no throne but exalts in its own freedom, to scatter its fundaments on the

343
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:52,320
earth, soiling the uppers of its shoes, to let down the inward produced product of its

344
00:19:52,320 --> 00:20:00,520
concentration, fertilizing the fields of science, sorcery, art, and religion.

345
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,440
Ah!

346
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,720
Ah!

347
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,220
For, lo, the frop cloudeth my brain, and my buckler and sheath shall be lost.

348
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:16,840
shield are ripped away. I am naked before thee, Dobbs, all nagoi, thou who hast unbuckled my

349
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:23,100
buckler and unsnapped my shield, which was my sole protection. Yea, my buckler being so unbuckled,

350
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:30,560
I am even as a poe-buck or buck naked before Bob. Bob dashes a bucket of ice water over my loins.

351
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:39,400
The buck path is not for the buck and the doe dwell in the same forest. The buck is Bob. He is

352
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:48,520
bucking tradition. He changes brick bats into buckets of bucks. Bucks, bucks, yea, bucks, bucks,

353
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:54,960
but awkward bucks. Difficult to explain away. I am chicken before my epopt, yea,

354
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,800
foul like the birds of the ground, Neuroticus 13.6.

355
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,640
Oh, sick, sick, sick is this world, O Bob, who hath beslimed the ground after thee,

356
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:13,300
even like unto the slugs and snails of the garden, whose chambered shells we step on and crush

357
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,560
inadvertently. Thou art not the healer, but the pharmacist, for thou dost sell unto us thy remedy

358
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,960
of slack, and it is unto us that we pay over to you the price, the price, Bob, which thou dost ask,

359
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,540
namely all that we have, and we shall come to thee.

360
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:37,260
Call that into our beloved radio station, which presents your words, which we know we would never

361
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,740
hear on any other kind of station, a station which needs so much money, and we shall put it,

362
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:52,100
therefore, in the envelope and send it in, for the excess are nearly upon us,

363
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,440
and the sale ends tomorrow. Going out of business,

364
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:10,560
prices slashed, everything must go. So ask not upon what day shall the tithe be sent,

365
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:22,760
for, unless ye know otherwise, every day is Dob's day, and ye never know when the master cometh,

366
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,720
again and again. Amen.

367
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,380
And praise Bob.

368
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:40,580
And, in fact, praise Dr. Howell, who actually wrote that extremely erudite-sounding and verbose rant.

369
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,580
At this level, our salesman can see the top of the ladder and is well on his way there.

370
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,380
You revolting genetic accident, take your smelly shell elsewhere.

371
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,420
See, General Spyback, see how well you...

372
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,440
He is a little crazy, but he's a little crazy.

373
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,080
He's a little crazy, but he's a little crazy, and I'm so amazed he's loyal.

374
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,300
Stupid, but loyal.

375
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,820
But, little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?

376
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,100
Listen, you little listeners whistling in the glistening mist.

377
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,900
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Life, Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, verse

378
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,320
than ever.

379
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,360
The passage runs, and I quote,

380
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,380
If you be tired or be proud, if you've got that run-down feeling, remember, you're not

381
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,080
just anybody, you're special.

382
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,220
You are living proof that God does not exist.

383
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,220
Yes, you, little listener.

384
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,520
If you are like most of the people who follow you, you are living proof that God does not exist.

385
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:30,520


386
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:36,240
who listen to this show are proof that no supreme being could ever exist the phones aren't ringing

387
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,060
i've got a tape here that will absolutely blow your mind i was about to shift into the serious

392
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:12,260

444
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,900
a

445
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,080
parallel

446
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,380
genetic

447
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,080
compost here

448
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,120

449
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,820
well

450
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,500
Yep, Cleveland Backwards is DNA level C.

451
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,260
It's backmasking.

452
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,400
Did you know that if you take the phrase,

453
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,420
Jesus loves you, and play it backwards on a rock and roll album,

454
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,400
and this is serious now, this is true,

455
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,420
the phrase, Jesus loves you, backwards, comes out as,

456
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,940
we smell sausage.

457
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,620
But if you take the phrase, Bob loves you, and play it backwards,

458
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,740
it says, we smell Bob.

459
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,060
Bob.

460
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,860
By the way, that was discovered by an Akron, Ohio, subgenius alumnus,

461
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,820
Mark Mothersbaugh.

462
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,560
Oh, well, yes.

463
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,200
Discovered that on his fancy computer doohickey, and informed us.

464
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,720
It used to be on his answer machine.

465
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,280
You know, I have a lot, a lot to thank Cleveland.

466
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:44,960
Mark Mothersbaugh was in Devo Wars.

467
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,260
Yeah, he went in Devo.

468
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,820
Some of these.

469
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,900
He was in the Devo.

470
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,640
He was in the Devo.

471
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,280
That was a great band.

472
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,460
He used to whip it.

473
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,720
A whole lot of subgenius mutant hierarchs came from this era.

474
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,580
And some other things.

475
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,280
Especially Akron.

476
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,520
Especially the Akron area.

477
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,080
Palmer Vreedys of the Lies Foundation.

478
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,620
Yeah.

479
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,900
And, well, I guess that's about it.

480
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,840
I guess that's about it.

481
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,240
Now, hold on.

482
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,940
Now, how many, and now, Cleveland is pumping out,

483
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,400
it's like a gigantic zit erupting with subgenius madness.

484
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,900
Subgenius madness.

485
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,800
Pope Jimbo.

486
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,560
Pope Jimbo.

487
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,460
Pope Jimbo, I hope you're listening.

488
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,660
We thank you.

489
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,600
Well, I don't.

490
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,000
I think we should announce over the air what we have to thank Pope Jimbo for in Cleveland.

491
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:43,260
I got some letters from certain, well, committees and, well, the city government requesting that the Subgenius Foundation cease and desist.

492
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,820
And, Senator, I stand here to tell you that Pope Jimbo had nothing to do with any of that.

493
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,500
No, no, no.

494
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,380
You can't blame.

495
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,400
And I don't know who he is.

496
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,380
I don't know his real name.

497
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,220
I'm not.

498
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,320
And I'm not going to.

499
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,440
Meet him tomorrow.

500
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,260
Well, okay, you've alluded to this man, and now you're not going to talk about him.

501
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,700
I'm not going to talk about him.

502
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,740
Well, actually, I am going to meet him tomorrow, but I didn't want anyone to know that.

503
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,800
Because I don't know yet.

504
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,680
I'm not allowed to.

505
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,940
Is he a real hierophant?

506
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,620
I mean, does your church have a hierarchy?

507
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,920
You mentioned a hierarchy.

508
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,000
I thought you were good.

509
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,940
A rigid, rigid hierarchy.

510
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,440
A rigid hierarchy.

511
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Well, I thought the only hierarchy was Bob itself, himself.

512
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,760
Well, it's sort of like the Sunnis and the Shiites, you know.

513
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,960
I forget which is which.

514
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,500
I think the...

515
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:34,780
The Sunnis believe that there is no intermediary between God and man, and Allah, all of it.

516
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,040
You know, everybody's their own preacher.

517
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,420
But then the Shiites believe that there are these imams.

518
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,040
Imams, yes.

519
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,940
Yeah, imams who stand in between...

520
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,520
And their actual spokespeople for all of that, and God, and so forth.

521
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,660
As we all are.

522
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,220
Yeah, and some subgeniuses, there's Sunni subgeniuses...

523
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,480
We're imams.

524
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:55,480


525
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:55,480


526
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,180
...who hate the hierarchy and think we're a whole bunch of fascist show-offs and blabbermouths.

527
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
We should be burned at the stakes.

528
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:11,160
And then there's those who recognize that, in fact, we are closer to Bob than you pathetic mere mortals out there with your $20 memberships.

529
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,920
Oh, I'm just remembering.

530
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,060
And all of that, and I'll have you know, I'll tell Bob on you.

531
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,980
I'm gonna tell Bob on you.

532
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,340
Christ, is that easily done?

533
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,120
Is that easily done?

534
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,820
I don't know.

535
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
I heard a preacher on the radio once.

536
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,780
I heard him say it a long time saying, I'm gonna tell God on you.

537
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,860
And I thought, well, what a concept.

538
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,940
Now, that guy's a Shiite.

539
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,700
He don't know Shiite.

540
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,640
And I don't know Sunnis.

541
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,100
Got no use for them Sunnis.

542
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,100
I like the Shiites.

543
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,540
Because I'm one of them, you know, imams.

544
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,620
I just watched you stop combing your hair and kiss me.

545
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,040
You're the maximum, utmost.

546
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,940
Well, I'm beamed in a dreamsville and I'm moving right now.

547
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,580
Because that's the kind of scene that I dig.

548
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,600
Baby, you're the ginchiest.

549
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,380
What?

550
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:03,840
Mmm.

551
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,100
Mmm.

552
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,400
Mmm.

553
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,200
My bob head is down.

554
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,180
Yeah, but what good is that bone gonna do us?

555
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,640
Oh, no.

556
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,320
Oh, no.

557
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,340
We're stimpified and ranned.

558
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:17,720
We are.

559
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,280
We're stimpified and ranned.

560
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,260
We've been deeply stimped and ranned.

561
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,340
Stimped and ranned.

562
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,040
Something.

563
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:25,480
Something.

564
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:25,480


565
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,440
Bob is coming.

566
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,780
And ain't no lie.

567
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,960
Well, I went to the drugstore.

568
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,480
And what did I buy?

569
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,900
A blank cassette.

570
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,520
Papers.

571
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,000
Papers.

572
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,320

573
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,480

Doo doo doo da girls.

Do they want to have one?

at your expense or you can have some commie who's so treasonous and un-american that he

603
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,000


604
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:02,840
you know really he's the classic rogue unsaved subgenius but he's still just crazy as a tree full

605
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:08,540
of fish friends come on now well

606
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:21,560
i bet you bush wins i bet he does that's my prediction george bush is going to win why because you because you're too tragically hip

607
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,880
to to actually go out and vote or pledge you're too hip to pledge oh no man

608
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:33,260
i'm just going to i don't have a conscience it doesn't matter bleeding heart bad invulnerable

609
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:39,620
heart good i'm just so cool now friends if clinton gets elected and takes away all our

610
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:46,260
guns and makes them teach communism and drugs and homosexuality in the schools along with witchcraft

611
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,800
and forced pregnancy-abortion combinations every nine months and evolution,

612
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,400
well, I'll be real surprised, actually,

613
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,660
because I don't think you'll really see much of a change at all.

614
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,200
And that's the sad thing, my friends.

615
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,720
The conspiracy is so much bigger than the Republicans or the Democrats

616
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,120
because they're all just a bunch of normals,

617
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,320
and they'll do anything to pass the buck

618
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,980
after taking as much of that buck as they possibly can.

619
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,420
And it ain't going to change.

620
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,480
No, sir, not in our lifetime.

621
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,620
Ain't going to change a bit.

622
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,660
You know, they're all out to do it to you.

623
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,520
Every one of them.

624
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,140
The other day I had to spend all day long

625
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,820
dealing with a loss.

626
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,420
A lawsuit.

627
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,540
Evidence of somebody stealing Bob's name

628
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,020
to put on their record album

629
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,260
so that it would sell better

630
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,480
because they didn't really have their own name.

631
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,340
And so instead of working on our new book,

632
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,840
I had to go deal with the trademark infringement evidence.

633
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,260
Ironic that we'd be suing somebody for copyright infringement, I know,

634
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,620
but this was extreme.

635
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,760
I mean, this isn't like what we do.

636
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,500
This is more like what?

637
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,740
They do.

638
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,800
Your friends like what you're doing to us,

639
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,040
sitting here listening, going,

640
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,500
I ain't going to pay no money to get in the way.

641
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,460
I ain't going to vote for you.

642
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,040
You're only stupid, stupid, stupid.

643
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,300
Well, now, I know from the best of your views.

644
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,800
Yeah, friends, because the same day I had to deal with that lawsuit,

645
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,440
I was in the post office sending out truth,

646
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,320
and I dropped my checkbook,

647
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,220
the Subgenius Foundation checkbook.

648
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,080
And after waiting in line for half an hour,

649
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
I realized that I dropped the checkbook,

650
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,920
and I ran back out looking for it,

651
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,760
while there was a man in the lobby holding the checkbook.

652
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,100
And he looked at me and said,

653
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:47,820
is this yours?

654
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,120
And I said, yeah.

655
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,500
And he handed it to me, and he said,

656
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,400
could you give me some money for returning your checkbook?

657
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,420
And friend, I looked at him,

658
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:06,420
and a sort of a grin of stupefaction,

659
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,960
and I knew just what to do.

660
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,020
I pulled out my wallet.

661
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,100
He wanted to know,

662
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,460
he wanted a reward for returning my lost object.

663
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,400
So I pulled out my wallet,

664
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,760
and I offered him everything I had in there,

665
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,440
which was one dollar.

666
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,900
He took my last dollar.

667
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,200
They all want a piece of you, friends.

668
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,920
A vote is not a piece of you.

669
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,300
It's taking a piece out of the other one.

670
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,060
See, not voting does not show the system

671
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,080
that you refuse to be a part of it.

672
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,960
Same with not pledging.

673
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,080
They'll just assume that you're too stupid,

674
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,060
to fight it.

675
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,040
And they'll be absolutely right.

676
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,120
And if you don't vote and pledge to your radio station

677
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,400
that plays the hour of slack,

678
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,740
your Reverend Stang is going to be ashamed of you.

679
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm ashamed.

680
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,700
I'm going to tell Bob on you.

681
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,300
I'm going to tell Bob on you.

682
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,680
You can all pledge five bucks.

683
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,280
Every one of you can pledge five bucks.

684
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,580
If you've got enough brains to appreciate this show,

685
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,900
then five bucks should be no problem.

686
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,060
Only laziness could explain your not sending five bucks.

687
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,520
And though I dearly love slack,

688
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,380
I detest laziness.

689
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,260
They are not the same thing.

690
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,680
Slack and laziness aren't.

691
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,720
Do not let your butt rot.

692
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,260
Get off of it.

693
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,820
Call, pledge, vote, send in the money.

694
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,000
In that order.

695
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,860
Call, pledge, vote, send in the money.

696
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,360
Call, pledge, vote, send in the money.

697
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,120
In that order.

698
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:55,980
What you believe tonight is the single most important separate issue of this press.

699
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,900
Where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign

700
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,700
with commercials and media sollution, and fear messages, and personal attacks, and things of that nature.

701
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,160
Anything goes.

702
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,640
We can ask anything.

703
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,120
Anything goes. Anything goes. We can ask anything.

704
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,240
This issue is an issue that divides Americans deeply.

705
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,720
I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-goggling.

706
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,620
There will be a giant sucking sound going south.

707
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,540
There will be a giant sucking sound going south.

708
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,740
How long can we continue with trickle-down economics?

709
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,880
Change for change's sake.

710
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,080
Change for change's sake.

711
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,100
Change for change's sake isn't enough.

712
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,920
You'll have a shot at me in four years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job.

713
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,820
You'll have a shot at me in four years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job.

714
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,620
And I would welcome you to do that.

715
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,140
I've been in the Senate.

716
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,040
I would have voted with the majority if it was a close vote.

717
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,940
But I agreed with the arguments of the minority.

718
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:04,940
You know, my wife Hillary gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again.

719
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,080
I got a, I'm a little confused here because I'm a little confused.

720
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:16,260
I got a, I'm a little confused here because I got a, I'm a little confused here because I'm a little confused here because I don't see how I got a, I'm a little confused.

721
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,360
And I'm getting tired of it.

722
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,080
Don't like swimming over the super-dry.

723
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,220
Got to keep on swimming cause I don't want to die.

724
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,080
Who dealt this mess anyway?

725
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,060
Yeah, that's an old park player's turn.

726
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:49,280
Sometimes you can use your switcheroo and it can be applied to frontal politics.

727
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:03,040
What I mean is, who was it that set up a system, supposedly a democratic system where you end up always voting for the lesser of two evils?

728
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,360
I mean, was George Washington the lesser of two evils?

729
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,080
No.

730
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:18,400
Michael Godlewitz is saying that yesterday at bite-sized

731
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,260
On camera knowl

732
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,240
dislocated

733
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,100
Paracetamol

734
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,280
The country is coming apart at the seams.

735
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,920
Who am I? Why am I here?

736
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,120
You need to have a president you can trust.

737
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,100
Who am I? Bill Clinton.

738
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,760
Let the president have a shot at it. Let the president have a shot at it.

739
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,640
I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world,

740
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,520
the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.

741
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,440
You have to question my patriotism.

742
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,280
You even right went into the White House to go into Russia in 69.

743
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,240
Went over for American's debt. I honor your score too.

744
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,680
Honor Mr. Uniform and whoever saw pro-crow.

745
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,680
Beeson is supporting.

746
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,860
But when Junk went around this attack patriotism, wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

747
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,840
You're from Connecticut named Bush.

748
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,680
You've right to stand party to attack my trade.

749
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,100
I was a poor but I'm country.

750
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,620
President who bring the heather.

751
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,560
Now we had enough.

752
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,060
Who am I? Why am I here?

753
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,420
The amount of time the candidate could spend in his country

754
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,600
in a campaign trashing their opponent's character and their programs is depressingly large.

755
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,480
We'll be on again Saturday night 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.

756
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,240
Okay, okay.

757
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,140
Family.

758
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,960
I've been there, Al.

759
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:47,740
Job.

760
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,900
I've been vice president.

761
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,400
Senator Gore.

762
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,260
We've been to the Congress together.

763
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,440
I've done the job as president.

764
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,960
President, you never...

765
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,560
What's your role from time to time?

766
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,180
And let me just where I am.

767
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,500
President Bush to Malta.

768
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,660
I had to meet with the president.

769
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,080
Meeting between the president and Gore.

770
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,380
The chopper.

771
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,760
I've been there before.

772
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,880
Broke out of the gun.

773
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,920
The situation resembled the present.

774
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,600
I know. I made the president.

775
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,580
The president...

776
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,520
The coup was...

777
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,200
Decontented him.

778
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,920
The situation ended.

779
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,840
Been there.

780
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,820
Come in and put yourself up a chair.

781
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,720
You're in the White House basement.

782
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,960
Come down the stairs.

783
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,720
Lieutenant Colonel Northe's doing fine.

784
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,420
He cordially invites you to go whack...

785
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,520
At Ollie's Playhouse.

786
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,120
First meeting with Rear Admiral Poindexter.

787
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,380
Examining long and short-term risk factors.

788
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,380
Vice President Bush drops by.

789
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,200
Elliot Abrams gets a deny.

790
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,340
Ever been...

791
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,300
At Ollie's Playhouse.

792
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,500
The Amarunder never told Poindexter to sell Hawks to Iran.

793
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,500
Gomez got withdrawal symptoms.

794
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,800
At a bank in Switzerland.

795
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,200
Hasim Busk got home for Christmas.

796
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,060
Woo-hoo!

797
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,720
Spokesman speaks.

798
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,640
Says bye-bye.

799
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,340
And me says when we get the dough, it won't remove us, you know.

800
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,440
Because it came from the ayatollah.

801
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,460
Reagan's in bed.

802
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,380
He's always napping.

803
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,520
But even when he gets up, anything can happen.

804
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,820
They're gonna take out Case's brain.

805
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,620
Give Casper and Schultz ya pain.

806
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,760
It'll be cuckoo.

807
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,740
It'll be wacky.

808
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,120
He'll be covert.

809
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,320
At Ollie's Playhouse.

810
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,880
I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan.

811
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,100
I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan.

812
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,240
I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan.

813
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,360
I'd like to create more millionaires the old fashioned way.

814
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:07,600
I'd like to create more millionaires the old fashioned way.

815
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,600
They're so heavy they give you, you know, back and, broken back.

816
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,060
He would target America.

817
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,840
Target America.

818
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,280
Target America.

819
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:16,280


820
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:16,820
Target America.

821
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,240
Well I want you to know that we really appreciate that.

822
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,420
Expanding jobs, growing expanding base.

823
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,640
Right now, a flattened job base and where it's going, it's minimum wage.

824
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,720
To really up base, that's going to structure an investor, a foreign competitor.

825
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,540
We're not.

826
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:29,980
We're not.

827
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,540
We're not.

828
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,020
trillion dollars budget and have the streets of the future up in this country. The revenue

829
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:39,580
go through a period of suffice. It's got to be fair. We've created and have much to show

830
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:45,020
and we have all I can say. I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag. I'm not going to

831
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,600
sit there and be a punching bag. I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag. How much longer

832
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,740
will it take, Dan, for trickle-down economics to work in your theory? Well, we're going to have

833
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:59,080
plenty of time to talk about trickle-down government. Well, I'd like to hear the answer.

834
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,160
But the question is, the question is, which you have failed to address, and that is, why is Bill

835
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,420
Clinton qualified to be president of the United States? You've talked about Jim. You've talked

836
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,760
about Jim Baker. You've talked about trickle-down economics. You've talked about the worst economy

837
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,780
in 50 years. I'll be happy to answer those questions. I'll be happy. I'll be happy. I want

838
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,560
to go back and make a point. Well, you've asked my question. I have an answer. I have an answer.

839
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,320
I will answer.

840
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:45,280
What's come over our great land? America is still my home, sweet home.

841
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:53,220
But where have all our heroes gone?

842
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,180
You have not told us why Bill Clinton is qualified.

843
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,980
I'm the president of the United States. I pointed out what he said about the Persian Gulf War.

844
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,820
Let me repeat it for you. Here's what he said, Senator. You know full well what he said.

845
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,820
Do you want me to answer your question?

846
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,300
I'm making a statement that he can answer.

847
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,740
All right. Can we give Admiral Stockdale a chance to speak?

848
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,840
I think, but he said, Al, here's what he said. If the vote, I mean, this is the Persian Gulf War,

849
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,700
the most important event in his political lifetime. Here's what Bill Clinton said.

850
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,460
If it's a close vote, I'd vote with the majority. If it's a close vote, I'd vote with the minority.

851
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,840
That qualifies you to be president of the United States.

852
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:27,700
Let's give Admiral Stockdale a chance.

853
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:27,960
Let's give Admiral Stockdale a chance.

854
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,040
Let's give Admiral Stockdale a chance.

855
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,780
Let's give Admiral Stockdale a chance.

856
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:58,000
I saw a group of boys the other day

857
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,940
standing in the corner

858
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,020
of the United States

859
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,880
of a playground, looking and laughing at a magazine.

860
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,280
And I overheard one of the boys say, man, is he ever cool.

861
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,960
And he pointed to the man whose picture was on the magazine cover.

862
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,400
And everybody kind of said under their breath, yeah, he's cool, all right.

863
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:19,020
And I got sick to my stomach because I'd seen the cover.

864
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,220
And the man that they were talking about had instigated a riot in one of our major cities

865
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,980
last summer. And the magazine was writing about how the police were unkind to him.

866
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:36,540
The judges were unfair with him and how he talked back and slung his long hair about and cussed and did his thing.

867
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,900
And they made him into a regular hero.

868
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:59,020
And inside this magazine was the story of the baseball player who got involved with the gamblers, of the football player who said that football was not the end, just a means to an end, meaning the girls and the good times, and a story of the folk singer who proudly claims to be both a member of a party alien to our government and a member of the government.

869
00:49:59,020 --> 00:49:59,020


870
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:06,520
non-tax-paying citizen. These young boys read with open eyes and open minds. And I thought to myself,

871
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:14,080
my God, are these the people that these young boys look up to? Are these their idols? Are these the

872
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:20,540
heroes of the now generation? Come on in, boys. Let's see what you got here. Nothing, nothing can

873
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:26,300
stop us. He doesn't like trickle-down government. And what I don't like is trickle-down government.

874
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,180
And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle-down, trickle-down,

875
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:35,960
and what I don't like is trickle-down government. At least you'll understand that I think that's

876
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,460
fundamental in our country, which you know what you're getting into. The word pain, the word pain,

877
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:46,840
the word pain. Men's suffering, Jim. There have been suffering, Jim. It's irrelevant. It's irrelevant.

878
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,580
Why is that a mistake? It's irrelevant.

879
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,560
I think it is highly irrelevant. It's irrelevant. It's irrelevant. It's irrelevant. It's irrelevant.

880
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:06,840
He has to do it. I think we've been fighting for day one. Price is time. The misery index,

881
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,460
and all you hear about is how bad things are. Are you better off? Are you better off? Remember the

882
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:18,920
question, are you better off? Are you better off? Everybody now knows the terrible price they're

883
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,820
paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain dead that they have problems. I don't have any

884
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,180
criticism of Mr. Farrow. I've never heard.

885
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:31,660
Governor Clinton make a mistake. So my argument is not with Rose Farrell. It is more with Governor

886
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,380
Clinton. Everybody's nibbling around the edges. Let's go to the center of the bullseye of the

887
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:41,320
core problem. I'd rather, if you gave me two bad choices, I'd rather have people representing

888
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:47,000
foreign countries working on their campaigns. That's the American way. It's the American way.

889
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,320
That's the American way. It's the American way. That's the American way.

890
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:06,740
Oh, friends, where have all the, where have all the pledgers gone? Oh, I just don't know what

891
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:14,520
happened. I just don't know what happened to the subgeniuses of America. I know what, which ones do

892
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:22,220
count. That's the ones who pledged tonight, and the ones who will pledge next week, because we're

893
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,000
going to have to do it again.

894
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:33,060
Friends, I am going to give you the, why, the credits, what you've been listening to tonight.

895
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:42,880
That very last thing, the collage of the debates called Master Debaters by Dad's New Slacks.

896
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:49,240
The folks in Portland, Maine, who played the hour of slack there, thanks, Dad.

897
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:55,740
There are quite a few little clips. Thanks to Reverend Susie the Floozy in Atlanta,

898
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:01,640
gave us a lot of those clips. A lot of clips came from the Lookout Miami media barrage. We still

899
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:09,280
don't know who did Lookout Miami. Oh, gosh, back from the beginning, while we heard Jimi Hendrix,

900
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,540
Ed Sanders doing some of those political songs, the Fugs, that is, the Yeasty Girls,

901
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:24,660
the Princess We Are Doe and Sister Mary Squared show, a little bit of barrage from Dr. Legume,

902
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:37,680
friends, and quite a bit of cuts from WCSB radio in Cleveland, where I was a guest on Lonesome Cowboy Dave's show.

903
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:47,200
Well, oh, and Ollie's Playhouse, the song Ollie's Playhouse was by Eugene Chadbourne,

904
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:55,500
and the amazing George Bush Farewell was by Joe,

905
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:03,160
Paulino, and Mr. Tokard. Friends, you've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour

906
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:11,560
of Slack. For more information on Church at the Subgenius, all you got to do is drop a line to

907
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:19,200
Bob. By the way, Emily, Tevis says hi, if I doubt if you're still listening at this point.

908
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,720
Write to Bob at Post Office Box 181413.

909
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,400
117 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

910
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,920
Just drop us a line and see what normally goes on in this normal, normal show.

911
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,020
Ah, yeah.

912
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,320
Please.

913
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,380
In his case, that's the American way. It's the American way.

914
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,020
I was opposed to the war.

915
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,860
I was with the minority, but I guess I would have voted with the majority.

916
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,900
Could I do it? Yes, I could.

917
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,420
Okay.

918
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,960
Could I do it? Yes, I could.

919
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,940
Could I do it? Yes, I could.

920
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,880
Could I do it? Yes, I could.

921
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,120
We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts.

922
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,720
That is absolutely absurd. That is absolutely absurd.

923
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:15,280
You violated the rule. You're ruled. You violated the rule. You're ruled. You violated the rule. You're ruled.

924
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,720
That's what I'll do as president.

925
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,760
Which I consider absolutely sick operation.

926
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,200
Whose country is this? Whose country is this? It's a mistake.

927
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,380
It was a remarkable event.

928
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,840
We did try to bring Saddam Hussein.

929
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,440
Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein.

930
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,680
We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations.

931
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:41,480
And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war.

932
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,120
Iraq-gate.

933
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:51,500
Ladies and gentlemen, directly from the Oasis Lounge in the Sands Hotel, here he is, Saddam Hussein-ger-field.

934
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,580
Oh, thanks, Johnny.

935
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,720
Oh, I'll tell you, I was okay last night.

936
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:55,920
I was okay last month.

937
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,280
But now I'm in bad shape.

938
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,080
Oh, I tell you, I keep trying to move a missile launcher and it gets blown to bits.

939
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,840
I tried to move my tanks and it got blown to bits.

940
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,380
Oh, man, I'm afraid to move my bowels.

941
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:06,620
Oh.

942
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:12,520
Then I said to my wife, Mrs. Hussein, I said, hey, Debbie, what do I got to do to get a rise out of that bush?

943
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,000
She said, buy me some flowers once in a while.

944
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,480
Oh, it's like my doctor.

945
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,000
You know my doctor, Vinny Al-Assad-Boombatz?

946
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,300
Oh, I said, doc, hey, my missiles keep misfiring and I can't hit the target.

947
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,700
He said, buy Debbie some flowers once in a while.

948
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,840
Oh, I don't get no respect at all.

949
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,040
Hey, hey, where's my Air Force?

950
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:30,920
Come on, guys.

951
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,140
Hey, I got to go change the oil in the Gulf.

952
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,520
Oh, America.

953
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,860
Oh, thanks a lot.

954
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,200
Hey, give me a break.

955
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,780
Come on, call that Ollie guy.

956
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,480
What's his name?

957
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,200
Oh, I said to my son, Bud, I said, what are you going to do after the war?

958
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,880
He said, I'm going to Disney World.

959
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,580
Oh, God, that America.

960
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,440
Those guys don't give me no respect.

961
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,100
I mean, they keep bombing me.

962
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,840
And all I can do is bomb up here.

963
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,360
Oh, I'm in bad shape.

964
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,180
Iraq, great.

965
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,800
Come on, that's not leadership.

966
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:01,520
George Bush continues to watch Bill Clinton's back in his troubled reelection race.

967
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:05,160
And now behind him, Ross Perot's footsteps are getting louder.

968
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,080
Jim Mikloszewski joins us now from the White House.

969
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,700
Good morning, Jim.

970
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,080
Good morning, Sarah.

971
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,980
The Bush campaign has been a big issue.

972
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:17,060
Presidential debates, anti-TV campaigns, there's been some movement in the polls.

973
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,520
Unfortunately for the president, they're headed in the wrong direction.

974
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,200
America is still my home.

975
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,760
We all belong.

976
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:34,320
But where have all our heroes gone?

977
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,840
I had heroes when I was a kid.

978
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,800
We all did.

979
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,300
And our heroes did their thing, too.

980
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,460
Like General Douglas MacArthur, who returned like he said he would.

981
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,700
Like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, who chased the bad guys right off the screen.

982
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,240
Like Glenn Berg, who flew the ocean.

983
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,620
And Jesse Owens, who showed Hitler.

984
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,160
And John Wayne and Gary Cooper.

985
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,320
After all, didn't they really win the war?

986
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:08,340
And General Ike, bless your soul, because you made us feel safe.

987
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,740
We've killed some of our recent heroes, the Kennedys and Kings.

988
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:20,040
And even as great as their space feats are, how many of the astronauts can you name?

989
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:20,860
Huh?

990
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,780
How many?

991
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,220
My heroes were people like you.

992
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,740
People like Joe DiMaggio, who proved that nice guys can finish first.

993
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,800
And Stan Musial, who never had an unkind word for anybody.

994
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:36,380
And Winston Churchill, whose two fingers raised together meant victory.

995
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:41,100
Not just to let your enemy have it all, kind of artificial peace.

996
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,700
This country needs a lot of things today, friends.

997
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,480
But it doesn't need any one thing any more than it needs some real heroes.

998
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,020
Men who know what it means to be looked up to by a grimy-faced kid.

999
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,280
Men who want to sign autographed books and not deals under the table.

1000
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,060
Men who are willing to play the game with the people who made them heroes.

1001
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:06,920
Men who don't mind putting on a white hat and saying thank you and please.

1002
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,340
I wish I knew more men that I'd be proud for my son to look up to and say,

1003
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,880
Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be just like him.

1004
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,520
We'll have all our heroes.

1005
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,740
Heroes.
