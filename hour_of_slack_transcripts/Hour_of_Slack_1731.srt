1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
All right now, this minute, I'm going to do something that may overthrow the entire radio business.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,020
But I'm not going to say a word about laboratory tests or quote you statistics or make medical claims.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,640
All I'm going to say simply and honestly is this.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,320
Ladies and gentlemen, try, just try the finest money can buy.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,400
Every advanced technique and control is concentrated on the subgenius.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,920
Power of Swag.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,000
Come on, wow.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,340
Great job.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:48,420
From PR News in Washington, I'm facing 18 counts of opioid and tax fraud and could face life in Washington if convicted.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,280
President Trump has insisted that he killed dozens of children traveling on a bus near the Oregon border.

11
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,980
The bus was carrying 29 children, all under the age of 15.

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,140
PR News.

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,240
And Trump believes he is 77,000 percent contained.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,100
President Trump's legal team has told Robert Mueller that Trump attorney tells Fox News that

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,020
We all do it.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,560
It's our money.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,440
To Swag.

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,500
Do it.

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,460
Do it.

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:16,820
Do it.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,400
As a result, the vehicle came inside the vehicle.

22
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,880
Six PRs are responding to the latest attack.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,380
The Dow was 74.53.

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,980
A new report from the Massachusetts Department of Public.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,140
Health finds that this is PR News in Washington.

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,640
I don't know.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,480
I don't know.

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,500
I don't know.

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
I don't know.

30
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,140
I don't know.

31
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,680
I don't know.

32
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,700
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,320
I don't know.

34
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,760
You're a tien�ay.

35
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,820
I know your staff really likes you.

36
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,840
You think you have a very soft voice.

37
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:47,840


38
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,820
I—I—I love it.

39
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:49,920


40
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,240
You got to go.

41
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,640
That's not my problem.

42
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,880
Oh, ese, hi.

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,660
It's going to be a good young trong��ре story.

44
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,460
Oh, same to you.

45
00:04:59,520 --> 00:04:59,900
All right.

46
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm going to go one more night.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,060
One more night.

48
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,280
All right.

49
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,920
I'm going to have some bananas inside my bed, and then we're going to have a fantastic

50
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:02,920


51
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Yankee Doodle, suck a feather in his pony Yankee Doodle, keep macaroni

52
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:31,680
Yankee Pony, suck a feather in his doodle Keep it up and let the girls be handy

53
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,320
I can't remember when the last moment I confessed My desk is such a mess with suggestions

54
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,120
Solving in a bin, check the end, and once again Eating donuts at the zoo in a necktie

55
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:56,760
I got my super secret stare, underneath my secret hair Losing product, but wearing your foyer, your foyer

56
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,020
I'm going to wear these shoes, I'm pouring butter on the clues Daddy, please don't lose their care

57
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,800
Heaven knows how I keep it all together when it eats up

58
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,360
Yankee Doodle said I keep my pocket It's kind of shocking when the source starts all the talking

59
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,140
I make some speeches and they open up the pages

60
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,760
Marks is the one who's walking in for fun My laptop turned a hole in my trash can

61
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,520
When you hold a giant ball, wasted artwork on your walls

62
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
Think it over while I'm talking to you

63
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,160
I'm going to lose your attention

64
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm going to lose your attention

65
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,220
Can the rain burst a vector from my brain Make numbers, or some mystic things to do?

66
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,660
You invite me out, and you're choking on your doubt Eating dinner by myself breaks my heart

67
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,240
Heaven knows how I keep it all together when it eats up

68
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,800
Yankee Doodle said I keep my pocket It's kind of shocking when the source starts all the talking

69
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,620
I make some speeches and they open up the pages

70
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,220
Heaven knows how I keep it all together when it eats up

71
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,120
Yankee Doodle said I keep my pocket It's kind of shocking when the source starts all the talking

72
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,580
I make some speeches and they open up the pages

73
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,240
Heaven knows how I keep it all together when it eats up

74
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,120
Yankee Doodle said I keep my pocket It's kind of shocking when the source starts all the talking

75
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,120


76
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,520
I make some speeches and they open up the pages

77
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:22,200
On a coin I hope the string can be put down

78
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,860
Up Hope

79
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,880
This land is my land

80
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,100
On a 28-hour train

81
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,100


82
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,420
California is to the New Yorkers.

83
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,900
This land is my land.

84
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,380
This land was made for me.

85
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,100
Well, do you need a bathroom break, Dr. Howell, before the show begins?

86
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,280
Well, it's just a matter of walking down the road a piece, isn't it, Quylo?

87
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,460
The Jenkins chambers are down there, ready for hopping.

88
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,580
Within a stone's throw.

89
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,080
So if you want to do that now, that's entirely understandable.

90
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,800
Take your bathroom break now before the Bulldada auction,

91
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,780
because once the action starts, you won't want to step away for even a moment.

92
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,560
Well, that's not to imply that you won't be able to control yourself

93
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,800
because of the excitement of the Bulldada auction.

94
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,760
That's ridiculous.

95
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,780
It's going to be something.

96
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,120
Yeah, I think you're right.

97
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,140
It's going to be something.

98
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,080
We don't know what.

99
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,300
But there will be something.

100
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:44,380
So we are hoping that this is all going to transpire as planned.

101
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,880
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to affect a somber attitude

102
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,680
while we ramp down our expectations such as they are for the Bulldada.

103
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,700
So, Quylo Drummond will be back momentarily.

104
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,800
Meanwhile, a poem, Paradise Lost, by John Newton.

105
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,740
Book one.

106
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,040
Of man's first disobedience, And the fruit of that forbidden tree,

107
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,080
Whose mortal taste brought death into the world, And all our ways were lost,

108
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,080


109
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,080


110
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,080


111
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,200
And all our ways were lost, And all our ways were lost,

112
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,200


113
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,780
With loss of Eden, Till one greater man restore us,

114
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,780
And regain the blissful seat, Sing, heavenly muse,

115
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,860
That on the secret top of Oreb or of Sinai Didst inspire that shepherd who first taught

116
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,780
the chosen seed, In the beginning how the heavens and earth

117
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,300
rose out of chaos.

118
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,060
Or, if Sion Hill delight thee more, And Siloah's blood-red

119
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,060


120
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,060


121
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,060


122
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,060


123
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,180
brook that flowed fast by the oracle of God,

124
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:14,260
I thence invoke thy aid to my adventurous song, That with no middle flight intends to soar

125
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,920
above the Aeonian mount, While it pursues things unattempted yet,

126
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,200
in prose or rhyme.

127
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,020
So welcome back, Quylo Drummond.

128
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:33,040
And now we are, I think, set for the very trembling beginnings of the Bulldada.

129
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,040


130
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,600
Bulldada auction.

131
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,160
Oh, we got feedback.

132
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,460
Feedback, yeah, we got lots of feedback here.

133
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:49,420
So, Quylo, is there a huge cache of stuff behind us that we should be dragging out and

134
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,660
piling up on the table?

135
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,280
Yeah, we should probably, I'll start bringing them forward and setting them up on the table

136
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,700
so people can eyeball that action item.

137
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,640
That's a very good plan.

138
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,000
And then one by one we will offer them up, eh?

139
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,100
That's right, huh?

140
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,780
You and me are offering them up.

141
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,020
Yeah.

142
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,020
That's the way that's gonna work.

143
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,860
That's right.

144
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,860
So in just a moment, ladies and gentlemen, we will begin the actual physical process

145
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,360
of the Bulldada auction itself.

146
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,140
What was this, Jay something McGee?

147
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:25,280
That was Jay Fred Muggs, the famous business chimpanzee that people remember, that is,

148
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,620
people of a certain childhood remember.

149
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,760
Jay Fred Muggs, an actual portrait here.

150
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,220
You know, a still, movie still size shot of Jay Fred.

151
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,900
Just one of the many inexplicable objects which we will be offering as part of the benign

152
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,440
venison of the Bulldada auction.

153
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,480
What is Bulldada, after all?

154
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,760
This essential subgenius concept?

155
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:08,260
So often through the years it's been misunderstood or even misapplied to inferior objects.

156
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:14,340
The fact is, we in the Church of the Subgenius have always believed that those who have the

157
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:23,420
opportunity should avail themselves deeply of this nation's popular culture and its many

158
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,360
evolutionary ramifications.

159
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:34,320
Going back to certain essential sources at the wellspring of creativity which informs

160
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,760
the nuosphere, or the world of things known.

161
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,540
And where better to find it than in cheesy monster movies and so on.

162
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,260
The reason is that people in the cheesy monster movies are trying to entertain, so they don't

163
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,320
necessarily have an attitude.

164
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,340
Thus, the eternal verities are not known.

165
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:11,660
It is all based on the

166
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:11,740
fairytale.

167
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,220
Because, until toothbrush, the object contains keeping Onu and

168
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,220


169
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:25,240
P allí où la bel notice est grande!

170
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,280
Unbelievable !

171
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,700
guitar solo

172
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,520
So you're lost on your way

173
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,840
And the price you must pay

174
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,400
Is the living hell of knowing you're a fool

175
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,040
And as you fall down

176
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,240
And the earth makes no sound

177
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,760
Cause you're breathing just to live

178
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,280
Just to drool

179
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,240
Then you're living

180
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,820
Oh yes, you're living

181
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,260
In the land of Ziggy-Dee-Boo

182
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,920
Ziggy-Dee-Boo

183
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,960
Ziggy-Dee-Boo

184
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,940
Yes, you're living

185
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,380
Oh yes, you're living

186
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,760
In the land of Ziggy-Dee-Boo

187
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,800
Ziggy-Dee-Boo

188
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,540
How about you?

189
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,060
Oh, the land of Ziggy-Dee-Boo

190
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,620
How about you?

191
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,320
Oh, the land of Ziggy-Dee-Boo

192
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,720
Oh

193
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,940
This is a good song

194
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,920
At the end of your rope

195
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,040
And you think you can't cope

196
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,520
But you're really to give the devil his due

197
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,260
And as you sink in

198
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,320
And become one with sin

199
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,820
Then you realize

200
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,880
You're praying for the true

201
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,540
And we're living

202
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,960
Oh yes we're living

203
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,320
In the land of Ziggity-boo

204
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,080
Yes we're living

205
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,500
Oh yes we're living

206
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,880
In the land of Ziggity-boo

207
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,420
How about you?

208
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,840
Oh, the land of Ziggity-boo

209
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,740
Oh, the land of Ziggity-boo

210
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:49,800
Oh, the land of Ziggity-boo

211
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,900
How about you?

212
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,260
The land of diggity boo

213
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,600
Cause we're living, oh yes we're living

214
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,940
In the land of diggity boo

215
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:34,140
Yes we're living, oh yes we're living

216
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,380
In the land of diggity boo

217
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,300
How about you?

218
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,300
The land of diggity boo

219
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,420
How about you?

220
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,740
Oh, the land of diggity boo

221
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:08,220
The land of diggity boo

222
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,520
The land of diggity boo

223
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,700
The land of diggity boo

224
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:36,120
The land of diggity boo

225
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,320
The land of diggity boo

226
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,460
The land of Sigity Boo

227
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,280
The land of Sigity Boo

228
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,380
From PR News in Washington, I'm genetically modified to withstand the Trump killer

229
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,180
that weakens the president's most powerful turkey plan ban.

230
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,440
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is stiff in Honolulu, Hawaii.

231
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,580
The mayor of Honolulu says three strippers at a high-rise residential building.

232
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,820
We want to be sure that we overreact.

233
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,040
The agency's new measures include requiring a special PR News during certain hours of the day.

234
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,580
And a sweeping crackdown, including the cracking sweepdown just last night.

235
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,220
The German turkey confirms this is PR News in Washington.

236
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,540
There's some movie on YouTube about it.

237
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,160
It shows...

238
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,440
It shows the age of the universe.

239
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,460
And the wrinkles, the falling hair, the falling...

240
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,820
It accelerates like ten times every ten seconds and goes like trillions and trillions and trillions.

241
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,080
That's gutter.

242
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,820
Into the future, until the last supermassive black hole explodes.

243
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,160
And sucks all the universe.

244
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,100
It's the end of time.

245
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,200
Yes, well, the question is, does it all start over again in the theory of eternal recurrence?

246
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,540
Yeah, I don't think we're going to that.

247
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,160
So then I'll see you a couple billion years...

248
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,600
A couple billion years from now, just in the same spot.

249
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,220
But there's also that film, Power of Ten.

250
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,960
Yeah.

251
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,400
I mean, if that one, that's the model for all such pictures.

252
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,140
Yeah.

253
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:35,900
Where it starts on the molecular level and then it keeps zooming out until you're way out past the galaxies.

254
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,880
Actually, it starts at a picnic and goes out and then comes back into the molecular.

255
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,340
It's on YouTube, folks.

256
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,300
The Hellstrom Chronicle.

257
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,600
Do you remember that movie from the 70s?

258
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,320
What was the name?

259
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,020
Well, it's...

260
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,140
Okay.

261
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,660
Yeah, it's a bug.

262
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,320
It's about, you know, it's actually micro photography of bugs.

263
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,960
And it's pretty good.

264
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,640
But then it's wrapped up in this story about this fake scientist saying,

265
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,280
we've only got a little while longer.

266
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,440
The bugs are going to take over.

267
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,300
They're utterly ruthless.

268
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,240
And one shot that's in it shows lovers.

269
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,720
They're lying on a blanket.

270
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,440
They're kissing.

271
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,320
It's the summer.

272
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,960
They make out.

273
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,180
And then it zooms into right next to them.

274
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,480
Two insects are eating each other alive with horrible sound effects.

275
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:12,820
Yeah.

276
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah.

277
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,280
Oh, God.

278
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,360
It's really pretty.

279
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,940
To show how horrible the insects were.

280
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,580
It shows you how bugs die.

281
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,540
And it cuts to famous big bug monster movies like Them.

282
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah.

283
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,460
They have bug goo in them.

284
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,000
I saw a poster for a really...

285
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,220
We call it Ickhor.

286
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,240
Really obscure movie called Day of the Dolphin.

287
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,220
With George C. Scott.

288
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,140
George C. Scott.

289
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,620
And some chirping dolphins that'll steal your heart away.

290
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,180
We don't recommend watching that one.

291
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,660
It's weird.

292
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,140
It's weird.

293
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,680
It's weird.

294
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,260
It's weird.

295
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,940
What's that you say?

296
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,300
He unwittingly trains a dolphin to assassinate the president.

297
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,340
Yeah.

298
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:50,760
Watch.

299
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:50,980
No.

300
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,560
Watch that.

301
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,780
Pet the dolphin, Mr. President.

302
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,080
No.

303
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,980
You'd better not pet that dolphin, Mr. President.

304
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,780
Step back from the dolphin, Mr. President.

305
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,080
Now get him, boy.

306
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,040
Like crap.

307
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,740
That dolphin just shot the president.

308
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,980
Can you resist the pull of a dolphin?

309
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,500
I'd want to pet the dolphin.

310
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,940
They got big teeth.

311
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
They can bite.

312
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,420
They're so gray and slimy and you just want to touch them.

313
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,500
They're nice, most of them, but that doesn't mean all individuals will behave in the same manner.

314
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,960
You could just have the bad luck to draw the crankiest, bitchiest dolphin in the ocean.

315
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,400
I was trying to pet one at SeaWorld one time and I almost got my finger nipped off.

316
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,620
Yeah, you're gonna bite your head off.

317
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,480
How's that for your peaceable dolphin?

318
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:38,760
Yeah.

319
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,140
One day, my father always told this story.

320
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,260
He was a young man.

321
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,800
He used to swim way out in the ocean.

322
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,640
He was out and something bumped him and he thought, oh my God, shark, you know, but then

323
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,440
a dolphin stuck its head up and went, and then it helped him.

324
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,460
It pushed him all the way back to...

325
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,220
Gave him 50 bucks.

326
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:58,940
Sure, yeah.

327
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,580
Gave him a haircut, a shoe shine.

328
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I would be so happy if a dolphin would just help me solve all my problems.

329
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,120
Hey.

330
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,980
If the dolphin would just say, it's gonna be all right.

331
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,800
Then you know.

332
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,760
You know that dolphin's got his own problems.

333
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,920
He's in the ocean with all that plastic and everything and you want him to help you now

334
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,860
on top of all that other stuff he has to do and that?

335
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,880
I don't have any clue.

336
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,740
I don't know the sonar waves we put in the ocean that screw up their communication.

337
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,160
Yes, they interfere with whale music and everything else.

338
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,460
Well, they just need a hug.

339
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,160
From a giant octopus.

340
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,420
We call him Nemo.

341
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,580
And we just can't find him anywhere.

342
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,500
The video is over, but this is the last of the commercials.

343
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:08,500


344
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:08,500


345
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,820
The last of the commercials is from the one and only, Jeff.

346
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:09,820


347
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:09,820


348
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:09,820


349
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:09,900
Bye.

350
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


351
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


352
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


353
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


354
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


355
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


356
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


357
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


358
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


359
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


360
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


361
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,920


362
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:09,940
Bye.

363
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,280
That's not Ricky, that's like Matthew

364
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,600
Evil minds are plot destruction

365
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,540
Slaughter of death construction

366
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:54,400
Slaughter of death construction

367
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,520
Slaughter of death construction

368
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:38,080
Slaughter of death construction

369
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,520
Slaughter of death construction

370
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:54,520
Slaughter of death construction

371
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,520
Slaughter of death construction

372
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:54,520
Slaughter of death construction

373
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:24,400
Slaughter of death construction

374
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:54,460
Slaughter of death construction

375
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:21,400
Slaughter of death construction

376
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,320
Slaughter of death construction

377
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,480
Slaughter of death construction

378
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,960
Slaughter of death construction

379
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,920
Slaughter of death construction

380
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,120
Slaughter of death construction

381
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,240
Slaughter of death construction

382
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,820
Slaughter of death construction

383
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,600
Slaughter of death construction

384
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,140
Slaughter of death construction

385
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,520
Slaughter of death construction

386
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:35,880
official, but the cities, the East Coast and the West Coast, where the better off, you know,

387
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:43,520
higher income, more educated, privileged, elite type folks live, they can all afford to have

388
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,100
edited internet. They spend a lot of money to have people and very good programs

389
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:59,100
filter out the garbage. Everybody else loves the garbage and go for it. And so America has

390
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:06,060
divided up into, you might say, blue and red areas, defined by where the Walmarts

391
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:13,100
start appearing as you leave a big city. That's kind of like the border. It's not like they have

392
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,040
checkpoints exactly, but inner America, the Midwest, the rural areas,

393
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:29,260
is Ameristan, they call it. And as this one character says, oh, the roads there are decent

394
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:35,000
or by the standards of Ameristan. Farmers need roads to move stuff around so they don't see

395
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,480
them as a government plot. They don't tear them up on principle and they don't blow up the bridges.

396
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,120
There's not a lot of roadblocks, so call it two days with one night at our farmhouse,

397
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,200
which is like a little pocket of blue.

398
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:56,380
Meaning where people are educated enough to not believe everything they see on the miasma,

399
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:06,820
as the internet is called then. And there's some, one of the poe buckers that lives in the interior

400
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,300
says something to them as they travel about Iowa City. And this other guy explains, oh, that's where

401
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:17,460
the big hospital is. So it's like another country to them. But they have to go there when they get

402
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,080
sick, like to get a, you know, a good job. And so they're like, oh, well, I'm going to go to the

403
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,400
hospital. And they're like, oh, well, I'm going to go to the hospital. And they're like, oh, well,

404
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:26,480
melanoma whacked off or whatever. They can't afford blue state hotel rooms or food. So they

405
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,740
have to camp out on the periphery and cook over propane burners under tarps. Not a fun time.

406
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,820
And I know one person who would know about that would be lonesome cowboy Dave.

407
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,900
Who probably is me. I'm having a hard time hearing you and probably

408
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,060
even be more.

409
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:55,760
Idiotic than usual all evening because phone is screwing up here. Now the cell phone doesn't

410
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:03,660
seem to be charging. It's charged up. It's like, you know, that's okay, Dave. That's okay.

411
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,500
Everything's fine. You don't have to understand us. I never understand you. I usually can't really

412
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:16,660
even hear any, anything anybody's saying to me. Is my voice coming through clear and loud?

413
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,960
Yeah. Well, I mean,

414
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,420
I hear noises. I can understand. I can guess what you're saying.

415
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,480
Well, we can all hear the gas pig, the noises from the gas pig that they've released down by

416
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,080
the, uh, untrary movement when they first opened up the gates and let some of the prisoners around.

417
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,640
Well, not physically aroused and kind of like mentally aroused, but they believe those

418
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,300
photographs that the president was showing about how, you know, how Iran attacked their ship

419
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,240
so that we'd get in trouble with everybody in the world, you know?

420
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,680
Well, everybody will believe

421
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:48,940
anything.

422
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,460
That they want to believe.

423
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,720
Oh, come on. What? What? Oh, come on. I mean, I read a lot of science fiction, but

424
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:06,700
dumber than a subgenius named Lunsum Cowboy Dave? Right? Or, I mean, even I can't understand that,

425
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,640
and I'm even dumber.

426
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:18,440
Hey, hey, watch your language there. Language.

427
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,940
I was going to say something untowards, pointed in no general direction, specifically.

428
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,960
Well, I was reading in the sci-fi book just before you called, Dave. I was reading in this new,

429
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:39,280
brand new Neil Stevenson novel, Fall. It's so new that I, I had to buy a hardback.

430
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,180
I hate Neil Stevenson so much. I have to. I had to. I've read all of this guy's books,

431
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,580
every one of them. I've read the...

432
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,060
Did you read it?

433
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:55,200
cycle three and a half times and it's 3,000 pages long that's how much I'm

434
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,400
jealous of this guy I hate him because I'm so jealous he's such a good writer

435
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,600
just has to say it that way anyway he's describing your part of the country Dave

436
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,380
and so one of the characters is asking how come so many of them have bad teeth

437
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:19,160
but our driver doesn't and this guy goes Ted has normal people teeth because

438
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,620
he's old and grew up before this part of the world got Facebooked after that the

439
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,800
people with education flute fled to places like Ames Des Moines Iowa City

440
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,360
which includes dentists a few mainline churches used to run charity dental

441
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,560
clinics where you could get a bad tooth pulled or whatever those are being

442
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,340
chased away

443
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:49,820
by these these people which is the Leviticus who I was over a thousand

444
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:55,580
miles away but we yeah but all of all of red America is the same in the sci-fi

445
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:01,060
book and they all believe the same everything they read on the Internet

446
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:09,120
well they should there yeah I can understand that people carry around a

447
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,380
little card with them

448
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,220
a little card with them that they put in front of awkward conversations they'll

449
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,620
hold it up in the middle of conversations that means they don't want

450
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:25,680
to argue one side of the card was solid red with no words or images and was

451
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,820
meant to be displayed outward as a nonverbal signal that you disagreed but

452
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,860
you weren't gonna be drawn into a fake argument the other side facing the user

453
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:42,240
was a list of little reminders as to what was really going on and here's the

454
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,080
the list of reminders, Dave, that you have to remember whenever you're talking to anybody,

455
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:57,240
especially on the internet. One, speech is aggression. Two, every utterance has a winner

456
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:13,020
and a loser. Three, curiosity is feigned. Four, lying is performative. And five, stupidity

457
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:25,860
is power. And so we find ourselves right back at the beginning of the Dark Ages.

458
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,220
Sounds like we're...

459
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,980
Before it starts and begins.

460
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:36,860
Well, yeah, yeah. Well, you know. It's a really fun, prescient science fiction book, Dave,

461
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,000
sort of like yours, Neighbor World.

462
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,820
Yes, I was thinking, just think of all the things in Neighbor World, particularly there

463
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:50,360
are two that are happening right now. In fact, you see, like, oh, Jan Janskaville, but 20

464
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:56,460
years ago, they kept it a secret what they were going to do. They have since the 1980s.

465
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,240


466
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,480
And they have been.

467
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,480


468
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,480


469
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,480


470
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,480


471
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,480


472
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,480


473
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,480


474
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,480


475
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,480


476
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,680
But what the hell? Who cares? Somebody struck me on the head kind of hard, was messing

477
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,840
around, picked up a brick and hit me on the head.

478
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,340
No!

479
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Well, that happened when you were much younger, though, right?

480
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:19,900
Oh, when I was in the common age of, I think I was 25 years old. It was my first time

481
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:25,280
in Lisbon and I joined the Navy, but I became a hiccup sergeant and I had to be reduced.

482
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,220
I was taken out of the military.

483
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,220


484
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,220


485
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,220


486
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,480
I think it was like one point and that's the only place I could live.

487
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,460
Dave.

488
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,520
Dave's had a rough life.

489
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,220
I guess.

490
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:46,860
He was a Navy cowboy. One of those brickheads, they called him. The ones that had been injured

491
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:52,000
in the head became less than a genius.

492
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,180
Yeah, they're...

493
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,200
And the ones in the submarines were called sub-less than.

494
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,920
They were called sub-less than geniuses. They kind of shortened that to sub-geniuses.

495
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,080
And it came to mean all the sailors who'd been hit with a brick in the head and eventually

496
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:12,080
it came to mean, you know, any, anybody really cool. So there you go.

497
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,580
Can I tell you...

498
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,060
Praise Bob.

499
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,880
Praise Bob. Or not.

500
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,940
Or not.

501
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:23,240
Can I tell you a true story now? I know of a municipality somewhere in the local northeastern

502
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,180
Ohio area who discovered while it was doing some drilling and stuff, that there was a

503
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:38,100
whole network of underground water to service fire engines that would come by and they could

504
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:43,320
just hook the pumper trucks up. They were like perfect brick catacombs, or not catacombs,

505
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,020
but they looked kind of like cylinders underground and you'd pump them dry and they'd fill up

506
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,400
with water again. Water, although they're not sure if it's completely potable or not

507
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,160
because so many things have happened. I think at one time you could get a lot of water out

508
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:04,080
of anywhere just by these things. And nowadays they don't have stuff that they had 20 years

509
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,280
ago. You know what I mean? People are getting stupider.

510
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,640
No!

511
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,420
Yes.

512
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,560
Hey, that's a good, hey, that's the first time anybody's mentioned on this show that

513
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,100
I can remember this hour. I wonder why that would be. Oh well.

514
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,140
It must be in the news today. Today it must be very forceful, like a bad bag of diarrhea,

515
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,140
you know, kind of something that you can't really compromise on.

516
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,140


517
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:33,480
Well, of course, needless to say, it's pretty sad when subgeniuses are calling somebody

518
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,420
else stupid. That's a bad, bad sign, but it's been going on for a while.

519
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,200
I haven't called anybody by name. I didn't say like, Reverend Ivan Stang, he's stupid.

520
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,580
No, and you wouldn't even say which municipality it was in Ohio that had these, what do they

521
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:53,480
call them, water pipes? Only they're not connected to city water, right? They're just well water.

522
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,120
No, they were discovered just recently and they were abandoned probably a year ago.

523
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,780
Probably in the 1880s.

524
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,360
Well, what town, how old are these towns you're talking about?

525
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,600
200 years.

526
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,060
There were towns in the 1880s?

527
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,540
Yeah. Most of these towns are 200 years old.

528
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,760
Oh yeah, up here in the north you'll run into that kind of thing.

529
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,220
Underground water reservoirs.

530
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:27,040
Well, now actually we have towns that are over 200 years old in the south, but they all have names like Santa

531
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,620
Antonio and El Paso.

532
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,620
El Paso.

533
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,100
San Jose.

534
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,020
Oh yes, Ohio was pretty well populated with the bad guys.

535
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,840
Well, now at some-

536
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,700
They were all Revolutionary War veterans and they were promised a bunch of land for doing their duty to the-

537
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,040
Oh, really?

538
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,220
Jefferson and Washington tried to get out of it, but instead they gave them a bunch of land that belonged to the natives.

539
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,860
That was the Revolutionary War?

540
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,540
Yeah, the Revolutionary War. So here's a bunch of land and you don't have to move, of course, a bunch of the native American people out.

541
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:10,420
So a bunch of white po'buckers got promised 40 acres and a mule and got gypped.

542
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:18,580
Not to put down gypsies, that's actually kind of a bad word to use because it implies that all gypsies are thieves.

543
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,840
You have to say Roma.

544
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:25,120
Yeah, they're trumped. They got trumped, rather, would be more accurate.

545
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:25,480
Yes.

546
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,660
Yeah, you can use that bad word as many times as you want. Never stop thinking.

547
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,320
Trumping. Go trump yourself. You're full of trump.

548
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:42,560
Oh man, I gotta run to the bathroom. I gotta take a trump real fast, man. Don't get in my way. There's trump running down my legs already.

549
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:53,380
Have you seen this thing on the internet? It's Trump, but it's like the old Ogden Nash cartoon of Humpty Trumpy Dumpty.

550
00:42:53,380 --> 00:43:00,120
From sitting on a wall and it's kind of like a fat belly, like a, well it looks like Tweedledum and Tweedledee all rolled into one.

551
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,620
I think I've seen 40 or 50 different editorial cartoons on that theme.

552
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,920
It's, it's a fat shaming, you know.

553
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,260
Well, you know, you hear Tweedledum and Tweedledee all trumped and dumpty.

554
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,600
Sphere shaming.

555
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,780
Not so much fat. I mean, because eggs aren't fat, they're just spherical.

556
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:34,060
Trump is not spherical. He's just a big fat guy. Big. And he calls everybody else little. If you notice that, he doesn't like somebody, they're little.

557
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,380
He's called condescensionist.

558
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,860
He calls them stupid.

559
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:50,340
He's like the Buddha before he had to learn the seven lessons. He's just the son of a king and so he thinks everything should be like, you know, son of the king style.

560
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:52,940
Well.

561
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,960
Misery has never touched his life. He's been blessed.

562
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:04,240
I wouldn't say that, actually. I wouldn't say that that guy's blessed at all. I wouldn't say that he's happy.

563
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:19,640
I wouldn't, I would say that that's the most insecure, unfulfilled, terrified, blatantly defensive person I've ever seen and I've seen a few of them.

564
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,920
But, you know, they say that the woman is the most beautiful.

565
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,080
I mean, don't you think that's a pretty good thing?

566
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,080


567
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,080


568
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,080


569
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,080


570
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,080


571
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,080


572
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,080


573
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,080


574
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,080


575
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:36,160
You know, it's almost the worst thing that can happen to you is being born rich and never, ever having to face consequences for your decisions because that turns you into little better than a moron.

576
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,140
And that should help, that should make all of us poor folks feel a lot better about that.

577
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:50,800
You know, it's like we may be struggling, but at least we have some awareness of what is actually happening.

578
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,960
And we're striving to be little more than a moron.

579
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,240
Well, little more than little, if anything, you know.

580
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,920
We're struggling to be morons, yeah.

581
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:06,160
Yeah, if I could just work my way up to the moron level, God, then I could pole vault up to idiot.

582
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,520
You know, like C5 is really a good holding zone.

583
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,860
You know, at least if you've got packages, you know, that you want in underwear.

584
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:14,840
Yeah.

585
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,540
Well, at least I'm not a vegetable.

586
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,980
Oh, who says you aren't?

587
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,440
Well, the nurse said I wasn't.

588
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:31,660
She said I could get out of the vegetable wing as soon as I started, you know, doing that thing for myself.

589
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,300
Instead of having them have to do it.

590
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,280
Well, you've spent some time in the beet department of the vegetable wing.

591
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,500
I remember.

592
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,920
I won't do that again.

593
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,760
I'm not going to do that again.

594
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,120
They don't have to put me in the beet wing, the beet ward.

595
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,860
The beet wing.

596
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,360
I'm going to beet off.

597
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,280
I mean, I'm not going to.

598
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,340
I mean, I don't want to end up in that ward again.

599
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,160
I'm not going to.

600
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,080
You won't be in that root cell.

601
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:57,620
I won't.

602
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:57,900
I quit.

603
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,860
I quit doing that.

604
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,400
It's not right.

605
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,080
There's a war in Ward 4.

606
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,200
These human valium group and grop and cry.

607
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,940
Herr Doctor, my authority, you know no more than I.

608
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,680
I'm not stuttering.

609
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,320
I'm not.

610
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,020
I'm not stuttering.

611
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,140
I'm not stuttering.

612
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:11,140


613
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:11,560
Why?

614
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,320
You keep me.

615
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,560
I have such an evil ring.

616
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,580
I'm sorry.

617
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,960
Dave, don't apologize for that.

618
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,560
No, he just said a point.

619
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,740
You can't recite poetry and then apologize.

620
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,020
He sounded like Dr.

621
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,640
Hal saying some kind of a highfalutin poem that I couldn't understand.

622
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:29,300
Yeah.

623
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:36,060
It's part of a lonesome song called kill talk about a person who's been put in a mental

624
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,580
institution against their will.

625
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,500
A new one?

626
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,760
A new Lonesome Cowboy Dave song?

627
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,160
No, I'm afraid it's about...

628
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,060
I'm afraid it's like a couple decades old.

629
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,380
Huh.

630
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,600
It's an old band, the Clocks, the Radio Alarm Clocks.

631
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,500
I don't know if you remember.

632
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,680
I know the Radio Alarm Clocks.

633
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,460
I've seen the cover.

634
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,060
We were in the Clocks.

635
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,900
We got afraid because there was a Clocks in Chicago, too,

636
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,000
so we had to be different.

637
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,120
It didn't make any difference.

638
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:03,840
It was stupid.

639
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,540
We have all the Clocks records.

640
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,240
We just don't have a record player.

641
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,400
Yes, we do.

642
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,520
We have a record player.

643
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,240
We just don't use a record player.

644
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:12,500
Right.

645
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,140
We don't use it, but we have one.

646
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,960
But you do smudge the house once in a while

647
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,980
because if you were a Native American or Phoenician

648
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,560
or a troublemaker or you had too many toilet breaks

649
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,700
during the first part before lunch and stuff like that.

650
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,460
That's how you keep the ghost and the tax man out,

651
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,600
is smudge the house.

652
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,700
You mean with, like, sage and...

653
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,000
Yeah.

654
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,240
And, uh...

655
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,600
And holy words.

656
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,600
And tiger X.

657
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,820
Tiger X.

658
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,360
And that sage.

659
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:40,720
That sage incense.

660
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,880
That Indian incense.

661
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,460
Yeah, the tiger poop scares away almost all the varmints.

662
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,100
Even dogs.

663
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:50,860
Yeah.

664
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,520
Tiger poop?

665
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,740
Yeah, of course.

666
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,700
It's very metal.

667
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:54,920
Expensive.

668
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,840
Well, you don't need much.

669
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,540
Just put a little bit around your door sills.

670
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,240
Oh, you can't.

671
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,420
You can't have too much

672
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,820
because you probably could have some convulsions or something.

673
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,800
Well, you better get it while you can

674
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,160
because there aren't going to be much tigers left on this planet after a while.

675
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,280
Yeah, that's...

676
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,460
We're going to have to build a very special

677
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:17,300
X-Day escape festival that has tigers in it.

678
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,040
Oh, well, it'll be like a zoo,

679
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,760
except that it'll be bigger than the entire Earth

680
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,020
and it won't have any bars.

681
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,620
And the tigers can eat all the giraffes and monkeys

682
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,400
that they can catch and kill.

683
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,580
And the monkeys and giraffes can flee as far as they want to.

684
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,460
And everything will be natural again.

685
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,400
I love when the Bratons do that.

686
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,080
Huh?

687
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,160
When they flee and scream.

688
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:40,220
Yeah.

689
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,060
Anyway, that's going to be one of...

690
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,460
On my escape vessel,

691
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,820
that's where all the animals are going to escape to

692
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,160
on X-Day in two weeks.

693
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,720
God, it's two weeks.

694
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,120
Yeah.

695
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,680
Well, two weeks before Dr. Howell gets here.

696
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,100
Yes.

697
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,940
And then that's like it's begun.

698
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,460
Yes.

699
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,100
I'm packing the van.

700
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:57,840
Mm-hmm.

701
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,460
And we're driving down to Southern Ohio.

702
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,460
Oh, I know.

703
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,320
Spending money hand over fist.

704
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,060
And even though it's cheap...

705
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,920
Dark-boiled socks, you know?

706
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,120
I mean, this is a cheap trip.

707
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:09,680
It's only...

708
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:09,900
What?

709
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,480
I can't...

710
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,280
I can't say what the week worth of partying costs,

711
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,460
but it's kind of like the subgenius membership.

712
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,540
You know, it's so small,

713
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,080
you can't even say it on a public radio station.

714
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:22,860
Right.

715
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:23,820
It's too embarrassing.

716
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,060
It's like a secret society.

717
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,060
Well, that too.

718
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,000
That's what I was going to say.

719
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,600
It's like one day they discover you're wearing gargoyle socks.

720
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,400
You know what I mean?

721
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,000
Well, the Illuminati don't go around saying how much it costs to join.

722
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,940
You know, Al-Qaeda doesn't say what their dues are.

723
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,440
No, they got that blank booklet.

724
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,020
They can just open it up anywhere they want and sign their first...

725
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,980
You know.

726
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,560
We're in the wrong club, man.

727
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,460
We joined the wrong fanatical hate religion.

728
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,080
Just not enough hate.

729
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,180
And they don't take it seriously.

730
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,760
All they do is draw funny pictures of their enemies

731
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,040
and say mean things on podcasts.

732
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,860
America's a club and you ain't in it.

733
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,100
And wear gargoyle socks.

734
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:09,840
Yeah.

735
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,140
Two-tone shoes.

736
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,420
We're in the club in that we work there

737
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,280
as dishwashers and, you know,

738
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,680
waiters and cooks and toilet swabbers.

739
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:29,440
That's why we get chicken bone soup for dinner every night after the shift's over.

740
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,500
Hat tippers.

741
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:30,800
Free food.

742
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,480
Shoe shiners.

743
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:32,760
Chicken fat.

744
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,740
For the swells.

745
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,460
Lizard wings.

746
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,320
Carnicobia.

747
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,120
Well, I shouldn't complain.

748
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:45,660
I actually have a pretty good situation as a club employee.

749
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,140
I'm one of the videographers.

750
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,240
So the rich people will actually talk to you if you have a camera

751
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,500
because they want to act like they know what kind of camera it is and stuff.

752
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,760
And you wear a tuxedo like they do.

753
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,220
Yeah, they like that too.

754
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,760
That's how I know about rich folks.

755
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:08,240
I used to videotape their deb parties and weddings and stuff on Betamax.

756
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,540
Because they didn't have their own cameras then, you know.

757
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,500
Nobody did.

758
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,600
Only experts.

759
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,060
That's mostly in the days where they used to have social registers.

760
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,120
And now you have to register to do anything.

761
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,340
You know, like if you're insane or something and you want to buy a gun,

762
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,280
you've got to go register just like the social registers did when they were all social.

763
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:28,880
No, you don't.

764
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:29,920
Are you kidding?

765
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,240
Not in most places you don't have to.

766
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,760
You can be as insane as you want.

767
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,700
You don't have to register to buy a gun.

768
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,060
Especially if you're a socialism.

769
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,880
You're not allowed to.

770
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:47,340
Because you could cause an insurrection that would be persecutional to our leader.

771
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,640
Whatever it is.

772
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,520
Seriously, my son bought him.

773
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:58,120
He'd moved back to Texas from a blue state.

774
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,240
And he thought, well, I better get a handgun now like everybody does.

775
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,580
He asked his cousins and his uncle, okay, well, where do I get this thing?

776
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:09,080
And they said, well, you know, you're not getting registered.

777
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,380
And they went, registered?

778
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,500
This is Texas.

779
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,000
What are you talking about?

780
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,920
So there you go.

781
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:28,660
Not only do you not have to register it, if you want, you can wear it on top of your head.

782
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,340
You know, wear a gun strapped to either side of your head just like part of your glasses.

783
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,500
Everywhere you look, there's a gun.

784
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,660
You could like put holsters on each ear.

785
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:46,200
So if somebody were to harass you, you say draw, and you could like pull both of them off your head.

786
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,600
If you wanted to.

787
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,920
If you wanted to, yeah.

788
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:51,600
Yeah, you can.

789
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,660
And everything's legal.

790
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,600
Of course, because it's Texas.

791
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,540
Everything's legal except sickness.

792
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,660
If you get ill, you just basically, that means it's time for you to die.

793
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,420
What kind of loser are you to get sick?

794
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,000
That's the way the health care system works there.

795
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:07,320
Yeah.

796
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:07,360
Yeah.

797
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,000
Yeah.

798
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:08,540
Yeah.

799
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:08,560
Yeah.

800
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


801
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


802
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


803
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


804
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


805
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


806
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


807
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


808
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


809
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


810
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


811
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


812
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


813
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


814
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


815
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


816
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,560


817
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,920
Of course, anything is possible then.

818
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,360
But I'm not exaggerating, by the way.

819
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:20,640
I've had up close and personal tragic experiences with this sort of difference.

820
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,380
It's true.

821
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:22,900
Yeah.

822
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:31,720
If you've got Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, kids, rob a 7-Eleven and move to Washington State or someplace.

823
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:36,040
Get on disability and get on pain pills and die legally.

824
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,020
Because otherwise, you're...

825
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,960
You're just up the creek.

826
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:45,100
Not only without a paddle, but without use of your limbs.

827
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,200
And in constant, endless pain.

828
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,940
And, yeah.

829
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,480
Well, that can happen to anybody in any country.

830
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,620
And some countries have worse...

831
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:02,400
Some states have worse health care even than Texas.

832
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,780
True.

833
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:04,380
Yeah.

834
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,440
It's a good thing we're not there right now.

835
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,360
But, too...

836
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,300
We won't be back.

837
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,620
We won't be back there for another couple of months.

838
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,020
By then, everything will already have been forgotten.

839
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,480
Everything that ever happened will be forgotten again.

840
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,520
Because it's...

841
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,960
The world has been...

842
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,480
The world has been Facebooked.

843
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,080
Why does anybody need to remember anything?

844
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,260
It's all been Facebooked.

845
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:28,960
Yeah.

846
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,560
And that's the truth, too.

847
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,460
It's a solemn, perfunctory act that we perform nightly.

848
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,740
With shoes or without shoes, we're all face west.

849
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,540
Why do they...

850
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,120
Why do you have to remember any...

851
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,300
Why do you have to remember any history at all?

852
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,780
Because there's always something...

853
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,080
There's always a new funny cat and dog picture on Facebook.

854
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,140
Right.

855
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,300
And plus, you are history.

856
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,080
You know, don't forget.

857
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,220
Any kind of revolutionary idea you may have is too late.

858
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,380
It's already done by somebody else.

859
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,920
Well, it's already been done.

860
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,220
And not only that, but there's an inoculation in society to keep it from working.

861
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,980
So everything will always be worse and stupid forever.

862
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,040
Oh, God.

863
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,040
It's so depressing.

864
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,600
The only thing that would ever make me feel better about any of this

865
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,540
would be to join some crazy cult that was really just not a cult,

866
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,840
but sort of for fun and made you laugh at all the sick, horrible things in the world.

867
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,200
Just long enough to not kill yourself.

868
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,140
You feel just a little bit of slack for half a second

869
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,500
and maybe get a leg up on something.

870
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,780
Hey, I know.

871
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,640
I've heard about this one called the Church of the...

872
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,580
What was it?

873
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,660
The Rub Plenus or the...

874
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,180
The Scrubnemius or...

875
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,500
God, I never can...

876
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:48,060
And they were like, praise gobs or praise dick or praise slug or something.

877
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,060
Praise Richard.

878
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,320
Bub.

879
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,460
Yeah, praise Bub.

880
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,040
Bubba.

881
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:52,840
Bubba.

882
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,900
Yeah, it was Church of Bubba or something like that.

883
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,000
Anyway, I'm going to join them sub-clemuses.

884
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,660
They've got the answer.

885
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,760
That Bub guy said so.

886
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,480
The Church of the Benign Slug.

887
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,640
That's the way I'll always be.

888
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,360
I'll always remember it.

889
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:13,800
I'll remember something that I go to the quartermaster of the den and stuff.

890
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,660
And right there in my chest of drawers,

891
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,580
it's like a Gideon's Bible as to a normal Hungarian or maybe a policeman.

892
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,240
I don't know.

893
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,320
But to me or anybody like me, it's not a silly thing.

894
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,720
It's a thing that we have to know what to say back.

895
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,840
We have to know how to converse with our friends

896
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,560
and our reparates who are...

897
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,060
Subgenius is...

898
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,900
Stupidity is power.

899
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:50,020
Well, where would I write to or where would I sign up for that on the miasma?

900
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,980
I don't suppose it would be scrub...

901
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,100
You cultivate a relationship with yourself.

902
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,720
Scrubgenius.com would be whatever.

903
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,400
If I could remember the name of that darn world religion,

904
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,620
then I could find their .com.

905
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,360
But if only I could spell it right.

906
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,460
I typed it in.

907
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,580
I typed it in a hundred different ways.

908
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,980
Subgenius, subgenousy, sobgen...

909
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,980
I just, I tried everything.

910
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,380
Scrubgeniality.

911
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,540
Sobgenius.

912
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:19,800
Yeah.

913
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,400
Well, I just don't know.

914
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,740
I just don't know either.

915
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,140
Hope we can figure that out.

916
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,780
It sounds awful slob-leelius.

917
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,220
That's it.

918
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,600
That was close.

919
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,420
That was real close.

920
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,420
Slobgenius.

921
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,000
That was it.

922
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:42,060
Because that would describe that cult perfectly.

923
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:42,620
Oh, wait.

924
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,540
We almost forgot.

925
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,420
Who is Vermin Supreme?

926
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,540
Presidential candidate, prankster, performance artist, jester, time traveler, all of these.

927
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,400
You could find out at Starwood Festival 2019.

928
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,360
Because he's going to be there and he's going to give us a lesson on hook...

929
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,440
Called Hooked on Megaphonics.

930
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,100
Where you learn how to protest...

931
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,380
Do street protest megaphone techniques and skills.

932
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,620
I should take that one.

933
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,440
The history of humor and satire in politics.

934
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:27,100
From Jonathan Swift through the Yippies and Abbie Hoffman to the Yes Man and Lonesome Cowboy Dave's novel Neighbor World.

935
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,940
And then there's a documentary about him.

936
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,880
And that's all at StarwoodFestival.com.

937
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,900
How about that on July 9th through 15th?

938
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,160
That sounds real interesting.

939
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,400
Along the edges here it says you can also see subgenius figures.

940
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,400
That's not very inviting.

941
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,100
Subgenius figures.

942
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,600
A couple of them.

943
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,500
I can think of a few that are okay.

944
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,360
Reverend Ivan Stang, author.

945
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,500
John Shirley.

946
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,040
John Shirley's going to be there.

947
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:02,360
God, he's written the grossest, most horrible, not side horror books ever.

948
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,540
Oracle.

949
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,080
Ask Dr. Howell.

950
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:06,880
Robbins.

951
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,980
Fat Man D.

952
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,000
And Wizard O'Bronzel.

953
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,640
And listen.

954
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,480
The angels are calling us home.

955
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,000
The angels have a job for us.

956
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,300
They want us.

957
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:25,480
They need us more than this horrible old world does, Dave.

958
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,300
So we're going to have to go.

959
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,320
To subgenius.com.

960
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,980
Well, I can see you're certainly lucky.

961
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,040
I couldn't hear very much.

962
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,840
I can't answer what you were saying.

963
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,700
But I can tell that you probably deserve to be in a penitentiary somewhere,

964
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,800
or at least facing the floodlights for what you've done to so many.

965
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,860
I won't say how much it costs.

966
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,840
Well, I'll be—

967
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,140
Because cost is not the issue.

968
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,440
Well, I'll see you there.

969
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,880
I'll see you there.

970
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,160
Huh?

971
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,460
When they come and arrest us and throw us into Trump stop for a permanent job.

972
00:59:59,520 --> 00:59:59,620
Oh, I see what you mean.

973
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:04,920
You're being sarcastic and saying that I'll also be there when they come to arrest us all.

974
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:05,720
Yeah.

975
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,040
Yeah.

976
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:06,080
Yeah.

977
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


978
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


979
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


980
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


981
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


982
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


983
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


984
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


985
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


986
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


987
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


988
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


989
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,080


990
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,500
And us, the Trumps, are home.

991
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:16,080
Oh, our background music, this show, has been, once again, CyberChump,

992
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:25,200
our friends who also do exposed foreheads.

993
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:34,500
They're going to be at the devotional Devo Research Center in late July.

994
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,820
I guess we're going to be there, too,

995
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,760
because we'll still be here.

996
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,380
And you're listening to WCSB Cleveland.

997
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,420
Okay, we just got legal.

998
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,760
I think Dave's gone.

999
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,460
Did he go?

1000
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,480
Dave left?

1001
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,040
Did he go?

1002
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,400
Did he go away?

1003
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,180
The dome of his head is no longer with us?

1004
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,200
Yeah, but you know—

1005
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,840
No, the dome of his head is right over here.

1006
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,000
You tricked us, Dave.

1007
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:04,080
Usually he hangs up before I even finish fading him out.

1008
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,740
I was pretending to be asleep.

1009
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:06,500
I was sleeping, you know.

1010
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:13,680
I thought, throw a little bit of humorous action there, some psychotronic rub, some dingleblad.

1011
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,180
I thought you were sleeping the whole time.

1012
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,560
Well, I'm so sorry.

1013
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:26,160
I'm so very sorry that my neuropathic syndromes don't work along the same subliminal lines as yours does.

1014
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:30,200
If he was sleeping, then I'm zeeping.

1015
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,600
Oh, I hope you wouldn't do that publicly anymore.

1016
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,660
Well, maybe I should.

1017
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:35,800
Maybe I should.

1018
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:35,800


1019
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:35,800


1020
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:35,800


1021
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:36,340
I should think about that twice.

1022
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:39,420
I feel like Dr. Sinister's been right over there this whole time.

1023
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,860
Why, yes, he's been here.

1024
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,180
He's just leaving us here to do an extra five or ten minutes of show.

1025
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:53,300
Brother Love went and let him in, and he's been here, and you've just been doing show and doing show and doing show.

1026
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,120
All over your bodies and having your weird dances in the moonlight and all this stuff.

1027
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,380
I think it's sinful and evil.

1028
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,720
Well, maybe not evil, but sinful for sure.

1029
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,640
Dave, are you dancing in the memes?

1030
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,400
Moonlight?

1031
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,920
Or inappropriate.

1032
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,060
Let's just call it.

1033
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:10,800
Say it was inappropriate.

1034
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,860
Barenaked dancing in the moonlight.

1035
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,240
Ooh, Barenaked dancing in the moonlight.

1036
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,560
The urine thing was something else.

1037
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,160
They had to drop that.

1038
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,180
They had to drop that?

1039
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,620
Yeah, the charges ensuing from the urine.

1040
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,620
Ah, I see.

1041
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,180
Sounds unpleasant.

1042
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,900
Well, it sounds like everybody's wound down now to like about a chicken strength.

1043
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,160
Chicken strength?

1044
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:38,460
Yeah, true.

1045
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,820
I'm about a chicken strength myself, yes.

1046
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:44,880
What about you?

1047
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:55,640
I'm having muscular spasms and a diagenesis, aphelon for its biological diversions.

1048
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,260
Oh, Dave, that's awful.

1049
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,120
I'm so sorry.

1050
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:58,900
I know, I know.

1051
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,120
Thank you so much.

1052
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,680
It's all right.

1053
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,040
Nothing's really going to help unless you give me an awful lot of money.

1054
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,800
And I don't have any money.

1055
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:05,800


1056
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,440
I don't have any money to give you.

1057
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,020
I'm in debt.

1058
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,880
Well, you could maybe find somebody.

1059
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,440
I don't know.

1060
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,720
Maybe I could find somebody.

1061
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,540
You never know.

1062
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,880
I could be resourceful.

1063
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,640
I've been resourceful.

1064
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,340
Okay, I'm going to send all of you away now.

1065
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,180
Oh, no.

1066
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,680
Dave and we.

1067
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:22,700
Please don't.

1068
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,240
See you guys later.

1069
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,940
Yes, and then the background music and everything and then this.

1070
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,160
This.

1071
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:35,380
And incidentally, schizophrenic behavior is such a vague term that it has really no

1072
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,800
exact or scientific meaning.

1073
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,400
How we think about things.

1074
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,800
How we think about things.

1075
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,620
How we think about things.

1076
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,940
How we think about things.

1077
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:52,040
Let's introspect together and see what are the conclusions that we all can draw.

1078
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,920
So when there's only awareness.

1079
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,360
And attention is not.

1080
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:05,360


1081
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:05,360


1082
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,840
It is resting just with awareness.

1083
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:14,200
Then the concept of belief does not even exist.

1084
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,900
Because if I can't have it all.

1085
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,600
I don't want any of it.

1086
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,200
And I'm for real too sweet.

1087
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,240
Okay.

1088
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:35,340
Now we can talk about the real truth.

1089
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:40,560
Really important stuff that we can't talk about on the air on broadcast radio because

1090
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:47,740
the hour of slack is almost always played on college and public supported stations that

1091
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,640
are non-commercial.

1092
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,200
That means we can't be commercial.

1093
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,740
But on the internet we can do anything.

1094
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,320
And we can tell.

1095
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,640
As fast as possible.

1096
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,780
As available.

1097
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,000
We can.

1098
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:58,780
This is the.

1099
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:05,320
This is our one chance to let you know that we know that you're tired of that old.

1100
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:05,320


1101
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,360
Begging.

1102
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,740
Recording that I stuck at the end of all those shows.

1103
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,240
And this is the new one.

1104
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,740
And we're not even begging.

1105
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,660
We're just selling you the ordainment kit.

1106
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,200
The subgenius ministers kit.

1107
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,120
Or membership kit.

1108
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,920
It's $35.

1109
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:23,700
Plus.

1110
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,640
375 postage.

1111
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,000
I think.

1112
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,060
Unless you're overseas.

1113
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,800
In which case it's like 150 bucks postage.

1114
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,120
But you'll see when you get on.

1115
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,220
On subgenius.com.

1116
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:36,580
Right at the top.

1117
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,120
It says.

1118
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,540
Become an ordained minister.

1119
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:39,540
You click on that.

1120
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,120
And you'll see a picture of all the cool stuff.

1121
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,680
The package that you get.

1122
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:49,080
Aside from the fact that you're now a damn minister.

1123
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:49,520
Okay.

1124
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,180
You could really can perform weddings.

1125
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,400
In fact I did one tonight.

1126
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,480
I signed the papers for my niece Jessica.

1127
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,260
And that lucky sum bitch Guillermo.

1128
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,780
And I did it for them for free.

1129
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,860
Because they're relatives.

1130
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:05,200
And.

1131
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,640
He's my nephew in law now.

1132
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,160
That's right.

1133
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:08,800
But anyway friends.

1134
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,860
You can do that too.

1135
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:10,960
You can perform weddings.

1136
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,600
And I usually get about 200 bucks.

1137
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,060
From you know.

1138
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,240
Civilians.

1139
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,120
You can do burials.

1140
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,860
Unfortunately you can't do divorces.

1141
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,120
And that's where the real money is.

1142
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,380
But for your 35 bucks.

1143
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,120
You will get inside a large puffy envelope.

1144
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,200
You'll get a black card.

1145
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:35,580
A black folder.

1146
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,760
That has.

1147
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,320
For one thing.

1148
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,900
Your subgenius minister's card.

1149
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:41,160
That says you're an ordained minister.

1150
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,040
But also.

1151
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:44,360
All the kind of things you'd expect.

1152
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,980
From a fan club.

1153
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:46,760
Such as.

1154
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,300
A decoder ring.

1155
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:50,660
That only we can decode.

1156
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,560
You won't be able to do it.

1157
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,320
It looks like a little metal button.

1158
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,120
With Bob on it.

1159
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:54,720
No you will need some assistance.

1160
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,560
Or actually divine intervention.

1161
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,280
You get eternal salvation.

1162
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,980
Or triple your money back.

1163
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:02,360
Right.

1164
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:02,920
Of course.

1165
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,520
Or yeah.

1166
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,180
Two ways.

1167
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:05,180


1168
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:05,180


1169
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:05,180


1170
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:05,180


1171
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:05,180


1172
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:05,380
You really.

1173
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,700
Really fancy looking documents.

1174
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:09,380
The all inclusive excuse.

1175
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,860
And the doctorate of the forbidden sciences.

1176
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,960
Which both look fantastic framed.

1177
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:18,000
On your law office wall.

1178
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:19,680
Hint.

1179
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,100
Hint.

1180
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,640
All those lawyers out there.

1181
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,060
Who haven't joined yet.

1182
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,860
But the main thing about membership.

1183
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,120
Is the feeling you get.

1184
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:30,040
That you finally really did support the hour of slack.

1185
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,100
And the subgenius Facebook pages.

1186
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,880
And all the other stuff that's free.

1187
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:39,800
and you helped Reverend Stang pay his half of the mortgage.

1188
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:46,140
So, and it allows us to keep doing this and so forth.

1189
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,720
So friends, send that $35.

1190
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,040
Actually, make it $40 with postage.

1191
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,720
For $38.75.

1192
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,340
Okay, $38.75.

1193
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,720
You can write a check to Subgenius Foundation.

1194
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,280
You can do it online and use a credit card.

1195
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
You can technically call us and give us a credit card number,

1196
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:09,420
but we hate doing that because, oh wait, I'm not deaf anymore.

1197
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:10,760
I guess I could take those calls.

1198
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:12,020
Yes, you can take those now.

1199
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:17,040
Anyway, friends, yeah, really, $35.

1200
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:18,760
And you get to write.

1201
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:23,000
And you've got to mention the post office box, both in Ohio and in Texas.

1202
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:26,080
Don't forget that, Reverend Orville Stang.

1203
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,200
Right, that's the post office box.

1204
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,060
And during the winter months.

1205
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:35,820
It's Subgenius at Post Office Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1206
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:42,500
During the summer and fallish, springish sort of months,

1207
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:50,360
it's Subgenius at P.O. Box 181-417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1208
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,580
Oh, I remembered it.

1209
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,680
Yeah, that's, don't be a gimme bob, friends.

1210
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,580
Don't be.

1211
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,460
Be a bommie gimme.

1212
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:08,900
I mean, it's really not cool to not send in your $35.

1213
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,700
It's the one-time thing.

1214
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:15,960
And from then on, I'll speak to you.

1215
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,300
That's about the only way that's going to happen.

1216
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:27,980
Also, you'll get to look at the members-only internet forum called Scrub Genius.

1217
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:28,680
Yeah.

1218
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:33,740
And believe it or not, there's some really intelligent writing on that thing.

1219
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,540
It's nothing like Facebook.

1220
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:42,920
So, and the reason is, I can kick out anyone I want.

1221
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,100
And I've never kicked anyone out.

1222
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,860
Because Susie the Floozy always does it and stay in.

1223
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,240
Reverend Susie the Floozy's on Scrub Genius, friends.

1224
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:55,180
And that's the only way you can be Reverend Susie the Floozy's friend.

1225
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,520
And I know you want to be friends with Reverend Susie.

1226
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,620
The Floozy.

1227
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:05,420
With a name like that, she must be purdy and sexy and just ready to jump in bed with anybody.

1228
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,620
Well, some of those things are true.

1229
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,040
She is really purdy and sexy.

1230
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:11,620
She is purdy and sexy.

1231
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,620
And she's really, really funny.

1232
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:19,400
And friends, that's why you must join the Church of the Subgenius.

1233
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,560
Get slack.

1234
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,540
The real thing.

1235
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:24,700
Yeah, exactly.

1236
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,780
How invaluable of a trick-or-treat bag is this?

1237
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:28,320
When you...

1238
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,460
Think of all the things you've gone through in your subservient lives out there.

1239
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,700
Waiting for one day or the next for something to change or happen.

1240
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,780
This will actually change your life, friends.

1241
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:43,200
I don't mean to call you friends speciously because I'm not in that form of mood.

1242
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,020
I'm a nice person.

1243
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:49,740
I could just diseasely say something very vicarious and argumentative about you.

1244
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,520
But I don't know you.

1245
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,800
And that's the problem.

1246
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,040
So to solve that problem, vote for the Church of the Subgenius by becoming a preordained...

1247
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,180
Preordained ministry.

1248
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,300
Because ministration is a very important part of our existence.

1249
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,820
If we didn't have it, we wouldn't have it.

1250
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:08,960
Praise Bob.

1251
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,120
And with that, friends, thank you and good night.

1252
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,740
Okay, but we're still on the phone, Dave.

1253
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,000
Buenas noches.

1254
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,420
Buenas noches.

1255
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:21,660
Buenas, buenas.

1256
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:24,740
Are we done?

1257
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,160
Well, yeah.

1258
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:27,960
Yeah, we're done.

1259
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,040


1260
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,040


1261
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,040


1262
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:29,860
I'm afraid...

1263
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,160
Okay, I'm going to actually turn the recorder off and that means we really are done.
