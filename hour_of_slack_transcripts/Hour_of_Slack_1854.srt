1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
Um...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,360
It's time for, uh...

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,060
Ehh...

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,260
It's time for some...

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Uh, come on, you know what time it is.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,680
Whoa...

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,580
Huh?

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,520
Light drop, eyes up, test it back

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,320
Well, welcome to the hour of slack

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,280
Raise up golden honey drag

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,080
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,780
Somewhere over the dobs and leo

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,540
Get high

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,320
Somewhere over the dobs and leo

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,300
Get high

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,360
Somewhere over the dobs and leo

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,080
Get high

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,020
Somewhere over the dobs and leo

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,040
Get high

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,040


21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,060
Get high

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,640
Somewhere over the dobs and leo

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,320
Get high

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,060
Welcome to the hour of slack

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,740
Ha ha!

26
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,040
And the Dave has...

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,340
The Dave man has...

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,320
Uh, arrived...

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,200
On his flying airplane

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,740
Under carpet

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,400
Oh!

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,980
With his air...

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,240
Head

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,260
His one single brain cell

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,880
Yes

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,420
Oh my god

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,720
This man

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,700
Look at his face

39
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,460
If we may call this a man

40
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,040
It is glowing

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,740
Yes, but the one evil brain cell

42
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,320
Gaze upon it as it swells and grows

43
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,180
Look, it's glowing

44
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,240
It's rising

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,060
It's pulsating as if...

46
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,880
It will infuse with some form of life of its own

47
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,140
As if it had sprang perhaps into existence on its own

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,620
There's a way to find it

49
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,100
No!

50
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,300
The Dave's old egg couldn't die

51
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,100
Friends, we don't want the Dave brain cell to die, do we?

52
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,120
Well, that's a leading question

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,040
I probably shouldn't put it quite that way

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,020
Flip and flap and drizzle

55
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,780
Just a...

56
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,420
We don't want to see it flap around in its cage

57
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,660
Or bother the other prisoners

58
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,240
Ah, there you go

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,700
Thanks, Nurse Mary

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,100
Oh, you're welcome

61
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,900
It's gonna be a long time before we can stuff the rest of the detritus back in that monster's skull

62
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,740
Yes, I know

63
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,060
But it looks really good from here, doesn't it?

64
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,160
Of course it looks good

65
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,800
But you can't eat it every day or you're gonna have the problem all over again

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,160
I know, I know, I know, I know

67
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,920
Jesus Christ, we gotta get this cleaned up

68
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,380
Look at that

69
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,980
Rumbod, hit it!

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,280
The brain is between your ears, finally here

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,100
Cool effect with your circle sphere

72
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,900
It's in your head, born and bred

73
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,300
If you didn't have a brain, you'd probably be brain

74
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,660
Situated below the cerebral cortex

75
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,880
Into the cerebellum, cold in effect

76
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,040
It's the medulla and I'm not foolin'

77
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,620
Frontin' and grillin', come on, chillin' and coolin' in Brooklyn

78
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,560
Hangin' in the whole hood

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,840
You need a brain if you're gonna make good

80
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,940
Chris McGriff, staging the drive-by

81
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,360
Homies on the corner, I'm crack, you know it, brain frat

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,540
I pull a nine millimeter, I told him to stop

83
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,820
Shots ring, I'm in one of the pewter cops

84
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,220
I'll pursue to aim and shoot your boy in the face

85
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,540
See your brain as entire, I think, is your brain

86
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,940
Your brain, your brain, your brain

87
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,720
Come on, get it up, get it up

88
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,320
Brain, your brain, your brain

89
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,140
Come on, get it up, get it up

90
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,800
Brain, your brain, your brain

91
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,580
Come on, get it up, get it up

92
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,160
Brain, your brain

93
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,380
Yo, yo, yo, brain

94
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Now then, my home boys

95
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,360
That wasn't at all bad

96
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,920
In fact, it was rather funky fresh.

97
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,760
But Philbert, what are you doing now?

98
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm keeping it real, you know what I'm saying?

99
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,920
I'm keeping it fly, you know what I'm saying?

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm fuxing up the funky mix down, you know what I'm saying?

101
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,600
I'm keeping it real and fly with the hip, with the rifle,

102
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,420
and the, yeah.

103
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,700
So throw your arms in the air and wave.

104
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,060
There's a very no consequence.

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:14,960
Yo!

106
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,740
I'm a lyrical poet, the riser in my brain,

107
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,000
just in case you didn't notice.

108
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,340
I'm on a mic, brewing, I don't rhyme.

109
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,560
Dipping up to make you all go blind.

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,660
Mastering the beat with my cold crush posse.

111
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,920
I make a rhyme here, but not the rise of posse.

112
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,140
That's because my brain was trained by the maestro,

113
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,180
James Brown.

114
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,720
With the girlies sitting in the front row,

115
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,580
I'm getting busy after the show.

116
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,940
Kissing and touching and stroking her gently.

117
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,200
In my Mercedes, Lexus, and Bentley,

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
or any of the other cars that I own.

119
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,580
Except for my bodyguard, we'll be alone.

120
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,920
He won't hear us, because he's so deaf.

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,700
He'll protect you, his niggas.

122
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,080
Black Knight.

123
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
We go to a party, and everybody's there.

124
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,880
Busta Rhymes, Eminem, and my homie Master B.

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,060
Drew an outfit, Durst, and ODB.

126
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,080
I hypnotize him with my brain power.

127
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,460
Bustin' a rhyme, getting richer by the hour.

128
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,320
And why not?

129
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,620
Because they pay me to come here.

130
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,900
The rhymes go from my mouth to your ear,

131
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,840
the head of your brain, and they cause a reaction.

132
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,960
Go beat, call a brain contraction.

133
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,580
I make you dance till your suckers get soft feet.

134
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,880
You break your head, little stupid face, face me.

135
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm the puff that it tough for the kid rock.

136
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,320
And all the rest of you busters can lick my ass.

137
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Don't playYaBeLeF선neCyons,

138
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,260


139
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,260


140
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,260


141
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,260


142
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,260

Come on, get it up, get it up,

Oh, cut it up, cut it up!

159
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,180
Brain! Your brain! Your motherfucking brain!

160
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,020
Now then, mm-hmm.

161
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,340
Well, this repetitive rhapsodic rhythm has totally wrecked my concentration.

162
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,800
Talk to the appendage, because the cranium doesn't want to hear it.

163
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,820
Ha! I shall remedy this situation with one swift stout!

164
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,800
Pentatonic!

165
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,160
Hey!

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,960
Ready?

167
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,760
Pull!

168
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,520
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,620
SHUT UP!

170
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,600
This is art.

171
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Art. Art. Art.

172
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,740
A little after-dinner music.

173
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,280
Now will you dance for me?

174
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,820
Dance for me. Dance for me.

175
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,080
Dance for me.

176
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:57,300
Now will you dance for me?

177
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,420
Dance for me now!

178
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,680

182
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,520

183
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:08,560
Down!

184
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,660
When did it get up here?

185
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:15,700


186
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:15,700


187
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:15,700


188
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:15,700


189
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,600
You, nobody,frist o Café Craig'saat!

190
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:56,280
Now, now, now, now you're done for me.

191
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,400
Done, done, done for me.

192
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
Done for me.

193
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,520
Done for me.

194
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,960
Done, done, done for me.

195
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,020
Kill me, kill me.

196
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
I'm not gonna hurt you, hurt you, hurt you.

197
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,540
Kill me, kill me.

198
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,140
Kill me, kill me.

199
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,900
Down for me.

200
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,160
Down, down, down for me.

201
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:06,540
Down, down, down for me.

202
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,540
Ah, yes, dear friends.

203
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,520
That was Kill Me.

204
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,360
By Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

205
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:31,580
And you can reach Onan at dobs.town.

206
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,920
And that's how you get into dobs.town.

207
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:44,380
The latest and possibly coolest of the new non-Facebook subgenius forums.

208
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,140
Although there are many others.

209
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,580
See subgenius.com.

210
00:09:49,600 --> 00:10:01,080
Before that, Brain Rap was that rap brain song by Consortium of Genius in New Orleans.

211
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,100
Who just had their 25th anniversary.

212
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,520
They've cranked out a lot of albums and rock operas.

213
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
And they do stage shows.

214
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,140
Consortium of Genius.

215
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,420
Look it up.

216
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,700
Over the Dob's Head and other collages were by Lee Murr.

217
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,580
As in?

218
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:19,760
As usual.

219
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,740
But so unusual.

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,300
And the radio stuff was, of course, ESO Swamp Radio with Chaz Smith.

221
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,380
The late Chaz Smith.

222
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,100
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave on WCSB in Cleveland.

223
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,460
By the way, I noticed that Chaz Smith played a theremin on that recent movie, Dune.

224
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,960
Maybe it was a ghost theremin.

225
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,880
Anyway.

226
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:58,100
Although I'm saying this in 2021, everything before and after it is from Hour of Slack number 854.

227
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,240
Exactly 1,000 shows or about 20 years ago.

228
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,360
Including what I'm about to say now.

229
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,560
Friends, you know the aspects of this show tonight, number 854, will be a drag.

230
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,100
Why?

231
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,740
Because the sad theme of this...

232
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,620
The sad show is drunks.

233
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:30,240
And it was inspired by Philo, Dr. Philo Drummond, unearthing some tapes of our friend that died of drugs.

234
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,760
Like whiskey.

235
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,140
Dr. X was his name.

236
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,900
Heard in the background jamming with me 1,000 years ago.

237
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:47,740
His name is in Book of the Subgenius right under Bob's next to mine and Philo's.

238
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,440
Yes.

239
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,500
In the early 80s, he had a band called The Pink Boys.

240
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,040
Recognize that term?

241
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,240
And we will be playing his song called Pink Boy later.

242
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,980
The significance of this is simply that to me, is mine.

243
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:13,080
He was my best friend in high school and was there when we first heard the word subgenius.

244
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,620
He was part of the boot force.

245
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,080
They moved a whole bunch of them into the cameras.

246
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,860
Do you know how slow and crazy that was?

247
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,200
I don't know what the clumsy drunks are to a fropper like me of coffee drinking.

248
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,260
Oh, sure.

249
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,400
Frop maniac.

250
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,080
And you know how little those stories that they tell you, those things say mean?

251
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,700
Like Spider-Man compared to these yo-yos.

252
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,800
Yeah, they're like...

253
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,720
Oh, thanks, man.

254
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,140
We were waiting for that for...

255
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,700
I'm sorry, man.

256
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,740
Your show is pretty lame.

257
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,540
Okay, well, we already said...

258
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:43,860
Okay, well...

259
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:44,700
Yeah?

260
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,800
Is there some way we can maybe...

261
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,840
Why aren't you turning the radio off or turning it on?

262
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,780
Turn it to another channel.

263
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,080
He said it was like...

264
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,240
Are you that much of a loser?

265
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,260
Is there something we can do for him, maybe?

266
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,500
Are you that much of a pathetic little dweeb that you can't figure out that you can turn your radio to another station?

267
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,760
Well, if he didn't like what we were saying, we could have helped him another way.

268
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Is somebody sitting there with a gun to your head forcing you to listen to this station?

269
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,540
He thought he was going to hear some music from the Blowfish Man and you blew his mind.

270
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,620
I can feel it now.

271
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,200
We're not playing Green Wave tonight, kid.

272
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,240
You're vacillating sexuality.

273
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,840
You're interpreting my mind.

274
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,040
Or, you know, they're fornicating or something.

275
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,020
I could tell that kid needed our spiritual help.

276
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,880
You can't expect responsible behavior when alcohol is served.

277
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,340
What the hell?

278
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,080
There you go.

279
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,660
You can't expect responsible...

280
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,780
As a matter of fact...

281
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,580
People, when they crucified Christ, they were all rip, roaring drunk.

282
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,560
You can't expect responsible behavior from drunks.

283
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,420
Right, right.

284
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,140
There are people who can drink and then there's drunks.

285
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,200
I was having responsible behavior all night.

286
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,840
That's why I don't drink!

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,420
Think of the beer hall push.

288
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,820
Hitler knew what he was doing.

289
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,260
What Hitler's doing.

290
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,860
My God.

291
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,120
You can manipulate drunks quite easily.

292
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,080
You can't expect responsible behavior from people who have any alcohol or any other mind-altering substance in their body.

293
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,720
That's funny.

294
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,920
You know, because I've known quite a few alcoholics who are not...

295
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,140
You can't really expect people with a functioning endocrine system to behave normal.

296
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,680
You can be a drunk and not be a jerk.

297
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,720
You can be an alcoholic and not be a jerk.

298
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Then there's the drunken jerks.

299
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,900
And if you're that kind of a drunk, don't drink!

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,620
And then they mix swingerism with...

301
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,340
Once again, who is putting a gun to the heads of these people and marching them into my campsite?

302
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,900
Or a pork chop, you know?

303
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,420
You know, I don't get it.

304
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,880
Who was out there?

305
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Who did they hire?

306
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,780
Who did Ace hire to go out there with handguns and force people to come into this thing?

307
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,180
And drink those Mai Tais and mudslides that Lagoon was making?

308
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,580
Yeah.

309
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,620
Take responsibility for your own.

310
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,940
Sweaty little shops, that is.

311
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,100
If you don't like our actions, then don't patronize us.

312
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,100
If you don't keep up with my accents, you don't have to.

313
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,980
Are you that stupid out there?

314
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,840
Stop throwing money at us, man.

315
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,980
Shut the hell up.

316
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,540
Oh, that was a really good one there.

317
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,620
Stop interpreting my endocrine system.

318
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:09,860
Totally.

319
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,480
Forget it.

320
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,860
Drop the alcohol.

321
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,300
Go straight for peroxide.

322
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,260
Really?

323
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,220
Now this guy's talking trash.

324
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,800
Yeah, everybody with white hair.

325
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,320
I think it'd be a beautiful world that way.

326
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,560
We're talking about squirting things out of your navel.

327
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,720
No, no, he's talking about drinking it straight, man.

328
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,300
Peroxide?

329
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,240
Yeah, hydrogen peroxide.

330
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,880
Try it.

331
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,440
Oh, man.

332
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,800
Talk about the blowhole of death, man.

333
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,640
That's going to remove a lot of your insides in one...

334
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,820
Run up some peroxide, man.

335
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,240
Hello?

336
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,880
Man, drop the peroxide, man.

337
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,560
Drink gasoline.

338
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,780
That's not good.

339
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,020
No, you know what?

340
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,740
That's not a good buzz.

341
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,300
Not with...

342
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,020
I've tried that.

343
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,120
Especially with the prices we've got.

344
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,400
The world petroleum problem.

345
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,620
That's not what your fire breathers use.

346
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,380
You know, I've had...

347
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,040
I've done that.

348
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,240
Who hasn't run out of gas and siphoned some gas out of another car and swallowed down

349
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,720
a bunch of gas?

350
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,340
It's not fun.

351
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,640
I mean, who hasn't flipped their old frig frog out once in a while and put it in the

352
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,080
tank just for a clever joke with the Polaroid crowd?

353
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,660
You know, some of them anyway.

354
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,240
Like that.

355
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,900
It's, you know, American.

356
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,760
It's macho.

357
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,660
We're humping steel.

358
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,860
I love my car, and I mean I love my car.

359
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,040
I'm feeling her headlights now.

360
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,820
They're like two round, robust, round...

361
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Oh, Christine.

362
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,020
And my thing is that...

363
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,220
Oh.

364
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,580
Ship stick.

365
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,680
Yeah, baby.

366
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,820
Four on the floor.

367
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,280
That's me.

368
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,480
Or maybe that's two underneath her.

369
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,580
Here it comes.

370
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,260
Here it comes.

371
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,020
Here it comes.

372
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Yeah, we're spilling beers right and left.

373
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,760
We got trouble in River City.

374
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,740
That's the smell of tea, which rhymes with B, which stands for beer.

375
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,900
Shake the hand, shake the hand of an honest drunk

376
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:25,720
The farmer, he got plowed

377
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,820
The bricklayer got plastered

378
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,660
The mechanic, he got tagged

379
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,620
And the construction worker got blasted

380
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,480
And daddy beat up mommy

381
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,020
And broke her collarbone

382
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,200
Oh, good luck

383
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,460
And everybody's drunk

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,260
And everybody's wasted

385
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,320
And everybody's drinking on the job

386
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,660
The garbage man got trashed

387
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,400
The janitor got messy

388
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,060
The taxi driver got smashed

389
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,000
The janitor got smashed

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,920
And the waitress, yeah, she got tipsy

391
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,700
In Kansas City, New York City

392
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,340
Great big city, itty bitty city

393
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,840
Now everybody's drunk

394
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,500
And everybody's wasted

395
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,620
And everybody's drinking on the job

396
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,580
There's a whole lot of places

397
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,020
That I ain't been

398
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,620
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen

399
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,080
A whole lot of things I'll never be

400
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
The generation that will change the world

401
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,340
Is still looking for its car

402
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:56,860
Yeah

403
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,900
Yeah

404
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,800
Yeah

405
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,420
Yeah

406
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:06,680
Yeah

407
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:07,940
Yeah

408
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:42,000


409
00:19:42,000 --> 00:20:12,000


410
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:42,000


411
00:20:42,000 --> 00:21:12,000


412
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,700
on's small but orada

413
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,180
This case has happened

414
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,300
And there's no real cure

415
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,300


416
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,400
and I'm bragging

417
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,400


418
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,400


419
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,400


420
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:40,180
And now I'm going home

421
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,620
To the great God

422
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,520
To the great God

423
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,520


424
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,520


425
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,520


426
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,520


427
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,980
And I love your

428
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,020
But I still believe

429
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,300
I'm going home

430
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,800
in Oslo and now something Philo did to something I did to Bob.

431
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,880
Yes, I'm a jambalida humping junkie that jumped the men from Mars. I drank the devil under

432
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,360
seven tables, I am too intense to die, opiates are the mess of my religion, I take drugs.

433
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,380
Yes, I'm a rip snorter, I cram coca leaves right into my arm veins before they are picked

434
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,500
off the tree. Space monsters cringe at my tread. I wipe the pyramids off my shoes before

435
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,460
I enter my house. I'm fuel injected, I'll live forever and remember it afterwards. I'm

436
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,920
immune. I'm radioactive. Come on and give me cancer, I'll spit up the tumor and butter

437
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,480
my bread with the juice. I'm supernatural, I bend crowbars with my meat axe and a thought.

438
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,420
My droppings bore through the earth and erupt volcanoes in China. Yes, I can drink more

439
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,900
wine and stay soberer than all the heathen Hindus in Asia. Yee-haw. Gut blowout.

440
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,220
Realmwave immediately.

441
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,740
Medium. Necropetrovsk-Chaterin.

442
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,880
Wavy medium brown. Tashkentum's chalupin.

443
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,940
Medium wavy brown. A van of Ochernigavoser.

444
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,940
I like shaping.

445
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,840
Wavy brown medium. I like to go out and drink beer.

446
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,580
I like to drink wavy brown beer.

447
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,480
We haven't...

448
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,340
Well...

449
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,460
We haven't any chance.

450
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,520
Chance?

451
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,880
You, uh...

452
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,580
No chance?

453
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:20,420
Naturally things happen like, uh, at the, uh, Columbia University.

454
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,760
The other mother college is...

455
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

456
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,360
No, it really is, uh...

457
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,280
Really? Come on.

458
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,220
I went to school at the University of Southern California.

459
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,980
We didn't do this, guys.

460
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,020
Let me explain something to you.

461
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,420
Let me tell you something.

462
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,180
I was a...

463
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,420
You see me in the fightin' McBurnum and...

464
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,680
I can't believe Bob was like this in front of those rotary clubs.

465
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,640
Oh, look, his butt... His butt fell right out.

466
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,280
Right on the...

467
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,140
Dias, man.

468
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,560
Oh, my God.

469
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,340
Listen to him.

470
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,760
Anybody...

471
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,280
His butt fell off his mouth.

472
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,820
...that walked into his...

473
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,060
Office.

474
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,520
Oh, man, what you doin' with your hands down there?

475
00:23:59,580 --> 00:23:59,620
...office.

476
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,340
Took a crap in your can.

477
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,320
...and tore down a picture...

478
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,360
Okay. Jesus.

479
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,900
...and...

480
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,780
...and did excrement in his, uh...

481
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,060
...excrement in his, uh...

482
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,800
Those Bobbies did in Dobbs Town.

483
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,540
...and did excrement in the Hot Tub.

484
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,780
Yeah, yeah, they, he was really, uh...

485
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,620
...very clink-boop-ashin' really.

486
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,040
But...

487
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,420
This is, this was Bob's reply after that year.

488
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,580
This was the last recording of Bob.

489
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,100
It was right after the year that they crapped in the Hot Tub.

490
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,920
...we, as members...

491
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,000
This is a very historical piece of memorabilia right here.

492
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,640
...would have picked the...

493
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,440
...mem...

494
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,160
See, that's when the pipe...

495
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,780
...he's tryin' to put the pipe back in its mouth.

496
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,820
...to keep fallin' out.

497
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,180
He doesn't like a curse.

498
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,020
...there were women there.

499
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,480
He won't say bad words in...

500
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,360
in the next company.

501
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,760
Not unless they're showing their labia to him.

502
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
Even when he's that drunk,

503
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,620
Bob has had manners.

504
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,020
Masek was an expert with the experts.

505
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,460
All serial murderers have this chair that I'm sitting on.

506
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,060
Morrison did something she had done before.

507
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,460
I looked under the bathroom,

508
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,400
and my telephone rang.

509
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
And it was this chair that I'm sitting on.

510
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,440
I opened the lighted phone, and it was empty.

511
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,840
So, um, I went back to the telephone,

512
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,440
and I said,

513
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,340
Richard, you're not in the telephone.

514
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,040
I am in that telephone.

515
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,460
I am in that telephone.

516
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,460


517
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,180
I am in that telephone.

518
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:55,100
I am in that telephone.

519
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:41,420
I am in that telephone.

520
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,380
I am in that telephone.

521
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:42,380


522
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:42,380


523
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,740
I should have kept going right on down

524
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,040
Sweatshop and Kingston.

525
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,380
No, way down, like down in Bolivia or something.

526
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,140
They would have taken Jack Cassidy to,

527
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,480
and me, Neil, Jack Cassidy,

528
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,240
I mean, Neil Cassidy, to a gun court for sure.

529
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,360
Remember the gun courts they had

530
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,760
for most of the subgeniuses, for crying out loud?

531
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,880
Hey, first rule of gun club,

532
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,280
don't talk about gun club.

533
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,280
If it's all natural, put it in your body.

534
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,360
Organic.

535
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,760
Beat that stupid.

536
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,500
Jimson weed.

537
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,760
That's the...

538
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,700
Datura, Lexus.

539
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,520
You gotta legalize it.

540
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,980
Open, tatty, down.

541
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,960
Datura, man.

542
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,840
Make a fine tea out of local weed.

543
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,500
The devil's weed, man.

544
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,040
You don't want to smoke the devil's weed.

545
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,720
The devil's?

546
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,540
The devil's weed.

547
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,380
Devil's weed.

548
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,860
My bud smoked some Jimson weed,

549
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,560
and he ended up taking a dump on his living room floor

550
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,980
in front of his parents.

551
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,160
My bud took a dump on his parents.

552
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,160


553
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,000
He was a hedonist.

554
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,760
This guy was a Jimsonist.

555
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,900
George Bush is about to take a dump

556
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,760
on everybody.

557
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,020
Just like that hedonistic buddy of yours.

558
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,720
No, that's it.

559
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,140
Now, you guys aren't going to be putting George down

560
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,180
when the evil terrorist germ bomb goes off

561
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,960
in your backyard.

562
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,140
Then you're going to want George to save you.

563
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,520
They're going to trace you back to

564
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,100
Aaron Fleischer's post office box.

565
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,160
Why didn't you buy...

566
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,160


567
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,160


568
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,160


569
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,160


570
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,500
We're going to bomb the hell out of those people

571
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,140
before they set off that germ bomb in our backyard.

572
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,260
That's what you'll be saying.

573
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,260
Face it, Stang, if you want to fight something

574
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,680
for America, war is good.

575
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,800
You've got to fight war is good for industry,

576
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,700
for the oil industry, yes.

577
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,160
But did you know that Iraq is sitting

578
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,280
on one of the largest deposits there is to sit on?

579
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,580
Did you know that the slate underneath

580
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,580
Saddam Hussein's feet was worth

581
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,160
billions and billions of petroleum dollars?

582
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,460
Stang, you're confused about what's important

583
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,280
in this country.

584
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,600
Look at you.

585
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,100
You're hardly a man.

586
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,500
Oh.

587
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,120
Ah, for crying out loud.

588
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,180
Look at those biceps.

589
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,260
What are you good for?

590
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,560
Can you lift this gun?

591
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,900
The eternal wisdom of nature's laws,

592
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,140
which are completely opposite

593
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,260
to the suicidal teachings of normality.

594
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,660
Whereas normality says to love your enemies

595
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,080
and to hate your own kind,

596
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,560
we say just the opposite.

597
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,500
We say that in order to survive,

598
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,980
we must overcome it.

599
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,780
Destroy those who are a threat

600
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,160
to our existence,

601
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,540
namely our deadly enemies,

602
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,580
the normals.

603
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,000
At the same time,

604
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,100
we advocate love and protection

605
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,680
for those that are near and dear

606
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
to our family and our own race,

607
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,640
the subgenius race,

608
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,980
which is an extension of our family.

609
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,680
Nope, it's just about killing.

610
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,100
It's just about our God-given right to kill.

611
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,960
Ask Ted Nugent.

612
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,380
Take as many as you can.

613
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,140
I'll bet Ted'll go.

614
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,380
Let God sort them.

615
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,420
I wish Ted would go.

616
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,620
And then he'll give them to the homeless center.

617
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,620
So give his kills to the homeless center.

618
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,560
When Ted realizes that some of the squirrels shoot back,

619
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,620
he's going to be in a lot of doo-doo.

620
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,220
I think he should go.

621
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,880
No, I'll bet he's into it.

622
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,900
I'll bet Ted would be into it.

623
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,460
He's like one of those guys

624
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,740
that came back from a golf war.

625
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,440
That's a good debate.

626
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
Would Ted Wimbo?

627
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,280
Abortionists find out those fetus ghosts are coming for him.

628
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,100
God, have the f*** for Marie.

629
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,760
Hey, guys.

630
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,840
Because we kill everything we see.

631
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,780
He plays his games.

632
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,180
We play ours.

633
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,680
The Butcher of Zapier.

634
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,400
To show our appreciation for so much power,

635
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,980
we keep heaven packed with fresh soul.

636
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:37,180
The Butcher of Washington hides behind his berms.

637
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,760
The great yellow dog of the Potomac.

638
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,660
His formidable berms.

639
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,740
On the podcast.

640
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,500
The Potomac.

641
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,680
Grace, Marshall.

642
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:51,160
But he will not resist our special guided patriotic psychotic missiles,

643
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,620
which can go straight down the premier's wife's brassiere,

644
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,180
if that's where we want to target them.

645
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,780
It was July in Virginia.

646
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,800
Yes.

647
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,460
The men of the Dogwood and the Laurel lay heavy on the land.

648
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,300
While the Virgin and the Magnole was...

649
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,680
Doc Mojo was burying Sung Lee back on the back four.

650
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:11,960
The majority.

651
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,600
That's sick.

652
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,740
Cheese lovers know that cheese lovers choose friskies.

653
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,720
Despite his sunny exterior, little Caleb is dead.

654
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,320
He doesn't even have a name.

655
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,220
For that reason, today we are proposing to add minutes to the environment.

656
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,120
Once it's added, shipments and sales would be allowed...

657
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,540
To companies that create everything.

658
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,580
Yay!

659
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,340


660
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,020
All too many demonic Israelis.

661
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,380
That would be me.

662
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,340
And may I say...

663
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,900
From the banana.

664
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,040
Take out the pen.

665
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:51,900
I don't know anything.

666
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,060
Place the tip of the marker on the surface of his spirit.

667
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,520
And it's gotta be friskies.

668
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,940
You can come across the middle, and then you can come high.

669
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,160
The dots in...

670
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,540
So they said...

671
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,260
Die young.

672
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,720
Now experiencing hair.

673
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,720
Just snap.

674
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,020
And may I say, I am...

675
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,680
Perfectly grilled.

676
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,740
Televangela just sent in her bad dream of two hours ago.

677
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,240
And I'd like to read this to you.

678
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,060
It's short, Dave.

679
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,340
Televangela dreamed...

680
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,400
Some sort of subgenius gathering in my backyard and home.

681
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,680
The home where I grew up.

682
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,020
Parents not home.

683
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Not informed they were coming.

684
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,220
Myself either.

685
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,100
The usual...

686
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,920
The usual group was there.

687
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,100
Plus some new faces with very unique outfits and problems.

688
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,500
A very loud woman in shiny spandex yelling that we should wrestle in food or something.

689
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,040
I recall vaguely thinking...

690
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,380
Oh, that was a bombastic party.

691
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,540
Is this Ziza?

692
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,360
Then people are pasting something on the wall.

693
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,280
Some sort of decoration.

694
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,620
Look, they're all pasty-faced.

695
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,340
Look more like clear peaches.

696
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,080
Then, the worst part of all.

697
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,560
My grandma shows up.

698
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,080
And is seated in a circle of subgenius.

699
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,960
And kisses on the lawn.

700
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,320
Without me being able to stop it.

701
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,640
Like Yume tells her about how we need more hate.

702
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,140
Jesus tells her he's Jesus.

703
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,060
Stang and we just agree and have those twinkling crazy eyes.

704
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,380
I show up, but it's too late.

705
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,440
She's pissed and confused and arguing.

706
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
I try to help grandma, but then...

707
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,040
I wake up.

708
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,380
Friend?

709
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,080
Are you even able to wake up?

710
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,480
You off from that dream you call life.

711
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,440
Can you open your eyes?

712
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,500
Can you awaken from that dream you call your job?

713
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,320
The sleep

714
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:56,240
Thank you.

715
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,420
지나 halfway through judge sono

716
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,220
Gratias.

717
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,900
E diablos

718
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,320
ha ha

719
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,820
chakallajajajajajajaja

720
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,840
乾杯

721
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:08,840


722
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,080
gasp

723
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,080


724
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,020
Karol 가

725
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,720
Mac- Mac-Mack-Eye.

726
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,620
Mac-Eye. Mac-Eye.

727
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,260
You know.

728
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:12,840
What do you got to do?

729
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,400
How'd you know?

730
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,400
I suppose you're going to tell us you don't know that Alexander Mac-Eye, vice-model Alexander Mac-Eye is for a tour of inspection.

731
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:18,900
Possible.

732
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,480
Possible.

733
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,000
Decker?

734
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,420
Dead.

735
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,920
Which is cold, robot.

736
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,000
Talk to people.

737
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,080
Uh, I'm a potato.

738
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,560
You said it, bud.

739
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,340
Great.

740
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,420
No, no, no.

741
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,020
Miss.

742
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,460
No, no.

743
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,020
Time.

744
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,880
S-

745
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,120
Ah.

746
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,380
Pizza?

747
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,440
Um, it's herbal.

748
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,420
Call the man.

749
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,760
So money.

750
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

751
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:42,960
Yay!

752
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:43,700
Yay!

753
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,400
So money.

754
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,940
Call the man.

755
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,860
Fernand and Andy Lemur did a collage and now from their new CD, Reagan's Polyp.

756
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,140
Hey, any- any Beatles fans in the audience tonight?

757
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,500
Uh, we got a song for you, it's called Daytripper now.

758
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:01,820
Oh, okay.

759
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,700
Bye!

760
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,440
Aw.

761
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:24,920


762
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,780
B- douchebag.

763
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,180


764
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,180
M- MVP!

765
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,680
Come-on, just take a 굿's for dados and tickets.

766
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,600
Well, if you don't take a lift, I'll usually be busier.

767
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,560
A- a- cut the music right here.

768
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,480
gasm. Thanks, Mom.

769
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,380
Thanks, Dad. It's gonna

770
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,180
rip your whole spine next time. Just

771
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,640
relax, little boy.

772
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,840
Yeah.

773
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,080
They're coming back.

774
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,040
Wait, you're gonna have to hide under the bed here, kid.

775
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,820
I'm afraid. Really afraid.

776
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,060
None of them pituitary gasms when they're coming by.

777
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,480
Don't make any noise.

778
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,440
Okay, okay, okay.

779
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,380
Hold onto this piece of wood.

780
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,940
Make him feel like you're doing something.

781
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,800
Okay, okay, okay. Be very quiet.

782
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,560
Bite onto the piece of wood if you want to make a sound.

783
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,240
If you start to...

784
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,460
You just don't...

785
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,360
Man, those people from Child Welfare Service is creepy.

786
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,180
They are creepy as hell, man.

787
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,660
That's not the half of it.

788
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,980
They've got some penises on them.

789
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,120
We're all in deep shit.

790
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,560
Shut up.

791
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,440
They've got the circumcision machines.

792
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,480
We're in even deeper.

793
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,340
We're a Bob without a Connie.

794
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,260
Oh, man. No anesthetic for these guys.

795
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,440
One of the first things

796
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,460
any of the forbidden children

797
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,800
must learn is how to keep

798
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
the pituitary gasm at a minimum.

799
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,960
The child service workers

800
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,700
are often vicious and barbaric

801
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,660
in their retribution

802
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,300
and have sometimes even

803
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,320
slothed the little little childs.

804
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,200
A pituitary gasm

805
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,700
in a pre-10-year-old

806
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,140
can be a violent, earth-shaking thing.

807
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:00,920
This is one of the

808
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,240
cause-lit causes for poltergeist.

809
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,340
That's not how you get into that.

810
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:06,840
That's not how you get into that.

811
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:06,840


812
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,940
you

813
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,420
the

814
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,260
violence

815
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:30,500
on their eyes most likely never come through.

816
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,720
They sniff the anguish.

817
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,780
They are fortunate

818
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,420
to him.

819
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
He says that the hardest part

820
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,200
child cars.

821
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,300
He sent out into the world his

822
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,520
nine-year-old Anguish and his eight-year-old

823
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,220
Peter. They were all

824
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,400
seven. I can see these

825
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,340
kids. What a

826
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,400
young age to live.

827
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,880
Some children,

828
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,220
some difference.

829
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,960
Truth.

830
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,800
Truth to children.

831
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,180
Am I still dancing? I can't remember.

832
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,660
It doesn't sound like much of a dance anymore.

833
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,880
I can't hear my ears clicking.

834
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,700
I'm dancing to the dark side

835
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,920
of the moon. Oh, Dave's playing that, I mean

836
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,040
Chance is playing that song about you, Dave.

837
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,760
Pink Floyd.

838
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,780
You know the Pink Boys?

839
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,520
The Pink Boys? Is that who this is?

840
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,680
Yeah, the Pink Boys. Man, that was

841
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
a great band before the

842
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,180
lead singer, O'Deid.

843
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,260
Pink Boys.

844
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,080
The food I left behind

845
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,700
a million last year.

846
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,360
Now we've got two, but only

847
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,280
got the two.

848
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,080
Fresh food.

849
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,360
You and me, we've been

850
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,880
living in a box, but it didn't

851
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,700
matter for you.

852
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,400
Pink Boys.

853
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,480
You know the Pink Boys.

854
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,100
The Pink Boys.

855
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,440
They got the

856
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:07,660
girls.

857
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,740
Pink Boys.

858
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,340
You can't forget this

859
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,800
passion. You can't

860
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
put a spin on this.

861
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,520
It's just a

862
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,060
passion.

863
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,080
It's just a

864
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,300
passion.

865
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,580
Listen.

866
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,980
Pink Boys.

867
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,700
You need a degree.

868
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,200
How is that

869
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,900
the universe

870
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,700
to see?

871
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,660
Because it is

872
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,060
an hour

873
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,720
to an

874
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,360
exception.

875
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,740
I was at

876
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:29,940
the

877
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,660
back door

878
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:30,980
so I

879
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,420
had to

880
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:31,620
learn

881
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,160
how to

882
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,560
show

883
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:32,760
it.

884
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,820
Pink Boys.

885
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,000
They were

886
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,280
born

887
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,500
on a

888
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,280
gold mine.

889
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,640
The Pink Boys.

890
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,000
They got a

891
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,040
gold mine.

892
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,400
The Pink Boys.

893
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,480
They got the

894
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,020
satisfaction.

895
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,380
You can't

896
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,840
put a

897
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,360
sound on

898
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,660
the world.

899
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,040
You've got

900
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,520
to find

901
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:48,700
some

902
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:48,960
more

903
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,320
sun.

904
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,820
Crazy

905
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,220
little

906
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,160
Pink Boys

907
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,560
have

908
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,200
to go

909
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,660
fly.

910
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,840
Crazy

911
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,240
little

912
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,660
planet

913
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,040
with

914
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,320
a

915
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:57,840
planet

916
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,220
in

917
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,640
line.

918
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,580
Crazy

919
00:39:59,580 --> 00:39:59,920
little

920
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,760
Pink Boys

921
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,020
have

922
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,420
to get

923
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:01,700
your

924
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,040
soul.

925
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,100
You

926
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,540
can't

927
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:03,620
go

928
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,000
to

929
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,400
Google.

930
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,120
Just

931
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,480
keep

932
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,040
flying.

933
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,880
I'm

934
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:06,880


935
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,420
going

936
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:07,740
to

937
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,020
fly.

938
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,140
The

939
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,720
back

940
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,000
door

941
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,900
said

942
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,160
I

943
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,620
wouldn't

944
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:11,920
leave

945
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,180
it.

946
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,740
Growing

947
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,320
up

948
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,220
crazy

949
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:14,840
and

950
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,340
singing

951
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,900
it.

952
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,620
I

953
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,280
can't

954
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,460
hold

955
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:17,940
the

956
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,340
reason

957
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:18,620
in

958
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:18,840
the

959
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,120
room.

960
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,760
It's

961
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,200
time to

962
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,420
make

963
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:20,520
a

964
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,040
decision

965
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,640
to

966
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:21,980
move.

967
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,000
Pink

968
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,460
Boys

969
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,220
are

970
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,760
going

971
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,120
to

972
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,320
go

973
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,800
out.

974
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,740
Pink

975
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,360
Boys

976
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,520
have

977
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,140
to go

978
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,520
to

979
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,140
school.

980
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,140
Pink

981
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,920
Boys

982
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,500
get

983
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:34,820
the

984
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,400
satisfaction.

985
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,400
Pink

986
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,100
Boys

987
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,180
have

988
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,740
to go

989
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,140
though.

990
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,600
Yeah!

991
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,380
Pink

992
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,200
I drink and kill the whiteness in my eyes

993
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,140
Don't wanna think about those lonely goodbyes

994
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:25,280
I can't forget the world pounding in my head

995
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,660
And waking up the creatures in my bed

996
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,720
And when did this all begin?

997
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,200
Tap on the shoulder, my friend

998
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,580
I, I, I, I, I drink enough

999
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,100
I, I drink enough

1000
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,540
I drink and travel around the world

1001
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,920
I drink and marry a liquor store girl

1002
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,280
I drink and build myself a yacht

1003
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,740
And smoke old drugs

1004
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:21,460
I never get caught in the bars where I want to be

1005
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:26,620
I take my ship and I tank across the sea

1006
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,640
I, I, I, I, I drink enough

1007
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:30,640


1008
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:30,640


1009
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:30,640


1010
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,180
I, I, I, I drink enough

1011
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:42,120
I, I, I, I, I drink enough

1012
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,360
Living at home, it gets cold

1013
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:53,660
And on my parents' house it's been so cold

1014
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,780
In the pubs where I want to be

1015
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,640
I take my boat and I go to the beach

1016
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:00,640


1017
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:00,640


1018
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:00,640


1019
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,920
And we can float across the sea

1020
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,980
And if I run out of cash

1021
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,100
And get my meals from the trash

1022
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,680
I, I, I, I

1023
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,940
I drink enough

1024
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,960
I, I, I, I

1025
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,260
I drink enough

1026
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,340
I drink and kill

1027
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,480
Whiteness in my eyes

1028
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,440
Don't wanna think about those lonely goodbyes

1029
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,260
And I can't forget

1030
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,680
All the pounding in my head

1031
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,840
And waking up

1032
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,960
Creatures in my bed

1033
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,240
And when I'm

1034
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,880
Will this all end?

1035
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,740
A little cirrhosis, my friend

1036
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,060
I, I, I, I

1037
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,180
I drink enough

1038
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,340
I, I, I, I

1039
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:08,600
I drink enough

1040
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,500
I, I, I, I

1041
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,620
I drink enough

1042
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,680
I, I, I, I

1043
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:18,980
I drink enough

1044
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,480
It tastes good

1045
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:35,540
Groß training

Birr

1050
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,260
The Line.

1051
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,900
The Line, tweaked by Lemur.

1052
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:19,840
Before that, that song, I Drink Enough, is by Rocco Schwab from his album The Barlight Beauty.

1053
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:26,080
Information is at www.scaryrecords.com.

1054
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,260
That's roccoshwab at hotmail.com.

1055
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:38,500
And before that, friends, The Pink Boys, doing that song, the titular song, The Pink Boys.

1056
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,040
That was the band of my friend Dr. X.

1057
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,220
That was recorded live in some club in Dallas in 1980,

1058
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,560
about the time.

1059
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,640
The first subgenius pamphlet was printed.

1060
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,540
Dr. X died of drink and bad habits.

1061
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,600
It was a bummer, man, because he was my high school best pal.

1062
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,020
And he died before he was even 40.

1063
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,820
But now, Reagan's Pollock!

1064
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,520
Any Led Zeppelin fans out here tonight?

1065
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,900
The only one that's called The Immigrant Song.

1066
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,820
It's him.

1067
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,820
The Immigrant Song.

1068
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:49,820


1069
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:49,820


1070
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:49,820


1071
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:13,020
I am a guldarned visionary, I see the future and the past in comic books and wine bottles,

1072
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,820
I eat black holes for breakfast, I bend my jeans and whittle my DNA with the sheer force

1073
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:24,520
of my mighty will, I spear my own guldarned evolution, I ran M out of heaven and sold

1074
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,720
it to hell for a profit, I'm enlightened, I achieved nirvana and took it home with me,

1075
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,960
yip, yip, yee yee yee, I'm so ugly the speed of light can slow me down and gravity won't

1076
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:41,560
tug at my cuffs, when the rapture comes, I'll make M wait, they'll never clean my cage,

1077
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,440
now give me some more of, take runs out.

1078
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,800
Summertime's here kiddies, and it's time to get to work,

1079
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,500
and it's time to take a trip, to take a trip, to this world so bad,

1080
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,680
you feel so sad, you gotta take a trip, into a world so glad,

1081
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:10,300
a world of frogs, and green fountains, and flying dogs, and silver cats, and emerald

1082
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:18,780
rats, and purple clouds, and faceless crowds, and walls of glass, that never pass, and I

1083
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:18,780


1084
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:18,780


1085
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:18,780


1086
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,560
know that if it honestly could disappear, you wouldn't waste more of your time,

1087
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:19,560


1088
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:19,560


1089
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,940
that laughter made you ask it, but the past and pictures hangin' upside down,

1090
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,920
it won't ask where you are, it's another world!

1091
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:34,420
You and your girl, and all your friends, will all be there, oh yeah!

1092
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,800
Let's take a trip, let's take a trip.

1093
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,560
TNT!

1094
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,640
SOS!

1095
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,620
HOP!

1096
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,320
TOP!

1097
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,620
It's the top, it's the top

1098
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,420
Hey, here we go now

1099
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,120
Let's climb some mountains, everybody

1100
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,100
Get on your walking shoes

1101
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,460
Let's start to climb some mountains

1102
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,280
There you go

1103
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,480
Let's take a trip

1104
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,320
Let's take a trip

1105
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,220
Let's start to dream

1106
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,320
Let's close our eyes

1107
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,140
It's groovy now

1108
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,100
Yeah

1109
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,600
Float

1110
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,100
Because I'm swimming

1111
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,600
It's all around

1112
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,720
Let's take a trip

1113
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,900
I'm from the ground

1114
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,220
Whoa

1115
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,840
Whoa, yeah

1116
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,420
Let's take a trip

1117
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,360
It's really hip

1118
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,460
No one will know

1119
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,300
What goes on

1120
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,200
Just you and me

1121
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,420
And the dreams we see

1122
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,840
I'll come back

1123
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,840
I'll come back

1124
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,820
You're doing it right

1125
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,000
Just put your head back

1126
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,940
Friends, The Trip by Kim Fowley

1127
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,080
You have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

1128
00:49:53,080 --> 00:50:04,880
You can get free information from Bob at Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043

1129
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:12,680
And you can write to me, Reverend Ivan Stang, stang at subgenius.com

1130
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,580
Just check www.subgenius.com

1131
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,320
And praise Bob

1132
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,840
I mean, everyone knows

1133
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,620
Who this shit?

1134
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,840
Here's a word problem

1135
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,380
A math word problem

1136
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,080
Okay

1137
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,800
The universe is an infinite

1138
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,320
Sorry, an infinite

1139
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,360
Oh, you said it right the first time

1140
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,300
An agglomeration of energy fields resembling threads of light

1141
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,200
That's A

1142
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,020
Okay, threads

1143
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,180
Remember threads

1144
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,500
These energy fields called

1145
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,120
These energy fields radiate from a source of inconceivable proportions

1146
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,200
Metaphorically

1147
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
Called the eagle

1148
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,240
The needle?

1149
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,160
The eagle

1150
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,420
The eagle

1151
00:50:59,420 --> 00:50:59,980
Eagle

1152
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,840
Human

1153
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,540
No, three

1154
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,600
Okay, no, C

1155
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,340
Human

1156
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,140
New age

1157
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:11,440
Human beings are also composed of an incalculable number of the same thread-like energy fields

1158
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,400
We are?

1159
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,760
So the question is

1160
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,460
One ply or two?

1161
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,860
Oh, man, that's an easy one

1162
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,600
Two ply

1163
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,960
Oh, you think it is

1164
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,320
Black hole

1165
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:23,800
Black hole

1166
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,400
Yeah, if you don't pick the right answer, that's what you get

1167
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,220
You'll be picking something else

1168
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,120
Out of your sockets

1169
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,480
Oh, is that song over?

1170
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,020
The end of the world is over already?

1171
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,360
Yes, it is

1172
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,440
Let's sing a song about the end of the world

1173
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,100
Ah

1174
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,560
Ah

1175
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:41,920
Ah

1176
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,100
Ah

1177
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,160
Ah

1178
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1179
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1180
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1181
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1182
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1183
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1184
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1185
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1186
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1187
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1188
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:42,780


1189
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,760
Let's sing a song about the end of the world

1190
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,180
Let's sing a song about the end of the world

1191
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,180


1192
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,180


1193
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,060
No, let's go to war.

1194
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,640
Let's sing a song about war and the end of the world.

1195
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,300
Sky Pilot.

1196
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,980
Oh, the beginning of the world?

1197
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,980
Yeah, let's sing a song about the beginning of the world in E.

1198
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:01,560
Okay.

1199
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,900
The great yeti mother

1200
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,500
Squatted down

1201
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,120
And grunted

1202
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,080
And gave birth

1203
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,380
To the universe

1204
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,540
And then the great yeti father came

1205
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,520
Upon the egg of the universe

1206
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,140
And what splurted upon it was what we call

1207
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,240
Time

1208
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,020
And so time and the universe came together

1209
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,320
And something came from nothing

1210
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,700
And then God invented souls

1211
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,860
And then Bob let God loose from his chain

1212
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,420
And said, sack him

1213
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,480
And the souls evolved

1214
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,300
And sent thirty dollars to Bob

1215
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,760
Praise Bob

1216
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,940
And so the universe began

1217
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:09,400
Well, that humbly was performed by his self, his own self,

1218
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,300
the gland man, our favorite clam, the reverend.

1219
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,100
Ivor.

1220
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,380
Ivor.

1221
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:13,380


1222
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,380
I don't think there's a dry eye socket or any other socket in this room now.

1223
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,040
The brain is the only proper receptacle for the seed of genius.

1224
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:34,440
The brain, the brain, look at how many little tiny dendrites there are moving.

1225
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,780
Bring me more blind French maid.

1226
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,960
If you fly past the sonic sphere, you will die.

1227
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,440
Yes, you will.

1228
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,160
You cannot live through that.

1229
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,960
It's a storm of light.

1230
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,640
You know it.

1231
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,780
It's pretty dark out there.

1232
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,820
Hey, what happens when two black holes come together?

1233
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,020
If two black holes meet?

1234
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,620
They suck each other up into the infinities.

1235
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,180
Gravitational ripples?

1236
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,880
Perhaps a new poo-poo on your wing?

1237
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,780
It's become like a snake eating each other's tails.

1238
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,920
No one could know the answer to that question.

1239
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,260
Or fabulous psychosis.

1240
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,320
We could never observe it.

1241
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,240
We could never absorb it.

1242
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,860
Any answer could never be proven.

1243
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:26,260
Well, from a distance we can observe the effects of the two black holes colliding.

1244
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,620
Perhaps in some future civilization.

1245
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:34,540
You would never really know what's going on deep down, you know, in the middle of it all.

1246
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,820
No, but it would generate unthinkable energies.

1247
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,220
And with those we could power our amps.

1248
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,620
Oh, what an ingenious idea.

1249
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,860
They're so much better than broomsticks and candles.

1250
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,720
That would be a great place to do a concert, man.

1251
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,260
Right at the meeting point between the two black holes.

1252
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,440
I think that's where we did it.

1253
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,100
Sapping forces of the vortex.

1254
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,440
That was sort of like one of those...

1255
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,340
The conclave-age.

1256
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,180
Concert right between the two black holes there.

1257
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,940
It was the two left eyes of God.

1258
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,780
Well, I think one of the black holes was Doc Frop's camp.

1259
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,840
That's where we got sucked into.

1260
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,700
Ah, like a parasite.

1261
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,900
Like a vampire.

1262
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,440
Oh, that's right.

1263
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,700
Yeah, you missed it all.

1264
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,880
You missed the big thing.

1265
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,520
Oh, but the robots.

1266
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,780
When I get my jet fighter plane, I'm going to play this piece.

1267
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,440
When I get to kill.

1268
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,080
When I get to kill our Iraqis.

1269
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,680
Listen, honey, they're playing our romantic song.

1270
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,960
Oh, remember how many Iraqis we killed with this song?

1271
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,520
They loved it.

1272
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,940
Kill, kill, kill.

1273
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,440
The loose wasn't so badly either.

1274
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,180
Kill.

1275
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,600
About the two black holes.

1276
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,240
Yeah.

1277
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,940
I think one's from a firefighter named Tom Evans when he put his fire out.

1278
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,860
What does that mean?

1279
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,640
That's a pretty metaphorical thing there, man.

1280
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,180
I don't know if we can even handle that on this show, at least.

1281
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,580
That is infatimable.

1282
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,560
We don't have the kind of energy forces to deal with that.

1283
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,020
Okay.

1284
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,960
What happens if an irresistible pie meets an uncontrollable high?

1285
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,260
Ah, that is when his alarm is going off.

1286
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:12,520
The boundless appetite for the infinite pie.

1287
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,840
I lost for food, not I lost for life.

1288
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,820
The uncontrollable pie.

1289
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:16,940
A pie.

1290
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:22,000
This is making me slobbering at the mouth of a pie.

1291
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,300
Mildly delicious.

1292
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,720
Look, your euphemisms are on the corner of your nasal drip.

1293
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,000
Isn't that Dairy Farmers Union place open all the time?

1294
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,120
Oh, no, not at this hour of the night unless you go to a special dairy mart.

1295
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,240
A special ice cream dairy mart.

1296
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,460
Oh, my God.

1297
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,060
Yum.

1298
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:42,460
Pie.

1299
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,260
Pie.

1300
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:43,760
Pie.

1301
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,120
Pie.

1302
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:44,640
Pie to the sky.

1303
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:47,540
That's what we've been offered the whole time when they're offering us death.

1304
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:47,840
Pie.

1305
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,360
Pie.

1306
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:48,900
Pie.

1307
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:48,960
Pie.

1308
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,040
Pie.

1309
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,040


1310
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,040


1311
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,220
I hate to sound like an old wobbly son of a bitch.

1312
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,620
I like to get down every now and then.

1313
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,660
I like to get down and...

1314
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:56,720
Carmelite.

1315
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:02,680
Really, you know, I do a whole different retuning for this and get down into the roots of pie.

1316
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,360
You ever get down into the roots of pie?

1317
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah, man.

1318
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,380
No, I'm hip to it.

1319
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,060
I've never done it.

1320
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:08,380
I've never done it before.

1321
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,200
A lot of people aren't in touch with that.

1322
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,380
They think, you know, all you do is go down to the music store and buy the equipment and,

1323
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,420
you know, that's the next thing.

1324
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,380
You're in pie.

1325
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,360
But you got to get into the root of pie, baby.

1326
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:19,780
Yeah.

1327
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,720
And that's something you can't buy at a store.

1328
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,700
You know, you can buy the pie there, but you can't buy the root of pie.

1329
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,460
Where does the mud of the root of pie come from?

1330
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,580
I don't know, man.

1331
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,620
You got to answer that question.

1332
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,620
Where's the mud of the root of pie?

1333
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,740
Oh, that's deep.

1334
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,940
Well, ultimately, it comes from a point which expands.

1335
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:43,180
It expands to become the circle from which we derive the pie, or vice versa.

1336
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,180
The perfect circle.

1337
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:46,800
It is perfect.

1338
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,360
The perfect hole.

1339
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,860
A zero.

1340
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,400
A nothingness.

1341
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,640
Like the thing in the center of Bob's brain.

1342
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,140
Perfect like a little baby's colon.

1343
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:56,980
An ever-growing nothingness.

1344
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,360
An all-devouring non-existence.

1345
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,480
Look at its little chunk.

1346
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,980
An anti-somethingness.

1347
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,640
Look at its little molecular bingo.

1348
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:08,660
An anti-toy.

1349
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,580
A rapacious black hole of all things.

1350
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,300
All light.

1351
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,160
All gravitational forces.

1352
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,220
Even tachyons.

1353
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,220
A ravenous boopholder of tachyons.

1354
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:21,680
Bob-ions.

1355
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,060
And whack-me-ons.

1356
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,120
Whack-me-ons.

1357
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,900
Yeah, I like the whack-me-ons.

1358
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,440
Oh, Bob, we call out to you in this, our darkest hour.

1359
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,880
We are lost in the wilderness, and we need not only your salvation, but your guidance.

1360
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,600
And your supreme pure light.

1361
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,620
Oh, let it shine.

1362
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,900
Till next week.

1363
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,340
Keep your hat on tight.

1364
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,260
You're back to the wind in your sack and the saddle.

1365
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,380
This is ESO Radio, signing off.

1366
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,080
See you there.

1367
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,360
Your eye.

1368
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:04,200
Till the sun is in the sky.

1369
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,060
Oh.

1370
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,240
Your eye.

1371
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,240


1372
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,240


1373
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,240


1374
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,240


1375
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,240


1376
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,240


1377
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,240


1378
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,680
to spend eternity alone with barely any swag.
