If you want a long cigarette, smoke the long cigarette.
It's wise to smoke.
So, enjoy long cigarettes.
You're not going to sedate me anymore.
Who are you?
The self-genius, power of smoke.
I seem to be in a timeless space void, neither light nor dark.
I have awareness, but not mind, but no memory.

This comes from...
From PR News in Washington.
I'm linked to Tainted Egg.
Because of bug parts.
President Obama says...
But the president says...
The president told a U.N. conference today that...
Obama administration officials plot attacks.
Officials say the number and pace of attacks is greater than at any time.
Administration officials have stepped up efforts to recruit Americans to act inside the country.
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has become more diversified.
Diversifying.
Diversifying.
Diversifying.

The chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had been convicted of PR News...
On Wall Street, 2114.
In Boulder County, Colorado, authorities have decided that this is PR News from Washington.
Here is the actual report.
The story you are about to hear is changed to protect...
Dragness.
Dragness.
Dragness.

Dragness.

Will you tell me why?
Well, it's our job to keep filthy junk like these books falling into youngsters' hands.
Yeah?
Now, on the other side of the fence, the youngster has to be taught dirt and filth and garbage.
And the youngsters have to be taught that in the home, in the school, in the church.
Bible, things like that.
The man was seldom.
How do you reach them?
Through the youngsters.
They seem to know the way.
Here.
Rotten filth, boy.
Here you go.
Possessing lewd and lascivious literature in the county jail.
What do you think?
No sense of humor.
Yes.
Oh, well, if I figured it out in those other town Kay's

And we're enjoying listening to the hour of slack.
I'm slacking off myself.
I think the people are leaving them.
X-Day's over.
And then the complications of X-Day.
So true.
So true.
That's it.
It's just sick.
It's just so sick.
In a good way or a bad way?
Well, in a good way.
So you think that's funny, huh?
That's fine.
Okay, laugh, laugh.
It's easy for you to do.
Okay.
I'm just going to go back and post some more tweets.
What?
What?
What?
Talk.
Say something.
Now.
Well, I don't know.
It can be confusing at times.
You know, the water is a bit, a tad too warm.
One could say it's even too hot for one's taste, for one's body.
You know, we're all individuals and our bodies feel the warmth of the water.
You know, warmth is nothing but micro-movements of particles in the water.
You know, H2O.
Christopher Walken calling.
I think so.
It's such an honor.
This sounds like, are you Christopher Walken?
Christopher Walken, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You sound like him.
I think I am.
Yeah, you sound like him too, man.
Yeah, because what happened is, Mr. Walken, it's great to talk to you after hearing nothing but Lenny Bruce for three hours.
Yeah.
I'm a huge fan of KPFA.
Every time I, well, I don't know if this is suitable for airtime.
Sure.
Well, don't say any of those seven deadly words of Christ and you're okay.
What are those?
Can you do a little recap or something?
Maybe.
Well, it's an honor to have you call, Father Guido Sarducci.
Well, a little recap could be in place if you would like to refresh the.
Yeah, yeah, I'll refresh the computer here.
Okay, I'm going to refresh my, I'm going to refresh my page.
Whatever you do out there, if you're listening to the show, refresh the computer.
Okay.











What are you doing up at this hour is the real question.
I always have, or listeners have, 848-425-510-ERICA.
Well, it's time to slack off.
Oh, yeah, I agree about that.
Okay, here we go.
Slack off like that.
Yep, we're slacking off.
What other business should take place right now at this hour, man?
Exactly, I agree.
I have two healthy hands, so what else do I need except maybe one cold brewski?
Yeah, that's all you need.
That's all.
That's all.
As long as it's, you know, like a gallon-sized brewski.
Yeah, and something to do with your hands, you know.
Yeah.
Maybe a pen you could tap on the table.
The idle hands are the devil's playground.
What?
If you're going to medicine, you could pop some pills.
Self-medicating, now you're talking.
An idle mind is the devil's workshop.
I don't do that kind of stuff, but, you know, many people are into that, you know.
Yeah.
As many people are into, have you heard of this new phenomenon called freaking out?
Yeah, it's like flipping out, only even more extreme.
You know, in UK, many young, you know, the youth, they're really doing this.
They got this new brand, you know, they're doing this freaking out thing.
They freak out?
Really?
Yeah, yeah, green hair.
He had a green hair at the disco check or a warehouse party, like we call it.
You know what?
I heard that they can get the freak out for a while, and then they turn around and look,
and they flip out.
Well, they should freak in.
They freak out and in.
While flipping.
Yeah, and then they drop.
My grandmother.
For their job.
Your grandmother had been known to do that also.
We had to put her in an institution.
Oh.
Well, I think that's.
The institution was burning in.
It's inevitable.
You know, it's inevitable.
What's the word?
I don't know.
I'm getting confused here, man.
Yeah, that's the show.
I am too.
That's the radio show.
That's the radio show does that to you.
This show too, game TV.










Someone must be like, oh, laughs, but not the video of this.

And the map

name Bob for practically
any exemplary, I wonder
if everybody's so plugged in that they
their neurons
have shorted pretty much.
So they just get the information
from the most superficial
part of their brain.
No, Dave, it's
simply that Bob is the most
common first name in the English
speaking world. But
I think you're referring to
how we got famous on TV
last Friday night when
that devil
demon rat woman
Rachel
Maddow
praised Bob. How come
the right wing guys hate her so much?
I'm not really that familiar with
television as a medium, you know.
I know. I actually
the first time I saw the Rachel
Maddow show was
on the web Friday night after somebody
called me up and said, hey, Rachel
Maddow talked about Church of the Subgenius
at great length the other night.
Just now.
And we have an audio tape of that
which I could play.
Our dearest friends worship her.
Oh, yeah, yeah. We have lots of
friends who worship her, but
they're like
center of the road people.
Left
leaning centers.
Yes. Well, they claim that anybody who's
on, can I say the name of a network
without plugging or something like that?
But anyone who's on her network, they're
also defile. They defile all
the MSNBC.
Yeah, you can say that. That's okay.
And they defile also
CNN, which
they believe to be Marxist. Right.
Yeah. And that we're all going to be going
to the gulag work camps and somehow
our freedoms are going to be taken away.
Any second now. Any second.
2012, man, the world ends.
July 5th.
7 a.m. 2012.
You're hoping for that even more than normally.
Well, that's the funny thing.
They've been hoping for that for a long,
long time. And they've been promising that the world
ends for a long, long time. But we
know exactly when
the world ends next year.
It's 1998.
July 5th.
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.
Yeah. Rachel
Maddow, a lot of the subgeniuses
got to talking about how they had a crush
on her.
Partly because she's gay.
That makes it safe, you know.
Oh, is she really? Yeah.
An out lesbian girl.
That's probably another reason why.
Exactly. It makes her extra sexy to the
subgenius boys.
Because they know
they can't do anything at all about it.
Except, you know.
Perfect, perfect, yeah.
The perfect woman.
For the perfect subgenius, frustrated in his own
mind over things he doesn't have
because he couldn't have them, but he never did.
Never mind. It doesn't make sense.
Well, let's play this little edited
excerpt.
This is quite edited because she was actually
doing a report about a crate
the guy the Republicans
are running for New York governor
who's
kind of off.
But that probably won't stand in his
way in today's
climate. But here is
an excerpt from that show.
I won't comment. I'll just listen.
I hope.
I hope.
It sounds like a Japanese commercial.
Okay, last slide, please.
Here we go.
This is a category of nearly ubiquitous iconic
1990s era American urban street art.
Art that was so iconic and so ubiquitous
it doesn't even really count as urban
anymore because it turned up everywhere.
You also have to include Bob Dobbs.
Bob Dobbs, the icon
of the Church of Subgenius,
which itself is a subject for another day.
But admit it, you have seen this guy's face
stickered or stenciled somewhere,
haven't you? Or on a t-shirt or something?
Okay, we can
bring the lights back up now.
Bob Dobbs,
and the Church of the Subgenius.
Certainly in the top tier of nearly ubiquitous
iconic 1990s era American
urban street art.
Alright? Now, back to Carl Paladino.
I'm telling you, I think
I have finally figured this out.
Carl Paladino is the Republican nominee
for Governor of New York, who I think
maybe isn't running a campaign.
Who I think is maybe doing an art project.
My proof
is here. There is a tagline
that goes along with Bob Dobbs
with the iconic 90s street art.
A stenciled guy with the pipe smiling at you.
What is the tagline that gets into your
subconsciousness for Bob Dobbs
of the Church of the Subgenius?
It's, I'm mad too,
Bob. And what's on
Carl Paladino's lawn sign?
I'm mad
too, Carl.
I'm telling you, this
is an art project.
Carl Paladino is not yet a stencil
on a skate park, but he will be.
And when he is, it will be so...
He will go for years and years
and years. He will be.
Years. Years.
Quite a plug.
And years.
To be mentioned as iconic street art
of the 90s on a national show.
Well, Dave, you know, that actually
used to happen all the time
in the 80s, because she's wrong.
It was actually iconic
1980s street art, but that was when
she was a little
mewling, puking baby child.
That's when she used to hang
out in front of PS1 where the huge
balloon head is of Dobbs.
Well, yeah, it's funny. I mean,
in the 80s,
my gosh,
we were covered by all the
CNN,
CBS,
New York Times, New York Post,
People Magazine.
I was even on the...
Who was that talk show
host, the loud
mouth, the guy that said, zip it, zip it.
That early
obnoxious talk.
Not Jon Stewart.
No, no, no. Long before that.
The guy with the large hair.
We were on Jon Stewart, too.
I know.
He had similar hair.
He died of alcoholism, didn't he?
Yeah, well, I would think so.
He faked
getting beat up by minority
members and then got caught
faking it.
And then he had to give all their members back.
My favorite kind of guy.
That guy, yeah.
Yeah, that guy.
Anyway, Rachel Maddow needs to
learn that Bob is more than just
a pretty face.
In fact, I invited her to the
New York City Devival, which
happens next weekend on October 9th.
I personally
invited her to come see that
since she said it was, you know,
Church of the Subgenius was for another story.
And what a
story it is. And you can
learn the story of the Church
of the Subgenius if you're
crazy. If
you were to take the Subgenius
history course online,
which involves about
three DVDs worth of downloads
of everything we ever did,
including all of our
magazines and shows
and movies.
But that's something you would have to
look for other
information about, because I can't tell you.
Yeah, you'd have to be a Christian.
All I can say is,
subgenius.com
is the place to look
for more information
on that. That starts
October 25th
and lasts for six weeks, all
online. It's like going to a Subgenius
show without ever leaving
your house, so you don't get the
diseases, but you also don't
get the beautiful live girls.
That's when you really
need to get the diseases.
On slide three.
I wonder what
is that thing?
Oh my God,
how could she do that?
I didn't know that was
physiologically possible.
Oh my God.
With Bob's pipe,
all things are possible.
Take a deep breath, friend.
You have nothing to lose.
You have very little
gain, but at least you'll be
on the plus side.
But steep.
Take a big, long draw
from Bob's pipe.
Yes.
Your eyes are rolling back in your head.
I hope you don't mind if we use you
for a little comic enjoyment.
Just stand over here in the middle of this
stage while you react, and we'll
laugh at you.
And I thought
my jokes were bad.
They are.
Honey.
It's like the Fibber McGee and Molly show sometimes.
I thought my jokes were bad.
And I mean,
she's you guys
perversely.
Well, that's
yeah, babe.
Well, listen, you know, you know, I don't know.
That's just the way we do it.
No, I'm saying no.
Sure.
No, I'm saying no.
Sure.
No, no, no.
No.

No.
No.
No.
No.
Okay.
Okay.
And I think
I think glyphic toolbar languages
and the social media.
And I think they've gone
too far without knowing
how far they've gone.
It's like a little dingleberry
in a life raft dreaming of perhaps
the other shore where there is none.
You know, that's so ironic because I
dream of dingleberries in life rafts
going around in circles.
And they dream of being
on our shore.
Well, sometimes there's huge tsunamis that
that bear down on them.
At the times there's clear sailing and there's
Hawaiian dancing girls wearing suitcases and
and enamored of boxes.
I think then other times you're stuck in the middle
of a strange shore that you wish you wouldn't have
landed on it.
The natives could be hostility and there could be
problems with your zippers.
I'm stuck here at the island.
I'm stuck here at the island of WCSB's beautiful studios
in downtown Cleveland.
Where the coconuts grow year round.
They do?
Well, yeah, sure.
Well, the nuts at least.
Dr. Sinister is here.
I'm stuck.
Is he wearing the, you know, the funny eyeglasses
that I sent him?
Well, he always said he can't take those off.
None of us can.
If I did, then people might recognize my secret identity.
Well, I guess.
Well, they're not worried about your secret identity
right now.
They're worried about how you're going to make it
for the next 25 seconds with them goggles on.
Those secret glasses I sent you.
25 seconds.
I can't.
I can't count that high.
You've just got to take life one 25 seconds at a time.
But I want an Oompa Loompa now.
Well, they can.
Just breathe deeply through the diaphragm.
If you can find one in the studio there, I guess there
was a pretty wild party last night.
I don't know, there was a party last night.

I feel really lucky right now.
And while you're on your
board with Lord Sinister, that was really
crazy.
How on Earth can you usually go to Oompa Loompa
and figure out your secret identity without showing
any sign you don't know about him and letting people know you for

And, uh, now.
That's great.

to see the out of doors,
that big bright light in the top of the dome.
Yeah, what is that thing?
It hurts.
So bright.
They could turn it down, but they won't.
No, they let the hula girls go past your window,
drifting by.
Oh, look at the girl.
We're on a little ukulele,
surfing one of them hundred-foot highways.
You can see through those grass skirts.
Mm.
That's so exotic and foreign.
Mm.
Hey, hey.
Hey, I'm going to play the news real quick.
Help me.
From PR News in Washington,
I'm now in police custody.
Authorities say 11 people were hurt.
The French government is bracing for another massive turkey.
President Obama says he's sorry.
On Wall Street 2010, 740.
The owner of an Iowa egg company says this is PR News.
PR News, Washington.
The drug administration has approved a new drug.
It's the first that can be taken in Washington.
The new drug slows the patient's brain.
It's called slow brain.
A company spokeswoman says no information is available.
The district attorney said the group paid itself hefty salaries.
The driver who was involved in a deadly tour bus
faces at least 11 charges of having children.
The statistics detail a serious
ose.
Stephanie Insurance,
English Translation,
And because the Black Widow's movie this morning
is phenomenal,
legged captain of the Clara M accidentally overheard an argument between Subban and the
crew. Jimmy was discovered eavesdropping, threatened with dire punishment by Clark Kent.
It is now several days later. Listen.
That's our biggest report of any waste party from me.
Hey.
What holy mackerel? What can that be?
Yes, what can it be? What is the meaning of the strange, dark, thrilling, mysterious weird Subban?
Tune in the demon-talling rip-snacker, Subban.
Subban.
Subban is right.
Subban is right. That was my favorite Subban episode so far.
I remember when Harry Olsen, the Paleolithic editor of the Daily Stones,
accidentally was found overlapping the desk with the lovely Miss Lois Arcade.
That was something for Superman to see.
You know, he had a hard time. He was about ready to bust a move,
but he knew that he would probably blow his cover.
You know what really gets me is how they always have to change one little detail or another
when making a comic book-to-film adaptation, you know?
And, you know, like just now they were saying that Superman was from the planet Supton.
No, he was from the planet Crouton.
Superman.
You know, they just had to change that for some of the Hollywood suits.
Superman.
Superman.
Does he come in garlic flavor?
Pardon me.
This is a family show.
He comes from Parma.
Parma.
Comes in melted cheese flavor.
I was told to pronounce that Parma when I first moved here.
Were they making fun of me?
Parma.
Yeah, you're a little bit behind the ball.
It's Parma.
In Parma, there's a street called Chevrolet Boulevard, and there's a place where they make cars.
If you come over to Pennsylvania sometimes, you'll notice that they make cores over there.
And then you go across the border and they make cars.
It's kind of weird.
But I love it, so I remember the last time I was in the same frame in the movie,
and it got frozen and started to burn.
Is that what happened to you?
No, that's what happened to you.
Oh.
Well, I knew one of us suddenly swole up and melted.
I was just watching.
Are you sure?
I was one of the many viewers chewing their popcorn and gribbling.
Now that frame stuck in the projector is a plug-in that doesn't make any sense to modern-day kids.
Well, thank God for that.
Because nobody shows 16mm films or even 35mm films on regular projectors anymore, hardly.
Well, what do they do when they go to a psychotronic film fest?
And they're sitting there.
And the weird...
strange...
vinyl-looking...
pale-blue-shirted...
gym teacher goes upstairs to see what's wrong with the projector,
and the kids, before the monster attacks,
the kids are all like,
ehhh,
because the film is going to...
and burns and stuff.
Thank you for reminding me.
I was going to do a movie review.
And how is Tyler Durden going to splice in single frames of pornography into family films?
Yeah.
How can they still do that, even after all of...
how technology has advanced so far?
Yeah.
I think, um, what we need to do is to form a new covert brotherhood.
Both for...
Are you playing Ema Schumach?
No, that's Princess Wee.
She's ate one of those one-dollar chicken sandwiches on the way back from Rabbit Town.
Oh.
And, uh, it's kind of...
it...
it...
irked her.
Now, does Rabbit Town about Frog Town, or does...
No, it's near Hutchville.
Oh.
Rabbiton and Hutchville.
Anyway, I was going to mention this movie that nobody's ever heard of, except, I guess, film students.
And I had not heard of it.
I found it in the media ditch near my house, and I didn't know what it was.
It's called Monsters.
And not really very aptly named, because although it has monsters, it's really a love story.
And, um, apparently it's such a low-budget independent film that, friends, you may never see it in your mind.
It's in your movie theaters.
But look for it in your local media ditch, or wherever you find movies that the conspiracy otherwise tries to hide.
It's called Monsters.
Made this year.
Directed by and written by a guy named Gareth Edwards, who also photographed it and did all the special effects.
The whole movie is on a budget of $15,000.
Lord have mercy.
Which is what you would pay for...
You know, a few minutes of film on a film camera.
But apparently it was made with a crew consisting of only two people using off-the-shelf consumer-level cameras and digital effects programs.
The film was shot entirely on location.
Any settings featured were real locations, often used without permission asked in advance.
And all the film extras were just people who happened to be there at the time.
And it looks like a million bucks.
And not only that, it's a really good movie.
So...
I'm sorry.
Even the central characters were just...
There's two central characters, and apparently the cameraman was the director and the writer, and he's really good.
He used to be a special effects person, apparently.
And he and the sound man and the two actors went to Mexico and shot this movie.
And made it look fabulous.
Here's the story, okay?
Six years ago, NASA discovered the possibility of alien life within our solar system.
A probe was launched to collect samples, but crashed upon re-entry over Central America.
Soon after, new life forms began to appear and half of Mexico...
That's not in Central America.
Was quarantined as an infected zone.
Today, the American and Mexican military...

Still struggle to contain the creatures.
Our story begins when a U.S. journalist agrees to escort a shaken tourist through the infected zone in Mexico...
To the safety of the U.S. border.
Which in this movie looks like the Great Wall of China.
And...
The thing is...
It's not really a monster movie.
It's really a love story that could have been set in any non-American country...
With Americans trying to get home through a disaster.
It could be a revolution.
It could have been anything.
But they decided to make it giant crab-octopus-squid monsters.
Who...
Well, I don't want to spoil it for you.
But...
The monsters aren't in it very much.
And monster fans who are stupid...
The stupid ones...
Like...
Not even subgenius level.
Because they didn't do the right thing.
And write to Bob.
They...
They didn't like it.
Because it was like, well, it's all mushy stuff.
It's just these people in Mexico running around with...
Trying to bribe their way through the panic.
But...
You know, the funny thing...
I've made low-budget movies.
And I've been trapped in foreign countries.
Not speaking the language very well.
And anxious as to whether I was going to get out...
Before the government changed its mind.
Or the monsters came.
Or whatever.
And the whole atmosphere of it is great.
Monsters.
2010.
Directed by Gareth Edwards.
That is my review.
If you look it up in...
IMDBA.
Internet Movie Database.
The...
The...
The user comments are actually pretty good.
I was tempted to read them.
But I won't.
Because I had a nice review of the movie by G8 Jedi.
That's the name that was attached to the review.
But...
Yeah, it was...
It's...
It's...
As this person says...
The monster effects are believable.
And...
And Edwards deserves due credit for some fun visuals.
But he successfully directs our attention to the human story.
Rather than letting the monsters be the main characters.
This is not a traditional action-sci-fi movie.
Though there are certainly heart-pounding, jaw-dropping scenes of mayhem and military firepower.
It's a character-driven story set in a sci-fi disaster-monster movie.
And it works.
Don't go in thinking it is district novella.
or Cloverfield, although it actually
looks kind of like both of those
at times.
I heard this
Cloverfield reference, but
the products... It's a monster movie.
It was a monster
movie from the point of view
of the fleeing public,
not from the point of view of the
general or the scientist
or the scientist's daughter
or the handsome square-jawed
hero who all already know
what the monster is. It's from the point of view
of the people fleeing down the street who don't
know what happened.
And that's the kind of monster movie
we like these days, because we've seen
all the other kind.
I got a great idea. Now listen to this. This has got all the elements.
See? There's a gay scientist.
No, no, he's a doctor. The doctor's
a scientist, and there's a monster.
This is a big monster, and he's coming by real
quick. So anyway,
the handsome colonel
in the Air Force, he falls in love with the
general's daughter. But the general's daughter
is falling in love with the handsome, no,
the gay professor. The monster. The monster, that's
right. And then the monster comes with all these
central characters that killed in the very
first act. The monster. And the next is the POV
of the monster. Do you see
where I'm coming from? I see, I see.
It's from the
monster's point of view. I'm digging it. I'm
digging it, man. I'm digging it. After that
last bite, he feels remorse.
He falls in love with another monster.
They come up with an idea.
See, this is the idea. It's gonna sell. It's gonna
sell. I can tell. It's gonna sell.
They taste pretty good and so on and so forth.
We're gonna do something better.
Aye, aye, aye.
Aye, aye, aye.
Aye, aye, aye.
Aye, aye, aye.
That's why they call them
news croppers, see?
They break into every little thing and give you
little tiny bits that don't make any sense.
But you're supposed to absorb them
just like a moist towel.
They're crying out loud.
They're eating our children.
Hey, Dave,
we saw you on the internet.
I didn't. You got on the secret
subgenius news group. Yeah, man.
You managed to get in. You're out.
Yeah. You're out.
Yeah, man. We outed
Dave on the inside.
He's netting, man. He's out there netting
and surfing. Well, what I don't like
is these people who are
obviously crazier than me
responding to whatever I come up
with to say at a particular moment
is, you're crazy. And they say
pretty succinctly, you know, just a couple words
and it makes you really feel deflated.
You want to just kind of
go hang your head somewhere and
wish you were on your own.
What, it bothers you that the crazy people call you
crazy? Well,
you better get off the internet then, dude, because
that's all the internet is, is crazy
people calling each other crazy, as far
as I can tell.
I think they're thought narcissists.
They think that their thoughts are so damned
important that they look at it
and it's like a, and then they
want everyone else to look at it.
Well, I
like it.

I like to look at people's thoughts sometimes.
Me too. Sometimes.
I don't have any of my
own and I, I
yearn so much to have
a thought someday. A real
thought. A thought of my own.
See, then you are like Dr.
Juergens. You are his true son.
You are a thought psychic
vampire. You are, you are.
Admit it.
So that's where all your ideas come from.
You go around checking out
the loony bins and crazy farms and
you even do little interviews with
a secret handheld mic and you walk in and you say
hey man, how's it going?
They're coming for poop talk tomorrow
and they don't know. Yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay. Well look,
what time they coming?
July 5th.
You only have to
do it every few years.
You leave a tight deck in the state mental
home at the
cafeteria
for a day and then you
hire a secretary
to transcribe everything the crazy people
say and there you've got your
new church of the subgenius for the next
five years. Point. Everything you need.
Right there.
Yep.
That's the plan. Sometimes.
Sometimes.
Well, you know, we teach, we actually
teach a course in how to run
your own
cult. Mind control cult.
I don't mean a
religion. I mean a cult.
Something that
takes away your judgment.
It replaces your
real thinking power with a set of
arbitrary rules, formulae
and that you have to
memorize. We teach you
how to teach other people that
and sell them on that
on your notion.
Your one thought. You only have to have one thought.
You can steal it. But
we teach you how to turn that one thought into
a cult.
You just take that nail and hammer it
and hammer it.
Hammer it.
And hammer it.
That's what I say.
And there you go.
And then you've made something.
I think it's probably one of the most brilliant
self-help and
self-education.
A learning at home system that
nobody can deny actually
has merits far beyond its use
and its value.
And when the price of gold does
continue to skyrocket,
I think you better
learn what you need.
You need to learn by paying attention
to this important course.
It's offered by a man of great authority.
A man with wisdom far beyond
yours and mine. And he's made
plenty of money.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
And that man
is J.R. Bob Dobbs.
The saint of sales.
The living avatar of slack on this planet
Earth.
And his church, the church of the subgenius,
could indeed be the greatest joke
ever told.
If and only if Earth can make it to the punchline.
Copyright 1979.
Reverend Ivan Stang.
We're getting close, aren't we?
To the punchline.
Well, we're getting close
to the end of this show.
Well, we need a punchline.
We've got about, I don't know, what, ten minutes?
In the last five minutes, I'm going to play
a song by my son.
The son of Stang,
who has now grown
to the age of 30 years.
He's six years old.
And, uh,
and does things like
songs.
He sent me a bunch of them, and
I apply it. Now I know how my parents
felt when I saw my first underground
movie.
Our child is so depressing.
Oh, my God. He's so
grim. I'd hoped that he would
avoid those angry,
awful, lonesome thoughts.
But, uh,
they do grow up.
Most of them grow up fast,
but they don't grow up much.
This one grew up
instantly.
Actually,
from the time he was born,
he had a judgmental look.
And how old
was he when he looked up at you and said
that he was having a bad life?
Yeah, when he was five,
my son had,
he just sort of had a bad day.
A toy broke
or something. He stubbed his little,
uh,
toe, had a boo-boo or something.
And he looked at me and he said,
Dad, I'm having a very
bad life.
It was so cute.
And I said, yes, son.
And soon you will be like that
dead squirrel we saw,
electrocuted on our electric
fence. We'll all
end up like that squirrel, son.
Is that why
he's now good at everything that he
does? I don't understand how he can
do that. Well, he had a sense
of time.
Like his daddy,
he had told me independently,
in fact,
when I was driving him to college
in New York, he said
that,
like me, he is
constantly aware of the grim
reaper lurking right
behind him, breathing down his
neck, going,
I've only got a limited bunch of time, son.
Better use it right.
Which, of course, means
to repent, quit
your job, and slack off.
But it also means if your idea
of slacking off was to get certain things done,
maybe you better get cracking on them.
And, in fact, the song that my
son did is about, he has two songs
about that. The first one is called
Timeline. And we will
be playing that
very soon. It is ironic that he would
come up with a song called
Timeline, as time is
one of your major problems.
Oh, you can't imagine the irony.
The irony is of the things that these two do
at the same time. It's incredible.
It's mind-blowing.
They both started video editing
and making DVDs at the
same time. At the same age.
At exactly the same time.
I was 35 and he was 2.
And their DVDs
crossed in the mail.
Unbelievable. Actually, his movie script
is bogged down at exactly the same point
mine is. It's really... Or ours is.
Actually, I should say.
Dave is part of the
subject.
Genius movie script.
It's just been announced that Dave will
be played by Robert De Niro.
No, Robert Duvall.
Robert Duvall is going to play Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
And Robert De Niro is playing
the old Reverend Stang.
But Johnny Depp is playing the young Reverend Stang.
That's very self-deprecating.
I thought it was going to be Mel Gibson.
But...
He blew it.
And Princess We will be
played by Scarlett Johansson.
But the most... The old and young
Princess We.
She doesn't change. Oh, anyway.
Well, yeah, it's getting down near the end of show.
This show
is The Hour of Slack from the Church of the
Subgenius.
Subgenius.com
And...
Now, that's not your son playing right now, is it?
No, that's my daughter. That's your daughter.
Yes, that's actually my daughter singing
at her wedding.
She sings very well.
So, yeah, I'm going to...
Let's see. Okay, all right.
Then...
I can't tell...
The time control and the timelines
around here are all messed up.
My watch says one thing and the
clockety-clock says another thing.
But...
But I'm going to go ahead and just
run this...
This grim...
Somewhat grim or perhaps hopeful
depending on how you look at it.
Depending on whether you are, in fact,
a rewardian like most subgeniuses
or an emergentile.
Dave?
Like Reverend Stang and his son.
I'm going to leave you on, but I'm going to
take the volume down.
I want... Yes, I want it.
Okay, okay, okay. And then...

Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!


Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!

Huh!
Huh!
Huh!

Huh!
Huh!
Yesterday was yesterday.
Tomorrow's another day.
One thing that doesn't change is
that today is still today.
Huh!
















You can look back at what went wrong
Or at what might go right
But if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that I'm giving this time bullshit a fight
I can feel the timeline on me
I can feel it shortening down
I can tell you that time is telling me
That it's about time I come around
Make all the plans that you want
They can always wait
There are always unfixable problems
When it's already too late
Look back at what went wrong
Or at what might go right
But if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that I'm giving this time bullshit a fight
I can feel the timeline on me
I can feel it shortening down
I can tell you that time is telling me
That it's about time I come around
Is this where it all starts?
Or is this where it all ends?
As far as I'm concerned
There's no middle for me
I can feel the timeline on me
I can feel it shortening down
I can tell you that time is telling me




That it's about time I come around
I can feel the timeline on me
I can feel it shortening down
I can tell you the time is telling me
That it's about time I come around
I can feel the timeline on me
I can feel it shortening down
I can tell you the time is telling me

How about that?
That's delightful.
That's quite a nice hook.
Yeah, he did like five songs and put them together and sent them out to the family.
And we all went, oh my God, he's as bad as me.
And they all have vicious hooks like that.
You listen to them once and they're with you forever.
Yes, they might be giant-ish.
Took the words right out of my mouth in terms of the vocals.
Oh, really?
Just the vocals.
Just the vocals.
The hook approach, yeah.
Well, he sounds different on each song.
That one's kind of higher pitched.
He tried all kinds of little funny filtering things.
He did all the music and drum loops.
There were loops in the drum track?
The drum, I think, was all loops.
Oh, wow.
But he played the guitar and keyboards and stuff.
Yes, Zandy Smith.
I'm not going to give his website because if the subgeniuses saw what this guy does,
they'd be so jealous.
They'd want to kill me even more.
So I tend to leave the family out of this stuff, you know,
unless they want to get into it.
Yeah, they don't want daddy's friends schlepping into something
which actually makes sense and works.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
No, no, I'm sorry.
And with that, we must go because the show is over.
And that is it.
Praise Bob.
Praise Dave.
Praise Bob.
Praise Dave.
Praise Princess Wee.
Praise this tiny little thing or big I pulled from the back.
And praise the listeners.
Oh, yeah, those things.
Those things, the ghosts.
And praise Rob.
Praise Rob.
And praise the universal.
Sorry.
