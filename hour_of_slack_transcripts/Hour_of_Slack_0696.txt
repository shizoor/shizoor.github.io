Don't you see?
We're all participating in God's great experiment.
This entire universe, not just our own galaxy,
but all the galaxies that stretch to the end of the heavens,
will provide one single data point for God.
He, she, or it is searching for perfection,
for that small range of initial parameters which,
once the universe is set into motion by the transformation of energy into matter,
will evolve, over billions of years,
into one perfect harmony.
A testimony to the creator, Bob's, consummate skill.
Science fiction, the literature of the imagination,
combined.
Forces with radio, the theater of the mind,
to produce a full, rich harvest of exciting, thought-provoking drama.

So at this moment, there are countless other universes evolving,
each having been started by God, with different initial conditions.
And God has somehow slipped this church,
inside this particular evolutionary universe,
and created a unique form of Inside

A momentary process to acquire information.
And the purpose of all of this
is so that God can define some mathematical construct
associated with creation,
that will always produce a harmonious result!
What God is, and has been searching for,
is a very special, closed, dense set,
located on this mathematical hypersegment.
This special set he is seeking has the property that any of its elements, that is, any arrangement of conditions for the instant of creation chosen from within this set, will produce a universe that will eventually end in harmony.
A chaos confounds God as well. Chaos is an outgrowth of all the physical laws governing the evolution of any created universe. It prevents the accurate prediction of the outcomes of large-scale processes.
So God cannot a priori simply calculate what is going to happen in the future and therefore by analytical techniques isolate the zones of harmony.
Experimentation is the only possible way.
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.
Chaos adds tension and relax and
It is the only way is about the
fourth dimension of the dots.
The fourth dimension люблю.

And to our awesome window of time.
From Badness's How to Be Going to As胡s and about the yeti's story of false words of rattles, although oops if you find these words useful, we'd like to thank you again, for supporting this meeting with the people involved and in writing the statement above.
Well, then you add time.
Because we may travel up, down, and sideways.
Time is four.
So if we were to look at ourselves from a...
We also travel through time.
Yeah, like if we were to lick the wisdom eye, like you guys were saying a little bit.
Lick the wisdom eye, yeah.
We could, you know, go back in time.
Man, that's one that'll catch you.
And look at it from outside the planet.
Well, if you walk Wittershins around the planet fast enough, like Superman did in the movie,
you can actually go backwards through time.
I think one of my friends are from the ninth dimension.
Why nine?
Excuse me?
Why nine?
I don't think you yet appreciate the scope of God's problem.
Only a minuscule fraction of all possible universes can end up harmonious.
The natural outcome of the transformation of energy into matter is a universe with no life at all.
Or at best,
aggressive, temporary living creatures who are more destructive than constructive.
Even a small region of harmony inside an evolving universe is a miracle.
That's why the whole enterprise is such a challenge for God.
What God is looking for is a universe which, before it dies in the big crunch, has achieved total harmony.
That's not just...
That's not just...
That's not just every living species from every world working together for the mutual good,
but every subatomic particle of his creation actively participating in that harmony.
For a while, I myself couldn't comprehend the full grandeur of this concept.
Then Bob told me about a species that makes living beings out of rock and dirt, as our biblical God did,
by transmuting and rearranging the elements.
Total harmony requires that advantage.
Advanced species like us use our technological tools to transform inanimate and non-living things into creatures that contribute to the harmony.
Going back to the original question, each of the clenches of the church is part of a hierarchical intelligence gathering information throughout this particular galaxy.
Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have a single superstation, which is the Milky Way.


The Milky Way is a superstation, which we call the Prime Bob, located somewhere near their center.
The set of Prime Bobs was created by God at the same moment the universe began,
and then was deployed to learn as much as possible about the evolutionary process.
The churches, the members, and the subgeniuses, and all the other engineering constructs you have seen,
were in turn designed by the Prime Bob.
The entire activity, including what has been called the Prime Bob, is designed by God.

The universe has been going on since the first church entered your solar system years ago,
has, as its objective, the development of quantitative criteria for use by the Creator
that will enable the subsequent universes to conclude in glorious harmony,
despite the chaotic tendencies of the natural laws.
The universe is a superstation, and the Prime Bob is a superstation.

The background...
The background
music is by ESO
from the upcoming CD
Space Trance 1.
And friends, this is Hour of Slack number
696.
Seems like that'd be kind of an evil
number, doesn't it to you?
And
but yes,
who cares whether it's evil or good?
Because friends, this is a faith-healing
radio broadcast from
right here in the city of Bob,
Dallas, Texas. Bob, damn this
foul place.
Bob, ignore Dallas and concentrate
on my stock market rivals,
would you?
Oh.
Friends, I must get off.
Sometimes I'm glad the Earth
world didn't end.
And last
X-Day drill.
Other times that I wish
I was on the saucers like
Bob promised.
And I was kind of...
I've got to give this Hour of Slack out quick
because I'm working on the XX Day video
and there's so many things that have to be done
and then I remembered
what?
The CDs! I've been cranking out this whole
new series of subgenius CDs
and why not just play some of that, huh?
Instead of this ESO...
What is that all about?
I don't sell ESO CDs, but how about
let's just grab a sample
song here off of
Bob's
punctured eardrum CD.
What shall we...
How about this classic old
hymn, I Wanna Die
for Bob
number 14 on the CD?
Ah, yes.
I Wanna Die for Bob.
Please Bob,
you must kill me.
I wanna die for Bob.
I wanna die
and hold me whole
and thrill the big boys
and the nobles.
If we have to,
if we have to
Bob can make them die
and we'll all
come back.




Older men will all
come back.
Older men will all
come back.
Older men
all know the reason
why.
You think I've got another
kid?
Praise Bob.
Kill me, Bob.
I wanna die
for Bob.
I wanna die
and ask the Holy Lord.

Ah, yes, friends, that grand old song.
Ah, yes, the subgenius, the first...
Not this, crew catcher.
Ah, yes, friends, this classic, old and new Bob Songs collection.
It's called Bob's Punctured Eardrum.
And we'll have information on our information and so forth later on in the broadcast.
And, friends, we do have all manner of...
unlikely and likely tapes and materials.
I'm going to continue with the incredible reports from Dos Equis XX Day,
the second failed end of the world.
We like to look at it actually as our fifth drill for the end of the world.
By the time the world ends, friends, we're going to be the most prepared,
the most prepared cult members this lonely, distraught planet has ever seen.
And we're going to leave it and not love it.
We're just going to leave it and shove it, friends.
Oh, sorry.
Sometimes it makes me...
It makes me mad.
It makes me want to just urinate, you know?
And that's a sign that the conspiracy's ripping you off.
If you ever...
Next time you have to do that, urinate,
take that as a sign that you're being ripped off by the conspiracy.
They are getting you, friends.
Before I go any further, I wonder if I should read from this little...
Okay, I've got to set this up.
Friends, you're going to like this.
This is a lot of fun.
God, I sound...
Just like one of those conspiracy...
God, I listen to conspiracy radio, friends, while I'm cooking or whatever.
And...
Oh, God!
Oh, the smarm!
The sheer, relentless, endless smarm!
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh!
Anyway, last week...
Well, actually, today was supposed to be the end of the world.
August 11th.
There was an eclipse that was going to destroy the entire planet.
Nobody in America noticed it,
because we weren't really going to be able to see the eclipse here.
But...
Our friends in Brazil, this Brazilian magazine,
they were all upset about the end of the world,
and they interviewed me about it by email.
They asked me some questions, and I emailed the thing back.
And the other day, they're...
Issue came out on the internet with this interview with me.
It translated into Brazilian, or Portuguese.
And our good brother...
I copied that off the web and thought, well, this is great.
You can see, you know, Bob's name every now and then.
But I thought, wouldn't it be fun to translate this back into English again
and see how close it was?
Well, praise brother RevbroVT,
who, incidentally, also translates every hour,
every hour of Slack show that you hear,
into real audio for internet broadcast,
which is a kind of a time-consuming
and bandwidth-consuming job.
And thank you, RevbroVT,
from everyone here in the...
Anyway, he translated...
He translated the Brazilian article about Church of the Subgenius
back into English using a...
computer translator,
Alta Vista's Babelfish.
And here are some choice excerpts.
Well, I'm going to get to the very first,
the best one of all,
is the motto of our church.
That if she injures,
if they do not find nothing funny.
You know, our old...
Bob's motto,
let them mount up upon themselves
if they can't see the humor of it,
or them,
if they can't take a joke, right?
That if she injures,
if they do not find nothing funny.
This is the only rule of our church,
it quotes me as saying.
Anyway,
Subgenius.
The Subgenius is spelled
S-U-B-G-J-N-I-O-S.
Think about that again, friends.
S-U-B-G-J-N-I-O-S.
Subgenius.
The salvation has its price.
Established in the Texas
in the middle of the past decade,
the church of the Subgenius
cannot be most trustworthy,
but at least the internet is amused of all.
According to its adepts,
the world is to the side of chaos,
and only Bob Dobbs,
a salesman of insurances
who had an illumination spiritual
in years 60,
and became a species of messiahs,
can be a messiah.
And in saving them,
with a site in the network,
www.subgenius.com,
a publishing company,
one radio program,
and a Bem-Aziatada division
of merchandising,
that it sells until mugs of coffee
with the face of Dobbs,
the Subgenius could not be of
or of a so palpitante substance
how much this.
Of its QG in the Texas,
the reverendo Ivan Stang,
that's me,
spokesman of the church,
today said,
exclusiveness to the network
of computer science,
today said,
with exclusiveness,
oh dear,
to the network,
excuse me folks,
I'm trying to,
I wanted to put on some,
some sort of background music here.
Hold on,
oh there,
that's much better.
With exclusiveness
to the notebook of computer science,
which of the Subgenius,
with relation to the end,
and the expectations eclipse of the world,
they only draw chinfra of the figure.
First question,
how are the Subgenius
are preparing for the end of the world?
And I, my reply is,
our master, Bob Dobbs,
foresaw that the world went to finish
in 5 of July of 1998,
I should do this in my real accent,
and we in prepare them for this,
for about 20 years,
sinning of all the ways that we could imagine.
The problem was that the world did not finish,
and Dobbs foresaw that it would finish again
in the following year in 5 of July.
It did not finish,
and it seems now that it's said
that of 2,000 people do not pass.
All end of world,
we organize the festival X day drill.
As of the year that comes as third,
it will be XXX day drill.
Note, XXX,
it is the sorting that the North Americans use
to identify,
we must live and transfer to one's last,
to become
sentinel psychod As a trial for extreme fifty,
owej trouble,
be bueno,
worse of the one that he is does not go to be same and he says well what do you
find that goes to happen in the end of the world and I said he who to order
$30 for the Church of the subgenie Nios goes to try the ecstasy Eterno already
the infidels will be fried by the ray laser of flying disks of the final
judgment amen the interviewer says a what Bob Dobbs has to say on this and I
quoted him that if she injures if they do not find nothing funny that's the only
rule of our church and he says what what he says what will you be doing on the
day 11 of August and I said I go be of I in the stock market exchange buying
actions of companies who sell kits of survival and dehydrated food
you
boys you to get away from that being a
yes you said that before just because they had known
where the book is called under well at least in history
you and that me why I do it have input of biblical
rythme that
in devenir
whitlington
going to go to places where the eclipse is happening and tell them that if they don't
give us gold, Bob will eat the sun. And he says, how do you advise us to dress in the
hour of the end of the world? She is necessary to be the character or it gives to wait the
end of the world alone of underwear and stockings? And I said, seen of the skill that to want.
It only takes care so that when the world will be finishing, its underwears are in the
certain place. So all will be well if the planet will not be reached by no asteroid
or be attacked by foreigners or aliens or dominated for the Antichrist. People give
a skill to finish with it for we ourselves. In other words, if we don't, who cares if
the aliens destroy the planet?
Or the asteroids? People will be perfectly capable of destroying the earth themselves.
Thank you.
And I think one of my friends are from the ninth dimension. Why nine? Why ninth? Because
he's not good enough to be from the tenth. Oh, you know, we're only as fast as our slowest
man. You guys talking at the same time slow. No, you got to stop smoking so much pot. I
know. Really? It's not such a bad thing. Go ahead.
You can't throw up a pot of coffee. Go brew some coffee.
It's probably better for you to smoke.
And smoke it if you want.
Yeah, you can smoke some coffee.
The coffee drinks the pot of foul water. That big porcelain throne is full of water. It's
a pot full of water.
You have to turn your computer down.
Yeah, turn your computer down. Unless you bought the brand new George Forskine sandwich
brewer in a cup, it makes a perfect sandwich in a cup every time with just a little bit
of thermal water and pickles and cheese, whatever you want, throw in there. It comes out the
other end like a sandwich.


It's like a deli sandwich. It also stops your computer from all...
Hello?
Yeah.
Whatever.
I can't believe it.
They were doing it to it.
They were having inter...
Yeah.
They were having coitus with their computers.
Man, you can't kill them tonight. Did you ever step on them? They just keep running.
They're like little bugs.
I stepped on that one three times. It just kept running around, man.
Oh, and if you think they're dead and you watch them for a while, they'll sort of pull
all their entrails back in stuff, man, and sew it all up and fly.
They fly away.
Well, that's what I did once.
Just as if they've never been squished.
I hit one with a hammer, and the little bits were all over the kitchen floor, and I sat
there long enough. You have to sit there really long and quiet.
For hours sometimes.
Yeah, and turn the fan off because you don't want your scent. If they get a whiff of your
scent, then they won't do this.
Stocking bugs.
Yeah. And then they just sort of come together little by little.

The little dots start reassembling, moving towards each other.
Yeah, they're starting...
If they've got one extremity that can move or push, they'll slow down.
Slowly put themselves right back in the game.
This is ESO, recorded live at XX Day 1999.
Friends, I think some of you have a sickness tonight. I don't know what it might be, but
if you are prepared, you can do it.
And to come forward, I will lay my hands on you. I'm fully licensed by the state of
New Jersey, Nevada, New York, and now Pennsylvania, to not only heal, but sicken you. But I refuse
to talk about it.
If your God is really bad, it's the only one you have. You want to take away the pain,
or go a-walking in the rain. Watch the flowers go to bed, or ask the man inside the head,
or ask the man inside the house.



If you're scared, never have to leave. All you gotta do is believe.
There is a calcium in the land, friends, or perhaps it's a lack of calcium. No, that's...
There's a great cancer in the land. That's what it is.
I'm not saying that there's a cancer in the land. I'm saying that there's a great cancer

in the land, and that is infesting a cancer that infests not only you, the subgenic, but
also pinks and people of other different hues. For instance, the purple. We all know this
evacuated polybius crew is fully and completely and totally un-infested.
All you gotta do is dream. Your body's gonna start to feel. Finger drifts and holding fire.
Everlasting sweet desire. If you're mad at what the doctor say,
leave a man to steal away. Miracles, they come for you.
And miracles, they come for you.
Can I put my hands on you? Can I put my hands on you?
They say that Jesus Christ came and lived among men, but I think Jesus Christ came and lived among women.
Or perhaps a nice, beautiful, young, but noble monkey. Thirteen years old, beautiful, but noble monkey.
Little red hair, kind of a cute little buck-toothed smile, little squiggly pink daughter hair.
I didn't think Jesus was capable of loving another human!
I don't know why I love this. It's a pain to be loved like this!
You can make you understand. All you gotta do is take his hand.
Remember what someone said. Ask the man inside the head.
Finger drifts and holding fire.
Everlasting sweet desire.
Can I put my hands on you? Can I put my hands on you?
So they say judgment is coming.
What I prefer to think, a fiery form of flatulence is coming.
Or perhaps an incarnate vision of the Buddha with his eyes crossed.
That's what I'm looking for, friends.
Or a woman with a very large, very large...
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
I sing in colors.
My mother is God.
My father is God.
My brothers, my sisters, all are God.
God to the right. God to the left.
God overhead.
Christ, encounter of the fourth kind.
But now I know I haveANA.
O tear it, O handful of cracks.

What a great day.
I like a happy reunion in a heartbreak.
God Sabrina passengers from saliva clearly.
I walk on my bare feet.
That's how many times I cry.

the end times
are near but there's
nothing to fear
if you
just send us a
dollar
get ready
get set
prepare for
the launch of the
bleeding head
of a
ball
remember
the motto
perform the
salute
slack off and
study the
pamphlets
and if you
should falter
then look to the sky
cause Bob's
always so
clear
nearby
there's a pipe
in the sky
and I'll
follow
you
anywhere
through the
sun
page
of
the
day
through
American
time
there's
a pipe
in the
sky
and we
can do it
it's a
great idea
it's a great idea
it's a great idea
it's a great idea
to be a saint
in the church
of the subgenius
I mean she's like
the perfect
woman
she's a
sex pot
obviously
I mean a really
sexy gal
smart
go get her
but most of all
she has managed
to destroy
two
count them
two sides
of the conspiracy
at once
by doing
nothing more
than following
her own path
of least resistance
right
and she's
I know that
when things
get hard
she's
she's really
really tough
when
she knows
how to
let's not
dwell on that
on the
linguistic
content
of that whole
routine there
Claude
okay well I just
want to say that
you know when
times are hard
she knows how
to pull through
I don't know
what I'm saying
but anyway
yeah
so
I mean I know
that she feels
like she's been
shafted
I think
you know
obviously
every year
the conspiracy
tries to
try some new
ploy to distract
humanity
from the fact
that judgment
is on the way
right
that they are
going to be
punished
for their
slacklessness
and their
inability
to even
comprehend
what Bob's
selling
them
so
you know
every year
we see
movies like
what was
Independence Day
in which
which came out
on July 5th
just like
Bob's
end of the world
prophecy
only
the humans
beat the aliens
using America
online
and then
what men in black
the next year
and then the next year
what was that
asteroid
or you know
Armageddon
Armageddon
one of those
it got to the point
where I didn't even
watch them
as the end of the world
becomes closer and closer
they'll come out
with one of those movies
every month
and then every week
and every minute
and finally
the big Hollywood movie
will say the exact
same thing
that Bob's been saying
all along
and then it'll
really happen
and at that point
all those
disbelieving
pinks and
corporate
sellout
Barbies and
cans
humans
meat
food tubes
blind
earth
peg-legged
three-dimensional
people
will suddenly
look up
and go
what
can I
blew it
because I was
so
because I chose
to believe
the conspiracy
media
instead of
Clyde Lewis's
talk show
hmm
I think that
in 6,000 years
I think this whole thing
with the 6,000 years
is there
to test us
because of the fact
that by that time
Bob will be
a huge
huge
um
deity
in the realm of deities
if he isn't already
there's no time
for all fallacy
when he ate
the cunt's
beer of candies
but for the most part
he won't let you down
when you find yourself
dressed for time
just shove and bob
and your mind
will unlock
cause you have
a piece of the rock
there's a pipe
in the sky
there's a pipe
in the sky
and I'll follow
with any way
through the sun
which will
fly
through the sun
and the sea
and the moon
through the
the wrecking

through the wrecking

uh diaphragms
I used to date
a
no no no

that's it
do you remember any?
will they help
anything at all?
of course

it was a jackal-headed

akimbo
a king seated

a drip of gold
a chippin nose
uplifted thusly
all engraved
on a pyramid
of massive size
with the body
of a lion
the paws that refresh

and the head of a fox
that pyramid

just fill out this card
oh thanks
oh look it's dirty
somebody's already used it
there's a name on it

I'm not really Mr. and Mrs. John Smith
oh that's okay
I'm not Joe
but he's not Ed
hey Bill
suddenly I heard a door
squeak open behind me
strange
I don't have a door
and they repossessed the squeak
only one man had the gall
to carry his own sound effects
I'm not Joe











is that gall I smell?
it's oil of anchovy, Dengar
have a tin
so Rocky Rococo
we meet again
no we met again last week
this is now
metaphysics gives me a headache, Rococo
open the tin, Dengar
there's a prize inside
anchovies
unroll the green one
half a fin
howdy, Abe
been a long time since you've seen
an honest man, eh, Dengar?
and the other one?
the other half
is waiting for you
at the end of the job
yeah?
what do I have to do?
nothing
nothing?
I'm not kidding
just file yourself under inactive
and remember I wasn't here
you never saw me
what a pleasant thought
I hate you, Dengar
can it, Rococo
and you can take your smelly little friends with you
you got anchovies all over my sharkskin suit
hey, looking good
I'm sorry, Dengar

there you go
the world ends
the world ends

and you may die
and in fact that's being very optimistic
you in fact will die
that's one of Bob's predictions
that definitely will come true
and the point is
okay, the world ends tomorrow
and it very well might
you never know
it might end just for you
have you been
have you lived today
as if this was your last day on earth?
or
probably not
or
alternately
have you lived today
as if
you could live forever
and had all the time in the world
because if you aren't doing either one of those
you're wasting all that time
blowing it off
go for everything or else blow it all
and but
live like there's no tomorrow
or that there is only tomorrow
but
we don't care
unlike other religions
we're not trying to save your soul
we would like to get your money
and we'll save your soul as a side effect of that
and that there's no problem
but who cares whether the world ends?
friends, we're religious nuts
are we subgeniuses
gonna let the Jehovah's Witnesses out kook us?
I think not!
nay!
I don't care if I have to come to this campground
and wait for the world to end
every damn July 5th
for the next
800,000 years
until the year 8661
which happens to be 1998 turned upside down
and that may have been the
and sure
are we afraid to look like a bunch of superstitious idiots?
friends
as I understand it
reality itself
is one big superstition
that's been the point of half of these
big mouth shamans
and philosophers
and so forth
all along
and you know
let those who want to scoff
go ahead and scoff
be backsliders
putting that knife in Bob Dobbs' back
and just twisting it!
alright we have to pause here
for a brief message
and we'll be back in a moment
listen
listen
a new Admiral Stereo is precision engineered
to free you from stereo
so that no matter where you sit
a twist of the balance indicator knob
always adjusts the sound smack dab in the center
the acoustic result of the finest custom components
all perfectly matched and balanced
so that you get full frequency range
smack dab in the center
for sounds like this
and speaking of jokes
I heard this funny joke the other day
about the Y2K bug
it was this
it went kinda like
hey did you hear that the dark ages
were started by the Y1K bug
ha ha ha
well that was a funny joke when I first heard it
but really
if you look into the history of it friends
the dark ages
were really started
by the Y0K bug
and we don't have anything against it
it's not really the Y0K bug's fault
I mean
you know we don't have anything against insects in this church
in fact some of us are insect sexuals
we're into bug porn
and friends to us the Y2K bug is just more bug porn
but the pincoots are running around like a bunch of ninnies
threatening their precious false slap device
they're all gonna get shut down
crash out
and fail to reboot
in the year 2000
they should be so goddamn lucky my friends
oh they want the end of the world so bad
I'm afraid that what's really gonna happen on January 1st
some gas pump in Idaho won't work
and 150 white supremacists will kill each other fighting over it
until somebody plugs it in
oh but they want the end of the world
they're musking for the end of the world friends
because of course when it happens
they get saved
and it proves that all the rest of us were dumbasses
isn't it nice that we aren't like that?
yeah
but it doesn't matter friends because we're outta here
we're outta here before the Y2K bug
we're outta here on the Y1.9999
bug friends
that's what Bob really did
before any of those bugs
and now the YKs arrive
we're KY'd up
we're gonna slide home free
day after tomorrow
we're gonna slide home free baby
on the X next night
X Y Z
X year zero
ah yes
spread Y for the final ride
because the Xs are coming friends
and you are too
they didn't take us seriously last time
hell half a U didn't take us seriously
didn't take Dobbs prophecy seriously
but this time we've learned our lesson
we can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space
we can't even rely on Bob
we have to learn how to escape earth
without being dependent on the conspiracy
or any extra terrestrials or salesmen
sure send in your 30 bucks but
build your own ship
you may not be able to do it
you may not have through
but just recover your ass
build your own ship
even better go buy hangar engineers
area 51 or Cape Canaveral
or studio 54
and steal your own ship
ah yes
and scrape your own fuel
hang on I gotta put my glasses on because
do you think Bob even has a skull left
after so many drill marks and pointy things going in there
well I won't cause him some pain
but start alright
a חwide
some other town
where in town
or what I hear
he'll never know
claimed to make his sons
서�
Is that what we're going to do?
Bob has no feelings, and we know that because we've experienced that for the last three years.
You can't have any sort of sympathy for humanity at all to have jived so consistently and so brutally.
He has great love, vast love, which he expresses physically.
I think it's half that.
Ah, it's Friday.
I was here, and then the fog took me away.
Don't hit me.
Friday's child.
Right.
He's twice as bad, twice as naughty.
Is that indeed the Doc Mojo on the other line there?
Well, who the hell do you think he would be?
I don't think anybody would start talking explosives except for you and me.
Hey, we've got another one here.
Let's see who's there.
I got it down now.
No one, I didn't lose anyone.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Sounds like it's coming from the audience.
Yeah, she's cute.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, there's a picture on the Internet of her dressed in.
I waste all my money on pot, as you insulted me before.
Oh, wait, you don't have a computer?
No.
Oh, you're not allowed to listen to the show.
Oh, don't say that.
No, no, that's a lie.
He's being mean because...
In eighth grade?
We use the computers to double the potency of the pot.
Oh.
Yeah.
Have you ever had coyotes with a computer, buddy?
They smoke the fop, and then they smoke...
Return it back into your head.
They convert back into antimatter?
Yes, yes, they do.
You smoke fat, man.
Yeah, so...
You smoke the stuff that runs out of your nose.
Get somewhere that...
Antimatter to us.
Antimatter.
He's battling on like a baby again.
We've been doing that for billions of years.
Tell us something new.
Really, antimatter is no...
It's nothing to us.
Where'd the girl go?
What about panty matter?
He cares about...
Where'd the girl...
Where'd that girl go?
Pantymatter, that's what got him thinking.
Pantymatter.
Pantymatter is what got him going.
No, it's the pantymatter.
Gerbil discovered that pantymatter is as a recursive time stream
by which it is constantly existing and expusing
from itself, of itself.
Into itself.
Into itself.
Past the wall light.
Into the rocket butt.
Well, you see, the pantymatter neutrinos have no mass,
and that has a lot to say about the fate of the universe.
It's going to implode a lot sooner than we were counting on.
And it's going to implode into someone's cervix
if we don't get those panties down.
And I just feel so good.
Ma'am, that's exactly what you're counting on, isn't it?
Well, if you're the kind of person who likes to scratch your fingernails
against the blackboard, I suppose it is.
Yeah.
Imagine that.
Antimatter panties.
That was a great man.
The entire universe is imploding into your cervix.
There's got to be a reason.
Antimatter panties.
I remember those guys, but the one guy died from heroin O.D.,
and the other guy tried to jump on the third whale of the subway,
and I don't know what happened.
He imploded or something?
Oh, that was a long time ago.
Wasn't that when you lived in New York, we came and visited?
The guitar player was swallowed by a whale.
Yeah, it was the guitar player that got swallowed.
Was swallowed by a whale, yeah.
A whale or something.
A Levian thing.
He had written in the subway, Leviathan or something like that,
and they found him out in New York Harbor.
He'd been chewed by a whale.
They cut open one of those orcas, and inside its stomach was that guitar player.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I thought they just found parts of him.
He was a guitar god.
But any guitar player who dies that way has got to be the greatest.
But why is he any better than the other guy?
He died cooler.
And the panty matters.
That dictates talent of guitar players is how cool you die.
Whales cannot wear panties.
But what about the guy that died from an H.O.D. and stuff?
Whales will be.
You know, he was a sensitive artist and stuff like that.
He'd taken up I&J.
Friday, you could answer this question.
The nasal flute was probably never really tuned for that kind of ear.
What is your question, Melvin?
Well, ever since I was a little boy, I liked stories about mermaids.
Because mermaids were always depicted as being pretty girls from the waist up
who didn't wear shirts and had their hair covering their breasts.
And, well, what I always wanted to know is,
did you have to scale them to, you know, to have your...
To know them.
Yeah, to...
No, they have, rather like a fish or a frog, they have a cloaca.
A cloaca?
Yeah.
What the hell's that?
It's a quarter-inch thick neoprene condiment.
It works just fine.
Yeah.
Oh, that's what a cloaca is?
It's a quarter-inch thick neoprene condiment.
Could you cut yourself?
If she got to thrashing around, I say she, what...
With the scales, right?
That comes with the vacuum cleaner.
No, it doesn't.
The scales get smaller around the edges.
Does that come with the vacuum cleaner attachment?
Oh, so they're smoother around the...
Yeah, it's smooth.
It's like a whale blow.
Oh, you can hook that right up to the ports in that case.
Oh, well, in that case, whoa!
Yeah, you can hook it up to the decompression port, Dave.
Yeah.
No wonder my appliances are talking to me.
But don't put in the rocket butt.
No, when you're in your spaceship...
A mermaid with rocket butt would probably be a terrifying demon, uber demon,
who would destroy the sea.
And the stars would be in the sky themselves.
All at once.
So you're talking about an actual egg-sant mermaid...
And it would burn bad.
...which can crash its fins and has a portable attachment for doing the floors?
It would really hurt when you peed.
Yeah, it hurts a lot when you pee.
What the hell are you talking about?
What, you pee these things out?
We don't...
Hello?
Oh, Arden.
Who's here?
It's amazing how these things can start growing through.
Who's this?
Avon calling.
Go ahead, ding-dong lady.
Give us a pie in the face.
Oh, we gotta get the solar image, today's solar image up on the screen.
The sun is kind of like falling apart.
Last week...
You're watching it.
Well, yeah, last week we thought the sun was being eaten up from inside out by black holes.
Last week we thought that the world was going to end, friends, but I think everything will
be okay after all.
Somehow or another, I just discovered that the main tape deck that I'm working on has
just lost its...
God, don't...
Don't...
Don't...
Don't...
It's not supposed to be singing?
That's ESO live at X-day.
What I meant to put in here was...
Well, anyway, friends, I wanted to give credit for what all...
All what we've been listening to, and of course, what we just heard was some ESO radio, Einstein's
secret orchestra, Swamp Radio, live on the phone at WCSB in beautiful Cleveland, and,
which is on every Thursday night.
And you can also hear it on the Internet from www.wcsb.org.
You can also, well, we've been playing tons of ESO tonight.
Where's my little list here?
ESO is in the background.
We also heard Einstein Secret Orchestra backing up me at the XX Day Devival just a month ago in July.
That was the preaching with music.
We heard a little bit of clips before that from the Bran Flakes
and also a tiny clip from something Susie the Flusie put together, various religion-oriented things.
There was a recording of yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,
and I'm sure you'll be able to hear it.
It's Starwood and Einstein Secret Music.
We heard two versions of the Firesign Theater.
We heard the Firesign Clones, which is a group in Ohio doing covers of the old Firesign Theater album,
a really old one,
and the actual real Firesign Theater doing a fairly recent album called The Three Faces of Al.
We also heard a clip from Clyde Lewis's Ground Zero radio show out of Salt Lake City, Utah.
It's a great show about conspiracies.
That's also on the internet, Clyde Lewis.
The song Hymn 999, or Pipe in the Sky, is by G. Don Truby,
and I think I mentioned it was Frederick Thordendal at the very, very beginning of the half-hour.

And friends, everything is on the subgenius website at www.subgenius.com.
Oh, yes, and, uh...
I'm going to go back to playing our new CD.
This is from Bob's Punctured Eardrum, the new CD,
and I'm not even sure which one I want to put on except to take us out of here, except this.

Universal Force
Galaxy's a number in a billion
They're all there for you
If you're the boss to see it through
And light the fire of truth
Will you ever let go to your instinct for no bone
Will you wander through the wilderness afar
You escape on the day July 5th soon
Will you wander through the wilderness afar
Will you wander through the wilderness afar
Will you wander through the wilderness afar
Will you wander through the wilderness above?
Will you wander through the wilderness above?
5,000 years in incubation.
All kind of panty weight.
Anti-panty matter.
Who's your guys?
You know what I mean?
I mean, just think of your average god or archon deity.
Just can't hold...
Oh, listen to Dave.
He's talking real big.
Well, I mean, I don't want to be, you know, getting a car accident on the way home or
nothing like that there, but, you know, just what have they done lately for me?
Or you?
Or anybody?
I mean, just think of your average deity.
We'll take the one we got right now.
God has given me unto my enemies, and has taken my enemies and bound them before me
and handed me a whip.
Oh, man.
Oh, well, see, now that would be a very...
And I have enjoyed myself.
Okay, good job.
And Steve's a-comin'!
And the pigs are...
