00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,660
slack is that coming to cleveland oh eventually i'm sure it will in fact

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,380
audience will gather

29
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,420
for them

30
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,440
not

31
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,120
coming around

32
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,440
yeah

33
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,760
right

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,120
well

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,340
there won't be

36
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,020
watching

37
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:18,500
what are you going to do hot culture

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,720
if it doesn't support

39
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,220
focuses on the old days.

40
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,600
Sadly enough, I mean,

41
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,160
I gave them footage of this station.

42
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,420
I went out of my way to make sure

43
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,720
there was an interview with Lonesome Cowboy

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,260
Dave, even if I had to do it.

45
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,720
They didn't use any of that stuff

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,520
that I shot. And it all

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,780
focuses on the first 10 years

48
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,800
basically.

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,320
Although it ties in

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,600
what's going on now and the

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,700
terrible need for slack, especially

52
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,500
lately. Oh my God, yes.

53
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,360
The last few years.

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,240
So it turned out

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,160
really, really good.

56
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
It moves real fast.

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,420
We've already

58
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,380
been talking to people from the station

59
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,280
about showing it.

60
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,080
It's still in film festivals.

61
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,340
But it came out pretty

62
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,200
good. I'm hoping it'll be on Netflix

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,280
or Amazon or something. That'd be sweet.

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,820
Also, I'd like to see if our

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,600
Cleveland Sim and Tech

66
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,560
or Cedar Lee.

67
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,500
But like I say, I still

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,240
don't even have a

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,920
copy of it.

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,200
Okay.

71
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,380
I can look at an old cut.

72
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,480
It's not as good as

73
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,020
the new improved version.

74
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,520
Okay. Well, I'm very excited to hear

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,060
more about it. I'm sure you'll keep us all

76
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,360
up to date on the goings on.

77
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,100
Yeah.

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,360
It was really fun. My grandkids

79
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,000
got to see the movie. My

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,480
10 and 8 year old grandkids.

81
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,400
Oh, wow. Yeah. When Bob

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,960
got shot, they said, was that real?

83
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,580
I said, no. And then they said,

84
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,860
is any of it real?

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,940
Do you guys really do shows? Yeah. Yeah.

86
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,300
That part's real. But the shootings

87
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,000
aren't. None of the shootings aren't.

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,420
There were a couple more shootings

89
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,160
later on that were also fake.

90
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,320
Well, I'm actually

91
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,380
going into your time now.

92
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,660
You're listening to WCSV Cleveland.

93
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
I'm just going to put up this dub music for a little bit.

94
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,760
If you want to switch it. I'll just use that part.

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,220
Okay. Yeah. I'll keep all that.

96
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,380
Okay.

97
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm glad I had the recorder on.

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,180
Okay. Hang on one second.

99
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,460
I hope the dogs

100
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,520
are listening. I hope the dogs are

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,080
listening too. Yeah.

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,460
They can only hear it off my little

103
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,380
computer speakers. Not the big

104
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,440
speakers. So the sound, they may not

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,520
recognize it. Okay. Here we

106
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,340
go. Our slack.

107
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,060
The subgenius.

108
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,500
Power of

109
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,760
slack.

110
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,220
Slack.

111
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,740
well

112
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,380
footage

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,560
I say, Mr.

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Speaker,

115
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,680
I've had a speech in-soak

116
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,800
this six months and it has

117
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
swelled me.

118
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:57,000
like a drowned horse. If I don't deliver it, I shall burst and smash the windows.

119
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:06,380
The gentleman from Subgenius talks of summing up the merits of the question, but I'll sum up my own.

120
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:14,180
In one word, I'm a screamer, and have got the roughest racking horse, the prettiest sister,

121
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:23,700
the surest rifle, and the ugliest dog in the district. I'm a little the savagest critter you ever did see.

122
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,760
My father can whoop any man in Tennessee, and I can whoop my father.

123
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,660
I can outspeak any man in this church, and give him two hours start.

124
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:43,460
I can run faster, dive deeper, stay under longer, and come out drier than any chap.

125
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:52,000
I can go to this side of the big swamp. I can outlook a panther, and out stare a flash of lightning,

126
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,180
tote a steamboat on my back, and play it rough and tumble with a lion, and an occasional kick from a zebra.

127
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,800
To sum all up in one word, I am a horse.

128
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,420
Goliath was a pretty hard colt, but I could choke it.

129
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,160
I can take the risk of a horse, and I can take the risk of a lion.

130
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:20,400
I can drag off, frighten the old folks, astonish the natives, and beat the normals all to smash.

131
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:28,660
Make nothing of sleeping under a blanket of snow, and don't mind being frozen more than a rotten apple.

132
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,080
Congress allows lemonade to the members, and it charged under the head of stationery.

133
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,960
I move also that whiskey be allowed under the item of fuel.

134
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:54,740
For bitters, I can suck away at a noggin of aqua fortis, sweetened with brimstone, stirred with a lightning rod, and skimmed with a hurricane.

135
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,040
I've soaked my head and shoulders in Salt River so much that I'm always corned.

136
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:12,380
I can walk like an ox, run like a fox, swim like an eel, and yell like a subgenius, make love like a mad bull,

137
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:19,360
and swallow a pink hole without choking, if you butter his head and pin his ears back.

138
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,920
This song is for her, you know.

139
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,260
I am a bull man.

140
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,360
I am a bull man.

141
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,360


142
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,360


143
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm a bull man.

144
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,460
I'm a bull man.

145
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:50,480
Bob.

146
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:58,720
After years and years of trying to catch Bob, we were going to kill Bob so we could make him look alive.

147
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,600
Bob must be about 15 years old now.

148
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,500
We gotta kill Bob while he's still alive.

149
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,060
I tried to shake off my feelings for Bob, but it was impossible.

150
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,620
Must catch Bob.

151
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,940
Aw, who am I kidding?

152
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,440
I haven't caught Bob in 15 years.

153
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,360
Find Bob?

154
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,660
I mean, catching Bob is one thing, but why do we have to kill him?

155
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,440
I don't like the idea of stuffing Bob either.

156
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:29,380
7,000 gigawatt radio signal activates an electronic pulse attuned to Bob's brain waves.

157
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,920
All Pete has to do is find Bob, and this baby will do the rest.

158
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,420
It's genius.

159
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,280
No wonder we haven't found Bob.

160
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,220
With extinction staring Bob in the face,

161
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,620
the only question was, could I save him?

162
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,320
Let me get this straight.

163
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,680
If I don't catch Bob, I'll be famous?

164
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,500
Bob is a fish.

165
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
You and I are fishermen.

166
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,580
I hope you appreciate this, Bob.

167
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,820
Next time will be too late.

168
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,700
Bob will be gone by then.

169
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,560
Bob.

170
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,040
When it comes to Bob, there's only one rule.

171
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,700
There are no rules.

172
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,540
We're talking big bad Bob here.

173
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,500
Great day to be alive, eh, Rigley?

174
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:10,720
Yeah.

175
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,200


176
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,120
Yes, you bet.

177
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,960
Unless, of course, you're Bob.

178
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,540
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

179
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,760
I'm sure it would mean a lot to Dad if you were here when we finally bag old Bob.

180
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,480
Bob was out of luck.

181
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,880
The Bob hunt had begun.

182
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,300
Bob.

183
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,140
But poor Bob wouldn't get the chance.

184
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,140
A feeling that Bob deserved a better fate than ending up hot glued to a piece of plywood.

185
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,860
Come on, Bob.

186
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,140
Make me famous.

187
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,180
Where's Bob?

188
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,960
I saw him on the way over.

189
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,140
He told me to say hi.

190
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,580
We're not against you, Don.

191
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,460
We're just for Bob.

192
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:51,980
Bob?

193
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,940
Bob?

194
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Sure.

195
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,740
Bob.

196
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,760
Bob.

197
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,080
Bob.

198
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:06,940


199
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,280


200
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,260
Bob.

201
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,940
Bob.

202
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,600
Bob.

203
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,620
Bob.

204
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,180
Bob.

205
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,560
Bob.

206
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,800
Bob.

207
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,500
Bob.

208
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,980
Bob.

209
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:31,940
Bob.

210
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,680
Bob.

211
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,380
Bob.

212
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,400
Bob.

213
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,280
Ya...

214
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,660
Bob.

215
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,280
In general, the two of us are always together

216
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,920
Now, the question is, what's the time?

217
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,300
One, two, three, two, three, four

218
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,480
What are we doing?

219
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,160
Because he started with experiments in the backyard

220
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,380
And Jack passes as a little boy when he wouldn't go too far

221
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,980
But the trouble really started when he found another young ascender

222
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,460
Because together they were ready to reach the sky

223
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,880
So the two of them began to play around about a year

224
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,180
Six, close six

225
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Jack is going from a local crowd of company

226
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,580
A military gathering at the Avial Rock

227
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,880
It's a sign of bliss

228
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,280
But the both of you are no one else at the chief

229
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,480
How high?

230
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,300
How high?

231
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,920
Does your rocket fly?

232
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,000
Does your rocket fly?

233
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,980
You've got to be careful boy, as you chase money

234
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,740
Except for the one that I find

235
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,960
You've got to be careful boy

236
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,340
You've got to be careful boy, as you set the world on fire

237
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,300
Set the world on fire

238
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,460
Set the world on fire

239
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,440
A loyal follower of Mr. Alistair Crowley

240
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,060
He took a oath to be a magistrate, really

241
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,540
His friendly house in Pasadena was notorious for the orgies

242
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,140
Every night at the city of Mysteries

243
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,380
So when his company became the famous Jakey Laboratories

244
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,600
His reputation made it difficult to proceed

245
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,280
And after one of his ecological ceremonies

246
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,140
He found his body in a pile of blood and debris

247
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,880
How high does your rocket fly?

248
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,680
You better be careful

249
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,360
Where's your rocket fly?

250
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,680
You can't smell it

251
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,860
You can't find it

252
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,760
Set the world on fire

253
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,780
Set the world on fire

254
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,340
You better be careful

255
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,400
Set the world on fire

256
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:37,880
How high does your rocket fly?

257
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,780
How high does your rocket fly?

258
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,440
You better be careful

259
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,800
Where's your rocket fly?

260
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,680
You can't smell it

261
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,900
Set the world on fire

262
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,860
You can't find it

263
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,340
We better be careful boys

264
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,160
We better be careful

265
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,020
Set the world on fire

266
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,480
Set the world on fire

267
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,820
Keep them up and down

268
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:02,580
Love is the love

269
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,040
Love is the love

270
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:15,860
Keep them up and down

271
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:15,880
We better be careful

272
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,720
Set the world on fire

273
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,200
Set the world on fire

274
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,520
Set the world on fire

275
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:32,520
Fly me through the moon

276
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:44,680
Fly me through the moon

277
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,300
Thank you.

278
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,420
Thank you.

279
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,280
Thank you.

280
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,720
Thank you.

281
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,580
Thank you.

282
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:06,820
Thank you.

283
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,380
That was delightful.

284
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,100
Delightful.

285
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,200
Yeah.

286
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
I wish I could sing like that.

287
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,640
Not everything's singing, you know.

288
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,680
The only important thing these days is rhythm and melody.

289
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,140
Rhythm.

290
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,120
And melody.

291
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,520
And melody.

292
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,460
And of all my friends

293
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,960
You've been the best to me

294
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
Soon will be the day

295
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,540
When I repay you handsomely

296
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,680
Broken heart's a heart to mend

297
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,400
Nor have my share

298
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,780
But life just carries on

299
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,440
Even when I'm not there

300
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,160
I'm not going to give in

301
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,300
Situation I win

302
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,380
Rush for a change of atmosphere

303
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,180
I can't go on so I give in

304
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,520
Gotta get myself right out of here

305
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,780
Situation I win

306
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,760
Rush for a change of atmosphere

307
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,620
I can't go on so I give in

308
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,840
Gotta get myself right out of here

309
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,740
I gotta get myself right

310
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,620
Gotta get myself right

311
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,580
Gotta get myself right

312
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,060
Gotta get myself right

313
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,620
out of here

314
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,240
Gotta get myself right

315
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,240
Gotta get myself right

316
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,900
Gotta get myself right

317
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,040
Out of here

318
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,680
Dog communism

319
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,980
And now

320
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,280
Hopefully

321
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,240
There will be

322
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,520
Lonesome cowboy Dave

323
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,260
I hope

324
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,980
Oh

325
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,820
Where is he

326
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,600
But if it's not Dave

327
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,860
Who could it be

328
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,280
Hello hello

329
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
Mutilage

330
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,780
Mutilage

331
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,900
Mutilage

332
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,360
Are you

333
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,840
Are you

334
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,300
Musilage tonight

335
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,520
I'm flavored

336
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,560
Well flavored indeed tonight

337
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,000
Took over 300 pounds of

338
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,980
Escawhiskers to bring this down

339
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,760
To its original

340
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,420
State

341
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,420
That's very

342
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,640
Musilaginous

343
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,080
It's like a caramelized onion in so many ways

344
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,700
That we don't

345
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,020
Yeah and that's the theme of

346
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,060
This show tonight caramelized onions

347
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,540
Oh wait well

348
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,240
I guess that's as good as any

349
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,020
Caramelized onion Musilage

350
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,620
Dave it's great to hear you over the WCSB system

351
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,560
It sure is

352
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,280
It's amazing to hear you be able to pick up

353
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,100
Without causing injury to yourself

354
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,340
And others around you

355
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,220
Yeah I hope the dogs

356
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,860
Are handling this well

357
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,820
They've been left alone for the first time

358
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,520
In the Cleveland Heights

359
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,720
Slacker Mansion

360
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,200
Well before they cause any demons

361
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,780
They're sure to check out every freaking

362
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,100
Square inch of the place

363
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,140
Well they've been

364
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,220
On the show for a year or two

365
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,800
Two years now but

366
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,320
Princess We hasn't been

367
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,380
This is the first time we've had her here for

368
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,080
A long time cause she had to stay in

369
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,280
Ohio all that time

370
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,320
But I'm back back baby

371
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,260
And Brother Love

372
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,100
Is here too

373
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,460
Hey who's Brother Love

374
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,900
He's the guy that does African

375
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,880
Abstract show half the time

376
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,980
Before our slot

377
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,620
I'm sorry I forgot

378
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,720
Quite alright

379
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,760
Well I remember I actually

380
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,800
Remember but I forgot

381
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,960
What the Soviet context was

382
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,440
Remember back in 1952

383
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,940
When we had the imperialists

384
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,780
By the testicles

385
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,220
What do you mean back then

386
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,320
Oh wait no

387
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,100
Now the imperialists have us by them

388
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,080
That's right

389
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,400
No that was the band the imperialists

390
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,080
Hey Dave I have to do some credits real quick

391
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,260
Cause I didn't before

392
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,820
And

393
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,540
There were

394
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,960
Several cuts involving dogs

395
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,680
Those were all by Lee Murr

396
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,620
Who also does our titles

397
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,160
There was a song

398
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,480
The song I just played called Rush

399
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,800
Was by

400
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,380
Big Audio Dynamite the second

401
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,060
And there was a song before that

402
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,420
By the Claypool Lennon Delirium

403
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,180
A song called Blood and Rockets

404
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,400
And if anybody listens back to that

405
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,320
Or on the

406
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,180
Podcast

407
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,780
You'll

408
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,040
You'll see that it's about

409
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,300
Jack Parsons

410
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,160
The crazy

411
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,180
Black song

412
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,000
Black rock

413
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,820
Black magic rocket scientist

414
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,660
Who partied with L. Ron Hubbard

415
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,260
And then blew himself up

416
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,640
And was he

417
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,900
Was he

418
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,440
Did he hang with Aleister Crowley

419
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,880
Or was that

420
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,240
No, he was after.

421
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,420
They just did his books.

422
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,480
That was much later.

423
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,840
Yeah, he just read his books.

424
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,040
He was involved in the OTO, and he took it real seriously,

425
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,480
and he really was a rocket scientist.

426
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,380
I think he started the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, strangely enough.

427
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,220
But what is the OTO?

428
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,000
I forgot the digital phenomenon.

429
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,080
The OTO is the...

430
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,300
The Ordo Templi Orientis.

431
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,860
Oh, yes.

432
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,460
Yes.

433
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,600
Tempical oracle.

434
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,160
Started by Bob's old prankster buddy, Alistair Crowley.

435
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,620
It was all...

436
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,800
He was actually a British agent of no imperialistic designs himself

437
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,420
because he wanted to be the leader of Europe in an underground way.

438
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Oh, he was a nut.

439
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,580
He was just another one of those nuts.

440
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,020
If it had happened a little bit later, he would have been a good subgenius, but...

441
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,400
Absurd selfies with lagoon hats on.

442
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,200
You know, that's the kind of stuff he was into.

443
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,220
You know, like a big turban and everything and smile like Lucifer.

444
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,440
Yeah.

445
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,660
Yeah.

446
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,100
Yeah.

447
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,680
Or not.

448
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,200
Do what you want before you wilt,

449
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,240
is the whole loophole in the law or something like that.

450
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,540
They're chanting all that stuff at the end of that song by the Claypool Lennon Delirium.

451
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:02,140
Oh, there was a collage that was the first collage we've ever gotten from Reverend Elvis Martini

452
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,580
that was called Pete and Pete Kill Bob.

453
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,280
These guys talking about killing Bob.

454
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,480
It was uncanny.

455
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
I don't know what show that's from.

456
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,240
Oh, in the very beginning, there was...

457
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Yeah, everybody knows Bob's already been dead for 25 years now.

458
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:16,900
Yeah.

459
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,640
Let's kill Bob.

460
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,440
You know, it's okay.

461
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,560
We're going to kill him again and again.

462
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,940
And they still don't get that joke.

463
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,560
Never mind.

464
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:21,900
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,680
He's still, you know, he's still got that...

466
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,840
He's still wearing that target on his back.

467
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,800
Nobody told him it was there.

468
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,020
I guess they like watching him get shot and bounce back.

469
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,860
Oh, and there was a brag at the very beginning.

470
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,020
That was, of course, Reverend Onan Canobite

471
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,000
doing a brag called Born on a Mountaintop.

472
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,420
Unchanged from the original...

473
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,380
Cowboy brag, except that he changed

474
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,440
one ethnic term slur to subgenius

475
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,820
and the other one to pink.

476
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,940
That was the only thing he had to change.

477
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,100
Otherwise, it was a perfect subgenius brag.

478
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,960
So, there we are.

479
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,860
Are my nostrils cutting out or are yours abating?

480
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,900
Like a text with abatement?

481
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,560
No, that's my allergy.

482
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,980
My newfound allergies.

483
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,080
I had a new...

484
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,960
I had a new gift from the...

485
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,380
From the goddess.

486
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,800
From the exists or Bob or somebody that's allergies I never had before.

487
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,620
I didn't notice your nostrils cutting out, Dave.

488
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:30,960
I did.

489
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,360
Yeah, it seems to have come and gone.

490
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,000
Like I said, digitized type of thing.

491
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,020
Well, I can faintly hear the whistling as you breathe through your nose

492
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,820
through that forest of hairs.

493
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,540
I have the same problem.

494
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,280
I have to use a big old lopper.

495
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,920
Well, better to have a...

496
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,180
Better to have a forest...

497
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,580
...to your degree in nose hairs than to breathe through your mouth holes,

498
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,200
which is very bad and sinful for your education as a miner.

499
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,780
I mean, a coal miner.

500
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,020
Don't worry.

501
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,080
That's too light for me.

502
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,080
I know you already went to that divine apple slapple in the sky

503
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
and came back and said,

504
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,840
hey, it ain't what it used to be and it ain't what it ever will be again.

505
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,920
I remember all those lies you used to tell everybody,

506
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,900
especially since the days of the French Revolution.

507
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,120
And then Bob, you come up with this Bob guy.

508
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,300
Everybody knows he's not real.

509
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,020
Or he is real.

510
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,420
In fact, he's a crazy guy on the route to San Leon in New Orleans.

511
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,260
He lives in one of them little shacks there up on...

512
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,960
No, no, you're thinking of Bob, not Bob.

513
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,500
I'm thinking of quotation mark Bob, unquote Bob.

514
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,080
Oh, you are?

515
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,500
Okay, well, whatever.

516
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,840
You can think of...

517
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,320
Okay, I'll just call him Bob because as you commonly know,

518
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,120
with your nose holes as big and wide,

519
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,880
and flared and strange and as full as venomous tissues as you're ours.

520
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,280
Boy, you know...

521
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:01,780
Some of us type Dobbs because we just don't want to do those quotation marks around Bob.

522
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,120
It's just as many letters,

523
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,480
but you have to use an extra digit to make those quotation marks.

524
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,800
Yeah, that's a real concern, man.

525
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,120
Somebody who knows the keyboard knows it hurts sometimes.

526
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,580
That's a true thing.

527
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,940
I don't know if you knew that for true.

528
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
You just made that up on the spot, Stang,

529
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,720
but that's an actual real thing that flashes in your head like,

530
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,040
I don't know if I want to put two freaking quotation marks.

531
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,340
Yeah.

532
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,040
Most of them don't know any better.

533
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,740
I mean, you can tell who's just a Bobby Gimme Bob on Facebook,

534
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:37,300
a pretender, by the fact that they don't even know about the quotes.

535
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,540
They never noticed.

536
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,060
They can't even spell Bob right, in other words.

537
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,020
What about the guy in Japan who married a love doll,

538
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,520
a pornographer story love doll,

539
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,240
and he made a big deal about it

540
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,880
because he took all kinds of selfies of him proposing and everything,

541
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,780
like it was going to be a real wedding,

542
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,220
mailing out these invitations and stuff like that.

543
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,820
Then he had, because it was a love doll,

544
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,660
he just couldn't respond in curios alquimundo

545
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,920
to his resolutions or his sparkling drinks and beverages.

546
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,220
So when the preacher said,

547
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,380
do you take this man for your lawfully wedded husband,

548
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,760
the doll didn't respond, probably.

549
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,280
No.

550
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,320
Unless the groom kind of out of the side of his mouth,

551
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,600
like a ventriloquist said,

552
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,280
I do.

553
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,600
Holding her head and nodding it around a little bit.

554
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,460
Yeah.

555
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,880
I saw a whole movie, a documentary movie,

556
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,720
about people who are aficionados of those love dolls

557
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,340
and really fall in love with them.

558
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,040
Yeah.

559
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,840
Yeah, treat them better than they treat their friends.

560
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,760
They feed them better than they feed their dog.

561
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,580
And they beat them better than they feed beaters.

562
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,020
And everybody loves dog meat, too,

563
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,480
especially in the wintertime when it gets pretty cold.

564
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,500
Well, not me.

565
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,820
Dog meat?

566
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,200
It would have to be awfully cold.

567
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,820
Not me, no, not me.

568
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,600
Well, you know, I turned into a dog person

569
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,320
at the last point when we were forced to.

570
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,760
My dad left me with this big old hound dog.

571
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,200
And then we got hooked on him.

572
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,700
And then he died because he was 12 years old.

573
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,400
And that's how old I live.

574
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,880
And so then we got a little one.

575
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,020
And now I've got yet another one that I also inherited.

576
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,680
And I used to spend all my,

577
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,200
I used to waste my time playing video games

578
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,300
or looking through microscopes.

579
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,340
I always had some hobby.

580
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,560
A new hobby is just worshipping the dogs.

581
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,960
Just doing their, serving them.

582
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,720
Doing their bidding.

583
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,460
Yeah, we're good service humans.

584
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,660
I used to use this very, very personalized

585
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,080
I'll see you later message

586
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,660
if I felt like I had to get home

587
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,280
and feed a dog or something.

588
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,720
I used to say, well, I gotta go,

589
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,720
how did I used to say it?

590
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,900
See a man about a penis full of urine?

591
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,080
Something like that.

592
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,540
Gotta go fillet the dog.

593
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,860
Oh, fillet the dog.

594
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,640
F-E-L-L-A-T-E, fillet show.

595
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,480
Yeah.

596
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,160
Oh no.

597
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,700
Gotta go fillet my dog now.

598
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,080
What?

599
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,880
Well, I don't have a dog right now to go and fillet.

600
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,280
Why would you do a thing like that, Dave?

601
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,480
Okay, okay, that's enough.

602
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,740
Because that's what it appears like

603
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,160
when you get to such great extent.

604
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
Oh, they need cookies.

605
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
They were good today.

606
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,580
Oh, they're going to put three walkies today

607
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,700
because you know what I mean?

608
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,260
Yeah.

609
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,640
Oh, I sure do.

610
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,100
Do the dogs wake you up?

611
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,400
Me?

612
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,200
Yeah, do they?

613
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,020
It's like, oh, it's time for you to feed me.

614
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,880
Get up, human.

615
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,440
Only in extreme situations.

616
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,560
Usually I'm up before they are.

617
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,440
Oh, okay.

618
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:54,760
Yeah.

619
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, they're really quite,

620
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,240
they sleep 18 hours a day, thankfully.

621
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,200
Yeah.

622
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,980
Because the rest of the time they keep me running.

623
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,760
Yes.

624
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,520
Daddy, take us for a walk.

625
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,600
Daddy, let us out.

626
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,240
Daddy, give us a treat.

627
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,820
Daddy's playing Einstein's Secret Orchestra, aren't you?

628
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,620
Oh, yeah, I am.

629
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,400
That's a witch disco that's in the background.

630
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,940
Yeah, I just, I heard that and I went,

631
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,640
where do I know that from?

632
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah, it's you on the guitar.

633
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,440
At least I'm on the Proximo Profundo as well, too.

634
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,960
The Battleship Potamkin sank back in 1942,

635
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,120
but they're still keeping the memory

636
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,740
of all those great Soviet seamen

637
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,860
and others who propagated the myth of Ishtar.

638
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,600
I think you got a couple of facts wrong in that sentence.

639
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,540
Oh, but I got plenty of facts.

640
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,640
That's what's most important is how many you have.

641
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,420
It doesn't matter if they have anything to do with each other.

642
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,220
That's what the president said.

643
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,600
That's what the president believes in.

644
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,540
And just think what a successful businessman like you would have.

645
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,880
Show you a vacuum cleaner or a hamburger maker.

646
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,540
Right, right.

647
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,580
Yeah, successful.

648
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,480
Mm-hmm.

649
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:08,920
Yep.

650
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,100
I bet he's having second thoughts.

651
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,460
About this whole public service thing.

652
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,040
He built up an empire of $7 million

653
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,960
into zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, seven times.

654
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,300
Well, but as people have pointed out,

655
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,240
yeah, I wish I was as poor as him.

656
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,640
You know what I'm saying?

657
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,580
Well, actually, he might really be.

658
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,000
If he were to shoot straight, square up and down,

659
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,920
maybe that might be true, but, you know.

660
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,260
If you have the right kind of lawyers,

661
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,000
you make money by losing.

662
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,560
You get the government to give you twice as much money as you lost.

663
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,800
Yeah, you have to be an expert.

664
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,940
You have to be an expert in, like, Russian literature,

665
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,140
like Chekhov and Gudanov.

666
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,280
Hey, hey, watch your language.

667
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,840
Nastrovya and Prevyat-Toverich.

668
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,040
And Nichival.

669
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,780
All right.

670
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,900
Well, I can sure hear some cutting out,

671
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,700
and I was wondering if it must be my phone.

672
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,060
Can you hear it on the other end?

673
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,440
No.

674
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,300
Sounds great.

675
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,560
Sounds real good.

676
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,000
No buzz.

677
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,520
No.

678
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,200
I'm hearing me.

679
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,260
We can hear your nose flare.

680
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,140
Yeah.

681
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,500
Yeah, well, I can hear you guys talking about dialectical materialism

682
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,540
behind my back and saying,

683
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,840
Bob's the real avatar of the century,

684
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,640
which I never believed or doubted or denied,

685
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,840
but I just used to poke a little fun once in a while

686
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,780
right between the eyes.

687
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,460
Dave, the voices you've been hearing weren't us.

688
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:40,820
Well.

689
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,200
That doesn't mean I still can't hate them as much as if they were you.

690
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:44,620
Sure.

691
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,720
Yeah, but I'm just letting you know that those voices in your head

692
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,960
weren't our voices in your head.

693
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,380
Why not?

694
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,780
Because we weren't talking to you that way.

695
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,780
We didn't say anything about dialectical materialism.

696
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,100
In fact, I barely, I don't really even know what that means.

697
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,720
I know it's something that commies talk about a lot.

698
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,120
Yeah, especially ones that like to play,

699
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,820
golf, you know, at Point Vista Towers or Trump Towers,

700
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,620
wherever it is.

701
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,920
Well, yeah, I wasn't invited to that party.

702
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,120
Or maybe I was and I just blew it off.

703
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,700
I don't remember.

704
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,120
There was a lot of stuff happened in the 80s and 90s that I,

705
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,000
I've been kind of surprised at some of the things I learned

706
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,580
from that documentary movie about us.

707
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,040
Yeah, I've heard you turn somebody,

708
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,480
some professor said you were a lot more religious

709
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,980
than you pretend to be making fun of religion and culture

710
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,800
and stuff like that and that you really are more of a religion

711
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,060
than some of those religions you're making fun of.

712
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:03,860
No, but it is true that the director of the movie told me

713
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,800
that she thought we behaved more like Christians than most Christians.

714
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,360
And none of us are really Christians.

715
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:10,960
That's the first thing that you mentioned,

716
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,220
that I thought was true.

717
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,620
That was the first thing you said,

718
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,720
followed by a bunch of other corroborating statements

719
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,080
that indicted you of being a liar

720
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,760
and a physical humorous and retardation.

721
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,340
Well, she acted more like a subgenius than most subgeniuses.

722
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:25,760
Yes.

723
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,980
You know, as I've been saying,

724
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,320
it's ironic that the best movie about Church of the Subgenius

725
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,260
was done by a pretty devout Christian.

726
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,740
Yeah, I just heard this guy the other day say

727
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,380
they were behind the Iron Sky.

728
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,420
What?

729
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,760
Well,

730
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,480
there's certain...

731
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,960
No, no, that's because Iron Sky ripped off...

732
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,060
She-Wolf.

733
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,340
That's because they were ripping off Bob's comic books

734
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:57,980
and, you know, manly pulp novels and stuff.

735
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,000
That's where all those movies come from.

736
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,660
They're all just ripping off Bob.

737
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,580
We sure did.

738
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,620
But then again,

739
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,360
he rips everybody off right in return.

740
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,300
But he's...

741
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,760
Yeah, but he doesn't have to even try.

742
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,240
That just happens automatically.

743
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,540
Oh, it's so sad sometimes to think of a way...

744
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,280
Only for us.

745
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,600
Not for him.

746
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,280
He's only sad if he's in the mood to be sad,

747
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,220
which happens sometimes.

748
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,680
It's a good excuse for him to get really drunk, I've heard.

749
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,400
And he'll get ridiculously maudlin'.

750
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,200
He'll just be...

751
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,900
Oh, why'd she...

752
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,620
The ones that she can't see are always bigger.

753
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,260
Why'd she do that to me?

754
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,060
Yeah.

755
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,940
I can't believe that.

756
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,380
You managed to pull a little post-relative humorous laughter out of me

757
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,540
just thinking of him saying that there.

758
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,860
It is rather humorous to see him kind of down on his knees

759
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,480
becoming a human being like the rest of us, you know?

760
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,680
Well, that's only...

761
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,340
Like I say, that only happens if...

762
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,820
That's kind of what he was in the mood for.

763
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,120
That was his whim, was to be miserable for a while.

764
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,220
But even then, he's grinning,

765
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,240
and the pipe still keeps smoking

766
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,480
without him ever having to light it or refill it.

767
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,700
And the devil hellions keep on stoking the fires of hell.

768
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,760
Well...

769
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,680
He might be sort of like that blues player Robert Johnson

770
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,600
where he had to sell something really important,

771
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,220
important to get that sales gift.

772
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,380
It's possible.

773
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,660
It has something to do with...

774
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,380
But it's probably...

775
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,080
Probably the devil felt somehow ripped off afterwards.

776
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,060
Like, wait a minute.

777
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,960
But he did.

778
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,520
Bob got all this riches and talent and luck,

779
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,060
and the soul he gave me is...

780
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,820
I'm not sure if it's even a soul.

781
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,200
I'm not sure what it is.

782
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,960
I think it might be a sock.

783
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,260
It's a baritone erection, they used to call it.

784
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,400
But, yeah, he...

785
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,440
Did I say that wrong?

786
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,340
I don't know.

787
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,300
Baritone erection?

788
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,320
I'll have to listen back to the recording.

789
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,420
That's when the middle fur of your animal fur goes down on you.

790
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,240
Oh.

791
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,560
I don't...

792
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,900
Wait, wait a minute.

793
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,720
You're getting perverted again about animals?

794
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,020
Well, I'm not really...

795
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,080
They're all perverse.

796
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,300
I mean, you think of the top of a mouse or a rat

797
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,160
or, like, a cheese monkey.

798
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:39,960
Or a fiddler.

799
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,980
Put all those together, you got one thing.

800
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,660
Onion pie.

801
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,100
It's not made for human consumption, you know?

802
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,780
So you have to kind of, like, put dangerous radioactive materials,

803
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,140
substantial amounts of vinegar and ointment,

804
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,180
and teenage pie, and everything is disgusting to you, right?

805
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,160
In one little box.

806
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,680
Wow, that's a pretty interesting recipe, Dave.

807
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,040
It is.

808
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,900
I don't know about the vinegar and ointment myself.

809
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,040
Just sent me a couple...

810
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,060
A couple thousand dollars, and I'm, you know, on Xerox or just...

811
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,000
That's right.

812
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,320
I'll type it up and print it out for you

813
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,980
and send it right to you directly in person, in hand.

814
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:20,820
I won't even email.

815
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,420
I'll get out my hands and my fores

816
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,420
and give it to you as a real artifact.

817
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,080
Well, there's that fundraiser for you online,

818
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,920
so you must be pretty rich now,

819
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,740
because you were asking for $150,000, I think, originally.

820
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,880
Yeah, I made literally tens of dollars.

821
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,840
That's what I...

822
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,280
Well, you did basically...

823
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,660
It basically says,

824
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,960
I need $150,000 so I can write screenplays.

825
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,940
But then it doesn't say anything about what kind of screenplays or...

826
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,080
And they're all very, very elementally cruel and interesting,

827
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,840
and I didn't even mention them.

828
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,680
No, right.

829
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,680
So it's...

830
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,520
I'm not surprised.

831
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,880
You know, I put that link on every time I post a show.

832
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,620
People...

833
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:08,800
Get...

834
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,860
The chance to click on the Give Dave Money link.

835
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,400
But...

836
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,540
But there's no teaser.

837
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,360
There's no...

838
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,840
Yeah, there's no...

839
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,220
You're not...

840
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,620
Yeah, you're not teasing them enough.

841
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,100
You're not seducing them into it.

842
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,800
Bob obviously didn't write that copy.

843
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,880
No, he didn't.

844
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,180
That's a very loser copy.

845
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,140
It was obviously written by the client.

846
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,080
Yeah.

847
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,560
And, you know, when the client gets out there pitching the cards,

848
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,040
you're going to see a lot of stupidity,

849
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,900
and the director's going to come up numerous times and say,

850
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,200
No, no, just read what we've got here.

851
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:38,560
Just...

852
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,000
Just look over here.

853
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,880
And then when I move my hand over here, look over this way.

854
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,640
Oh, this is just like the way Washington works now.

855
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,740
Yeah, George Washington used to write commercials.

856
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,100
Oh, okay.

857
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,140
For wooden teeth.

858
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,540
And hemp.

859
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,960
Yeah, I'm playing on the guitar.

860
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,560
I'm playing the wooden teeth part, too.

861
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,300
I just heard that.

862
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,880
Hey, they...

863
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,680
Philo's like George Washington now.

864
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,920
You know, he moved to Kentucky,

865
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,860
and he...

866
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:08,780
He...

867
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,540
He sold his hovel near San Francisco for over a million dollars,

868
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:19,240
and for what a hovel outside San Francisco costs,

869
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,480
he was able to get a 50-acre farm.

870
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,120
And now he's...

871
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,260
They legalized hemp growing again,

872
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:27,920
not marijuana.

873
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,900
That's kind of different.

874
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,260
But just regular hemp.

875
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,080
Yeah, so they can...

876
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,020
He can, you know,

877
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,380
they can make flags and paint out of it and stuff.

878
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,060
And toilet paper.

879
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,120
At least it's not seditious material that we'd have to report to.

880
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,380
No, but if there was some of the kind mixed in with that,

881
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,900
nobody would really notice it.

882
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,720
Not that he would...

883
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,700
Not that Philo would do a thing like that.

884
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,780
Oh, heavens to Betsy.

885
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,500
If you see something, you've got to say something.

886
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,700
You know, haven't you ever gone to a council meeting?

887
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,180
No, I've avoided this.

888
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,700
Wearing a pair of leather hosiery with your Nazi armband on.

889
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,420
And before you give your...

890
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:07,820
You say,

891
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,360
Reverend Ivan Stang,

892
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,460
so-and-so,

893
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,060
Glenn Rose, Texas.

894
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,460
And then you go,

895
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,480
you hold up your fist in a mighty Hitler-like salute

896
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:16,800
and say,

897
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,580
seek high on it.

898
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,100
And sit down,

899
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,080
you're wearing shorts, you know,

900
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,980
and a brown shirt and everything,

901
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,460
and you look like a bad, bad Nazi child.

902
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,900
Oh, man, you wouldn't believe how much trouble we've gone to

903
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,660
to erase and hide all the old photographs of those days.

904
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,780
Because, you know, people just don't forgive you

905
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,800
for a sick joke you made 30 years ago.

906
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,380
Ever.

907
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,160
And hey, man, you know, I went to Argentina,

908
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,660
just like all the rest of us.

909
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,440
You know, I didn't stick around and cause more trouble.

910
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,520
I knew when I was licked, like a wounded dog.

911
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,740
Yeah, well, it serves you right for whatever it was you did.

912
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,860
Well, I don't know if I actually did anything on any level at all.

913
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:58,940
I didn't think you remembered.

914
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,240
I didn't think you'd know.

915
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,540
You don't know what you're being punished for, do you?

916
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,440
No.

917
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,200
I don't either.

918
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,440
That's why they call it Welcome to the Memory Camp.

919
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,220
If you can remember what you did wrong, then you get released.

920
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,300
Well, yeah, but if you...

921
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,120
They'll just keep giving you more years of labor,

922
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,040
forced labor at Trump Stop.

923
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,060
You know, those private prisons combined with convenience stores.

924
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,540
Yeah.

925
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,080
Yeah, I think we already did this bit before,

926
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,620
and that's the way it all turned out, too.

927
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,460
Oh, you think it's a bit now?

928
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,040
No.

929
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,020
It's just a repetition of a theme, and, you know, it's true.

930
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:42,680
It's true.

931
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,920
We've coupled up some ideas there, you know,

932
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,520
and next thing you know, it's a world of its own.

933
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:52,320
Just like, you know, have you ever seen a book by the porcelain monkey?

934
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:53,740
Sure.

935
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,220
Anytime somebody makes a sick joke like that, it comes true.

936
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,440
Or you find out that it already was true.

937
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:02,800
Yeah.

938
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,560
If we had enough...

939
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,120
If we were sick enough to just think of it

940
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,580
as a joke, that means somebody else was sick enough

941
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,720
to really do it for real and set the wheels in motion.

942
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:20,660
And then we get unfairly accused of inspiring these arch criminals,

943
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,480
which we might have done, but we didn't mean to.

944
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,920
That wasn't our intention.

945
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,780
We wanted to inspire the arch slackers.

946
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,100
Yeah.

947
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,020
Whatever that means.

948
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:36,860
I'm not sure.

949
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Put fuel in the fire there for them.

950
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,180
That's what I agree with you on that one.

951
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,540
You just said...

952
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,300
Now, true, we don't...

953
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,280
You kind of agree with me a little bit on that there.

954
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,000
Yeah, I agree with you.

955
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,840
Well, I mean, you know, it doesn't sound like you really, really think I know what I'm talking about.

956
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:55,860
But I do.

957
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,560
I do, Dave.

958
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,140
I really do.

959
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,880
I don't.

960
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,240
Yes.

961
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,940
I've already forgotten what the hell you were talking about, but that's not unusual.

962
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,240
That's okay.

963
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,500
You signed it away, man.

964
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,620
I signed that contract with Dobbs.

965
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,500
He signed it all away, man.

966
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,520
Yeah, the memory.

967
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,960
I signed away everything.

968
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,060
You look in the mirror and go, I know who I am.

969
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,160
I know who I am.

970
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,060
And cry and stuff like, what's his name in Johnny Angel.

971
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,640
Well, you sign away the memories of everything that you're signing away.

972
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,240
So you don't even know what you had before.

973
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,740
So you don't miss it.

974
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,460
Well, right.

975
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,140
But it's like Robert Johnson, he said, like at the Crossroads,

976
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,640
once the devil did come and put the pie pan right in his football.

977
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,840
That's hard to do.

978
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:40,620
You know what I mean?

979
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,820
That's difficult as hell to do.

980
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,080
Yeah.

981
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,440
And once you do it, you do it once.

982
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,220
You come to the Crossroads and you made your, you signed on the wind blood on the dotted

983
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:50,760
line there.

984
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:58,820
When the X day comes, meaning in your language, X day, when the day in question comes, X day,

985
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,640
you'll be ready to go somewhere else.

986
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:03,920
Yeah.

987
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,720
What Dave said.

988
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:06,700
Yeah.

989
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,100
Speak out.

990
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,100


991
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,100


992
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,100


993
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,100


994
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,100


995
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:18,280
Speaking of X day, that subgenius holiday and destruction of the entire human aspect

996
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:24,600
of the planet is coming up in a couple of months, less than a couple of months, I guess.

997
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,840
It's breathing down our very necks.

998
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:27,320
Yeah.

999
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:36,620
Starting July 1st, the devout will be gathering in Southern Ohio at that campground.

1000
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,820
With possibly Bob lurking in the woods.

1001
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,620
Did you mean like Wisteria campground?

1002
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,420
Yeah.

1003
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,020
Is that the one you meant?

1004
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:46,400
Yeah.

1005
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,640
Is this a Starwood?

1006
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,980
Bob always pooped in the woods in Wisteria.

1007
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,860
Well, Starwood happens after.

1008
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:51,920
Yeah.

1009
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:55,380
But see, X day comes first.

1010
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:55,880
Okay.

1011
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,120
And if-

1012
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,660
And if the world survives.

1013
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:05,360
Well, even if it doesn't, we'll have our own planets that we can put Starwood on.

1014
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:05,920
Oh, okay.

1015
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,160
Cool.

1016
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:06,600
Yeah.

1017
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:06,600


1018
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:06,600


1019
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:06,600


1020
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:06,600


1021
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:06,600


1022
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:13,300
So I was planning to beam up the campground and protect it and let them have their Starwood

1023
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,320
before we eject them out into space.

1024
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,580
Wow.

1025
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,800
The ones that didn't pay up.

1026
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,420
Of course, by then, everybody will want to join up.

1027
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,100
Yeah.

1028
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,160
But we can't do any kind of a call to action.

1029
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,260
Really?

1030
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,040
Starwood's got some interesting guests.

1031
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:32,220
Yes.

1032
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:37,720
President Vermin Supreme is going to be at Starwood.

1033
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,960
And apparently when he does an event, he does it to the max.

1034
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,740
He does several workshops.

1035
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,720
He'll rant.

1036
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,280
He'll be your friend.

1037
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,920
He'll tell you the secrets.

1038
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:55,480
So yeah, Vermin Supreme, he was very friendly to deal with too.

1039
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,680
Yeah.

1040
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,820
And he didn't charge too much considering that he was actually elected president.

1041
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,580
Yes.

1042
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,960
I thought he looked horrible as a woman though, Stang, really.

1043
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,960
When you said he dressed up, he looked really good.

1044
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,800
And the trans side, dress side bit just did not work on me.

1045
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,380
He looked horrible as a woman.

1046
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:19,240
Because he had these like, you know, all rouged up and rowdy chicks and cheeks.

1047
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,100
Oh, man.

1048
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,540
Well, actually, he looks like a wizard from Lord of the Rings.

1049
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,120
Yeah, he does.

1050
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,820
But that's not unusual at Starwood.

1051
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:31,100
Yeah, he turns up as an old lady, you know, like when you walk up behind him and you see

1052
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,560
they got a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

1053
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:31,560


1054
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:31,560


1055
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,540
He's got a bunch of long white hair.

1056
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:39,100
You think it's an old lady, a 93 year old lady and you look at it's some kind of bohemian

1057
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:39,380
man.

1058
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:50,800
I wish I could say we would have celebrity guests at Ex Day, but, and we do, Dr. Hal,

1059
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,080
wee ma ma the mother of Princess Wee.

1060
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,880
The amino acids are usually there.

1061
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,400
Yeah, well, something amino acid like.

1062
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:01,540
They're superstars.

1063
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,500
Something amino acid-like, yes.

1064
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,300
Yeah, yeah.

1065
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,520
And, yeah, that always happens.

1066
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:14,580
And then if you happen to be a superstar and you want to come to X-Day, you're more than welcome.

1067
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,580
Yeah, that's right.

1068
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:20,380
Well, they still have to pay for the campground and us.

1069
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,400
Are the four elements going to be there?

1070
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,960
Earth, air, wind, and fire?

1071
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,280
Yeah, are they going to be there?

1072
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,420
Well, they're usually there in great strength.

1073
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:31,840
In large quantities.

1074
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,940
Especially the wind and the rain and the fire.

1075
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:36,580
Yes.

1076
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,320
Oh, wow.

1077
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,240
And if mud counts as earth, there's usually lots of that.

1078
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,400
Lots and lots of that.

1079
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,060
Yeah, there's weather.

1080
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,860
You do get weather.

1081
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,620
You do get weather.

1082
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,720
We've had mostly good weather the last couple of times.

1083
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,620
The last three times.

1084
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,540
It's been very intemperately hot, though.

1085
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:56,040
A couple of times it was, yeah, it was a complete.

1086
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,500
But that was the whole Midwest was almost destroyed by the heat.

1087
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,940
And there was no power anywhere in Ohio, southern Ohio, except for that campground.

1088
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:08,180
That's right.

1089
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,680
They were prepared.

1090
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,780
We were the only, it really was like a rehearsal for X-Day.

1091
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:21,000
And for the first time ever, the subgeniuses had ice and internet.

1092
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:21,500
Yes.

1093
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,920
And no one else did.

1094
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,900
And we were told, don't tell anyone.

1095
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,120
That we still have power or ice.

1096
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,080
Because there were people selling bags of ice for 50 bucks in town.

1097
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,240
Wow.

1098
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:33,980
Yeah.

1099
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:39,540
We didn't want to have the bikers and Amish invade and kill us, you know, for our ice.

1100
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,180
Yeah.

1101
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:48,280
Yep, I think that was one of the most heartwarming and stirring things that the church has ever done.

1102
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:54,500
It's become the same as those avid reptiles down there who took the day off on Tuesday, I think it was.

1103
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,400
And it was tempestuous.

1104
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,620
It was like 98 degrees.

1105
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:02,620
And the photography session was 98% or something like that.

1106
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,020
98, 98.

1107
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:12,540
And even the people who went out to get their turtles snapped off over at the turtle pond there could find no relief.

1108
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,080
But the reptiles like it.

1109
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,780
I mean, the reptile people like it.

1110
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,760
They thrive in that high temperature and humidity.

1111
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,020
Well, sure.

1112
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,380
It's just like dangling food.

1113
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,960
A low fruit.

1114
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,280
A low fruit source.

1115
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:31,700
It just about kills the little hairy mammals, though, which is most of the subgeniuses more fit.

1116
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:31,940
Yeah.

1117
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:32,720
More super, yeah.

1118
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:33,740
Yeah.

1119
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,540
With pouches.

1120
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,060
Some of them do have pouches, actually.

1121
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:40,580
I know.

1122
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,520
It's a good thing we all do have pouches.

1123
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,620
Because what would you do if you were out in the woods?

1124
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:52,100
You're going to start a little fire and you realize that your kindling and some of your starter fire stuff like Utsie the Iceman is in your pouch.

1125
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,300
And you reach down below your navel there and then your pouch is gone.

1126
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:56,460
Yeah.

1127
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,320
That's a sinking feeling.

1128
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,320
Uh-oh.

1129
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,700
It's going to snow pretty soon and I won't be in a nice little warm tent.

1130
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,980
I'll be freezing my cuckoo.

1131
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:16,300
Well, and for a lot of people, since that's a clothing optional campground, the really elderly ones actually go clothing free.

1132
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,020
And they really do have pouches, but they need them.

1133
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,720
They need them to put their car keys in.

1134
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,200
Yeah.

1135
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,760
The chargers for their phones.

1136
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,340
And their phones.

1137
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:34,380
And you're saying that the young and beautiful and fit and taut ones all wear clothing?

1138
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,060
Mostly, yeah.

1139
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,520
Well, they have the sky-clad camouflage there.

1140
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,800
They're wearing that sky-clad camouflage.

1141
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:46,160
It means you can look exactly like a 78-year-old woman with tattoos and a very, and a ponch.

1142
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,880
What do you call it?

1143
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:55,020
Up until about 2005, the young people did run around naked.

1144
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,060
Oh, yeah.

1145
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,040
But then the smartphones appeared and everybody had a phone.

1146
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,000
Suddenly, grandma was on the internet.

1147
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,360
And all the younger ones, you know, they didn't want their boss seeing what they did on the weekend.

1148
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,240
Actually, we're pretty tight with that.

1149
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,840
We really, really...

1150
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,120
Well, you guys try to keep the cameras down, but it's impossible.

1151
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:16,960
We do try to keep the cameras down.

1152
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,840
It's almost impossible.

1153
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah, because people just don't...

1154
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,100
Some people don't know the camera rolls.

1155
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,500
Brushes are okay.

1156
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,500
Okay, because they're just...

1157
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,260
Brushes are okay.

1158
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:35,240
But if, say, for instance, Floridina or one of the exes' girls were to start massaging their floral areas very protuberantly,

1159
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:41,320
then you'd have to have some trouble there with your FBI and your NSA and all your other police scores.

1160
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:42,780
Yeah.

1161
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:47,120
Well, unless you make sure they get to have copies of all the pictures, too.

1162
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:47,480
Right.

1163
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,900
You always got to look up the popo.

1164
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,240
We really did have FBI and so forth come to X Days to check it out.

1165
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:54,420
Yes.

1166
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,120
Back in the old days.

1167
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:55,520
Oh, yeah.

1168
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,640
There's so few people there now, they don't really...

1169
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,540
It's like, well, how many terrorists can they possibly have?

1170
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,220
And they all wear glasses.

1171
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,000
They can't...

1172
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,880
It's like a bunch of terrorists that are all pencil-knit geeks that wear glasses.

1173
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:15,040
And aren't really terrorists and just play Magic the Gathering while they...

1174
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,400
They're Canadian exchange students.

1175
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,540
Yeah, while they listen to Dr. Howell and me rattle on and on and on and on.

1176
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,760
Only last year, I wasn't there.

1177
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,020
Neither were you, Dave.

1178
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:31,420
What's sad is that they walk away from the event with a diminished sexual interest.

1179
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,160
Suddenly, it's like life, like you're...

1180
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,660
I'm real young and I'm going to take the world by the horns.

1181
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:42,480
And by the time I'm 52, I'm going to own the Megaloth Empire and so forth and everything like that.

1182
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,040
And all of a sudden, next thing you know, you're 22 and you feel like you're 92.

1183
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,340
Yeah, but that's a real relief, you know, not to be driven anymore like that.

1184
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:52,880
I mean...

1185
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,060
Driven like a bad old car.

1186
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:54,220
Yeah.

1187
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:54,820
Is that what you're saying?

1188
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,780
Like a bad old car?

1189
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,460
Is that what you're saying?

1190
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,020
Something like that.

1191
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,100
Hey, Dave, it's getting...

1192
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,220
We're getting up near the end of the show, as they say.

1193
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,360
And we actually did about five minutes of stuff early.

1194
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,040
So the internet version is going to be a little longer.

1195
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,840
Because Brother Love did some banter with us before the show.

1196
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,120
But anyway, I do need to say that you're...

1197
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,660
Some people are accidentally...

1198
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:35,180
For the first time in their lives, listening to The Hour of Slack, a variety show from the church of the subgenius.

1199
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:41,940
A real religion disguised as a joke disguised as a real religion disguised as a joke.

1200
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:51,840
Disguised as a bunch of regular folks acting better.

1201
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,420
Better.

1202
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,760
People around the institution, wherever they go.

1203
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,880
In their own strange way.

1204
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:06,240
Anyway, what people need to know is that they can learn more at subgenius.com.

1205
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:15,600
Our prisoner friends out there who are not allowed anywhere near social media can actually do it by mail.

1206
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:23,160
And so our post office box in Texas is box 807.

1207
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,380
Glen Rose, Texas.

1208
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,400
76043.

1209
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:36,600
However, until the world ends, if anybody remembers our Cleveland address, you can use that.

1210
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:37,800
Because we're here.

1211
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,480
We're in Cleveland for...

1212
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,460
Just until the world ends.

1213
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,640
And then after that, we'll only show up when the world is ending.

1214
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,440
Right.

1215
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,220
Well, Princess We might be here a lot more than I will.

1216
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,460
But somebody has to stay.

1217
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,820
They, you know, mend the fences.

1218
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,340
And, you know, rope the goats.

1219
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:03,740
Speaking of the goats, Stang Ranch has 114 new kids.

1220
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1221
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,500
Praise the holy goats.

1222
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,760
Praise the holy goats.

1223
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,960
And let's see, what can I play next?

1224
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,740
I have to play the Goodbye Dave words.

1225
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,020
Goodbye Dave.

1226
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,820
Goodbye Dave.

1227
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,040
But what are the words?

1228
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,440
Goodbye Dave.

1229
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,280
Goodbye Dave.

1230
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,580
Oh, I thought that's what it was.

1231
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,200
And then I just faded out.

1232
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:25,840
I hate saying goodbye to Dave.

1233
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,060
And you can keep listening, but I'm cutting.

1234
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:28,880
He's out.

1235
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,440
He's gone.

1236
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,260
He may be able to still hear us, but he can't talk.

1237
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,280
And now that's true also of you, Princess We.

1238
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,840
And in a minute, well, what will I play here?

1239
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,440
I'll just put on some Jimmy Ryan.

1240
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,820
Reverend Jimmy Ryan.

1241
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:45,080
This is an instrumental called Pipe Dream.

1242
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,240
It's big guitar, because that's what he does.

1243
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,040
He's a big guitar guy.

1244
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,300
And...

1245
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:52,300
And...

1246
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:57,660
And after that, if the show bleeds over into radio synesthesia,

1247
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,480
which is coming, because Dr. Sinister is here.

1248
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,720
Oh, look, it's the alarm that says I need to take my pill

1249
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,660
and give the dog her pill.

1250
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:06,780
Oh, no.

1251
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:07,760
Yeah.

1252
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,060
