Signal to noise

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,740
Begin transmission

4
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,780
This program is brought to you by Bob

5
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,500
And

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,660
Hallelujah

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,760
Awesome

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,660
Let's see

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,860
What we can do for the subgenius today

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,140
I am seeking information about Bob

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,240
Let us see what is on the radio

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,480
You're listening to PR News

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,540
No, I don't think I can accept that program

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:57,760
No, I don't think I can accept that program

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:57,760


16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,540
No, I don't think I can accept that program

17
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:57,760
No, I don't think I can accept that program

18
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,460
Welcome to nightmare

19
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,260
From PR News in Washington

20
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm working towards the elimination of Pittsburgh and North Korea

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
Investigators say they found JPEG images of Bob on his computer

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,320
Both those men were arrested on charges of lying to PR News in Pakistan last year

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,860
Pittsburgh

24
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,760
Police in Pittsburgh say they were all lying to Bob on his computer

25
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
Also PRs

26
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,720
And countries like Pittsburgh need to consume more

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,100
To build a more sustainable PR News

28
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,560
Less prone to Pittsburgh

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,320
Nearly 15 million point 7 percent

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,960
PR News

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,340
On Wall Street

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,440

23-10-9

34
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,560
Former U.S. President says he hopes to explode gas emissions

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,800
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,300
The United Nations Security Council has unanimously signed off

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,760
On a U.S.-sponsored resolution to ban gas emissions from the U.S.

38
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:57,960
And it's expected that the U.S. will accept the bill

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,000
As it would commit all nations to working towards the elimination of PR News in Washington

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,200
Hello, this is me, Bernard

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,140
You know, no, no mistake for who's calling here

42
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,700
For whom's calling here

43
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,380
You know, I just want to say, you know, the Conspiracy of the Pinks

44
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,980
You know, in their counterfeit society

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,900
They are idiots

46
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,180
You know, you know, they eventually will get what's coming to them

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,400
You know, and hopefully

48
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,440
that the UFOs, alien beings not from this world, will do something about it.

49
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,940
You know, to stop these, you know, the beast element of humanity

50
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,380
who are screwing around with our individual rights and our freedoms

51
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,940
will, you know, wipe out these humans.

52
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,040
You know, these brains of so-called humans

53
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,460
who represent society, whom are the most visible at large.

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
What have you been doing with your life?

55
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,000
Uh, professional killer.

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,860
Oh, good for you. It's a growth industry.

57
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,580
I'm an annoyance to my superiors.

58
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,260
A joke to my peers.

59
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,700
They call me spooky.

60
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,560
You'll see him in your nightmares.

61
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,780
You'll see him in your dreams.

62
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,440
Spooky Mulder, whose sister was abducted.

63
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,080
Abducted by aliens.

64
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,160
Chases after little green men.

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,020
Conspiracy.

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,980
Designed and directed by his red rat hand.

67
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,420
Chatting to the heavens, or anyone who'll listen,

68
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,840
that the fix is in and the government's hit for the truth

69
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
and part of the conspiracy.

70
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,500
I can no longer sit back and allow

71
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,600
communist infiltration, communist indoctrination,

72
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,280
communist subversion,

73
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,720
and the international communist conspiracy

74
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,580
to sap and impurify

75
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,220
all of our precious bodily fluids.

76
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,080
Now it is 1980.

77
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,020
1980.

78
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,020
Before

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,220
Knock and knock at your front door

80
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,560
It's the suede denim secret police

81
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,120
They have come for your uncool mates

82
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,800
You can never tell anyone you did this.

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,800
What, what could they do to me?

84
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,540
Take him home to your house and kill you.

85
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,700
So what's your business?

86
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,160
It's a professional killer.

87
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,960
Do you get down all the way back?

88
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,900
Must be some kind of conspiracy.

89
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,400
The whole world's a goddamn conspiracy.

90
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,040
Look anywhere long enough, you're gonna find a conspiracy.

91
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,720
And life is a conspiracy!

92
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,500
Here's my theory on that.

93
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,840
When I was institutionalized, my brain was exhausted in the guise of mental health.

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,780
I was interrogated, I was x-rayed, I was examined thoroughly.

95
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,800
Then they took everything about me and put it into a computer where they created this model of my mind.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,820
Yes, using that model, they managed to generate every thought I could possibly have in the next, say, ten years,

97
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,480
which they then filtered through a probability matrix of some kind to determine everything.

98
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,700
Everything I was gonna do in that period.

99
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:57,540
And when you peel back my eyes, I see the pain and feel alive.

100
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,780
I see leaves on this fire that burns inside you.

101
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:12,800
I see many things. I see plans within plans.

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Ah!

103
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,480
Ten years, man! Ten!

104
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,320
Where have you been for ten years?

105
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,280
I freaked out, joined the army, went into business for myself.

106
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm a professional killer.

107
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,580
Oh, does that, do you have to do postgraduate work for that, or can you jump right in?

108
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,560
I'm curious about that.

109
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,620
It's an open market.

110
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,740
Open market, that's good.

111
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,120
Wow.

112
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,340
I'm a professional killer.

113
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,460
I'm a professional killer.

114
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,440
I'm a professional killer.

115
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,460
I'm a professional killer.

116
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:45,660


117
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,380
I'm a professional killer.

118
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,680
I'm a professional killer.

119
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,420
I'm a professional killer.

120
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,200
I am just a figment of your imagination.

121
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,000
You've just been erased.

122
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,840
Whoa, that was a collage on the conspiracy from a new contributor called Signal to Noise.

123
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,560
That is reverenderic.com.

124
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,300
A suitable intro for this hour of Slack number 1225.

125
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,480
Before that, we heard our frequent...

126
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,040
We call her Bernard, who loves our toll-free number a little too much.

127
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:28,780
PR News is from Leemur, as was our new title, although the very beginning was also Signal to Noise.

128
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:37,680
And much of this show, however, comes from episode 29 of the British podcast called Right Where You Are Sitting Now,

129
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,980
with hosts Ken Monaghan and Ken Eakins.

130
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,560
So, one of the things we wanted to talk to you about today,

131
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,700
there was a book that you guys released.

132
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,180
It was actually one of the most underrated, I think, of the subgenius releases in book.

133
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,500
It was the High Weirdness by Mail.

134
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,400
Can you talk a little bit about how that happened and the back story behind it?

135
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,660
Right.

136
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:13,200
In the middle 1980s, after the book of the subgenius had been first unsuccessfully published by McGraw-Hill

137
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,540
and then successfully republished by McGraw-Hill,

138
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,120
by Simon & Schuster, the editor at Simon & Schuster, the late Tim McGinnis,

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,820
suggested that I put together a non-fiction but amusing book about rival cults.

140
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,220
And I did.

141
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,620
High Weirdness by Mail covers not just kooky cults and people who don't believe in Bob,

142
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,240
but political extremists, very extreme art.

143
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,620
This was in the 80s.

144
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,080
Things like body modification were relatively new.

145
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,020
And there was no internet to speak of.

146
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:01,500
So, it was mainly about self-published, the kind of self-published material you could get over the mail.

147
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,540
Now, since that time, the book has been rendered, well, I mean, that was 20 years ago.

148
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,620
About half of those groups and cults are gone.

149
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,840
Although the most...

150
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:22,480
bizarre, to my mind, ones are still in business and have their own websites and so forth.

151
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,960
But the internet kind of made my book redundant.

152
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:40,520
Because there are dozens of sites on the internet that sarcastically examine different types of cults and wackos, kooks, crazies, and visionaries.

153
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,940
You know, one man's kook.

154
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,660
That's another man's presidential candidate.

155
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,900
There's another man's gay lover.

156
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,160
There's another man's clip art deity.

157
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:07,880
And with the internet now, it's so easy for a psychotic person to put their writings out in the world that it's like I couldn't possibly keep up with them.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,440
In fact, when you asked me about talking about new cults, I had to do some homework.

159
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:23,140
And I asked on alt.slack this morning if anybody had any new favorite kooky cults.

160
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:30,820
One person said that kookery has gone mainstream since the days of high weirdness by mail.

161
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,400
The most obvious example being current U.S. politics.

162
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,300
And then my friend...

163
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,420
Well, I should...

164
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,060
You know, in some ways, the book...

165
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,880
The book High Weirdness by Mail is being updated by something called the High Weirdness Project.

166
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,680
Yeah, I was going to bring that up later, actually.

167
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,380
But yeah, yeah, go on.

168
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:04,860
Yeah, our friend Reverend Modemac created his own wiki type thing, a Wikipedia type of setup that examines weirdness of all kinds.

169
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,500
And he sent me a list of his favorites.

170
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,400
But to tell the truth, they're all kind of...

171
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,660
Either they're...

172
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,960
They're old or they're...

173
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,800
They're so well known that...

174
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,460
Well, like David Icke, for instance.

175
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,040
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,740
They're in your...

177
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,420
On your own...

178
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,480
On your home planet.

179
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,400
He's relatively new.

180
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,120
He wasn't around when I wrote High Weirdness by Mail.

181
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:38,080
But, for instance, the Lyndon LaRouche movement was...

182
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,840
And for some reason is still going on.

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,040
You know, the Flat Earth Society.

184
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,740
The Flat Earth Society still exists.

185
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,440
Yeah.

186
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,040
Even the breath Aryans exist.

187
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,160
And they were people who believed that you could live only on air.

188
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,580
You can't.

189
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,960
And their guru was caught cheating numerous times.

190
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,300
But you know how belief is.

191
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,160
You'll believe, as my father said,

192
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,900
I believe whatever I need to believe.

193
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,060
And some people need to believe things.

194
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,040


195
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,440
That I don't need to believe.

196
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:22,580
I had one friend who read a book that convinced him that the...

197
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:28,240
That the U.S. had never sent a spaceship to the moon.

198
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,940
There had never been a manned moon landing.

199
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,360
And when I tried to argue that I thought maybe there had been,

200
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,020
he got almost angry to the point of physical fighting.

201
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
But not a month later, he was arguing...

202
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,960
He had...

203
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,120
He had read a different book and decided that not only had we been to the moon,

204
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,640
but we had taken over the existing ancient civilization's moon bases

205
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,260
and were keeping slaves there.

206
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,240
Right.

207
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,260
And would get just as upset if you tried to tell him that.

208
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,800
There wasn't much proof for that either.

209
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,520
So I...

210
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,720
You know, actually, when I finished A High Weirdness by Mail,

211
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,200
it was hard work being so sarcastic.

212
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:13,940
It was hard work being so sarcastic.

213
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:13,940


214
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,520
About so many sincere people.

215
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,260
And I kind of got burned out on cult bashing

216
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,760
and became more of a professional kook myself.

217
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,060
So I now know more about the kooks within my own cult,

218
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,200
the subgenius cult,

219
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,580
than I do about the new, you know, rival cults.

220
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,840
Now, there are some new ones, though.

221
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,820
For instance, the 9-11 truthers.

222
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,800
Yeah, yeah.

223
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,000
Now, some people would say there's...

224
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,380
That's like the JFK assassination.

225
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,380
You know, there's a lot of argument,

226
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,960
and it'll probably never be settled for sure.

227
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,380
No.

228
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,240
You know, there's people who say that the Holocaust never happened

229
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,120
to whom I say maybe World War II never happened.

230
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,440
For all we know, World War II was faked.

231
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,880
I wasn't there. I didn't see it.

232
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,780
I've seen lots of movies, but you can fake anything.

233
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,220
I've seen a movie.

234
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,960
Here in the U.S., we have a new type of reactionary kook called birthers

235
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,660
who are trying to believe or trying to convince everybody

236
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,200
that President Obama was not really born in the United States.

237
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,620
He was really born in Africa, and therefore he can't be president.

238
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,900
Because the very idea of a president of the U.S. of African descent

239
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,760
just curdles their blood.

240
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,160
Which makes me...

241
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,480
I'd love to watch their blood curdle.

242
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,360
Let me put it that way.

243
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,000
I really enjoy watching the curdling of kook blood.

244
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,320
So what you should also know, friends,

245
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,860
is that we are here to condone any avenue of inquiry.

246
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,700
And no matter how occult or forbidden a topic may be,

247
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,220
you are hereby empowered by me to jump into that thing with all four feet.

248
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,920
There is no book, no recording,

249
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,220
that is going to cause you harm or cause you to harm anybody else.

250
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,320
We say read that book, listen to that song,

251
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,180
no matter what anybody tells you otherwise.

252
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,500
And if you do end up killing somebody because of some song,

253
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,720
please blame Bob.

254
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,700
We could use a publicity.

255
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,680
So, should you purchase that sinful item of indulgence

256
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,120
seen over there at our sales table?

257
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,820
Well, why not?

258
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,560
Go ahead.

259
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,160
Be bi-curious.

260
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,920
You already...

261
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,060
You already have all the money you're going to need for when you're dead,

262
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,340
and you're going to be dead a lot longer than you're going to be alive.

263
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,020
So consider it an investment in eternity, friends.

264
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,640
The occult and religion are endlessly fascinating.

265
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,800
I wouldn't be in this if it wasn't, obviously.

266
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,340
And there's no reason why you shouldn't adopt all of them for your own.

267
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,680
The more contradictory, the better.

268
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,960
The immaterial dialectic, Onan called it.

269
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,520
It's a war.

270
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,280
It really is a war.

271
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
On one side are the cool people.

272
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,180
On the other side are the cool people.

273
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,760
And it's the subgeniuses that are in the middle,

274
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,300
and we say enough of their cool war.

275
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,440
We are through being cool, and we're through being uncool.

276
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,440
We...

277
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,720
Praise Bob!

278
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,360
Don't hurt yourselves doing that, kids.

279
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,940
That's, you know, professionals.

280
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,460
We cast derision upon the coolostomy bags of the normals

281
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,940
and their designer parasites.

282
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,300
Being cool or uncool has nothing to do with being a subgenius.

283
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,720
What matters is having slack.

284
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,600
Now...

285
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,160
But then there's these built-in contradictions to the human condition,

286
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
or even...

287
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,180
the subgenius condition, for that matter.

288
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,420
For some reason, we were created to have this ever-reoccurring appetite.

289
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,000
And yet we only get to eat sporadically.

290
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,260
You know, we'd love to be eating all the time,

291
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,800
but you only get to every now and then.

292
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,900
We were created to take in nutrition.

293
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,180
Good, healthy nutrition.

294
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:40,160
And yet we enjoy the hell out of sugar-fried bacon loaf.

295
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,420
So the decade...

296
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,100
was stacked against us from the start, friends.

297
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,440
Therefore, go ahead and eat up while you can.

298
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,080
The food chains of the law have been broken.

299
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,220
Eat what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.

300
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,360
And...

301
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,340
That goes for sex, too.

302
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,480
I thought they'd...

303
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,560
Yeah, I thought there'd be some of that hooting and hollering.

304
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,320
Friends, for the advanced subgenius,

305
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,440
there are yet even more exotic vistas to conquer.

306
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,000
Amazing new adventures for all of you.

307
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,400
Like getting a job.

308
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,120
Keeping it.

309
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Then getting a better job.

310
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,700
Maybe even having health insurance!

311
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,380
You're free!

312
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,920
You are free!

313
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,040
I'm a holy man, I can say that.

314
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,180
You're free, you can now do anything you want,

315
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,760
and we will still accept your money.

316
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,040
You can be a...

317
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,740
Virgin!

318
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,160
And we'll still let you be a subgenius.

319
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,580
Friends...

320
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,700
Um...

321
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,220
And that's what this church is all about.

322
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,760
We've been pole vaulting the shark under the bus since 1953,

323
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,100
so we know what we're talking about.

324
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,640
You wanna know the really cool thing about Bob?

325
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,500
He automatically upgrades himself while you're sleeping.

326
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,360
How easy is that?

327
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,200
Tu-ra-lu-ra-lay...

328
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,560
You're right.

329
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,260
He's sounds like a completely different railroad.

330
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,020
A proper railroad sjc?

331
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,960
Beef, look at that.

332
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,040


333
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,040


334
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,060
and I sure as hell won't lose that.

335
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,500
Little HIV but I'll try my best.

336
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:36,720
AJZOver, he's late.

337
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,720


338
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,720


339
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,720


340
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,720


341
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,720


342
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,720


343
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,340
Telephone

344
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,340


345
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,580
ì

346
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:39,580


347
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,420
I think you need the subtitles.

348
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
ao

349
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,000
But like I say,

350
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,080
we have our own kooks within the Church of the Subgenius.

351
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,540
I've lost track of the number of people

352
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,660
who honestly think they are the person

353
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,640
that Bob Dobbs is based on.

354
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,900
By the same token,

355
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,100
I used to read a comic book

356
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,000
called The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers

357
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,580
about pot-smoking hippies.

358
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,380
And somehow I met dozens of people in Texas

359
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,160
who all said that they were the person

360
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,340
that those pot-smoking hippies were based on.

361
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,260
I actually knew the artist who drew that,

362
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,160
and I knew the characters weren't based on anybody.

363
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,740
Bob Dobbs, I can tell you for a fact,

364
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,360
is based only on J.R. Bob Dobbs,

365
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,840
the person depicted in the clip art

366
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,140
shown in our many websites.

367
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,440
So, you know, I've pretty much given up

368
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,200
on trying to understand anybody else's beliefs.

369
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,540
The first friend of mine who had a sex change operation,

370
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,900
that was when I quit trying to understand.

371
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,660
And seriously, you know,

372
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
because for a while I did try to understand

373
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,560
and it got me nowhere.

374
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,400
So I just threw up my hands and said,

375
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,140
I shall have faith

376
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,000
that these people know what they're doing.

377
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,380
Hello to the Reverend Ivan Stang

378
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,040
and Ankara

379
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,760
and everyone from

380
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,180
the Church of the Subgenius.

381
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,300
Uh, bear with me and I shall send you some subgenius messages.

382
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,740
One, two, one, two, three, four.

383
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,460
We accepted, wanna fuck.

384
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,220
We accepted, wanna fuck.

385
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,260
Uber, gobble, Uber, gobble.

386
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,860
We accepted, we accepted.

387
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,820
We accepted, wanna fuck.

388
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,560
We accepted, wanna fuck.

389
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,620
Uber, gobble, Uber, gobble.

390
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,240
We accepted, we accepted, we came, we saw, we kicked it down.

391
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,100
I was testing you and you can ask.

392
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,900
Dental plan.

393
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,840
Lisa needs blood.

394
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,780
You'll be required to fart on a regular basis.

395
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,060
I'm gonna make him an offer, gentlemen.

396
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,260
He's a chattel to the eye of the sea.

397
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,180
RoboCop, who is he?

398
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,960
Federalize, you are coming with me.

399
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,880
In a hurry to defend,

400
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,820
we beat the eyes and people in the head.

401
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,820
I'm telling you, Doc, you gotta believe me.

402
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,620
I did everything I would leave you.

403
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,520
My beautiful chocolate candy is dandy.

404
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,000
Top of me is a nice candy.

405
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,920
You can count on slippery feet.

406
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,860
Suicide will be nice and neat.

407
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,520
I didn't build the Panama Canal.

408
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,500
Open the pod bay doors, please, Al.

409
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,460
These aren't the droids you're looking for.

410
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,060
These aren't the droids we're looking for.

411
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,360
I am not an empire.

412
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,000
I am a free man.

413
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,300
I am a free man.

414
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,500
To the idiot mobile.

415
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,680
Right away, Michael.

416
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,100
I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, leaked,

417
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,100
deeply or numbered.

418
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,260
We came, we saw, we kicked it down.

419
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,000
You don't understand, I could have had class.

420
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,880
Round and tasty, unpaid money.

421
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,780
Who's giving you what you've got?

422
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,680
Finally, can I stop those lines?

423
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,760
No, I've been there twice.

424
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,740
Then run.

425
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,980
What's the matter, Al?

426
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,220
Just rob us of all of his money.

427
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,100
We came, we saw, we kicked it down.

428
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,860
Brain checks your body, can't cash.

429
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,120
I was elected to lead.

430
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,480
I feel the need for me for a thing.

431
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,340
Watch out for snakes.

432
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,360
A good man's lover.

433
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,740
HQ, my hat looks like a muffin.

434
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,160
Over.

435
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,880
My God, it's full of snakes.

436
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,860
There was no driver in the car.

437
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:29,160
Sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky.

438
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,320
Right away, Michael.

439
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,860
OMG, I'm in hot pursuit!

440
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,140
There are only two things I love in this world.

441
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,760
Everybody and television.

442
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,100
I see you.

443
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,200
You must be shrooming.

444
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,840
Wait for me, Moomin.

445
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,960
Just like to meet the host of that show, Meat Boy.

446
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,320
I want to go to there.

447
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,380
We came, we saw, we kicked it down.

448
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,180
Wild typhoon.

449
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,960
Like a wolf, mustache.

450
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,680
I have a fever.

451
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,860
I just had a such.

452
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,620
I don't give a shit about food.

453
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,880
What is Meat Boy's fault?

454
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,460
Not any good.

455
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,520
Maybe we're going to need him maybe a potion.

456
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,280
What did you say?

457
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,360
I think she bought it.

458
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,260
Suck it, monkeys!

459
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,240
I'm going home!

460
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,040
Must be tour.

461
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,920
A drive.

462
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,760
The fight is alive.

463
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,720
So do your loss.

464
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,640
No on those.

465
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,340
Pick that up.

466
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,340


467
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,340


468
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,340


469
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,580
Those French fries, yum yum yum!

470
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,040
Bueller, Bueller, Bueller

471
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,300
It's two degrees cold

472
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,120
The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long

473
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,220
Six words to help us all

474
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,860
We accept no one of us

475
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,640
Bluebird Gobble, Bluebird Gobble

476
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,480
We accept it, we accept it

477
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,980
We accept no one of us

478
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,940
We accept no one of us

479
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,380
I am no one of us, I am your blue man

480
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,700
We gave you song, we kicked it down

481
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,420
Give me my twenty thousand in cash

482
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,400
We gave you song, we kicked it down

483
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,120
I think you woke up the dead with that flash

484
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,100
We gave you song, we kicked it down

485
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,340
Woah, this is not my batman axe

486
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,560
We gave you song, we kicked it down

487
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,180
We accept no one of us

488
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,280
We gave you song, we kicked it down

489
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,540
We accept no one of us

490
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,600
We gave you song, we kicked it down

491
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,200
We accept no one of us

492
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,920
We accept no one of us

493
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,500
Hello, America Land!

494
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,440
I bring you tidings from London.

495
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,280
Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

496
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,300
Still, there are only two and a half people in Trafalgar Square.

497
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,260
I think this is terrible. Where are all the drunks?

498
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,880
I was led to believe London was a council of sinners and idiots.

499
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,680
I didn't mean idiots. Don't come and kill me.

500
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,800
We won't kill you. We admire you.

501
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,440
That was Reverend Diva Schematic from her live TV appearance on a plinth in Trafalgar Square.

502
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,120
Reverend Diva is also the editor of that amazing song, which we just heard,

503
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,520
which is also a YouTube video, friends.

504
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,140
You really should check it out.

505
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,360
It's called Golden Age of Video by Ricardo Autobahn.

506
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,720
I strongly suggest you Google Golden Age of Video Ricardo Autobahn.

507
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,340
It's a great podcast.

508
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,000
It's on youtube.com.co.uk.

509
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,900
We also heard some ranting from Starwood 2009, and we'll hear more.

510
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,680
But first, back to podcast number 29, right where you are sitting now.

511
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,820
You said you'd selected some modern-day cults for us to talk about.

512
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,360
Obviously, we've talked about birthers.

513
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,620
Who else have you selected?

514
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,780
Well, there's apparently always has been and always will be groups of people who specialize in hazing,

515
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,920
hating certain other groups.

516
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,980
The number one targets being Masons, Catholics, and Jews.

517
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Well, actually, that's three different targets there.

518
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,640
And there's still a few witch burners around, if only they could find any proper witches.

519
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,440
I know a lot of Wiccans, but they're not worth burning.

520
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,800
I mean, their magic powers do not make them powerful enough to be worth burning.

521
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,780
But I still...

522
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:08,200
I certainly have known a lot of people who thought that the Masons were funded by the devil,

523
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,300
and or the Catholics, and or the Jews.

524
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,120
These are all the same entity.

525
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,080
Masons, Catholics, Jews.

526
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,360
Oh, and Muslims, I guess.

527
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,380
In fact, I've been called...

528
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:27,940
There's quite a few people over the years who've called me a pagan, Masonic, Catholic, Jewish, Hindu, Satanist.

529
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,820
And a commie.

530
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,800
Now, the funny thing is, my next-door neighbor actually does, is all of those,

531
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,700
and, well, not a few, except for the Catholic part.

532
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,280
He's a Masonic, pagan, Jewish, Satanist.

533
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,720
And he's gay, to boot.

534
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:00,640
So, you know, among the subgeniuses, we can actually outdo the evil that is being imagined by the various hate kooks.

535
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,260
Hmm.

536
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,760
Yeah, so...

537
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,020
I'm not trying to put down hate.

538
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,160
Subgeniuses hate everything normal.

539
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,700
But, as I said, we...

540
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,340
Comes by our hatin' fair and square.

541
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,160
It's really...

542
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:23,780
It's really soul food that the number systems of your own mind,

543
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,780
you are made in the image of our Heavenly Father.

544
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,040
Yahweh is the Spirit.

545
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,040
And 33 is the most influential of all numbers.

546
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,740
We're going to deal again with part two, where we left off.

547
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:46,280
And we were talking about, if you will, the three double-digit numbers

548
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:53,720
that are rooted in the single-digit numbers record special emphasis and attention.

549
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,000
And these are 11, 22, and 33.

550
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,700
These are the master numbers because they possess more potential than any other numbers.

551
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,400
They are highly charged, difficult to handle, and require time.

552
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,380
They're maturity and great efforts to integrate into one's personality.

553
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,180
So, if you're trying to grow up as a calf in a stall,

554
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,940
33 is the most influential of all the numbers.

555
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:26,600
11 is the most intuitive, and 22 is the most powerful.

556
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,020
There are 22 words in the Hebrew language,

557
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,760
and that's not by...

558
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,180
By chance, ladies and gentlemen.

559
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,100
That was designed by our Heavenly Father.

560
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:44,060
And the master numbers, again, like the master numbers 11, 22, and 33,

561
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,780
represent a triangle.

562
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,680
And another way to look at it would be a triangle of enlightenment.

563
00:30:51,800 --> 00:31:01,500
So, we hope and trust that we can give you the core numbers of the master numbers,

564
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:14,760
which is, indeed, the numbers of 11 and the numbers, if you will, of 22 and 20...

565
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,600
Or 33.

566
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,440
11, 22, and 33.

567
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,880
Hello.

568
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,720
It's me, Bernard.

569
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,640
I am a card...

570
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,200
Well, I lost my card in 2002.

571
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,160
But I am a registered...

572
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,080
I am a registered U.S. member.

573
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,820
I just want to say that these Federalists here in the United States are going to get

574
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,040
what's coming to them real soon.

575
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,220
These so-called Americans are going to get what's coming to them real soon for being

576
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,620
the ringleader of the vast global conspiracy.

577
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,240
These UFOs that have been appearing since 2006, they know what's going on.

578
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,780
And even other alien beings out in this world, they know what's going on.

579
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,840
They know what the United States is.

580
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,100
And anyone who's friendly with the United States is going to get what's coming to them.

581
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,100
But the future is grim, my friends.

582
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,400
If you want to imagine...

583
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,720
If you want to know what the future is, imagine a pipe smoking in a human face forever!

584
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,200
That's a quote from famous literature.

585
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,500
I wouldn't expect you subgeniuses to pick up on that.

586
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,300
Which brings me to the subject of crime.

587
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,620
I'm sorry.

588
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,400
Cooks and Bobbies.

589
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,900
Well, now, we're all kooks, and I was the first Bobby.

590
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,480
But did you ever wonder if you...

591
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:48,020
I mean, you know, when you're late at night, alone, did you ever wonder if maybe you were

592
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,240
really a braying jackass?

593
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,880
Well, you can quit wondering about that, friends.

594
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,880
I sure did.

595
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,600
Because one man's kook, as Reverend Richard Scull said recently, one man's kook is a

596
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:08,480
man's presidential candidate, is another man's gay lover, is another man's clip art-based

597
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,040
deity!

598
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,060
Praise Bob!

599
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,220
And one thing that we've learned from the kooks, and believe me, the Church of the Subgenius,

600
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,300
I mean, obviously, it attracts kooks.

601
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:27,120
But then there's, you know, it takes all kinds, but then there's the kind it doesn't take.

602
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,980
And we get a lot of those.

603
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:37,060
And one thing we've learned from that kind of kook is that everything, everywhere proves

604
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:46,540
that everything everywhere is a satanic, pagan, Masonic, Jewish, homosexual, Mexican negro.

605
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,960
That's what I've learned from the kooks.

606
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,340
Everything proves that.

607
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,940
I have been called all of those things at once!

608
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,960
Have there ever been any anti-subgenius groups?

609
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,900
In the past, other than the legal wranglings recently?

610
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,260
Not nearly enough.

611
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:11,140
In fact, we've had to organize our own fake hate groups.

612
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,100
That happened in London recently.

613
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:20,780
When we were having our main X-Day gathering in the States, there was simultaneously one

614
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,700
on July 5th at a club in London.

615
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,380
It was indoors.

616
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,060
I think they may even have lost money on it.

617
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,060
But they did promote the thing quite a bit.

618
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:43,320
And there's a video you can see of the British group, or the London area group, in Hyde Park.

619
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,320
And half of them are dressed in funny spacesuits holding Bob signs.

620
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,760
The other half are pretending to be vicious Bob haters.

621
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,360
Because it's hard to believe.

622
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,360


623
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:02,800
The other half are trying to get anybody to take us seriously enough to hate us properly.

624
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,980
In an organized fashion.

625
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,920
There are plenty of people who hate the Church's subgenius, but it's for all the wrong reasons.

626
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,880
It's because they think we're connected with the Masons and the Devil and so forth.

627
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,680
We might be, but that's not the best reason.

628
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:24,100
The main reason to hate us is because we want to see most of humanity destroyed.

629
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,340
Is that funny?

630
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,120
That's too much to ask, and I don't blame them for it.

631
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:37,800
If they really knew, if these meanly-mouthed, love-burger, New Age hippies and Christians knew what was in our heads,

632
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,720
they would kill us, one and all, before we kill them.

633
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,880
But we are subgeniuses, and we do believe in slack.

634
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,120
And that means we're waiting for the aliens to come and do all our killing for us.

635
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,520
Yeah.

636
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,280
So...

637
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,100
We actually do not recommend that subgeniuses kill anybody at all.

638
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:00,840
No.

639
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,800
It's...

640
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,900
Because you never know.

641
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,140
The person you're killing might be a subgenius you happen to not like.

642
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:12,760
So we insist that you wait and let Bob and the aliens from Planet X handle all of that.

643
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,520
Yeah, yeah.

644
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,080
All the kook-bashing.

645
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,560
We'll let our alien friends handle that.

646
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:53,920
So, how about we go back to the beginning?

647
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,100


648
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,100


649
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,100


650
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,100


651
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,120
I'm going to go back to the beginning.

652
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,160
Okay.

653
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,260
Here we go.

654
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,260


655
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,260


656
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,260


657
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,260


658
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,840
We should get to see the way you really are for a while.

659
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,520
Punching up or punching down, either way you're just looking for that willing clown.

660
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,600
It's just a nest to hide your stash, take off your clothes and hoax down that rast.

661
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,200
The facts you spin, the conclusions you reach, are they true or are you on a leash?

662
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,240
This is the farthest you can go.

663
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,240


664
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,240


665
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,240


666
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,500
That's a scam.

667
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,280
Your downfall comes to lizard by your own hand.

668
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,360
The flickering chives at whose expense?

669
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,100
Your hopes are pinned on convoluted common sense.

670
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,340
The air is foul, what do you mean?

671
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,240
The play revolves around props you haven't seen.

672
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,480
The taste is sweet, so you swear it's good.

673
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,180
You justify it just the way the rest of us would.

674
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,320
The ticking bomb won't go off yet.

675
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,940
There'll be nothing to collect when you win your bet.

676
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,340
Go on, Bob.

677
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:03,340


678
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,460
Go now, lick the boots of strife.

679
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,160
And come back and tell me what you've learned about life.

680
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,940
You don't know.

681
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,240
You don't care.

682
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,040
You only care about the hairspray in your hair.

683
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:24,020
Whatever you do, whatever you say, your only purpose is to ruin my day.

684
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:02,100
Yeah, but there's one time I gotcha heavy.

685
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,180
Just dumplings?

686
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:02,820
Yeah, maybe dust snowball effect.

687
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,320
Uh ah.

688
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,320


689
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,320


690
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,320


691
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,320


692
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,320


693
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,320


694
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,320


695
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,640
A stroke victim, for example, will describe in detail a conference he attended over the weekend

696
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,440
when in fact he has not left the hospital.

697
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:21,240
Even so-called normal people sometimes have a tendency to confabulate rather than admitting,

698
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,360
I don't know.

699
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:30,380
Some people will make up an answer or an explanation and express it with complete conviction,

700
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,460
believing it themselves as they make it up.

701
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:41,720
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob, Bob Dobbs, he's no fool,

702
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,960
he's the head of that subgenius church, which means he's super cool.

703
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,040
Is this a religious thing, that's it, Bob?

704
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,740
Yeah, it's some mindless acolyte of Bob.

705
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,160
Oh, Bob's been good to me, so I...

706
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:06,660
I say thank you, Bob, for giving me the tee-hee-hee that helps me fight the conspiracy.

707
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,540
Oh, Bob's been good to me.

708
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,320
Goodness gracious, what a lot of Bob Bob bobbing.

709
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,440
He's Bob Bob bobbing along.

710
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,180
He's speaking and removing all doubt.

711
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,580
Yes, he's speaking and removing all doubt.

712
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,000
And that is the way it is done, ladies and gents.

713
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:29,940
Fine.

714
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,380
This is Bob One, reminding you that you can buy A1 slacks at a store near you.

715
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,360
More slacks?

716
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,140
Depending on where you live.

717
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,880
Welcome, Bob One.

718
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,100
Thank you, Bob.

719
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,160
You're welcome, Dad.

720
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:45,680
You know, somebody who called himself Bob Dobbs wanted to be my Facebook buddy.

721
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,200
Yeah, he wanted to be mine, and I wouldn't let him.

722
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,160
I wouldn't let him either.

723
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,880
I actually ignored him.

724
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,900
Me too, I ignored him.

725
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,880
How funny, we all ignored him.

726
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,760
Well, because he...

727
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,540
If you're listening, Bob Dobbs, what does this mean?

728
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,360
It means that you forgot something very important.

729
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:07,420
And I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you need, when you make such an approach, to include what you did not.

730
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,900
So, better luck next time, Bob Dobbs.

731
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,040
Yeah.

732
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,900
There's a difference between feeling pain and being in pain.

733
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,220
There's a difference between feeling Bob and being Bob.

734
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,880
Yeah.

735
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,640
Bob.

736
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:28,880
The complete disassociation of the sensory dimension of pain from its affective, cognitive, and behavioral compounds.

737
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,760
There you go.

738
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,300
And it's up.

739
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,480
Is it the disassociation of pain's affective components from its sensory discriminative compounds?

740
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,140
Well, we can learn a lot from them.

741
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,240
I looked at all the people that I've chosen.

742
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,680
Bob Dobbs.

743
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,400
Crossing the painful threshold.

744
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:51,420
And feeling the piercing, ranting pain of a mutual, multi-dotted face of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

745
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,460
I decided this is, but I don't like them.

746
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,700
Don't like whom, my boy?

747
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,140
Oh.

748
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:00,740
Everyone.

749
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,420
I mean, no one.

750
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,940
Every dot in Bob's face?

751
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,060
Every dot in Bob's face.

752
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,440
For that is what everyone is.

753
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,720
Because I am equally.

754
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,800
Your fellow humans are dots in Bob's face.

755
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,180
In my comments.

756
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,240
And dots incredible, ladies and gentlemen.

757
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:13,560
Dots.

758
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,880
Dots are the way it is.

759
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,280
Dots are truly fantastic.

760
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,740
That's truly fantastic.

761
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,180
I was just editing all that.

762
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,820
And here's a funny thought.

763
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,380
Okay.

764
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,240
Beep.

765
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,000
And it's 9-11.

766
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,100
The past has been called.

767
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,800
2001.

768
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,880
The moment doomed.

769
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,160
The troubadour in trouble.

770
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,160
The disciple of today.

771
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,000
451.

772
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:30,800
Bobby.

773
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,320
Bob.

774
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:32,440
Bob.

775
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:32,820
Bob.

776
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,280
It's that big bulbous Bob again.

777
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:35,840
Bob.

778
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,060
Bob.

779
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,280
The bulging and barging into our show.

780
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,260
All real Americans.

781
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:39,880
Yeah.

782
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,760
Love.

783
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,620
Bob.

784
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,040
The sting of Bob Dobbs.

785
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,880
Natural fluid.

786
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,980
The sting of Bob Dobbs.

787
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,320
Bob.

788
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,780
Bob.

789
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,320


790
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,700
Bob.

791
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,100
Bob.

792
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,420
Bob.

793
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:50,760
Bob.

794
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,080
Bob.

795
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,400
Bob.

796
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,520
Bob.

797
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,280
Bob.

798
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,660
Bob.

799
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,000
Bob.

800
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,000


801
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,000


802
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,920
Bob.

803
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm triggered by a 7.6 heart cancer.

804
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,120
A Russian cosmonaut.

805
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,360
A various cancer.

806
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,540
Very powerful U.S. astronaut and wealthy tourist from Canada are violently shaken in the rubble.

807
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,840
Communication has been cut off with PR News.

808
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,420
The White House calls this a menace to society.

809
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,020
On Wall Street, 6-7-7-12.

810
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,040
This is PR News.

811
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,520
The Obama is lightning.

812
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,800
The money will come from the multi-billion dollar PR News program.

813
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,760
This represents history.

814
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,340
He paid $30 and is trying to publicize the problem of PR News.

815
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:33,240
So before we let you go, are there any other last cults you want to bring up?

816
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,180
How about marijuana worshippers?

817
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,040
I've run into a lot of people who believe that drugs are the answer.

818
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,000
Some of them, marijuana is all they need.

819
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:52,700
The other ones, it's mushrooms or LSD or DMT.

820
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,060
They can be real snobs.

821
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,160
I've noticed.

822
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,600
The wine drinkers look down on the beer drinkers.

823
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,240
The pot smokers look down on the wine drinkers.

824
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,280
And the coffee drinkers hate them all.

825
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,240
I am a coffee drinker.

826
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,140
Yeah, me too.

827
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,220
Among other things.

828
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,840
But the coffee is the only one that they cannot.

829
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,880
They'll take my coffee away when they pry it out of my cold, dead face.

830
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,740
Do you find yourself crying at funerals?

831
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,320
Do you ever feel clumsy when you're in an awkward situation?

832
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,640
When you laugh, do you often find yourself gasping for breath?

833
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:44,620
If so, ask your doctor when he can start putting you on more normalin.

834
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:49,920
It's designed to allow you to enjoy the illusion of being the person you always thought you wanted to be,

835
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,580
but may not have been sure of.

836
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,440
If you ever thought you could be more normal,

837
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,040
more normalin may or may not be.

838
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,000
Side effects may include, but are not limited to,

839
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,180
simultaneous bleeding from the ear, nose, throat, and rectum,

840
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,580
bloody diarrhea and urination, frozen fingers, partial or full paralysis, diphtheria, gout,

841
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,640
morbid dental plaque, painful micturation, sudden inexplicable vomiting, tongue fur,

842
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,340
enlarged nostrils, and a slight possibility of detached limbs.

843
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,800
More normalin.

844
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,680
It can help you be more normal.

845
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,600
Use only as directed.

846
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:32,460
Check out my YouTube account, youtube.com slash revstang,

847
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,780
and you will find all the treasures in my favorites list.

848
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,780
And here's one, a cover of Negative Land's early song,

849
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,620
The Playboy Channel, performed by the 180 G's.

850
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,040
When all of a sudden

851
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,240
Wham!

852
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,980
The horrible noise comes in

853
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,300
And completely destroys your orgasm

854
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,640
On the Playboy Channel

855
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,560
There it goes again

856
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,860
That awful interference

857
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,060
Wrecking

858
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:24,220
Your orgasm

859
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,020
On the Playboy Channel

860
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,520
Yeah!

861
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,360
You've called the cable TV company six times

862
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,000
Each time the technician comes out

863
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,560
He can fix the problem

864
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,360
He is fine

865
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,900
When

866
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,200
Hello

867
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,900
That's a

868
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,000
More appropiate

869
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,900
Than you are

870
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,140
When you put the cable ...

871
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:02,360
Turn the TV off

872
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:02,640
That sound

873
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,760
Is more appropiate

874
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,660
Than your entire life

875
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,780
And it

876
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,480
Will stop you

877
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,100
Stop you

878
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,440
Stop you

879
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,600
From having

880
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,220
That

881
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:18,680
Oh

882
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,440
Oh

883
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,060
Oh

884
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,600
Oh

885
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:20,980
Oh

886
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,220
Oh

887
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,600
Oh

888
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,520
Hey, this is Bob from IINet.

889
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,580
Bob makes getting naked DSL in your home even easier.

890
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,660
Plug him in, Bob will get you naked in no time.

891
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,680
Won't you, Bob?

892
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,460
Fast broadband, all your local and national phone calls,

893
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,900
and no phone line rental.

894
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,020
Hallelujah.

895
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,560
Hallelujah.

896
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,780
So come on, you, Bob, naked, together.

897
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,180
This feels so right.

898
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,100
But not in the money.

899
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,760
But not in the money.

900
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,180
Hello, this is me, Bernard.

901
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,640
I just want to say, and I just want to declare,

902
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,300
that I believe that me, Bernard, I'm the last Bob.

903
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,780
I believe that I'm the last Bob,

904
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,920
because no one will step out and stick their necks out

905
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,040
who calls themselves subgeniuses against the establishment

906
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,460
and against the powers that...

907
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,840
I believe I'm the last Bob.

908
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,100
I believe that I'm a nexus.

909
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,540
Everything that I do, everything, you know, every move I make,

910
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,180
you know, I've observed that the conspiracy, you know,

911
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,100
you know, there's some kind of reaction, you know,

912
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,180
when a move I make, I believe I'm the last Bob.

913
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,040
Quite a few people walk up to me today and go,

914
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:23,940
Reverend Stang.

915
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,280
I...

916
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,800
Did you know that Bob spelled backwards still says Bob?

917
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,420
You've got me mixed up with J.R. Bob Dobbs.

918
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,080
I'm just, you know, I'm the clerk.

919
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,480
I'm the mail clerk, essentially.

920
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,520
He's a mail clerk?

921
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,600
I do the...

922
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,640
Whoa, you're a mail.

923
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,360
I do get to deposit the checks.

924
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,360
Like I said...

925
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,560
We're the funny weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.

926
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,500
So, do you have any...

927
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:50,020
I know you must be exhausted from receiving the most recent holy text from Bob,

928
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,300
but do you have any more...

929
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,840
Do you think Bob will send you any more holy...

930
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,080
Writings?

931
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,640
It happens constantly.

932
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,100
Bob speaks through many people,

933
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:06,080
and every year I assemble a new sermon for all purposes

934
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,540
out of whatever the new statements are from Bob

935
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:17,280
that people have discovered or channeled or whatnot.

936
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,280
I suppose in some cases they could be lying

937
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,500
and they just came up with it themselves and said Bob said it.

938
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't know.

939
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,220
There are certain types of lines, you know,

940
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,300
that just sound like something Bob would say.

941
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,660
Like, too much is always better than not enough.

942
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,460
Yeah, yeah.

943
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,280
That's one of my favorite mottos.

944
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,100
It's a lie, but it sounds great.

945
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,700
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

946
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,660
You'll still be blind, but at least your head will be warm.

947
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,880
We often leave out the second half,

948
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,440
the disclaimer part of those slogans.

949
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,060
We also sell...

950
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,040
We sell the kind of gimcrack and gee-gaw that a fan club would.

951
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,940
You get a bumper, stickers, T-shirts, all that kind of stuff.

952
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,300
It's enough that it keeps me from having to have a real job.

953
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,100
I haven't had a real job for anybody else in like 15 years now.

954
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,280
Yeah, that's pretty good going.

955
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,020
Yeah, I'm not exactly getting rich.

956
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,880
Bob Dobbs is the one who gets rich off of this, not me.

957
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,820
But I can sit here chattering away to you guys.

958
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,240
You're a millionaire in terms of slack, aren't you?

959
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,360
Pardon me?

960
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,180
In terms of slack, you're a millionaire.

961
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,820
That's exactly... Yeah.

962
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,420
Well, that was not always true.

963
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,140
There were years when I preached slack,

964
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,100
but had no slack at all myself, or very little,

965
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,840
because I was trying to raise a family,

966
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,860
work two jobs at once,

967
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,760
and the Church of the Subgenius.

968
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,400
I mean, it was...

969
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,920
I led a slackless life,

970
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,280
so I know how valuable slack is.

971
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,740
And now I actually do have what I would...

972
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,720
I mean, it only is getting better at this point.

973
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,220
So I can tell your listeners

974
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:05,040
that although most everything you hear everywhere,

975
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,960
including the Church of the Subgenius' hogwash,

976
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,500
slack is real.

977
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,620
It is real.

978
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,140
You can achieve slack,

979
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,880
but only you know what your own slack is going to be.

980
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,240
In my case, it happened to be my marriage

981
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,440
to the beautiful Princess We Are Doe,

982
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,980
queen of all the UFOs.

983
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,900
And I'm expecting home from her real job any minute now.

984
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,120
But it's not just because she has a job

985
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,060
that she gives me slack.

986
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,320
In fact, she's going to be retiring in December,

987
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,820
and we'll both be able to travel a whole lot more.

988
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,960
And I'm hoping to spend more time overseas

989
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,340
and maybe meet y'all.

990
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,040
Yeah, yeah.

991
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,260
You have to come back to the UK again.

992
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,380
Yeah.

993
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,620
I mean, I'm sure we will.

994
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,940
It's getting to be...

995
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,220
Nowadays, it's...

996
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,840
It costs about as much for me to fly to London

997
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,940
as it would cost for me to go to California.

998
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,580
Yeah, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

999
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,080
I'm actually possibly a little closer to London.

1000
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,700
But I still have trouble with the language, obviously.

1001
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,040
Yeah, well, you know,

1002
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,080
it takes a while to learn the English.

1003
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,760
But yeah, thanks a lot for coming on again.

1004
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,820
We'll definitely have to have you back on as soon as possible.

1005
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:18,720
Praise Bob.

1006
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,900
Praise Kim.

1007
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,000
Praise Ken.

1008
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,800
Praise you, Reverend Stang.

1009
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,680
Yeah, praise you.

1010
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,280
Thanks to Ken and Ken of right where you are sitting now.

1011
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:37,520
And you can get more of that from sittingnow.co.uk.

1012
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,600
Also, thanks to Bernard for the calls.

1013
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,220
Thanks to The Large and Lemur and Signal to Noise for the collages.

1014
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,500
This is Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1015
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,540

1017
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,480
And the background music here is Witch Disco,

1018
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,040
recorded live at Starwood.

1019
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,840
Witch Disco, which is everybody from ESO,

1020
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,320
except for the late Chaz Smith.

1021
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,060
Hey, praise Bob.

1022
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,460
Praise Bob.

1023
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,980
Praise Bob.

1024
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:23,060


1025
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:23,060


1026
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:23,060


1027
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:24,540


1028
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:24,540


1029
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:24,540


1030
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:24,540


1031
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,360
How can we live with this threat?

1032
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,280
Our best life insurance may be summed up in four words.

1033
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,080
The Hour of Slack.

1034
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,760
This will take some doing on your part.

1035
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,780
It will take slack to survive.

1036
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,820
Praise Bob.

1037
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,260
Praise Bob.

1038
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,180
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1039
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,900
The greatest salesman who ever lived.

1040
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,900
And remember, X-Day is coming again.

1041
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,440
Check out subgenius.com.

1042
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,100
I must now check my messages.

1043
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,000
I wish I'd bought a prop.

1044
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,400
And we know that there are blood cults around the Earth today,

1045
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,840
and we have thousands and thousands of Aryan children

1046
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,020
that disappear in these blood cult rituals every year.

1047
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:28,860
There is innumerable numbers of these children, and adults also,

1048
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:34,300
that they're using in these ritualistic cults

1049
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:40,520
where they literally sexually pervert them and sodomize them

1050
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,460
and other things that we could mention,

1051
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,340
and it's almost too barbaric and too embarrassing to talk about.

1052
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,920
But however, we bear record that the Book of Psalms said they ate,

1053
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,720
the dead, and drank their blood.

1054
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,700
David realized that.

1055
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:02,860
It was these ancient descendants of Cain.

1056
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,220
Cain has got a bloodline that goes back to him himself,

1057
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,740
who was cannibalizing the body of Abel,

1058
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,540
drinking his blood.

1059
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,800
And when he returned back to Yahweh,

1060
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,720
he sought favor.

1061
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,520
He said, now what do you think about me?

1062
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,020
Have I got the right blood now?

1063
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,780
And he would literally drink the blood,

1064
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,240
of Abel's body,

1065
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,080
and reappeared to Yahweh.

1066
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,580
And the first thing Yahweh asked him, he said,

1067
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,240
where's your brother?

1068
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,460
