1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Haven't you figured it out by now, those of you who listened to the program for a while?

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,760
The reason it's a little different is that this audience is a little different.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,680
And the reason this audience is a little different is because I'm a little different,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,200
and I'm a little different because I want to reach the people who are never going to go to your church.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,160
No.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,360
Exciting.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,180
Turn on.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,440
And now, the Sucky Genius.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:39,420
What are we doing? What are we doing with the money?

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,700
Well, honestly, we're spending. We're paying a huge, huge stout salary.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,260
I mean, like yesterday, they were counting in a huge box of money.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,220
She says, look, Bob, it was so good to look at that.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,080
With your dear, dear host in prayer.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,760
Partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:06,180
Presented to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,920
In the name of J.R. Bob Dole.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,020
Yes, dear friends, we're back.

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,100
And it's so clean in here this time.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,220
Yes.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,140
We.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,220
Actually cleaned up Tarzan's radio station.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,540
So named because of the treehouse-like effect that it gives when you look at it.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,840
There's microphones hanging by vines from sticks and things like that.

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,560
But in the process of cleaning, and theoretically, you won't hear me knocking cassettes off the table anymore.

25
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:47,940
Oh.

26
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,820
Well.

27
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,980
Or not as much.

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,420
And in the process of cleaning up.

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,380
The mountains and mountains of little Wellman heads and cassettes.

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,160
I've stumbled onto lots of wonderful old tapes that I'd sort of forgotten existed.

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,500
Including this Nina Rota music in the background here.

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,100
I've been looking for this for years.

33
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,240
And so I'm just going to mix a little bit of the old and the new.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,280
To most of you, even the old will seem new.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,880
Well, here's some new.

36
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,380
Let's listen to this Jesus fellow here just briefly, eh?

37
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,700
Now think.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,360
Have I launched the head today?

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,240
Have I helped others launch the head?

40
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,560
L. Launch the head.

41
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,560
Now L also stands for the luck plane.

42
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,900
Now this is something that when you're a subgenius you come to understand.

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,900
Bob is the center of the luck plane.

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,500
Now most people, we call it surfing the luck plane.

45
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,320
Most people don't even know that they're on the luck plane.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,980
They don't even know they have a surfboard.

47
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,040
Now you guys have wisdom.

48
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,500
Again, you haven't even paid your 30 bucks and I've just told you something else.

49
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,040
You're way ahead of everybody else because you know you're on the luck plane.

50
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,440
And once you know you're on the luck plane, you can begin to manipulate it.

51
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,900
You can begin to ride that wave.

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,040
And I'll tell you, it's true.

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
Most people, they're on the board.

54
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,920
Everybody's on the board.

55
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,660
And they're just paddling along with their arms and legs hoping to get by.

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,700
And you become a subgenius.

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,220
You learn slowly to use the luck plane for yourself.

58
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,580
Because that's all we really want.

59
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,400
That's all you want.

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,100
That's all you really, really need to get by in life.

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,660
Think about it.

62
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,000
Think about it.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,140
How does a band like the Beatles become as popular as they become?

64
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,340
Or Madonna or Michael Jackson or any of these people?

65
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,340
Why them and not everybody else?

66
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,640
Luck.

67
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,220
Now a lot of people might say, well, it's just good marketing.

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,820
No.

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,500
There's a lot of people with good marketing.

70
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,300
It's luck.

71
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,960
And that is the only thing you need.

72
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,600
This is a message to all churches denomination.

73
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,360
Respect is due to be judged.

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,160
I've lost my mind.

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,620
Okay.

76
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,920
I think this guy up there.

77
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,640
You're listening to a diamond amusement park in a very good style.

78
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:12,640


79
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:12,640


80
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:12,640


81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:12,640


82
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,260
History and let your old not see it saying, Oh, God.

83
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,020
Exactly.

84
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,220
He's gotze.

85
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,440
Huh?

86
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,120
He said, Simba Ignition.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,680
We're trying even harder, right?

88
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,200
Bobby the印ic.

89
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,660
No.

90
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,040
So you don't pay for it.

91
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,060
Is this life for me?

92
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,360
To do this?

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,360


94
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,360


95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,360


96
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,360


97
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,380
No.

98
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,200
Oh, yes, if I'd be old time religion.

99
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,320
If I'd be old time religion.

100
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,460
If I'd be old time religion.

101
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,600
Because if it's good enough, all right.

102
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,700
If it was good for Moses and David.

103
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,060
If it was good for David and Solomon.

104
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,520
Ah, yes.

105
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,940
All right, Dallas.

106
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,060
All right, wherever you are, everywhere but Dallas.

107
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, dear friends.

108
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,880
I have never seen the image of a bald-headed Jesus yet.

109
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,240
Although, the current living Jesus actually is an Italian.

110
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,340
But he is a, well, he's not exactly a dreadlock feller.

111
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,740
But he looks like Jesus is supposed to look, you know, with the long hair and the beard and so forth.

112
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,180
I'm working on the Moses bit myself.

113
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,380
I can't grow a beard.

114
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,320
I can't grow a beard for hooey.

115
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,000
But I got the long graying hair.

116
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,160
We're working on that, friends.

117
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,660
Let's see what else is on this ancient type.

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,200
Day by day, you will become more and more relaxed.

119
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Each day, you will experience a new delightful sense of quiet peace and perfect contentment.

120
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,280
This enjoyable sensation will launch you into...

121
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,900
The soul.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,380
The soul.

123
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,640
The soul.

124
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,640


125
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,280
Oh, oh.

126
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,620
Not that again.

127
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Time.

128
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,360
It is showtime.

129
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,100
It's showtime.

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,640
And the show must go on, baby.

131
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,520
Come with me and you will see.

132
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,240
We are stepping high.

133
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,240
What is the name of our show?

134
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,260
Love Genius Radio.

135
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,740
Well, obviously, that's just going to go on like that.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,880
That was a great old intro.

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,820
Yeah, there it is.

138
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,180
High in the sky.

139
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,060
We will dance.

140
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,020
We will sing to please you.

141
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,100
You are stepping high, high, baby.

142
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,880
But don't forget that I am here.

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,600
Yes, dear friends, that man is driven by Bob Dobbs.

144
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,340
He's got to be.

145
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,080
He's got to be.

146
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,640
This is Ken Nordean.

147
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,280
Sometimes I wonder if I know where I'm going.

148
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,760
I go for a walk like this.

149
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,140
And it seems I have been walking for years and years and years.

150
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,960
I've been mixing for years and years.

151
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,360
And I don't know where I'm going.

152
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,740
I hear the sound leading me on.

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,820
And I don't know where it is taking me.

154
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,720
I see people.

155
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,680
I see people rushing someplace.

156
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,700
They seem to know where they're going.

157
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,060
And they're getting there in such a hurry.

158
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,280
But where am I going?

159
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,680
You know where you're going.

160
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,160
Maybe you could tell me.

161
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,760
And then I could go along with you.

162
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,880
What's the matter with you, bud?

163
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,500
You in a fog?

164
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,280
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,240
No.

167
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,080


168
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,080


169
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,080


170
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,080


171
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,080


172
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,080


173
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,500
I don't even know why I'm there.

174
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,260
God

175
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,360
Come on, you human beings are not human.

176
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,640
I fotoshocked myself in my protect center sleeping on top of it.

177
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,100


178
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,720
Look at me, at you.

179
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:12,720


180
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:12,720


181
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,700
One look and you know what you're going through.

182
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,020
Well, I know what you're going through.

183
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,220
And I has nothing 번째.

184
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,600
Well, I vig community in a récup.

185
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,600
I know where I'm going.

186
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,720
Sometimes I feel as if I'm getting closer.

187
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,140
Like now.

188
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,580
Yes, I am getting closer.

189
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,040
You hear?

190
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,380
The sound is getting louder.

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,520
Yes.

192
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,460
But it's getting blacker.

193
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,260
And blacker.

194
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,940
And blacker.

195
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,720
Help!

196
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,660
Help!

197
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,740
Help!

198
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,060
Help!

199
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,960
Help!

200
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,920
Help!

201
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,180
When you're on, you're not you.

202
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,960
You make me rich.

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,940
A big business man with a big company.

204
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,460
And everyone.

205
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,480
Everyone kowtows to you when you come around.

206
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,220
But when you're lost, you're a nobody.

207
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,880
You're just a lost person, that's all.

208
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,880
And unless and until someone or something gets you straightened around

209
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,240
so that you know which direction to travel,

210
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,500
you just don't amount to very much.

211
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,520
You're not worth anything to yourself

212
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,700
and you're not worth anything to anybody else.

213
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,560
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you

214
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,460
that it's often a photon that light releases,

215
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,380
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

216
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,400
Bob.

217
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,580
Bob.

218
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,220
Bob.

219
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,000
Bob.

220
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,260
Bob.

221
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,760
Bob.

222
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,020
Bob.

223
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,020


224
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,060


225
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,380
Bob is sex.

226
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,260
That's your key phrase.

227
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,780
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

228
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,960
We are controlling transmission.

229
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,680
Three, two, and one.

230
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,600
Now to continue with the tape recording.

231
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,440
Now Bob, Bob's the luckiest man in the world.

232
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,340
Bob's never made a mistake.

233
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,400
Um, and the mistakes that Bob does make,

234
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,120
when he does make them,

235
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,980
in the long run, are not mistakes at all,

236
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,600
but just a way for him to make more money.

237
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,780
Uh, you know, Bob could break his leg and then make a million dollars.

238
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,900
And it doesn't all make sense to us,

239
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,280
but when you're riding the luck plane,

240
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,720
it all comes together.

241
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,900
So, L.

242
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,200
Launch the head.

243
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,620
A.

244
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,760
Third letter in slack, A.

245
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,100
Acknowledge your superiority.

246
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,340
This is very important.

247
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,580
Once you've made a mistake,

248
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,660
you're a subgenius.

249
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,320
You realize you're not just different than everybody else,

250
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,980
you're better than everybody else.

251
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,960
Now when you're a subgenius, you must realize this.

252
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,360
You must cultivate it.

253
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,840
Because, yes, you are better than everyone else around you.

254
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,000
And all this time you just thought you were weird, or,

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,280
you know, a lot of us have gone through life,

256
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,580
been in school, we were the outcast.

257
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,340
Or maybe even in our adult life, we're still the outcast.

258
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,600
And we're thinking, well, what's wrong?

259
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,200
Well, your superiority is what is wrong.

260
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,120
Now, that doesn't mean you don't make mistakes.

261
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,240
It just means that, well, you're better.

262
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,920
Now, if you go around as a subgenius

263
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,080
and tell everybody that you're better than everybody else,

264
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,880
well, you're going to be real annoying,

265
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,900
and, you know, not really have all that many friends.

266
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,580
And a lot of subgeniuses make this mistake.

267
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,700
But you have to remember that part of being better than everybody else

268
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,580
is realizing that you're not just different than everybody else.

269
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,340
You're not really better than everybody else.

270
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,100
Like, take this person next to me, for instance.

271
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,360
I can tell by looking at her that she is better than me.

272
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,300
And by me recognizing that she's better than me,

273
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,940
that makes me better than her.

274
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,180
But you need to do this, and as a subgenius,

275
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,620
you are superior.

276
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,560
Yeah, God bless you, Bob.

277
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,060
Yeah.

278
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,260
Teams of Christians work at every airport in America,

279
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,360
waiting for the drug to take effect,

280
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,100
loading their helpless victims into waiting planes

281
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,420
while airport officials and the FAA do nothing.

282
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,760
Make your children stay at home after school.

283
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,720
If they try to sneak out, beat them severely.

284
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,140
This is very important, as this blood cult of evil

285
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,520
targets places where teens congregate.

286
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,660
Shopping malls are among the best recruiting grounds

287
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,640
for young people to be lured into this false Christ's evil web.

288
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,340
If you would like more information about this threat to our American way, write to...

289
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,340


290
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,460
The true Jesus.

291
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,200
PO Box 140306.

292
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,600
Dallas, Texas.

293
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,240
75214.

294
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,340
Thank you.

295
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,400
Oh, friends, there you have it. You heard it.

296
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,460
It's all true. I know it's all true.

297
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,540
It's all there on paper. It's there. I can see it.

298
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,920
I can hold it. I can feel it. I can touch it.

299
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,640
They wrote it. We read it.

300
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,220
That settles it.

301
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,960
Uh, yes, dear friends, a little bit of Dr. Legume.

302
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,540
Uh, there on, on, uh, Ed Strange's show.

303
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,020
And, and, uh, that brings me to this old song that I...

304
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,820
Back when Dr. Legume died in that car wreck about a year or so ago,

305
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,780
I just searched all over for this old record, this old Roy Acuff record.

306
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,760
It doesn't have a damn thing to do with Church of the Subgenius,

307
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,080
but it's just a great old song, so here it is.

308
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,460
If, if you're, uh, if you were raised like me, you grew up with stuff like this.

309
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,060
Who did you say it was, brother?

310
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,740
Who was it fell by the way?

311
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,580
When whiskey and blood run together,

312
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,580
did you hear anyone pray?

313
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,520
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother.

314
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,460
I didn't hear nobody pray.

315
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,620
I heard the crash on the highway,

316
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,340
but I didn't hear nobody pray.

317
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,420
When I heard the crash on the highway,

318
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,180
I knew what it was from the start.

319
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,140
I went to the scene of destruction,

320
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,400
and a picture was stamped on my heart.

321
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,100
There was whiskey and blood all together,

322
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,220
mixed with glass where they lay.

323
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,180
Death lay,

324
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,060
and I laid her hand in destruction,

325
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,140
but I didn't hear nobody pray.

326
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,220
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother.

327
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,260
I didn't hear nobody pray.

328
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,480
I heard the crash on the highway,

329
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,300
but I didn't hear nobody pray.

330
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,820
I didn't hear nobody pray.

331
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,980
I wish I could change this sad story

332
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,740
that I am now telling you.

333
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,460
But there is no way I can change it,

334
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,780
for somebody's life is now through.

335
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,160
Their soul has been called by the master.

336
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,980
They died in a crash on the way.

337
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,240
I heard the groans of the dying,

338
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,960
but I didn't hear nobody pray.

339
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,100
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother.

340
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,060
I didn't hear nobody pray.

341
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,280
I heard the crash on the highway,

342
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,580
but I didn't hear nobody pray.

343
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,080
I didn't hear nobody pray.

344
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,080


345
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,080


346
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,080


347
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,080


348
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,620
Oh, yes, Roy Acuff, dear friends.

349
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,740
And when your time comes, my friend,

350
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,860
And when you're called by your maker, you gonna be ready?

351
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,800
You gonna be ready? I want you to listen to this recording.

352
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,960
Just think about it.

353
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,460
Call the next defendant.

354
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,740
Scott Camp to the bar.

355
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,500
Scott Camp, I sentence you to hell.

356
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,620
No, I have been saved.

357
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,420
I've been in church practically all my life.

358
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,840
Yes, you have grown up in church,

359
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,720
and you have certainly had an experience with your God.

360
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,160
But the record reveals that you have been unprofitable,

361
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,100
and the word decrees that the unprofitable servant

362
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,780
must be cast into outer darkness.

363
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,740
But when have I been unprofitable?

364
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
You have, Rebecca.

365
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,840
You have rebelled against my word,

366
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,020
and you have stolen your Lord's money.

367
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,980
While you lived upon the earth,

368
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,420
I permitted you to earn a good living.

369
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,180
As my servant, I gave you power and health to earn money,

370
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,740
and in return for this, I decreed in my word

371
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,400
that a tenth part of those earnings were mine.

372
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,300
I left that ten percent in your care,

373
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,780
charging you to invest it for me into my church

374
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,040
that the gospel might be preached.

375
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,720
But you, Scott, have rebelled against my word,

376
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,080
and you have not only taken ninety percent,

377
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,760
which I freely gave you,

378
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,060
but you have been so covetous as to take the ten percent also.

379
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,300
Did you know that rebellion is a sin of witchcraft,

380
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,000
and that no covetous person shall enter the kingdom of God?

381
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,200
Oh, sir, I tell you, I didn't realize it was so serious.

382
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,960
You made that choice when you were only eighteen.

383
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,580
Look at your record.

384
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,200
July fifteenth.

385
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,000
Nineteen fifty-three.

386
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,860
Will a man rob God?

387
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,420
Yeah, you have robbed me.

388
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,600
But you say, wherein have we robbed thee?

389
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,100
In tithes and offerings.

390
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,180
You are cursed with a curse,

391
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,300
for you have robbed me, even this whole nation.

392
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,780
No, God wouldn't do that.

393
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,020
He's a loving God.

394
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,520
Besides, there's plenty of people that have more money than I do.

395
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,500
I need mine.

396
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,300
Scott, you made your choice.

397
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,180
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

398
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,220
And to your eternal sorrow,

399
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,160
you have found that not only could you afford to give to God that which was his,

400
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,480
but you could not afford to do otherwise.

401
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,000
The Senate still stands.

402
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,740
Cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness,

403
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,340
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

404
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,960
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir.

405
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,880
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

406
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,860
Sir, no, no.

407
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,220
Let go. I don't want to go to hell.

408
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,080
Sir!

409
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,240
Call the next witness.

410
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:32,660
You, Janer Hypercletes, did ye not indeed launch that selfsame head of golf pro Arnold Palmer?

411
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,220
Lord, it was just a satire, Lord.

412
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,200
Yeah, that's right.

413
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,380
It was a satire on the unprofitable servant.

414
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,800
Yeah, that's what it was.

415
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,700
But whatever you do, yeah, please, Lord, cast me into that lake of fire.

416
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,840
Please cast me into that lake of fire.

417
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,720
Just do it.

418
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,720
Don't send me to subgenius hell.

419
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,580
Send him to subgenius hell, where he may join the others.

420
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,580
Tricked him again.

421
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,640
Lord, before I go, I, Janer Hypercletes, would like to tell you to...

422
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,980
No, I can't do that one.

423
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,540
Ha, hee, hee, hee.

424
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,080
Hmm.

425
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,840
Well, just think, friends, on the day of judgment,

426
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:25,780
old Reverend Stang will be forced to listen to every one of these tapes that he has put together for you.

427
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,580
Father, Son, Holy Cow!

428
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,220
Well, well.

429
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,660
Moses went up to the mountain high

430
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,360
to find out the God.

431
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,700
Why did you make us?

432
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,100
Why?

433
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,040
Secret words in a secret room.

434
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,500
He said,

435
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,760
Wop, bop, a-loo, bop, a-lop, bam, boom.

436
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,600
I did not put you here to suffer.

437
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,220
I did not put you here to whine.

438
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,840
I put you here to love one another.

439
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,980
And did I have a good time now, now, now?

440
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,840
Let my people go, go, go.

441
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,700
You gotta let my people go, go, go.

442
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,440
Let my people go, go, go.

443
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,660
You gotta let my people go.

444
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:29,880
Yeah.

445
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,820
Joseph fits a battle of Jericho.

446
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,380
He tells the boys with the horns, get down and blow.

447
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,000
They rear back, aim their bells at the stars.

448
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,500
He says, feed me big.

449
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,880
Daddy, they ain't to the bar.

450
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,620
I did not put you here to suffer.

451
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,160
I did not put you here to whine.

452
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,800
I put you here to love one another.

453
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,980
And did I have a good time now, now, now?

454
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,140
Let my people go, go, go.

455
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,740
You gotta let my people go, go, go.

456
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,400
Let my people go, go, go.

457
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,340
You gotta let my people go.

458
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,020
What I say.

459
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,660
Ah!

460
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,620
Now, when Jesus went out for a walk with his mother,

461
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,440
the scribes and the Pharisees, plotting hugger-mugger,

462
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,940
they locked him up and they threw away the key.

463
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,560
He said, why is everybody always picking on me?

464
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,440
I did not put you here to suffer.

465
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,160
No, I did not put you here to whine.

466
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,540
I put you here to love one another.

467
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,620
Yeah!

468
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,800
And did I have a good time now, now, now?

469
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,740
Let my people go, go, go.

470
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,500
Let my people go, go, go.

471
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,540
Hey, you got to, oh, you got to.

472
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,220
Let my people go, go, go.

473
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,940
You gotta let my people go, go, go.

474
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,620
Let my people go, go, go.

475
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,100
Sing a title.

476
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,580
I feel so bad about being a liar.

477
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,240
Let my people go, go, go.

478
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,860
You know, I think the winner to have a good time.

479
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,780
Let my people go, go, go.

480
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,840
Let my people go.

481
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,540
Got to let my people go.

482
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

483
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,360
Because you got me confused.

484
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,720
Confused?

485
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
Yeah, just a little bit there.

486
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,660
Okay.

487
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,680
Look, look, look.

488
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,460
You started out this conversation saying you're confused.

489
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,920
Well, now I'm confused.

490
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,640
So what's the point?

491
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Okay, what I'm saying is since I believe Lord Jesus is all-powerful

492
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,140
and nothing can be done without his permission,

493
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,160
I don't understand, you know, on the side of the Christians like me,

494
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,520
don't understand.

495
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,480
It sounds like you're trying to scare us.

496
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,700
I am trying to scare you.

497
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,340
I am trying to scare you.

498
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,480
I want you to wake up.

499
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm ready to go when the Lord tells me.

500
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,320
Mel.

501
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,740
Slack.

502
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,120
S.

503
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,380
Send your $30 to Bob.

504
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:35,880
L.

505
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:36,940
Launch.

506
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,800
Launch.

507
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,580
Launch the head.

508
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,920
A. Acknowledge your superiority.

509
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,640
C. The conspiracy.

510
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,220
Who is the conspiracy?

511
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,340
What is the conspiracy?

512
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,120
The conspiracy controls everything we think and do.

513
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,960
It's the people responsible for putting the bad TV shows on,

514
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,460
of making the bad movies.

515
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,560
The conspiracy is so intertwined and so complicated,

516
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,120
they don't even realize they're the conspiracy.

517
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,580
Because they're hiding the fact from themselves.

518
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,400
And really, we know who the conspiracy is,

519
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,780
and you know who the conspiracy is.

520
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,620
It's everyone that you don't like.

521
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,020
And furthermore, it's everyone that doesn't like you.

522
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,420
We are the only church who, for 15 years,

523
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,280
has been fighting the conspiracy.

524
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,080
Some of the things that the conspiracy does that are obvious

525
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,180
is things like cover up important truths like UFOs

526
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,060
or the JFK assassination,

527
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,800
the Holocaust,

528
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,160
the Apollo Earth,

529
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,620
you know, all these truths that we need to know more about

530
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,320
and, of course, are hidden from us because of the conspiracy.

531
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,080
So, the first thing you need to know about the conspiracy

532
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,380
is who the conspiracy is.

533
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,640
You need to recognize who the conspiracy is.

534
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,940
You'll never know who they are personally,

535
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,620
because it's bigger than that.

536
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,820
But you need to see the conspiracy all around you.

537
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,800
And once you see the conspiracy, you learn to better deal with it.

538
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,800
See it.

539
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,700
This is the conspiracy.

540
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,220
This is the biggest conspiracy.

541
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,260
The only big conspiracy.

542
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,360
The World is Over Now.

543
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,000
You can return to your base.

544
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,220
You're not trying hard enough.

545
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,040
Oh, that's certainly great.

546
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,800
Send us more money.

547
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,920
Yeah, more money.

548
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,940
How much would you like?

549
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,440
Fifty thousand, would you say that would do it?

550
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,400
Uh, checks in the mail.

551
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,460
All right, thank you.

552
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,140
You're welcome.

553
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,280
Next caller, please.

554
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,320
The automatic Bob Nelson.

555
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,080
We'll put the automatic Bob Nelson on.

556
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,900
Yes, okay.

557
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,040
Where's my thesaurus?

558
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,900
Ricky, Lucy.

559
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,760
Here, Bob, here's your head.

560
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,720
Put this part on.

561
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,740
Here we go.

562
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,240
Now drive this station down Shattuck Avenue.

563
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,500
Never going to stop.

564
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,520
Ain't got no spare.

565
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,480
We haven't got a spare for this program.

566
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,260
We don't have a jack for this program.

567
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,560
We don't even have a hydraulic foil for this program.

568
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,200
We're just going to drive until this program canes in.

569
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Go and go and go.

570
00:26:59,480 --> 00:26:59,920
Welcome.

571
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,520
I just want to say that Bob absolutely saved my life,

572
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,060
and I'm so glad you're there.

573
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,000
And I'm president of the Bill of Rights Club.

574
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,580
It can't be a radius, so I'm going to write you a letter

575
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,540
and tell them that you just aren't being treated like the good people you are.

576
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,320
Goodbye.

577
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
Thanks a lot, Mom, for calling to show it.

578
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,580
Squeaky, little squeaky.

579
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,380
Subdini Mind Control gone out of control.

580
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,120
They handed me this jar and said my brain was in it,

581
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,460
and then when the police came, they poured it down the sink.

582
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,280
He's been...

583
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,720
It's going down to Bob's new subgenius.

584
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,080
Hello.

585
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,660
Well, what can we do for you, caller?

586
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,960
Have you come to sing, entertain us, or do you have a parting question?

587
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,480
I thought this weird thing, you see.

588
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,000
You know how people often get reincarnated into this material plane,

589
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,220
no matter how hard they try?

590
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,380
Yeah, yeah, man.

591
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,340
I must have committed suicide 300 times,

592
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,500
and I keep ending up in the same lifetime in a slightly different observational universe.

593
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,000
And I had to talk to you guys because...

594
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,440
Yeah, man, that's really heavy.

595
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,560
It's deeper than I can handle.

596
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,960
Just lay it on us, man.

597
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,300
I keep being born on October 21st, 19...

598
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,660
1952, and I end up going through the same lifetime...

599
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,440
Oh, well, okay, your problem is you've got a bad case of the 50s.

600
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,080
I've seen it.

601
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,220
That grassy knoll just went around the country shooting people.

602
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,420
There were 10 people there shooting that looked just like Cary Thornley.

603
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,300
Got it, dead center.

604
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,300
Cary Thornley!

605
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,680
Ah!

606
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,320
Ah!

607
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,080
Thornley!

608
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,140
Yes, he was the guest that scared everybody.

609
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,060
Even the other...

610
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,980
Even the other stations were scared by Cary Thornley.

611
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,620
You scared me so much.

612
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,580
Is he gonna be at your convention?

613
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,200
Oh, yes.

614
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:24,940
Oh, good.

615
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,260
And here he is now, Gary Gibrofram and Little Bud Smith in the PE class.

616
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,840
No, no, no, money was well spent.

617
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,380
Here they are doing push-ups in the showers.

618
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,340
There's no water coming out of these showers, Doug.

619
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,680
Just this funny smell and gas.

620
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,040
No, no, no, don't worry about...

621
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,980
That's the P of V.

622
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,360
That's not water coming out of those showers, friends.

623
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,380
That's church air.

624
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,440
Yeah, funny thing.

625
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,200
Really tough hombre.

626
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:46,540
Yeah.

627
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:46,900
Yeah.

628
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,080
Yeah.

629
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,340
Yeah.

630
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,540
Yeah.

631
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:47,660
Yeah.

632
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:47,700
Yeah.

633
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:47,780


634
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:47,780


635
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:47,800


636
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:47,800


637
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah.

638
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,620
Yeah.

639
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,580
The music has gone and the mucus is up.

640
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,060
Oh, no.

641
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:51,920
Hello.

642
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,620
We're really testing callers this morning.

643
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:53,900
Good morning.

644
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,460
Good morning.

645
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,280
Are you man or woman enough to take the church?

646
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,020
Yes.

647
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,800
As a matter of fact, we're planning the overthrow of the convention.

648
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,040
Ah, that's what we like to hear.

649
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,740
That's what we hear.

650
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,160
That's true.

651
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,640
Yes, yes.

652
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,420
It's a kill ball.

653
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,300
Are there any secrets you can share with us at this time about how you'll be taking over

654
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,480
the convention?

655
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,080
A bloodless coup.

656
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,720
Yeah, by doing something so completely unpredictable it will totally...

657
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,680
Oh, he's in the P-Dawg.

658
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,080
He's in the P-Dawg school of tentative inconvenience whipping the dead dog with siloes.

659
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,300
Yeah.

660
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Yes, you see, I even wrote it.

661
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,180
I even wrote it to Dallas and said how predictable even the show has become.

662
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,840
It's James Joyce Nelson.

663
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
He's doing a monologue, an internal...

664
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,260
We can hear Nelson thinking.

665
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,580
Listen.

666
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,640
Well, at least there's no babies.

667
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,180
Let's get out of here before the babies fill up the room with that poopy stuff.

668
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,720
Oh, those stinking babies.

669
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,540
Standing diapers.

670
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,560
Well, if we walk out the door, the callers are going to call.

671
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,940
We can't let Nelson have a caller.

672
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,120
Right.

673
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,380
You're just going to have to stay there all night.

674
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,920
Yeah, well, only for another six and a half hours, actually.

675
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,340
Meanwhile...

676
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,640
They are yours to inspect in the privacy of your own home, shop, office, den for 20 years

677
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,960
or express permission already withdrawn by the Polk McKinley Harding Dobbs Coolidge Mint.

678
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,060
The only mint authorized stamp your application with its own seal.

679
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,320
Looks easy, doesn't it?

680
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,480
But it won't come off.

681
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,720
Yeah, exactly.

682
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,500
We were right the day we started this thing.

683
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,800
Yes, that's why the shop only has the right period.

684
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,900
Well, I've listened to Over the Edge, and I've had my callousness reinforced.

685
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,100
And brutalization therapy advanced to a higher possible state.

686
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,880
Well, one portion of Over the Edge...

687
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,600
We'll get you out of the 50.

688
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,380
Don't worry about it.

689
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,460
How long are you guys going to be on?

690
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,440
We're going to be on until they throw us out.

691
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,420
Or kill me!

692
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,200
Or kill me!

693
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Yes, and we're back.

694
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,960
And what credits do I need to give?

695
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:38,080
On side one of show, we heard that song, Let My People Go, is by the Rainmakers,

696
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,200
a band that I really loved.

697
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,800
And I think they just broke up.

698
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,220
I actually corresponded with the guy who...

699
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,580
The main songwriter in that band for a while.

700
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,540
And let's see.

701
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,960
And of course, some KPFA, Berklee Subgenius Radio show,

702
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,420
with puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Gary Brobefran, Glass Madness,

703
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,280
and special guest, G. Gordon Gordon.

704
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,100
And...

705
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,320
I have no idea what we're going to put on next,

706
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,880
but I guess we'll just find out in this circus-like crazy, crazy show,

707
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,120
The Subgenius Hour.

708
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,560
I have slack!

709
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,220
With that wacky preacher, Bob Dobbs,

710
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,240
and his nutty apostles,

711
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:22,940
Jesus,

712
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,020
Robert Stang,

713
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,360
Dr. Legume,

714
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,000
and the Circus Bocalypse,

715
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,220
Palmer Vreemies,

716
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,900
and Susie the Floozy.

717
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,820
Hey, that's what I'll do.

718
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,220
We'll put on a little...

719
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,800
We'll continue with Sister Susie the Floozy's yard sale

720
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,780
from WREK in Atlanta.

721
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,700
And with her...

722
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,080
We tune in.

723
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,360
Lots and lots of Thriving Plays.

724
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,780
She's not the only one on Susie,

725
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,680
and she is commiserating with her long-lost, just-found twin brother,

726
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,640
Dr. Nolan Void.

727
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,800
Oh, hey, lookie here.

728
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,320
If no one buys these canned goods, you're welcome to them.

729
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,220
Hey, nice selection.

730
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,100
Tripe with extra suet.

731
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,520
My favorite.

732
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,100
But the cans won't sit flat.

733
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,800
Nah, they're just a little swollen.

734
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,360
Don't worry.

735
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,440
You just don't put them in a high cabinet

736
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,100
that says they don't roll out and bunk them.

737
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:25,980
Good tip. Oh, I remember these. The hottest Christmas gift idea for 1984.

738
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:34,740
Yep, the Ronco tampon removal system kit. I scored 50 cases of these at a discount.

739
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,600
And I was gonna be rich beyond my mildest dreams.

740
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:46,300
Until those damn product liability lawsuits killed a major money-making scheme.

741
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,020
Damn whiny butt crybabies. Hell, mine grew back.

742
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,460
Speak for yourself. Ouch.

743
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,340
Eh, too many moving parts. That was the problem. With you and the kits.

744
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,420
Hey, what are these funny-looking milk glass trumpet things?

745
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,160
Boy, they sure sound flat.

746
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,520
Oh, those. That's not milk glass, it's clear. I had to wash them before I set them out.

747
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,780
Those are some used breast pumps I scored at thrift stores.

748
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,800
Blah, blah!

749
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,740
You wouldn't believe it, those places are lousy with them.

750
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,880
Oh, hey, look at this. I was gonna get rid of my Wasmo Nariz album.

751
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,240
Oh, I must have been out of my mind.

752
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,920
Oh, look at this dork Wasmo. He always wore two ugly neckties at once.

753
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,160
It's kind of like a proto-contempo oingo-boingo band.

754
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,580
One of these.

755
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:38,980
You hear some?

756
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,220
No!

757
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,040
Great, you'll love it.

758
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:04,700
I see the legs. I see the gait. So little time. I mustn't wait.

759
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,100
Oh, is she be good?

760
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,500
Oh, just a play.

761
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,120
I'll be OK.

762
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,120
I mustn't you know.

763
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,880
Aah.

764
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:24,880


765
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:33,500
Like a fish!

766
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:34,480


767
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:34,540
Bulbulg gracamurg framing

768
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Hey!

769
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:40,320
Like a fish, I'm the bait. I scourge ahead and hesitate.

770
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,360
My mind is fast, my body's slow.

771
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,760
Lunger!

772
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,200
Lunger!

773
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,700
Like a tool, I spend mislaid.

774
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,300
This use has caused a rusty blade.

775
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,580
I see your face, but will I not?

776
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,620
Lunger!

777
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,740
Men of Earth, seize all atomic testing.

778
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:05,940
Lunger!

779
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,800
Hi folks, Hiroshima Schwartz for Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

780
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:21,080
Home of the Mini-Meg, the Pocket Thunder, and many other fine, small, low-megaton nukes that fit in your purse or pocketbook.

781
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:27,260
And what am I doing here at Helsinki Station in Moscow instead of our beautiful air-conditioned warehouse?

782
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:33,220
Well, I'm sure not waiting for V.I. Lennon. I'm waiting for the latest armed shipment from the troubled Yarrow Mountains.

783
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:39,820
Yes, at Hiroshima Schwartz, we know the best deals come straight off the train, with no Russian mafia middlemen.

784
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,340
Lots of American arms dealers go hunting in the former Soviet Union and don't come back.

785
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,560
But at Hiroshima Schwartz, we bribe enough officials in one month to bring you year-round savings.

786
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,860
Mr. Schwartz, the conductor would like a half-day word for you.

787
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,940
Your egg baskets and icons have arrived.

788
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,980
Car 54.

789
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,080
Oh, I thank you, Officer.

790
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,580
I thank you, Officer Krupke, you friendly Russian official.

791
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,840
Here's 5,000 rubles. Buy your family a loaf of bread.

792
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,940
And yet you vote, Krupke.

793
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,400
Anyway, folks, Hiroshima Schwartz Miniature Nuclear Weapons House, where, where, Weapons Warehouse, where we go to the source.

794
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,160
No middlemen.

795
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,840
Hiroshima Schwartz is literally blowing up the competition.

796
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,160
Here we are, stuck in this tiny tuna can.

797
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,960
Spinning endlessly through the black depths of space.

798
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:49,480
Broadcasting to any pilgrims down below, settlers on the planets of this solar system as we fly by.

799
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:58,520
And we'll be sending that little almond-eyed gray humanoid around to your door to collect those organs, so...

800
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,100
Snappy.

801
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,720
He'll be in the cute little uniform, so don't be afraid.

802
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,120
They're your friends. They're here to help.

803
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,760
They're our brothers from the stars.

804
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,620
You should believe anything they whisper into your ear in the dead of night as you try to sleep.

805
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,240
Whisper, whisper, whisper in.

806
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,940
They're your friends.

807
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:26,420
They want to teach humanity and lead us into a new age of enlightenment under their gray jackboot.

808
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,720
Whisper, whisper, now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen in, now listen.

809
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:45,240
If you wake up in a vat of poison, with little aliens standing around outside the vat, wrapping, tying napkins around their necks, sharpening their knives and forks,

810
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,040
be glad, because you've just fell into the hands of the good aliens.

811
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,660
The bad aliens are far, far worse.

812
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,580
Whoa!

813
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,420
Was that a caller?

814
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,160
No, that was an accusation. An accusation.

815
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,500
We need more caller souls. The bucket isn't half full yet.

816
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,120
Call and deposit your soul.

817
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,540
There was another one.

818
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,500
Oh, look, Bob's bucket's half full.

819
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,920
Look at that little old soul. Oh, it's squiggling around.

820
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,300
I'm gonna wipe it on the end of the table and kill it.

821
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,580
Oopsie-miss. Ow!

822
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,780
I'd like to donate my soul.

823
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Ay-yo-ay.

824
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,600
She'd like to donate her soul.

825
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,400
Oh, it's... Let me whiff it.

826
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,160
We need to chew the organs.

827
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,460
It's a ticklish one, isn't it? You've got a ticklish soul now, admit it.

828
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,220
Never mind, I changed my mind. Goodbye, bye.

829
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,020
So relax.

830
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,260
Three beats per measure.

831
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,040
Sit back.

832
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,340
And enjoy our feature presentation.

833
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,660
This is the story about the brave men and women in the Church of the Subgenius

834
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,440
and all the things they did to get themselves evicted from the halls.

835
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,560
Shame and narcolepsy on Fantasy Island.

836
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,300
But when you get right down to it, good triumphs over evil.

837
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,540
And the forces of light trample into bloody pulp with sickly powers of darkness.

838
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,580
So remember, as we wander through this charnel house, this abattoir we call life,

839
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,180
that even though the future promises nothing,

840
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,360
destruction looms ahead, and the end of all joys, old age, robs us of everything worth having,

841
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,680
there are some nice things in life, like a shaft of sunlight drifting down.

842
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,840
Down to what to do next.

843
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,600
Well, remember, we're all on the phone now.

844
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,580
This is the show.

845
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,060
This is Interblab.

846
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,800
It's not that black, it's pink and shiny.

847
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,840
Now you can call us on any of the independent systems,

848
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,920
Unitalk, Ameriphone, Tele-Yank, East, Dixie Vox, U.S. Transpeak, or the Bell Panhandle.

849
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:53,360
And what we want you to do while you're waiting for us to answer those phones is disassemble each phone.

850
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,420
And with the knurled volume knob on the underside, force one button to open.

851
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,760
Full stop past left.

852
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,840
We're out of the volume knob!

853
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,140
Now turn it back the other way. See what happens?

854
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,300
Okay, there we go.

855
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,300
Now forward each of the directories in your possession to the person or firm whose name immediately follows yours on the listing

856
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,080
after you have crossed out your name, address, telephone number.

857
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,960
If your name is the last one in the directory, follow the directory to the person or firm who has the last one in the directory.

858
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,380
You did measure the total length of the telephone cord on premises and inches identified by the number.

859
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,380
In 3.5, the resulting number should match your temporary changeover identification date.

860
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,600
If it doesn't, notify the show as soon as possible.

861
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,400
The best-selling utility program that includes the notepad, calculator, and the phone.

862
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,500
There he goes. Flying around the room backwards.

863
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,120
Oh!

864
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,940
Oh!

865
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:34,580


866
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:34,780
Oh!

867
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,480
Darn it! Gosh dang it!

868
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,680
I told you to think, but I know differently.

869
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,520
He said, I told you to do that only if I didn't get any applause.

870
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,480
Wow.

871
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,760
Twang, twang, twang, twang.

872
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,660
And why don't you play some of the, uh...

873
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,760
...the lovely cantrips of Jesus?

874
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,580
We don't have to hear this, uh...this bad stuff all the time.

875
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,860
What a beautiful world it was.

876
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,780
What a wonderful world this would be.

877
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,760
We could all, like, have radios in our heads, you know?

878
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,040
And listen to the show all the time. Wouldn't that be neat?

879
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,740
And you would know what's tape and what's real, what's live, who's there, why they're there.

880
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,600
It's so neat.

881
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,540
There's another one, too. There are other things that these guys did.

882
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,060
If you want to...

883
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,120
If you want to, if you want to, sub-deenies.

884
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,520
It hurts, sub-deenies. It hurts for years to be on the show.

885
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,780
Okay, now, you realize that nobody can hear anybody anywhere in central or northern California.

886
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,220
...beat up two-bit accordion.

887
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,660
Wow.

888
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,280
That's exactly what they said out there.

889
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:50,840
Well, if you can't tell the difference, you ought to realize by the sound, a baby makes a completely different noise than an accordion when you squeeze it.

890
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,500
And when you stretch it, it doesn't even take in air.

891
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:53,840
Rigidity.

892
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:00,020
There is none righteous, no, not one. There is none that understandeth. There is none that seeketh after God.

893
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,820
They are all gone out of the way. They are together become unprofitable. There is none that doeth good, no, not one.

894
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Verse 14.

895
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,400
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their way.

896
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:21,180
And the way of peace have they not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

897
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:28,680
These verses, whether we admit it or not, are a description of all of us before we came to the knowledge of the Lord.

898
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,540
Bob?

899
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:41,940
But until that happy day, we can only drink and say, Bob is my Lord, and he's coming again.

900
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,680
Bob!

901
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,980
B-b-b-Bob!

902
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:48,820
Bob!

903
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,800
Bob who?

904
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,160
Bob who?

905
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:51,280
be!

906
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,920
R-r-ra-r-rudine!

907
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,060
Bob!

908
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,980
24 hours late and toilet last minute after 1600 years as their beginning.

909
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,480
R-r-r-op few more rounds.

910
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,020
E causes a relapse.

R every että partil Ty teer

912
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,120
Until young five Burns word think

913
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,280
that Bill Simmons was the prodigy that jarrowed supper bar

914
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:17,380
just so that he so did sound

915
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:22,480
understand killing Bob, but they really don't understand the complexities in killing Bob.

916
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:30,220
Because to kill Bob, you must hate Bob. But to hate Bob, you must first love Bob.

917
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,980
And the first step is pretty easy, getting to love Bob. Now we have in the church what we call

918
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:42,600
Bobbies. Bobbies have taken the first step. They love Bob. They put Bob stickers all over the place.

919
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,120
They talk about Bob all the time. They buy all of Bob's stuff. And hey, they keep the church

920
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:53,100
together. I mean, let's face it, without our holy sales, we wouldn't be here. But that's only the

921
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,420
first step. And everyone should go through that first step. You should buy everything we have.

922
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:04,900
Buy one of everything we have to show your love for Bob. And then comes the next step. And this

923
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,980
is a trap. This is the great subgenius trap. And a lot of Bobbies fall into this trap.

924
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,580
And that is, they go from loving Bob,

925
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:20,460
not into hate of Bob, but into dislike of Bob. Now, dislike is namby-pamby. Dislike is lower

926
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:30,820
than hate. It's furious. And you must cultivate true hate. Dislike. Dislike is the subgenius

927
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:35,280
trap. And this is someone who's bought all the Bob stuff. Usually when they're younger,

928
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:42,040
they've talked about Bob. And they realize that maybe they're not getting sex. They're not getting

929
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:42,420
the...

930
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,940
the slack that they were promised. You know what? They can't figure it out. And they turn against

931
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:52,660
Bob. They send back all their subgenius stuff, or they burn it, or they throw it away. Because now

932
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:58,320
they decide that Bob is stupid. This happens to people all the time. They'll love a rock band when

933
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,520
they're young. And then all of a sudden, it's not cool anymore to like that band. And so they'll

934
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,660
stop liking them because it's not cool anymore. And a lot of people do that with Bob. They think

935
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,560
he's so great. And then they realize, hey, Bob's not cool. There's nothing cool about this guy at

936
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:11,760
all.

937
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:20,920
And they dislike Bob. Well, some of them come back to Bob. Now, this is where if you get out of that

938
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,600
trap and you dig yourself out of that hole. Okay, you're 14, you're 15, you love Bob, you buy all

939
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,120
your Bob stuff. Then you think Bob isn't cool. You hate Bob. I'm sorry, you dislike Bob. You say you

940
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,740
hate Bob, but you don't really hate Bob. You dislike Bob. You ruin all your stuff. And then

941
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:40,740
when you get about 21, 22, you look back and maybe you see a Bob pampered or a Bob head and you go,

942
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,580
what was that queer thing? And you're like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

943
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,820
think I liked Bob. I remember I liked that. Boy, that was really dumb. But you know, I kind of

944
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:52,120
remember that. It was kind of funny, too. I pick up one of those books. I think I think I saved a few

945
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,480
pages that I tore out of the book of the subgenius. And you go back and you look at it and you

946
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,740
realize that you just didn't really understand it. You know, you were young or just introduced

947
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:08,260
to the word. You only saw the surface of it. And you realize, hey, there's something deeper there.

948
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,460
And you know, this happens not just with the subgenius. It happens with a lot of things. You

949
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:19,780
see this with disco for instance or other types of music that come back in the style.

950
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,720
And we're not saying we're coming back in the style.

951
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:28,020
That would be wrong to say that because we'll never be as big as something like disco because

952
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,080
we're only meant for certain people like yourselves.

953
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,880
But you realize then when you're older that this bob isn't really all that bad.

954
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,220
And this word is a little bit deeper and a little bit more true than you would originally

955
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:42,640
notice.

956
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,180
And this is when you can start cultivating true hate for bob.

957
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,860
You love bob.

958
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:54,140
Maybe you've gone into that state of subgenius limbo of dislike.

959
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,320
Maybe you've gone right past it to truly hating bob.

960
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,140
I don't know if I've achieved true hate of bob.

961
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,720
Maybe in a few more years I'll truly hate bob.

962
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:06,860
You should have to.

963
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,840
You have to dedicate quite a bit of money and quite a bit of time.

964
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:17,680
And after 10 years, 11, 12 years, you realize that you've been busting your ass for a guy

965
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,840
who doesn't even know your name.

966
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:24,840
That all your work, everything you've done is for this so-called false religion.

967
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,820
People are still laughing at you when you give the word of bob.

968
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,660
This is when you can really hate bob.

969
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,940
This is why I don't understand why the Christians hate us so much.

970
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,860
I believe we're just a bunch of idiots.

971
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:36,860


972
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:41,440
I believe the great Dr. Legume once said, there's not that much difference between the

973
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,120
Christians and the subgenius.

974
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,200
They have a savior that they nailed to a stick and we have a savior we beat with a stick.

975
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,520
Or kill me!

976
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,280
Or kill me!

977
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,000
But there it went.

978
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:53,460
The owl.

979
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,860
The wallow in our intellectual omnipotence.

980
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,840
Doug's shorted the show out and spent the whole thing in one little three second buzz.

981
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,420
Yeah, sorry.

982
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,740
I didn't want to use up all of our tangible effect.

983
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,480
I'm sorry.

984
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:02,720
I didn't want to use up all of our tangible effect.

985
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:02,720


986
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,800
I'm sorry.

987
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,120
I'm sorry.

988
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm sorry.

989
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,120
I'm sorry.

990
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,220
I'm sorry.

991
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,760
I'm sorry.

992
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,920
I'm sorry.

993
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,980
I'm sorry

994
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:35,600
You put on custom tailored three piece suits and shiny wooden fish shoes.

995
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,840
Don't have to make your athletic�iter.

996
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:36,840


997
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:36,840


998
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:36,840


999
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:45,100
to take the city bus won't have to sing the blues so nice and warm and cozy so clean and well-defined

1000
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:53,200
it's all on the expense account in a corporate state of mind to get to be one of the chosen few

1001
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,760
depends on who you know mix equal parts of promises and the people that you've sold

1002
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:08,480
then add a dash of ruthlessness to all of the above you're guaranteed supremacy when the push

1003
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:17,000
turns into show please don't feel uneasy at reflections that you see it's only a distortion

1004
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:24,240
of what you thought you'd be if only you knew sooner what you hoped you wouldn't find

1005
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,160
destined now to live and die in a corporate state of mind

1006
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,500
and let it wash over you

1007
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:40,520
prepare to fight

1008
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:40,740
please prepare to run

1009
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,440
don't bang and hang

1010
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,200
to the rest of your life

1011
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,900
do it without ever having done

1012
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:54,160
to the depths that you none of your deserve

1013
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,340
do it..

1014
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:55,900
fight

1015
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,420
to bring joy

1016
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,640
to those around you

1017
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,300
so I'm not doing this

1018
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:58,380
just calling

1019
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,000
but here's my line

1020
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,360
which is so obvious

1021
00:50:59,360 --> 00:50:59,740
but it was pretty cool

1022
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,800
It could never be

1023
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,700
I'm not the man it seems

1024
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,380

1025
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,560
guitar solo

1026
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,560
If you feel a pen of doubt

1027
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,280
Be calm and don't despair

1028
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,880
Go over to the closet

1029
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,320
You'll find the suit to wear

1030
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,360
A pen of doubt

1031
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,200
Apologies to all concerned

1032
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,500
You'll get it right next time

1033
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,880
Whenever in doubt

1034
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,300
Just hold the part

1035
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,340
In a corporate state of mind

1036
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,960
No pity or expendables

1037
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,760
They got what they deserved

1038
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,600
They may have had the talent

1039
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,960
But they didn't have the nerve

1040
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,880
So make the deals

1041
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,900
Return the wheels

1042
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,960
You know just what you'll find

1043
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,600
Right there in the limelight

1044
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,720
In a corporate state of mind

1045
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,280
Guitar solo

1046
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,320
It could never be

00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,500
I'm not the man it seems

1048
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,540

guitar solo

1070
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,700
I'm a little scared now.

1071
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:34,720
Uh, yes, I have some mighty hot guitar playing there, ain't it?

1072
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,200
Yeah, that's, um, the...

1073
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1074
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,660
Oh, got the wrong...

1075
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,500
Oops, excuse me.

1076
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,260
Had the wrong volume knob there.

1077
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:48,120
Friends, that's, um, that and what's in the background now is, uh, the Flying Ryan Brothers.

1078
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,860
Um, with, uh, Reverend Jimmy Ryan there on the guitar.

1079
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,000
They just came out with a CD.

1080
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:00,120
Uh, yeah, I sometimes play, uh, uh, Dr. Bizarro.

1081
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,520
And, uh, Jimmy Ryan is the guitar player with Dr. Bizarro.

1082
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,180
And he just came out with a CD that he and his brother...

1083
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,140
Did.

1084
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,480
Uh, the Flying Ryan Brothers.

1085
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,540
I'm gonna give you their address, dear friends.

1086
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:24,800
That is, uh, Mace Incorporated, 7144 North Harlem, number 318, Chicago.

1087
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:27,980
Ill, 6...

1088
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,300
God.

1089
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,020
60631.

1090
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,640
Yeah, 60631.

1091
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,380
God, I'm getting old.

1092
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,100
I have to pull my glasses down to read.

1093
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:44,000
And, dear friends, while we're at it, I suppose I definitely should give you the power-packed church of the subgenius post office box,

1094
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,200
where you can write for free information about all this horrible stuff that you've been hearing.

1095
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,740
And that, uh, post office box number is, once again, B-O-B.

1096
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,700
No, that's Bob.

1097
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,340
It's, uh, P-O-B.

1098
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,200
P.O. Box 140306.

1099
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,680
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1100
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,580
Once again, that's box 140.

1101
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,060
P.O. Box 140306.

1102
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,300
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1103
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:21,260
Or email for free information from Jesus, uh, whose email address is slack at metronet.com.

1104
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,040
Slack at metronet.com.

1105
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,720
Uh, hold on just a sec.

1106
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,580
I'm gonna go down there and see if Jesus is here right now.

1107
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,000
Oh, hey, man.

1108
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,240
Um, I'm just about finished with this show.

1109
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:35,980
Really?

1110
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,180
And we're on the air right now.

1111
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,440
And then we can go.

1112
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,480
All right, let's go.

1113
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:45,120
Um, friends, we're, we're, uh, the Lord and, and myself are about to go to the Texas State Fair.

1114
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,820
It's one of my favorite things to do.

1115
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,820
Go look at the mutated bulls and, and, uh, pigs and chickens and so forth they have down there.

1116
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,580
And the, oh, yeah.

1117
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,300
Oh, God.

1118
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,600
The Pobucker watching is, is great.

1119
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,960
Hey, you'll like this show.

1120
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,920
I played a lot of you on it.

1121
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,960
We got all the way through S-L-A-C-K.

1122
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,400
K, kill Bob.

1123
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,080
Kill Bob.

1124
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,680
And, uh.

1125
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,080
Lunch.

1126
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:07,220
Lunch.

1127
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,900
The head.

1128
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,720
Lunch the head.

1129
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,440
Send in the $30.

1130
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:12,920
Uh.

1131
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:14,460
Uh.

1132
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,120
What was A?

1133
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,680
Oh, no, I fell asleep by then.

1134
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:23,440
Um, well, friends, um, wish us luck down at the Texas State Fair.

1135
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,400
Uh, praise Jesus, praise Bob, and, uh, uh, praise Raymond Burr.

1136
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,060
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

1137
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,520
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.

1138
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,860
Looking forward to it, Mr. Stang.

1139
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,820
I'm afraid I really am here.

1140
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,260
I didn't want to be.

1141
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,340
It was like a nightmare.

1142
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,060
Now it starts to sink in.

1143
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,440
A nightmare come true.

1144
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,860
You wouldn't believe it.

1145
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,140
The reason that refrigerator's so empty, he's been putting on weight at the cost of this church.

1146
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,260
Look at this thing.

1147
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,300
I can't believe it.

1148
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,120
Growing on it.

1149
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,120
Nonsense.

1150
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,980
The Reverend Stang is just well-fleshed and enjoying the full moon.

1151
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,280
Not for long.

1152
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,320
New studies have shown that excessive show causes cancer.

1153
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,800
Bite your tongue.

1154
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:18,100
Uh, human soul fills a man's belly so well.

1155
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,260
If only I had been able to stay asleep.

1156
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,860
I had this nightmare.

1157
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:29,700
I dreamed I was, I was on an airplane from Dallas to San Francisco,

1158
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,780
but there was problems with the engine or the runway or the landing gear,

1159
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,680
and they couldn't land.

1160
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,100
And suddenly the, the,

1161
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,480
the captain sounded like Hal.

1162
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:42,820
And, and all the stewardesses walking back and forth sounded like Mobius Rex.

1163
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,080
We're mumbling.

1164
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,300
And then I turned around and sitting in the seat next to me was Gary Gabrog.

1165
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,000
Ah!

1166
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,220
Hey, sailor.

1167
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,240
Want to go surfing?

1168
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,460
Just fasten your safety belts.

1169
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,260
This is a little brief period of freedom.

1170
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,720
More fog.

1171
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,940
More, more show.

1172
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,140
That speck below us on the left is more.

1173
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,640
Hey, am I allowed to smoke in here?

1174
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,140
Sure, just try.

1175
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,520
Sure.

1176
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,420
Sure, no problem, Paul.

1177
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,700
It doesn't bother me a bit to watch you smoke, Paul.

1178
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,140
I don't miss the cigarettes.

1179
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,620
Fine.

1180
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:20,740
It's no problem.

1181
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,500
I'm all right.

1182
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,380
I'm all right.

1183
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,180
I do not call it a mistake, a mendacity.

1184
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,980
I call it a sin.

1185
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,060
Perhaps fleabagism.

1186
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,100
All right.

1187
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,380
All right.

1188
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:34,720
Thank you.

1189
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:34,900
Thank you.

1190
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:35,660
Shake your head.

1191
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,160
I'll do it.

1192
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:36,300
I'll do it.

1193
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,200
I'll do it.

1194
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:38,200


1195
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:38,200


1196
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,620
Down here at the little live station with all the live little doctors.

1197
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,120
We make you almost as free as Jesus at this hour.

1198
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,980
Yes, but it costs the people of California a lot more than Jesus will ever cost them.

1199
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,780
Their lives, their souls, and now, yes, we want their pocket change.

1200
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:05,820
And if you don't believe that, son, then you might just as well have shot that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1201
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,020
yourself.

1202
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,700
You might as well yourself have loaded that Saturday night special.

1203
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,320
I did load the Saturday night special, and I handed it to Hatwood.

1204
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:22,740
And you might as well have nailed J.R. Bob Dobbs' hands and feet up onto that cross along

1205
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,740
with the woodman at will.

1206
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:32,800
You might just as well have dragged Bob's body through the streets, pelting him with

1207
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,780
rotten fruit.

1208
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,120
You might just as well have performed.

1209
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,020
You might as well have performed that autopsy and thrown away the eight bullets that would

1210
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,020
have proved how many gunmen there really were.

1211
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,140
We're all guilty.
