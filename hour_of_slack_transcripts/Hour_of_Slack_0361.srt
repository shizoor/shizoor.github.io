1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
And thank you so, so very much.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,400
What?

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,280
What happened?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,500
Are you doing kind of trouble here?

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,560
Well, I don't know why you people seem to think this is magic.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,540
It's just this little chromium switch here.

7
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,840
We must admit frankly and honestly that something is very wrong.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,360
Listen.

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,580
Now, wait a minute.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,040
I can't change attitudes.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,160
I didn't apologize.

12
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,380
I didn't apologize.

13
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,100
Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customsman.

14
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,040
This is the sound of my brain.

15
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,960
Then I said, this is the sound of my brain on Don Henley.

16
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,160
Then I said.

17
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,200
What about Slack?

18
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,380
That's your key phrase.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,420
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

20
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,500
And now, the self-genius, our boss, Slack.

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,900
Yes, dear friends.

22
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,660
Well, we're back.

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,660
I think that's plenty loud there.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,900
Forever in stange.

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,960
Well, yeah, you can hear little machines running under it.

26
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,660
Oh, pledge away.

27
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,100
Well, dear friends, welcome back.

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,320
Oh, we need the background music, or it's not like a regular show.

29
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,820
Oh, yes.

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,520
Oh, yes, dear friends.

31
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,840
Welcome back to another subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,860
It's so nice to be back with you.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,780
And our special guests here, Dr. Philo Drummond on vocals,

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,920
and Dr. Snavely Eklund on disintegrated.

35
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,160
And with a special second microphone that has,

36
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:25,640
it's the most naked, naked microphone for your naked ears and your naked soul.

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,220
Oh, yes.

38
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,440
Yes.

39
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,220
Yes.

40
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,160
Well, what now, Dr. Drummond?

41
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,640
Well, you're the one that invited me here.

42
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,620
We came here to do a show.

43
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,240
I know.

44
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,180
You said, if you come on the show, I'll play the Swingin' Love Corpses for you.

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,400
Oh, yeah, that's right.

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,680
That's what you said.

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,200
You told me if I came here, that's what you'd do.

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,660
Oh, no, no.

49
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,520
It was like a...

50
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,880
And tonight, we've got in our studios Dr. Philo Drummond from the Swingin' Love Corpses.

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,260
They're going to be on tour for the next six months.

52
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,800
You'll be...

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,780
Yeah, man.

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,160
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,480
You'll be hearing about them everywhere.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,880
Yeah, we're on tour.

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,320
And, Dr. Drummond, do you mind if I call you Philo?

58
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,020
No, man.

59
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,660
It's okay.

60
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,160
Yeah, everybody called me Philo or something like that.

61
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,880
Something like the Swingin' Love Corpses, man.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,100
Yeah.

63
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,800
It's like the Swingin' Love Corpses.

64
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,700
I've been into the Swingin' Love Corpses since I was like 13.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,420
I remember that.

66
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,400
Yeah, me too, man.

67
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,240
I was in there at least back that far, back when they was really cool.

68
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,320
In the early days, I used to listen to that band before I was a member, man.

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,540
Yeah.

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,680
You founded the band, right?

71
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, that's right.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,640
You and your brother.

73
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,500
Me and my grandfather.

74
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,220
And your grandfather.

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,860
My grandfather did it.

76
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,980
It was a long time ago.

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
It carried the tradition for years.

78
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,540
And this is...

79
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,560
These recordings we have tonight to play are from a live concert, I understand.

80
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,380
That's right.

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,280
That's the Stupid As They Want To Be tour.

82
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,080
The album Stupid As They Want To Be on...

83
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,440
What's the...

84
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,040
What record company is that?

85
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,100
That's Incipid Music Publishing Company.

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Incipid, right.

87
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,160
Right.

88
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,860
It's on the Incipid label.

89
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,180
Really insipid.

90
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,580
Yeah, it's kind of a cheap nut.

91
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,420
Not a lot of people heard about it.

92
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,840
It's really a growing label.

93
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,720
It's a good one to buy stock in right now.

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,280
You ought to check that out.

95
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,720
I hear you.

96
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,440
I hear you.

97
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
It's a comer.

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,920
It's a real comer.

99
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,260
That's what they say about the Swingin' Love Corpses.

100
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, this...

101
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,380
What about this song we're about to play here, Bummer?

102
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,440
Bummer?

103
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:28,580
Bummer.

104
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,080
Yeah, that's a bummer, all right.

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,280
Hey, where's this one?

106
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,560
Where's this coming?

107
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,080
I want to do a little scritch scratch.

108
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,020
Oh, here you go.

109
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,480
There you go.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,040
Hey, it's like hip-hop radio.

111
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,160
There, do some scritch scratch there with...

112
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,800
Let's...

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,720
Hems from the Southwest, I believe.

114
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,200
Play it right now.

115
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,540
Hey, it's crazy.

116
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,160
It's cool.

117
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,820
It's like a giant planet here.

118
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,440
And, uh...

119
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,180
Flying through space at unbelievable speeds.

120
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,880
And we're just a little speck of protoplasm on the board.

121
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,280
And you can just slam into a bunch of metal at any time.

122
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,040
Just slam.

123
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,480
And mostly all we get today is doom, doom, depression.

124
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,100
Boom and destruction.

125
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,680
Poverty, chaos.

126
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,740
Death.

127
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,060
Degradation.

128
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,700
Filth.

129
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,280
Homicidal maniacs.

130
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,960
You know?

131
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
You know?

132
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,280
I fall like a dead man through the canyons of my mind.

133
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,640
20,000 people dying in an industrial accident caused by an explosion of a chemical plant in India.

134
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,120
Horror!

135
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,420
You're a bummer!

136
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,660
Horror!

137
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,280
Horror!

138
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,540
The ozone liner is...

139
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,180
This period of the farming right, the incidence of skin capture has increased to 100%.

140
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:13,120
The Dow Jones is falling! The Dow Jones is falling!

141
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,600
Falling!

142
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,040
The rainforest is being destroyed at the rate of 50,000 acres a minute.

143
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,420
Bomber!

144
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,380
Half of all species will be extinct by the year 2000.

145
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,820
Bomber!

146
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,500
Real f***ing bomber!

147
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,520
Uh oh, I'm not politically correct.

148
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,660
Uh, no kidding.

149
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,840
Bomber!

150
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,460
Yeah, he forgot about that one. Thanks, Darkie.

151
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,360
Bomber!

152
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Our apologies. Bomber, man. Bad words on the radio, not meant to do it.

153
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,060
Bomber!

154
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,560
How about the, uh, Iraq has a hydrogen bomb?

155
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,600
Bomber!

156
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,760
How about the, uh, in Bangladesh?

157
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,800
3,000 people are killed in a typhoon in Bangladesh.

158
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,100
Bomber!

159
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:27,640
Bomber!

160
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,580
There's a trillion dollar deficit.

161
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,860
Bomber!

162
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,240
Kind of a bomber.

163
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,660
No, it's not alive.

164
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,000
I cut myself shaving!

165
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,080
Oh!

166
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:42,940
Bomber!

167
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:43,940
Bomber!

168
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,380
Bomber!

169
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,020
Bomber!

170
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:49,920
Bomber!

171
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:51,880
Bomber!

172
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,420
Bomber!

173
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:56,940
Bomber!

174
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,580
Baloo killer killed six million Jews in World War II.

175
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,120
It was a bomber!

176
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,920
Bomber!

177
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,620
Bomber!

178
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,720
The greenhouse effect...

179
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,820
F-fright, well...

180
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,000
...killed the dinosaurs.

181
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,820
Oh, yeah! Right.

182
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,300
When an asteroid hit the earth,

183
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,020
How...all the dinosaurs were killed as a, uh, a cloud covered the earth.

184
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,660
Real bomber!

185
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,980
Bummer! Bummer!

186
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,840
Help! I'm falling and I can't get up!

187
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,000
Bummer!

188
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,780
That song is a bummer.

189
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,340
No kidding. That is a bummer, man.

190
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,840
One, two, three, four!

191
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:22,540
Yeah, cause this is a fun show.

192
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,140
So dear friends, we've always tried to give you the most fun, fun kind of radio here.

193
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,060
The Hour of Slack.

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,960
That's always been the reputation of this show, is fun.

195
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,100
That I've always heard of anyway.

196
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,600
When you come to Dallas, it's like, what do you do? You know, you get on the fun show.

197
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,880
That's right.

198
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,580
And that's what I've always done.

199
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,140
And we've got members of two fun, fun bands.

200
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,120
Doctors for Bob, the original Doctors for Bob,

201
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,980
and, uh,

202
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,200
that's a,

203
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,160
uh, Dr. Snavely Eklund there.

204
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,640
Ah! My mind and your mind!

205
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,260
You all remember Snavely? Hey, wow, I remember that song. That was a great song.

206
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,680
My mind is not my mind.

207
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,280
My mind is your mind.

208
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:19,460
It was the days, dear friends, when you could go to a subgenius revival and there'd be the pure Doctor music.

209
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,660
The pure spirit music.

210
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,760
Music of Bob.

211
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,500
My mind is not your mind.

212
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:33,120
That was, it was performed in the spirit, in that no one who held an instrument had been schooled formally in those days.

213
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,220
The best Doctors sat in the audience while other ones played their instruments.

214
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,880
Like puppets.

215
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,180
In a play.

216
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:48,240
We would found the band and then start the show up on the stage and then we would relinquish our instruments to the audience.

217
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,860
One at a time to members from the audience until finally,

218
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:58,140
the band and the audience had transposed themselves and, and the, and the din was...

219
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,100
The din was unbelievable.

220
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,780
And then everyone was dead.

221
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,260
And, yeah, they died.

222
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:11,760
It was like knives in your ears, dear friends. It was such a beautiful, beautiful thing.

223
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,020
And unfortunately most of the Doctor bands learned how to play. You know, it happens to the best.

224
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,000
Most of them died.

225
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,980
Look at Devo.

226
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,220
Most of them died.

227
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,360
A number of them died.

228
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,980
And, uh, but not as Dr. Eklund. Dr. Eklund still lives. He never learned to play.

229
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,580
Never.

230
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,640
The best ones are dead though.

231
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,200
And the dead ones are best in the world of Doctor music.

232
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,080
But hell, there's only good Doctors and dead Doctors as far as I'm concerned.

233
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,600
I always hated, and you'll vouch for this won't you Doctor John?

234
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:41,960
Yeah, I'll vouch.

235
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,980
I always hated.

236
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,320
I don't even know what he's going to say and I'll vouch.

237
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,340
I've always hated the music that we did.

238
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,520
He has always hated that.

239
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,380
I can vouch for that.

240
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,040
I was in a Doctor band.

241
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,220
I was in Doctors for Wotan, the second Doctor band based on Doctors for Bob.

242
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,480
And, uh.

243
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,620
And he has always hated Doctors for Wotan and Doctors for Bob.

244
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
Well, no, I didn't mind Doctors for Bob after a while.

245
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,440
He hated them.

246
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,240
Well, yeah, he acted like he liked them.

247
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,900
I hated the band that I was in at the time that I was performing the music.

248
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,820
But the funny thing was when you played the tapes back it sounded okay.

249
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,600
Yeah, how about, what was that one?

250
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,860
Moans from the Toilets in Hell.

251
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,360
Moans from the Toilets in Hell.

252
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,500
Yeah, you know I don't play the old Wotan music much on this show.

253
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:23,580
You should.

254
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,340
It's kind of like The Roots, you know.

255
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,800
It is The Roots but it's got.

256
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,340
Going back to the pamphlet sort of music.

257
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,060
The problem is The Roots are just hanging right out of the ground and you cannot play

258
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,060


259
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,080
Yeah, you know it's a problem.

260
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,060
Erosion.

261
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,620
It's erosion to the soil.

262
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,260
You know that microphone you're on has a very, it has a flat quality.

263
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,700
I'll stand away.

264
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,200
I'll stand away.

265
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,220
And project my voice better.

266
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,340
How's that?

267
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,640
Yeah, I picked up that and it erased half the tapes Dr. Drummond.

268
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,700
And that's what made everybody the happiest.

269
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,980
I was happy.

270
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,480
When the tapes finally were erased and they shut up for a while.

271
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,500
What's this next, now that we're at a Swingin' Love Corpses concert, what's this next song coming up?

272
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:11,940
Nature.

273
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,960
I hate it.

274
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,540
John Sarge statement on the, for all the environmentalists out there.

275
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,160
Animal rights.

276
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,720
Animal rights activists.

277
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,120
You know what I'm going to do is.

278
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,900
Environmentalists.

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,120
We really are concerned about the ecology and about things like living.

280
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,240
Living.

281
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,400
Living.

282
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,140
Living things.

283
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,840
Like the Indians.

284
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,660
Living things.

285
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,860
Yeah, I like things too.

286
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,680
We're concerned about things.

287
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, I can tell.

288
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,380
Your concern really shows through in this song Dr. Drummond.

289
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,140
And we're going to talk about political correctness a little bit more after this.

290
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,060
Lovely anthem.

291
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,680
Well it's been a while since time began.

292
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,460
A bad struggle against nature, a force of nature against man.

293
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,640
Take down a great movement, a simple quicksand

294
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,100
Nature has the power, nature has the upper hand

295
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,660
Nature, I hate it!

296
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,860
Nature, I hate it!

297
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,140
Well the forces of nature come in many degrees

298
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,880
Maybe a forest by a peg or killer bees

299
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,360
Maybe an earthquake or maybe typhoon

300
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,300
Tornadoes, volcanoes, rings of monsoon

301
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,340
Nature, I hate it!

302
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,580
Nature, I hate it!

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,080
In the baby's dioxide

304
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,120
Blue glint of light

305
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,120


306
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,040
White powder of species

307
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,140
How does it make you feel?

308
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,840
Got your hole in the earth

309
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,120
Fill that hole with plastic

310
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,340
The way we treat our planet

311
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,140
Wonderland

312
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,060
Nature, I hate it!

313
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,900
Nature, I hate it!

314
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,260
So gotta wake up

315
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,920
And try to come back

316
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,820
To get to know you

317
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,100
Nature Where you go

318
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,720
Nature Where you go

319
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,800
Nature where you go

320
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,740
Nature Where you go

321
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,160
Nature Where you go

322
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,940
Nature Where you go

323
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,040
Nature, I hate it!

324
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,040


325
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,040


326
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,840
guitar solo

327
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,160
solo

328
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,800
solo

329
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,260
solo

330
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,640
Well I wouldn't find nature

331
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,940
if I had my druthers

332
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,120
Wish I could control

333
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,440
the action of others

334
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,580
We should love nature

335
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,460
like one of our brothers

336
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,000
But you know it's not nice

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,860
to fool your mother

338
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,080
Nature

339
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,500
I ain't enough

340
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,100
My sister Veronica and I did this double act

341
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,500
And my husband Charlie traveled around with us

342
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,480
For the last number in our act

343
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,060
We did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row

344
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,140
One, two, three, four, five

345
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,260
Splits, spread eagles, flip flops, backflips

346
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,640
One right after the other

347
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Well this one night we were in Cicero, the three of us

348
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,540
And we were in this hotel room boozing and having a few laughs

349
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,920
And we ran out of ice

350
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,600
So I went out to get some

351
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,400
I come back, open the door

352
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,620
There's Veronica and Charlie

353
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,920
Doing number 17

354
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,100
The spread eagle

355
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,620
Then one night she says

356
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,540
Baby, what's the sense? You working every night

357
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,700
I don't get to see enough of you

358
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,780
So she offers to put me on an allowance

359
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,780
Just like that, an allowance

360
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,200
So finally I ask her

361
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,980
I said, baby, where does all this loot come from?

362
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,020
Did you rob a bank or something?

363
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,980
No, she says, I thought you knew better

364
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,580
I'm a hustler

365
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,540
Well, I wasn't shocked

366
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,700
I should have known

367
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:11,900
I'm a hustler

368
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:11,900


369
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,400
I've been around that kind of thing

370
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,860
She looks so college-y all the time

371
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,960
But I didn't tumble, I guess

372
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,260
Anyway, I wanted to bring her down

373
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,200
But to be perfectly honest with you, I was sort of hooked

374
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,140
I mean, where else could a guy like me get a hold of money like that?

375
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,940
Your love gives me such a thrill

376
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,280
But your love won't pay my bills

377
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,480
I want money

378
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,120
That's what I want

379
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,900
That's what I want

380
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,920
That's what I want

381
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,580
That's what I want

382
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,560
I want my own seis

383
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:56,200
But I don't need your see'ny

384
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,280
She wants money

385
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,700
Put your partner back

386
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:58,700


387
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:58,700


388
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:58,700


389
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:58,920
What do you want?

390
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,920
She wants money

391
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,220
What do you want?

392
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,060
She wants money

393
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,340
Put herfahren

394
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,120


395
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,900
and on and on and on and on and on and on.

396
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,660
What'd you say?

397
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,060
This is stupid, man.

398
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,480
We're a lot better than this if we just stand around and just yak at each other.

399
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,920
Yeah, I guess so.

400
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,120
Yeah, but you were sitting there forging my name on all those FCC papers.

401
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,340
So, what about it?

402
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,780
Is that something that's bad?

403
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,380
I mean, is that like an illegal thing?

404
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,480
Yeah, it is illegal.

405
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,220
Just because the FCC is a federal governmental agency?

406
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,800
Yeah, but by admitting it, we guarantee disbelief.

407
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,780
Isn't that the greatest thing about the church of the subgenius, Dr. Drummond?

408
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,320
Isn't that the greatest thing about that church?

409
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,660
You mean that church that we were the first two cool guys who started a long time ago?

410
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,200
Well, after Bob.

411
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,340
We were the first two subgeniuses.

412
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,200
There was Bob, and then there was two subgeniuses.

413
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,920
And then there was you.

414
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,580
Well, yeah.

415
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,820
But we were the first two.

416
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,040
There was that other guy.

417
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,780
We killed him.

418
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,320
We don't even talk about him anymore.

419
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,940
No, well, he killed himself.

420
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,340
We didn't kill him.

421
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,640
Well, we might have.

422
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,140
We wouldn't even say his name.

423
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,780
We might have put him.

424
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,680
We might have put the bullets in the gun and put the gun in his hand, but he pulled the trigger, I guarantee.

425
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,820
That's right.

426
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,840
That's the important thing.

427
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,480
We might have strapped the gun in his hand and put a spring behind it, but he pulled the trigger.

428
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:24,840
The important thing is, you know, it's like he could choose between a glass of water or life.

429
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,580
And eventually, he just got thirsty.

430
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,280
He made the choice.

431
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,520
He got thirsty.

432
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,820
So, there it is.

433
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,280
It's that simple.

434
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,840
It was a philosophical way.

435
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,660
Back in the old days, we used to do stuff like that.

436
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,540
Whatever happened.

437
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,400
Dr. Drummond to the old days of the church.

438
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:41,840
In the olden times?

439
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,740
Yeah.

440
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,500
What's wrong?

441
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,360
What's wrong?

442
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,140
I'm hearing odd things in the broadcast.

443
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,340
You know, there's somebody who jams our signal.

444
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,820
Oh, really?

445
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,620
Yeah, there's this, like, I don't know.

446
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,060
Is that the Citizens for Normalcy?

447
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,800
It's either them or the feds or the Criswell Baptist.

448
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,980
Some late group that really has some bad history.

449
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,860
It thinks that we're just a...

450
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,280
The Chihuahua.

451
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,580
The Trevinoist.

452
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,160
The Chihuahua?

453
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,280
Speaking of Chihuahuas, H. Ross Perot.

454
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,620
Yeah, that little...

455
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,620
Chihuahua haircut sporting goon.

456
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,200
There's been an argument about whether he resembles a Chihuahua,

457
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,920
like Ren of Ren and Stimpy,

458
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,180
or if he's more like the winged monkey that picks up Toto in Wizard of Oz.

459
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,080
I just want to know where he gets his haircut.

460
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,080
I think he just kind of sticks his head in a blender, you know?

461
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,600
H. Ren Perot.

462
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,860
Yeah, H. Perot.

463
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,020
And, you know, if you made Bill Clinton play Stimpy,

464
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,680
and George Bush could play Nickelodeon,

465
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,380
you'd have a feature film right there.

466
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,440
Yep.

467
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,880
Yep, by George.

468
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,440
Clinton would make a pretty good Stimpy, you know?

469
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,180
And Perot as Ren.

470
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,500
Yeah.

471
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,360
Think about it.

472
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,560
He could fluff Clinton up and sleep on him and stuff like that.

473
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,960
He'd make for beautiful bedfellows.

474
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,240
Bill!

475
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,860
Bill, don't you know the old ways are best?

476
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,760
The old ways are?

477
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,680
The old ways are the best, dear friends.

478
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,920
And Dr. Drummond and Stavely and I remember the old...

479
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,000
Well, we would be able to remember them had they not been so good, you might say.

480
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,100
What's that over-modulating I keep hearing, man?

481
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,580
I don't know.

482
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,120
It's because the people didn't send in their pledge money to the station.

483
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,660
And there's...

484
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,700
Knock that old nuclear generator there.

485
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,660
They have a gasoline generator here in the studio that keeps everything running.

486
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,880
They do?

487
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,480
They have the...

488
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:37,740
They have the...

489
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,600
They brought in the new EKG machine.

490
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,200
Oh, the toys.

491
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,580
So you can take one while you're doing your show.

492
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,700
The toys in the mail.

493
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,460
Phyla.

494
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,620
Yeah, Phyla.

495
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,940
Phyla, they called him back in the olden times.

496
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,120
Back in the old bear slapping fish amoeba flagellate times.

497
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,780
Yeah, I remember when you created amoebas.

498
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,160
Yeah, me and the old...

499
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,960
That was back in the good old days.

500
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
Yeah, that was the old days.

501
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
I remember when you created dog-eat-dog.

502
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,640
The whole concept of one life form would destroy completely another life form.

503
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,760
And then would be in return destroyed.

504
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,940
It was the only logical conclusion for the proliferation of life forms.

505
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,140
Is that eventually one had to consume the other else there would be too many.

506
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,200
Yeah, I'll tell you.

507
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,900
I've...

508
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,760
You know...

509
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,900
It's a natural selection.

510
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,020
This church has been around for a long time.

511
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,600
A long time.

512
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,520
Some people think.

513
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,080
Do you remember when they used to cut off their male organs?

514
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:30,940
Huh?

515
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,680
Who's dog?

516
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,760
What about that dog?

517
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,780
Dog.

518
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,420
Dog.

519
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:36,940
Dog.

520
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:36,960
Dog.

521
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:36,980
Dog.

522
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,040
Dog.

523
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


524
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


525
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


526
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


527
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


528
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


529
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


530
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


531
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


532
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


533
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


534
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,080


535
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,080
All that dog?

536
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,920
That one dog?

537
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,540
Yeah.

538
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,120
But, oh the...

539
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,060
Old dog...

540
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,480
I remember.

541
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,640
The old dog.

542
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,320
Dogs has...

543
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,420
I vote for both of them old dogs.

544
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,940
Dogs has always been my friend.

545
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,620
Both them old dogs, man.

546
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,200
Why didn't you do some nasty old dogs?

547
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,000
Right after the dinosaurs were killed out, those two dogs appeared.

548
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,480
And...

549
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,360
If it weren't for you...

550
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,420

I'm kind of slack-filled right now.

588
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:17,160
Do you not, therefore, share 25% of the debt of the, the debt, I say, of the Subgenius Foundation?

589
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,640
There's, there's, all right, you own 50%, and then you own 25% of the debt.

590
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,480
No, my wife owns 25%.

591
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,660
And then I own the other 25%.

592
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,180
My first one.

593
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,200
My main one.

594
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,460
You own 75%, 25 of which is the debt.

595
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,220
And mine is the other 25%, which is the profit.

596
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,360
The debt.

597
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:34,580
The debt.

598
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,860
That's the key.

599
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,780
The President takes on 75% of the debt in a subgenius.

600
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,660
If 100 subgenius businessmen do it, then it's legal.

601
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,120
Right.

602
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,740
Right.

603
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,540
That is correct.

604
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,000
That is correctamundo.

605
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,460
That is a basic tenet in the Church of the Subgenius.

606
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,820
The fact that 100, the 101th, though, the 101st.

607
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,040
The 101th subgenius.

608
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:01,580
The 101th subgenius is the one that pushes it over to the critical, the critical mass.

609
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,000
The critical mass.

610
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,340
And then all the subgeniuses start doing it.

611
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,060
That's correct.

612
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,960
After the 101th doctor first washes his old one.

613
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,860
His sweet potato in the ocean.

614
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,900
The 101th doctor first washes his old one.

615
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,280
And then pretty soon they all do it.

616
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,500
And then the girls say, all right, I'm fine.

617
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,020
As long as you do that, we're all.

618
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,640
And it's the new age.

619
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,280
All of a sudden, Ashtar is in command.

620
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,180
Orthon is in his special.

621
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,960
I'm flipping my sweet patootie in the ocean and you're flipping your sweet patootie in the ocean.

622
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,340
And we're sucking up all the money.

Read it, dear friends.

633
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,340
Well, should we go back to.

635
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,720
I'm coming up to the special part.

636
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,340
Quote me.

637
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,760
Quote me.

638
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,320
Bleeding head ecclesians.

639
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,160

640
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:13,620
And he shall come unto ye and ye shall be forced to reach for the washcloth of Gahangang.

641
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:22,780
And to thence cleanse thyself from that which has tainted thine soul.

642
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,580
I'm glad to hear that Reverend Stang used the perfect.

643
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,360
See, I can quote it.

644
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,600
You ask me another one.

645
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,300
And I'm proud that you used the correct pronunciation that only an educated neophyte could have learned after.

646
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,620
Years and years of.

647
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,160
Neophyte.

648
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,160


649
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,360
Neophyte or.

650
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,160
I don't know.

651
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,480
Quote me Exodus 20.

652
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,100
21.

653
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:42,920
I don't.

654
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,980
I don't quote the Bible.

655
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,540
I only quote.

656
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,300
The book of the subgenius.

657
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,640
A slave owner.

658
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,020
A slave owner can beat and kill a slave.

659
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,580
But only if the slave dies a slow and lingering death.

660
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,300
Exodus 21.

661
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:55,860
32.

662
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,640
Slaves are worth 30 coins.

663
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,640
But coins of what denomination?

664
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,540
That's correct.

665
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,320
Were they dimes?

666
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,400
Were they nickels?

667
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,720
Or were they coins?

668
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,220
Are they diamonds?

669
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,260
Are they nickels?

670
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,260


671
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,260


672
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,260


673
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,280
Are they diamonds?

674
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,280


675
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,220
Are they Jewish coins?

676
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,880
Mayhaps.

677
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,660
May they even be Mormonic?

678
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,600
They could have been more ironic.

679
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,440
It's sticky.

680
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,420
It's sticky.

681
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,880
The Mormons, of course, had that special.

682
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,880
That S special.

683
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,120
Coinage.

684
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,320
That Joseph Smith got on the copper.

685
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,840
From the copper plates.

686
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,900
You know, I'm related to him.

687
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm distant relations.

688
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,140
Yeah.

689
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,100
Could you say that again?

690
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,460
I just.

691
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:28,840
Oh, yeah.

692
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,200
For the polygamous king.

693
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm saying this over again for you that had to flip your tape.

694
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,980
Thank you.

695
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,260
I'm a polygamous king.

696
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,260


697
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,260


698
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,260


699
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,260


700
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,260


701
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,840
You.

702
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,900
Where was I?

703
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,060
About the moronic kingdom and the polygamous knuckleheads.

704
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


705
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


706
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:38,740
How we went.

707
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,540
And you started that.

708
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,100
And the Church of the Subgenius.

709
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,420
That cult.

710
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,080
Inherits.

711
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,240
Inherits this.

712
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,640
These tablets.

713
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,240
And you know.

714
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,920
We carry the tablets.

715
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,500
The Mormons were actually.

716
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,580
Came from a lost Israelite tribe who came to America.

717
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,700
And fought great battles which are recorded in the Book of Mormon.

718
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,260
Not to be confused with the Kaizoric peoples.

719
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:01,780
Yeah.

720
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,180
And the.

721
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,260
And of course.

722
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,580
When the.

723
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,160
It's.

724
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,600
When the.

725
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:04,720


726
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,880
It's odd that none of it can be substantiated through any.

727
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:08,740
Any.

728
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,060
Archaeological evidence whatsoever.

729
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,160
Although there was quite a bit of activity.

730
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,200
And hundreds and hundreds of thousands of.

731
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,200
The angels.

732
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,540
People.

733
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,960
Came and took it away.

734
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,640
Yes.

735
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,080
Right.

736
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,860
Because faith.

737
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,380
It's the faith.

738
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,380
It's the faith.

739
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:23,880
In the.

740
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,500
Copper plates.

741
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,620
And the blood.

742
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,640
Of the.

743
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,520
Believer.

744
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,020
Of the sacrificed lamb.

745
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,440
The sacrificed lamb.

746
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:30,920
Ah.

747
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,540
Yes.

748
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:31,860
The.

749
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,160
The.

750
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,160


751
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,480
Drinking up the blood.

752
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,160
Ah.

753
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,160


754
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,180
The drinking.

755
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:35,940
Because.

756
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,340
The drinking of the cup.

757
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,240
The one cup.

758
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,900
The sharing of the one cup of the blood of the risen yeti.

759
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,180
And it doesn't have to be the.

760
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,620
The living blood.

761
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,020
It can be the soup of.

762
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,020


763
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,020


764
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
The risen yeti of Dobbs.

765
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,920
Dobbs yeti.

766
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,280
Blood.

767
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:49,980
Resurrected.

768
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,220
As represented by the.

769
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,660
The money of the believer.

770
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,280
And spewed.

771
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,180
From the jugular veins of the dead yeti.

772
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,920
Oh.

773
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,460
It's so sad.

774
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,120
So sad.

775
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,760
But yet.

776
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,780
But what else do you do with a dead yeti.

777
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:01,880
From it we draw strength.

778
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,160
We draw strength.

779
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,500
We can draw.

780
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,260
Strength.

781
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,780
There you go.

782
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,640
And it's.

783
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,300
It's a party.

784
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:06,940
It becomes.

785
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,300
Like.

786
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,400
The sultan of Brunei.

787
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,040
Like the saucers.

788
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,300
Have you heard about the sultan of Brunei?

789
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,340
Yeah.

790
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,640
I've heard he lost his money.

791
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,200
He's already down to about 75 billion.

792
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,520
He's been gambling with J.R.

793
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,280
Bob Dobbs.

794
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,480
The sultan of Brunei said to be the richest man in the world with an estimated wealth

795
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,320
of 37 billion.

796
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,580
There.

797
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,800
See he's down from 75.

798
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,160
And.

799
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,160


800
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,520
It's not a good time.

801
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:32,520


802
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:32,520


803
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:32,620
There's a.

804
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,180
A bunch of people that is not.

805
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,820
I do not know.

806
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,180
I'm not sure.

807
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,400
I'm not sure.

808
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:36,760
I'm not sure.

809
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,260
But.

810
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,680
And.

811
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:38,880
But.

812
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:38,880


813
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,120
There he is.

814
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,300
I can't believe.

815
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,000
He's there.

816
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,620
He's there.

817
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,220
He's there.

818
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:41,580
I know.

819
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,600
He's there.

820
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,220
He's there.

821
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,600
I'm not sure.

822
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,200
But.

823
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,240
He's there.

824
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,440
He's there.

825
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:48,480


826
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,300
He's there.

827
00:33:52,300 --> 00:34:00,980
unto his harem a special dispensation that's right the original cleanse them

828
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:10,140
of their sins twelve apostles the twelve not and if 13 not Nate name not the 13th

829

831
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:29,160

832
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:36,420
stunk the original the one that came before and left behind this man a stench

833
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,360
unlike none other

834
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:50,880
communicated through a metaphoric melodious smell it had a mind it was tied

835
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,380
to the

836
00:34:51,800 --> 00:35:00,920
the basic underlying reality and could communicate certain talented mediums

837
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:11,100
such as the great lepetomane yes he was a disciple I'm a disciple of the great

838
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:21,720
lepetomane didn't you have a band school school of the petalology the petal monology that was a

839
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,620
great band lepetomane's disciples it was those of you who are not familiar with

840
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,300

00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:36,460
another swing of course too all right here are we going downhill lepetomane's

842
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:36,740

well I think so

847
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,100
we just need to clean up after ourselves

848
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,380
I don't want to get off the stage

849
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,180
I don't want to get off the stage

850
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,720
who told me to get off the stage

851
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,980
am I just paranoid maybe I'm paranoid

852
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,740
that's it

853
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,240
that's it

854
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,340
thank you

855
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,580
good

856
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:16,960
good

857
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,380
good

858
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,460
good

859
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:25,620
good

860
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,280
good

861
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,320
good

862
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,340
good

863
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
good

864
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,380
good

865
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,020
this is that song tune up time that you guys do

866
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,400
this is called tune ups of the gods

867
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,660
what is it

868
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,140
tune ups of the gods

869
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,700
who said I would break you out

870
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,060
turn it back on

871
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,020
it's on

872
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,400
It's because you guys take so long to get around to finally playing a song.

873
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,420
This is the most boring band.

874
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,120
If you've ever seen them live, they spend forever.

875
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,000
I keep thinking people are talking about me behind my back and stuff.

876
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,300
While I'm going down the freeway, those people in the car next to me, I know they're talking

877
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,860
about me.

878
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,520
I'm going down the freeway.

879
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,720
I'm going down the freeway.

880
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,340
I'm going down the freeway.

881
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm going down the freeway.

882
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,940
I'm going down the freeway.

883
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,700
We were destined to make it right.

884
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:07,820
We're predetermined.

885
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,200
We are grown-up men

886
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,140
We are all past

887
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,980
The age of reasoning

888
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,720
It is our mission

889
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,600
And it is our task

890
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,780
It's obvious

891
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,540
Yet useless

892
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,320
We are born to save the universe

893
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,180
We are born to save the universe

894
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,060
We are born to save the universe

895
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,180
Goodbye

896
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,680
Goodbye

897
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,140
Goodbye

898
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,980
Don't you worry

899
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,740
Don't have no fear

900
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,500
Or get uptight

901
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,340
Because the Indians fear

902
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,180
We can't fail

903
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,660
But we don't decide

904
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,460
We're in control

905
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,360
And we are born to find

906
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,380
We are born to save the universe

907
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,300
We are born to save the universe

908
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,580
We are born to save the universe

909
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:35,580


910
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,040
The universe

911
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,900
This time

912
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,480
And kids, you know, you can save the universe

913
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,440
If you haven't registered to vote

914
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,580
You need to vote

915
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,560
You need to do it pretty quick

916
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,100
You need to register by this Tuesday

917
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,800
October 6th

918
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,060
Or you can't vote on November 6th

919
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,700
Of course, half of you may be hearing this

920
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,060
After November 6th

921
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,020
And the conspiracy will have destroyed us

922
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,760
A vote for Bob is a vote against the conspiracy

923
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,380
Bob for world overlord

924
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,620
Bob for everything

925
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,980
Here's the lesson to be learned

926
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,000
Bob for Bob

927
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,900
The lesson to be learned

928
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,560
You're not going to read it

929
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,500
You're not going to read from some old book

930
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,260
You just found laying around the radio station, are you?

931
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,180
No, man

932
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,620
That's what they do on Welp

933
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,380
Jeez, what did you do?

934
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,920
Oh, God

935
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,400
I'm sorry, dear friends

936
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,700
With this particular episode of the Hour of Slack as an informal

937
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,660
You're the one that fed me

938
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,780
And relaxed

939
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,320
Please

940
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,360
If you don't mind

941
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,040
We don't need to be discussing bodily functions or other

942
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,380
Illegal things

943
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,460
You didn't say anything

944
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,600
Yeah, you didn't say anything

945
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,080
It was good, Reverend Spiney

946
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,340
Thanks

947
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,640
It was good

948
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,720
That's Snake Pudding

949
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:15,560
Man

950
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,820
Good stuff, boy

951
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,060
Good stuff, boy

952
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,060


953
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:26,160
Oh, Frank

954
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,640
You don't want everybody just to stick your finger in your nose

955
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,180
But don't you feel one more

956
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,260
I don't know how you feel one more

957
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,280
way or the other.

958
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,060
It's a picture of me, the wife, and all your brothers

959
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,300
driving in your car.

960
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,460
And you're looking at your neighbor by the nuggets

961
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,480
from his house just like you save her in the favor.

962
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,200
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's yanking on this thing.

963
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,160
It's a long, stride of steam still connected

964
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,940
to the brain.

965
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,220
Pick a booger.

966
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,560
Pick a booger.

967
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,740
Pick a booger.

968
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,060
Pick a booger.

969
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:23,680
Pick a booger.

970
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,520
Pick a booger.

971
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:32,880


972
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:32,980


973
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,520
It's the new day.

974
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,800
He's a slave to the master of his role in scientists.

975
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,520
The kids all want to have days of infatuation

976
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,020
because a pick a booger boogie is the new sensation.

977
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,520
Pick a booger.

978
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,940
Pick a booger.

979
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,160
Pick a booger.

980
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,120
Pick a booger.

981
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,500
Pick a booger.

982
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,240
Look at that.

983
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,700
What a lovely day, Dr. Drummond.

984
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,400
You ought to see the dance that goes with this, dear friend.

985
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,660
Sort of a finger dance.

986
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,400
A very special dance.

987
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,760
You have to kind of imagine in your mind what it would be like

988
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,680
if you were seeing a bunch of grown men on stage picking boogers.

989
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,880
Acting like it, of course, not the real thing.

990
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,560
We wouldn't be that gross.

991
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,620
We wouldn't be able to talk about that.

992
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,260
No, that'd be sick.

993
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,480
Sort of like the Russ Meyer movies.

994
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,140
Just the fact that we know that it was fake makes us realize that it's not sick.

995
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,040
But if it was real, then we would know how sick we really were.

996
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,320
You don't need to know anything about this.

997
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,420
Just how sick.

998
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:25,960
Hey, this tape's about to end.

999
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,660
Do you want to hear something I did with my computer?

1000
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,920
Yeah, let's hear it.

1001
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,720
This is an ad I had to do.

1002
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,980
Let's hear something you did with your computer.

1003
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,040
I did.

1004
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,060
You were Reverend Stans.

1005
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:32,680
Yeah, I had to do it.

1006
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,600
I've got to show this off.

1007
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,300
I did an ad.

1008
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:34,920
Stansy?

1009
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,260
Yeah, Reverend Stans.

1010
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,220
We're making fun of John Rohde, your friend.

1011
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,440
Yeah, Reverend Stans.

1012
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,380
Now everybody who's calling in is against you.

1013
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,660
I think you guys are a bunch of cruds.

1014
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,380
You guys don't know what's going on.

1015
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,980
Yeah, I thought it was kind of clever until all the Christians started calling in.

1016
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,660
When they called in, now I'm bummed, man.

1017
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,360
You guys, what kind of psychos are you?

1018
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,980
What kind of crazy...

1019
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,440
Thought you'd tried everything?

1020
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,880
Well, we have!

1021
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,500
And it's so nice.

1022
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,820
We're doing it twice.

1023
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:11,580
Yes, the world's first subgenius rant and rave is doubling back to give you R&R Squirrel.

1024
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,980
The Association for Consciousness Exploration and the Smart Bar.

1025
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,800
1575 Merwin in the flat.

1026
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:22,760
We'll double your pleasure with the semi-new rant and rave, too.

1027
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,800
Starting at 7 sharp on Saturday, October 10th, we unleash two subgenius master preachers.

1028
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,520
Reverend Ivan Stang from Dallas.

1029
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:30,900
And...

1030
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,540
Little Rock's Sternodoc.

1031
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,200
Plus, the double-barreled Reverend Mary Squared.

1032
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,540
Au contraire.

1033
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,520
Too much for any warm man to handle.

1034
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,960
Plus, the twin attractions of the Devil Biker Bunnies from Naked Hill.

1035
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,460
Two house music stars, New York DJ Larry T and Hey Fellow Singer Simone.

1036
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,820
World beat drummer Free Percussion.

1037
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,040
Coupled with the Cosmic Corridor to Ace's Mind Bomb.

1038
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,840
And we'll all get married.

1039
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,580
Where?

1040
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,020
At the Mass Short Duration Marriage Ceremony.

1041
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,900
Yes, it's all too much.

1042
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,900
But remember, too much is always better than not enough.

1043
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,900
Tickets are $7 in advance, $8 a day of show.

1044
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,740
Available at Smart Bar, Record Rev, and Coventry Christmas Board.

1045
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:17,420
Yeah, so we can play that ad on this station because that's an ad for an out-of-town show.

1046
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,900
You can't go to it.

1047
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,580
But just to let you know, what you can do with a little Macintosh.

1048
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,260
Wow, that's cool, Reverend Stang.

1049
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,680
I was talking into my Macintosh.

1050
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,040
I just wanted to show off what you can do with your Macintosh.

1051
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,520
Yeah, the Macintosh one.

1052
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,720
My computer's on.

1053
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,760
It's almost as good as yours.

1054
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,180
Yeah, I had a Macintosh once.

1055
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,100
Yeah, you threw it away in there because you've got such a good one.

1056
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:36,540
Yeah.

1057
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,040
See, it goes on.

1058
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,300
See, you can do all that fancy schmancy stuff.

1059
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,400
I know.

1060
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,020
Oh, oh, is it?

1061
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,660
Oh, okay.

1062
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,060
Yeah.

1063
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,740
Well, now what do we do?

1064
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,880
We've got ten more minutes until we have to kill now.

1065
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,620
Well, I've got this media barrage tape.

1066
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,540
You know, it's like funny.

1067
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,320
It's like collages.

1068
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,920
Well, let's just talk, Reverend Stang.

1069
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:04,480
Okay.

1070
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:11,140
Well, I could play the rest of Pick a Booger and Johnny Got Robbed and Give Me Back My Fun Thing.

1071
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,380
Okay, yeah, let's do that.

1072
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,340
But you know, these tape decks sound peculiar tonight.

1073
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,340
I think there is.

1074
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:24,000
They both uniformly sound as if they're being broadcast all the way to Oklahoma City and back.

1075
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,720
With the static and everything in between.

1076
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:27,680
Yeah.

1077
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:28,860
Yeah.

1078
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,240


1079
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:29,840
Yeah.

1080
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:30,020


1081
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:30,140


1082
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:30,220
Yeah.

1083
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:30,300


1084
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:30,840
Yeah.

1085
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:30,840


1086
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:30,860
Yeah.

1087
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:30,860


1088
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:30,880
Yeah.

1089
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:30,880


1090
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:30,880


1091
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:30,880


1092
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:30,880


1093
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:30,880


1094
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:30,880


1095
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:30,880


1096
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:30,880


1097
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:30,880


1098
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,700
Yeah.

1099
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,320
Yeah.

1100
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,200
And then we took some more.

1101
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:33,840
Yeah.

1102
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,600
Yeah.

1103
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,880
So we might as well.

1104
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,100
I remember that.

1105
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,620
Continue, you know, the same way.

1106
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,080
What'd you say?

1107
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,560
Yeah, we took some more.

1108
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,320
Yeah.

1109
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,480
Hey, did you hear that noise, man?

1110
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,400
Yeah, but then the truck was full and we couldn't take any more.

1111
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,100
That's a good thing you only took two because I saw what happened that first time.

1112
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,820
That truck load.

1113
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,000
Two truck loads.

1114
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,180
And two bathtubs full.

1115
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,760
Two bucket loads.

1116
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,280
They were full.

1117
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,080
I never saw so many dead cops.

1118
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,120
That was a frightening thing.

1119
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,700
You know, if you tried to do that today, if you tried to do that nowadays, they'd shut you down in a minute.

1120
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,420
No, they still got chainsaw juggling.

1121
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,820
There's an old dump truck full.

1122
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,780
Yeah, dead pickup.

1123
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,140
So dead pickups.

1124
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,740
Well, hell, Tom Warner'd probably sign your contract.

1125
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,640
That Tom Warner'd be showing up at your house going, sign here.

1126
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,040
You got a truck load full of them?

1127
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,080
I got a dump truck full of pickup trucks.

1128
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,960
I got a heavy four-back barrel lifter and a quad.

1129
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,020
I got a quad overhead cam double shifter.

1130
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:34,960
And a pick-match, too.

1131
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,640
That thing, man, it'll tear up.

1132
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,420
It'll pick me up in an inning.

1133
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,500
It'll do me down.

1134
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,100
It'll tear a janer tongue right out of its mouth.

1135
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,080
A 48 Buick is olive green.

1136
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,180
Damn, were the days.

1137
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,580
It was so easy back in the old days.

1138
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,840
I remember when.

1139
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,940
Before the diseases and the mental illness.

1140
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,180
48 Buick.

1141
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,380
It had lights in the wheel wells and quarter walls.

1142
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:00,820
I had a wheelchair.

1143
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,120
Burned cheap gas since you always stalled.

1144
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,660
I remember when I was real tall like the dog.

1145
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,380
I know J.R. Bob Dobbs for what he was.

1146
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,220
I know the sub-denim for what they were.

1147
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,440
Got 20 and 10-E with a vacuum tail.

1148
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,180
There's a spare in the trunk, but it's full of nails.

1149
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,880
They were there, but they were almost backwards.

1150
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,380
And you put them upside down and the buttons would come out.

1151
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,280
And then they'd throw them over and run on them.

1152
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,660
And then they didn't do nothing like.

1153
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,440
You're right.

1154
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,300
All the kids on my block say it sure looks keen.

1155
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,120
That was back when the church was just one old shed.

1156
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,780
I remember when the church was just a walking around town kind of church.

1157
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,000
You just got up and didn't even have any roots.

1158
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,960
It was just like a pair of old pants.

1159
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,620
You just put them on and wear them around town for a while.

1160
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,980
And you take them off, throw them in the corner.

1161
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,040
And nobody knew they were there.

1162
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,880
And then we had that little shack.

1163
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,740
And that was the first roots we ever had.

1164
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,800
And nowadays you walk around on college campus.

1165
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,740
You walk around with a Bob shirt.

1166
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,300
And while they're all walking up.

1167
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,260
Where'd you get that?

1168
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,500
Oh, they don't show up in the conspiracy stories.

1169
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,080
They don't knock you down, man.

1170
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,520
Some colleges, they just knock you down trying to tear it off of you.

1171
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,000
Well, I don't want to go into them for some of the adventures I've had on them campuses, Dr. Drummond.

1172
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,220
I don't want you to.

1173
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,420
I've been amazed at all you do.

1174
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,520
Nobody else does either because it's sick.

1175
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,580
It's just sick.

1176
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,080
People, yeah, people, sure.

1177
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,780
You know, KFJZ don't have anything like that.

1178
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,940
They took them off over there when old George left.

1179
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,900
People, sure.

1180
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,820
When old Mr. Opinion left over there at KFJZ.

1181
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:40,740
This is the sickest, sickest thing I've ever seen on KFJZ.

1182
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,200
You don't think people ought to be able to start their own religion?

1183
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,000
People.

1184
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,600
People, yeah.

1185
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,720
People, sure.

1186
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,600
But this, this is sick.

1187
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,440
The sickest, sickest thing I ever heard.

1188
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,000
I ever heard on KNON.

1189
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,640
They just kept...

1190
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:00,900
KFJZ.

1191
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,280
Saying they were doctors over and over again.

1192
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,100
But then...

1193
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,540
Then they called back.

1194
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,380
This is different.

1195
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,780
They talk about cattle mutilation.

1196
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,180
People, yeah, sure.

1197
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Oh, back in them days, you could get on the air.

1198
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,760
You could talk on the telephone with the listeners.

1199
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,060
They'd call up and challenge you.

1200
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:22,940
And you didn't have those sick boys, those ones that called in to cuss, cuss rappers.

1201
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,800
No, you didn't have to worry about it in them days.

1202
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,820
Back in them days.

1203
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,040
Dr. Drummond, he was...

1204
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,500
He was a little rooster back in the day.

1205
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,780
Pass me that Sombutol.

1206
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,080
I'm a damn it all man myself.

1207
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,560
I need another swig of that Sombutol.

1208
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,200
See?

1209
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,300
Sombnambulators.

1210
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,680
You can have your damn Joyjackers.

1211
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,500
I'm going to stick with my Sombnambulators.

1212
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,600
I need my Sombnambulators.

1213
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,320
You crazy thing.

1214
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,360
Well, I'm going to...

1215
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,340
One screamer, two minutes.

1216
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,080
Okay, well, we've got eight minutes now.

1217
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:56,820
Eight minutes.

1218
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,860
Okay, well...

1219
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,100
All that wasted space for just...

1220
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:00,700
Two minutes.

1221
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,320
Think of what we could have been doing.

1222
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,000
Well...

1223
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,220
To what these airwaves could...

1224
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,480
We could have been talking about political stuff, man.

1225
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,200
What about this election coming up, Dr. Drummond?

1226
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,460
I know that you're a good liberal.

1227
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:13,580
And...

1228
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:14,720
Why, of course.

1229
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,080
I say, vote your conscience.

1230
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,120
Not only that, just remember.

1231
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,920
Who pays the taxes in this country?

1232
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,340
You or me?

1233
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,960
Well, I can tell you right now, it's not me.

1234
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,300
Praise Bob.

1235
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:32,420
So?

1236
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,580
But, friends, you can't...

1237
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,700
Whoever you vote on...

1238
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,160
If you don't vote, you can't complain.

1239
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:36,860
That's right.

1240
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,020
You can complain, but if I catch you, I'm going to say,

1241
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,200
Did you vote?

1242
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,880
And then you'll be going,

1243
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,880
Hold up, man.

1244
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,460
Like, I don't believe like this.

1245
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,720
It's like, everyone doesn't make any difference to you, man.

1246
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,960
It's like, besides, I had a great show that night.

1247
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,220
I don't...

1248
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,040
There's nobody to vote on, man.

1249
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,780
I'm like...

1250
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,140
They're all like...

1251
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:56,900
They're all like...

1252
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,020
Yeah, man.

1253
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,840
You just vote for me.

1254
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,880
Yeah, I'll tell you how to fix this country up.

1255
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,520
I'll tell you how to fix this country up.

1256
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,420
There ain't nobody to vote on.

1257
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,640
You know, you can even absentee vote in the next couple of weeks.

1258
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:15,660
You go out there and vote before everybody else does.

1259
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:19,800
So that you can start complaining then.

1260
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,300
I vote for higher taxes and lower wages.

1261
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,520
You know, if Bill Clinton becomes president,

1262
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:29,760
and all of a sudden they take away your car, your guns,

1263
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,220
your money, and give it to the nearest crippled,

1264
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,940
minority, lesbian, blind person,

1265
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,520
because they're the most needing,

1266
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,560
then you can complain if you vote.

1267
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,620
You can complain all you want.

1268
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,980
If you vote, if you don't vote,

1269
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,540
and George Bush is president,

1270
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,600
and the next day you wake up in a concentration camp

1271
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,780
for all those who weren't white males,

1272
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,240
with a big bank account,

1273
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,100
and a company of their own,

1274
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,420
then don't complain.

1275
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,640
If you don't vote, and Ross Perot is president,

1276
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,800
and you wake up, and everything's completely...

1277
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:09,860
Pain.

1278
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,580
It's just pain.

1279
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,120
It's gonna be pain.

1280
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,520
It's gonna be like World War II.

1281
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,140
Everybody's gonna be...

1282
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,000
But everybody's gonna share the pain.

1283
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:17,600
That's right.

1284
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,540
We're all gonna share the pain.

1285
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,320
This is our sacrificial religion, dear friends.

1286
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,520
I'm sorry, when we cut your program, Mr. Medicare,

1287
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,640
we only have five dollars left.

1288
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,200
But...

1289
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,280
I'm sorry, when we cut your program, Mr. Education and Welfare,

1290
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,560
we only got ten bucks left now.

1291
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,180
Nineteen dollars a gallon.

1292
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,580
But we're sharing the pain, that's for sure.

1293
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,400
Yeah.

1294
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,300
We're all feeling the pain, aren't we?

1295
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,260
See, I told you we'd feel the pain.

1296
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,420
I didn't lie to you.

1297
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,780
I didn't lie to you.

1298
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,580
Now, if it wasn't for the volunteers, I wouldn't be here.

1299
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,780
I'd be out mining my three billion dollars, or whatever it is I got.

1300
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,100
I'd be out flapping my ears, flying around Dallas. I've been counting.

1301
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,100
You're leveraging your address song.

1302
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,420

vice president.

1306
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:10,440
Yeah.

1307
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,080
I quit.

1308
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:16,140
Now, how about we use a victim's office.

1309

Where is old Stimpy?

1317
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,180
Now, if the volunteers in all 50 states want me to run, then I will.

1318
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,040
And I said I would, and now I'm going to run because they said they did.

1319
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,380
I'm running.

1320
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,740
Well, you want to pick a booger?

1321
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,920
Sure. With Ross.

1322
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,820
Dear friends, hey, where is the...

1323
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:52,680
You probably, when you duped that for me, you probably didn't even rewind the tapes just to get them all lined up, did you?

1324
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,220
Nope, just got a whole bunch of blank stuff at the beginning.

1325
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,080
You're going to have to talk all the way through the rest of it.

1326
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:04,880
Dear friends, you have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack here in Dallas, Texas.

1327
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,080
I'm going to give you a number to write to.

1328
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:15,180
I don't know why you would want more information on this church, but you can get it for free anyway by dropping a line to

1329
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:22,460
Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1330
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:22,660
Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1331
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,740
75214.

1332
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:44,840
Oh, no, you better give the Swingin' Love Corpses a go, because those of you who aren't here, the least bit interested in any information cataloged or taped on the Swingin' Love Corpses is 338 Lakewood, St. Louis, Missouri, or Baldwin, Missouri, 63011.

1333
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,560
You barely could remember your own address.

1334
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,900
I couldn't remember my own address for a minute there.

1335
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,740
I know the feeling there.

1336
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:54,980
I thought that was just the pressure of being on the radio and actually speaking normally.

1337
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,720
Yeah.

1338
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:06,160
Well, thanks, Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Snavely Eklund, for showing up and providing background sound effects and medias.

1339
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:18,120
And, you know, every now and then I probably ought to thank old Will Dobbs for coming down here and answering the phone, except that I think he manages to get his...

1340
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,320
Yeah.

1341
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,600
He makes his time work.

1342
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,160
It was a great work, yeah.

1343
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,860
He might join New York City up front or something.

1344
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:24,460
I've been talking to him for this whole year, the next six years, but, and that, yeah, that thing where I mean his mom runs it like a crack in theales.

Come on, everybody, stick your finger in your nose

1359

Take a look around, why have you got your nose?

1360
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,220
Don't know how you feel, one way or another

1361

If it makes you happy, why have you got your nose?
