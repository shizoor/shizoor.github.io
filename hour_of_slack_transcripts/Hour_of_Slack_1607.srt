00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
When the Security Council of the United Nations met Bob Dobbs in New York,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,920
radio faced the task of broadcasting its historic sessions.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,600
Few listeners had the time to devote to a meeting of six or seven hours.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,540
This station therefore prepared a specially condensed version.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,440
The subgenius hour of swag.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,420
The tape was then edited down to our show.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,400
It was then re-recorded and finally broadcast at night,

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,340
when the largest audience could listen.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,980
The program became so popular that the station was requested to release it to the United Nations

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,960
so that they could broadcast it themselves, thereby providing another source of income.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,880
For the value of radio time is judged by the amount of goods it sells to the public.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,320
This is independent radio in a democracy.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,480
The End

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,300
The End

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,660
Kids, I'm afraid I've...

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,320
I've lost the most precious thing there is to me.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,500
My personal slag.

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,940
Oh children, gather around.

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,540
The older girls, look up closer.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,340
The ones who are starting to sprout.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Are you missing your slag, brother?

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,900
Have you no slag?

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,120
Well, praise Don.

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,860
Don brings slag.

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,560
To the slagless.

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,060
If you down in your mine or your quarry have not enough slag,

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,700
why, R.L. Don Glods will bring you slag.

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
Smooth. Soft.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And he will teach you the story of the Mists from outer space

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,860
who will come down to Earth and save all those who spent their thirty-one dollars.

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,740
Oh yeah.

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,040
Yes.

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,480
Praise Don.

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,700
Praise Don.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,460
Yes.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:54,760


37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,380
Don will let you play with your thermometer in the rain, unlike Bob Dobbs, who'll let you

38
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,940
stand in hackneyed and short.

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,580
He's the kind of man who visits and blots...

40
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,340
Whew.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,300
What was in that stuff?

42
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,600
Is that stuff?

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,220
Or is it just something else?

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,560
Oh, that's that stuff J.R. Bob Dobbs sold you, ain't it?

45
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,700
He ate it?

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,840
You can't...

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,520
He ain't...

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,020
He can't...

49
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,380
He can't skip...

50
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,100
He can't...

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,580
it all the time.

52
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,580
It just goes like

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,840
Bob. It gets into

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,020
your brain and then it just scrambles everything up.

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,700
Thank God we're into dawn now

56
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,740
and forgot that evil slackmeister

57
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,840
Bob. Trying to heal, you know,

58
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,740
those

59
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,040
who've been

60
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,780
brainwashed by the Bob cult.

61
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,500
Those who

62
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,460
are recovering.

63
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,940
Those poor people.

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,660
Cult addicts.

65
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,080
Are you hurt?

66
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,180
Bob. Bob.

67
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,800
Hi.

68
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,920
You faker.

69
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,200
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,620
It's a time space warp.

71
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,580
I'm not sure I know exactly what that is.

72
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,540
I don't suppose anybody

73
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,260
really does.

74
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,460
We've seen some strange things tonight.

75
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,600
Strange

76
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,520
creatures that we know don't belong on our

77
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,840
planet.

78
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,100
God only knows where they came from.

79
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,120
Jenny and Beth.

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,660
The Vortex

81
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,220
took them.

82
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,540
Just...

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,120
Just took them away.

84
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,760
Welcome to Sub-G Sci-Fi.

85
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,540
When last we left

86
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,620
our heroine, Severia Yeti

87
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,860
Blood, she had pursued her nemesis,

88
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,480
Lord Niki, into the very

89
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,140
bowels of the great starship,

90
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,020
Capstown.

91
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,980
Give it up, Lord Niki.

92
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,460
There's no place left to run.

93
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,120
Never.

94
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,340
I'll hunt you yeti until you're extinct.

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,880
I will have order.

96
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,760
Do you hear me?

97
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,820
Order for the billions and billions of star systems.

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,260
Order and discipline.

99
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,300
I've fallen for your conspiracy tricks often enough

100
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,040
to know you're full of crap.

101
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,400
You're not a clone of Carl Sagan.

102
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,660
You're an evil agent of the conspiracy.

103
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,580
But what will you do now?

104
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,580
I've magnetically fixed the power of the conspiracy.

105
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,600
I've put the luck plane in place.

106
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,720
All the odds are against you.

107
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,500
Permanently.

108
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,420
Typical conspiracy thinking.

109
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,760
How will your evil machinations ever hope to defeat this?

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,920
Good God.

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,260
That's the very pipe of Bob Dobbs.

112
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,480
How did you get it?

113
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,160
Sent $30 to the Reverend Ivan Stang.

114
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,840
You idiot.

115
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,960
How else would I gain access to the one true pipe?

116
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,860
Let me smoke from it.

117
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,560
I beg of you.

118
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,080
You disgusting conspiracy peon.

119
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,780
You don't smoke the pipe of Bob.

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,560
You let the pipes run.

121
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,020
Smoke you.

122
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,140
Don't do it.

123
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,680
If you fire that in here, you'll destroy the ship.

124
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,820
What makes you think that's not exactly what I intend?

125
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,480
You conspiracy fool.

126
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,880
But you also destroy the space fighters

127
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,700
led by Nikki Deathchick

128
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,820
that are even now surrounding the ship.

129
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,740
Commander Deathchick can take care of her squadron.

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Worry about your own miserable hide.

131
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,460
Why are you doing this

132
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,500
when we could rule the universe together?

133
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,820
I'll tell you why next year.

134
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,200
The Exists will definitely come to Brushwood.

135
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,680
And rupture us all the way to Planet X.

136
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,700
You subgenius fools have been saying that for years.

137
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,880
Don't you realize you've been duped?

138
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,660
You must be insane to believe in that charlatan Bob.

139
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,300
That's exactly what a pink boy like you would say.

140
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,660
Now eat hot plasma balls.

141
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,440
In a small way, I pity Lord Negi.

142
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,320
He simply wasn't willing to pay the price.

143
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,560
To find out what he really thought.

144
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,860
Tune in next week for more sub-G sci-fi.

145
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,200
By the Bishop.

146
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,220
the information he could not reveal.

147
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,840
see more clips at deputy go

148
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,520
받아

149
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:41,620
i

150
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:48,840
the heart

151
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,320
Heart Ignition.

152
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,480
Colorado D.O. is possibly severe.

153
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:56,940
You're in bar.

154
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,940
The million dollars.

155
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,060
Thanks.

156
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,980
Thanks.

157
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,340
This is low-income students.

158
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,200
Some low-income students are encased in rock on public lands in Colorado.

159
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,820
These little creatures are poised to wreak havoc.

160
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,900
They say it violates the state constitution, creating a black market for...

161
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,240
Thanks.

162
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,600
Bye-bye, Fernanda Nende.

163
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,580
Lee Moore.

164
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,160
Oh, yes, dear friends.

165
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,320
Papa John's.

166
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:44,340
Joe Mama's 1998 subgenius radio play called I Was a Cultist for the ATF

167
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,380
is but one of several short radio plays in this rerun from 2003.

168
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,600
Hour of Slack number 902, it was.

169
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,640
We also get subgenius sci-fi by The Bishop

170
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,680
and the classic high school madness by the Firesign Theater

171
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,740
from their album Don't Crush That Dwarf Family of Pliers.

172
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,060
Oddly.

173
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,340
All of these old skits seem remarkably pertinent to this week's news events,

174
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,860
despite being such ancient parables about authoritarianism in The Conspiracy.

175
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,100
A Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the late Chaz Smith are also heard in some great clips

176
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,960
from ESO's Swamp Radio from WCSB,

177
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,580
and there's loads of keen Lee Moore collages,

178
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,480
plus Radio Lee Murraya, which has nothing to do with Lee Moore,

179
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,540
but features a fine rant by Reverend Lemuel Atom.

180
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,260
Music cuts include Reverend Mojo Nixon and Reverend the Amino Acids.

181
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,580
And now this.

182
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,420
After sterilizing all of the little children by the fire

183
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,140
and making sure they'd never make babies with big orange heads like them,

184
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,060
we commenced to sing a song.

185
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,620
Old Uncle Floppy was the head clown, and believe me, the children just loved him.

186
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,680
The sores were still bright and burning in there,

187
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,280
there weren't very many things they could say.

188
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,040
Many of the tongues had been removed.

189
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,480
But he was, Uncle Floppy was so great.

190
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
Everybody loved Uncle Floppy.

191
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,620
He talked about Bob at the Church of the Subgenius.

192
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,680
He talked about Sloth or whatever that, he talked about...

193
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,220
And they hit each other and threw pies and then knocked each other down,

194
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,720
and they were little and funny.

195
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,080
And they sang like a Cacophonous sound.

196
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,240
It was like the Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz.

197
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,800
Electro!

198
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
It kept you from talking.

199
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,860
That was the best thing about it.

200
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,660
Those clowns, they just, they kept you from...

201
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,980
Hanging on, man.

202
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,220
From having to talk.

203
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,120
They just filled everything up.

204
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,800
They stopped you from believing, man.

205
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,160
With fun.

206
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,940
That's what's wrong with you now, man.

207
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,600
The cork's out.

208
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
You're evacuated.

209
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,340
All the belief is gone, man.

210
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,220
You've got no more belief left to go.

211
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,820
Come on, buddy.

212
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,160
Buck up, there's just three more miles.

213
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,700
Bob said, believe me out of it, dude.

214
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,240
Bob said a lot of things.

215
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,780
He didn't make any damn difference.

216
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,320
He didn't make any difference to anybody.

217
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,120
He's a liar then, he's a liar now.

218
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,200
He's perfected his lying arts.

219
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,240
His ability to deceive and confuse.

220
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,020
But he was honest about it.

221
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,800
I suppose if you bold-faced lie,

222
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,800
and then you confuse and deceive behind it,

223
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,820
and say that's what you're doing,

224
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,540
and then say you're not,

225
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,520
because it's like the lion's sister in the mountain,

226
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,020
and the two of them were stuck together

227
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,320
at the midriff hemispheres.

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,960
It's like that.

229
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,420
But if not, it's...

230
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,800
Well, no, I mean, often,

231
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,600
when he was a salesman,

232
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,800
he always just dressed his best.

233
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,780
But when he would go out,

234
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,280
and preach,

235
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,600
he had the word liar written

236
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,940
in thick magic marker across his forehead.

237
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,940
But nobody paid attention to that, man.

238
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,160
They looked at his shoes, man.

239
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,280
They were so shiny and bright.

240
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,640
No, they thought that was part of his message.

241
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,240
They thought that was what guaranteed

242
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,840
that he was telling the truth.

243
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,240
That's serious.

244
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,360
Because he was the one guy

245
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,460
that had liar written across his forehead.

246
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,300
It guaranteed the laughs.

247
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,620
It kept the small force going.

248
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
It'd make things bright.

249
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,840
But no, no, man.

250
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,640
It was the shoes.

251
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,340
Do you remember?

252
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,640
No matter what he did, though,

253
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
he kept losing ratings to Rush Limbaugh.

254
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,520
Yeah, and he kept on...

255
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,360
They just...

256
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,720
They went for the subtle approach

257
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,280
rather than the direct, honest approach.

258
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,640
And then after the third year,

259
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,780
he kept on gaining radium,

260
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,720
and then he was more dishonest.

261
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,780
And the next thing you know,

262
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,320
he had taken over the clear channels

263
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
all over the places.

264
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,600
He was the one.

265
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,400
He was the one, man.

266
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,120
The big, big, big one.

267
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,740
Speaking of big ones,

268
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,660
I was looking through some article

269
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,160
in some paper about local radio stations,

270
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,360
and it turned out that they were all owned...

271
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,140
All 20 or so stations

272
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,040
were owned by only

273
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,760
three different radio stations.

274
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:35,980
And they were all the same people

275
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,220
who also were the same ones

276
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,960
who own that many stations.

277
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,980
The Puppet Meister.

278
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,700
In every city.

279
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,080
Yes.

280
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,660
In every town.

281
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,840
In every planet.

282
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,980
We know who the puppeteer is.

283
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,280
It's Rupert, baby.

284
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,540
Rupert is the puppeteer.

285
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,480
You know, man.

286
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,100
He pulled the strings.

287
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,280
He made the money dance.

288
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,040
No, if you know his name,

289
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,520
then that's not the puppeteer.

290
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,100
That's only one of the puppets.

291
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,440
For his name shall not be named,

292
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,400
he shall not be known.

293
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:03,960
He shall not be known.

294
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,320
Somebody owns Rupi.

295
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,160
You can't follow the strings up that far.

296
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,040
No, man.

297
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,680
It'd be easy to cut them if you could.

298
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,860
If you'd like to know the real truth,

299
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,120
the strings go on beyond this planetary sphere.

300
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,000
They go way, way, way, way out there.

301
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,780
Well, they're very sophisticated

302
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,360
because now they have puppets

303
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,720
that can work puppets.

304
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,060
You see.

305
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,680
You don't know how many puppets

306
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,100
down the line you are.

307
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,000
There's not...

308
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,120
Notice, you're not running

309
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,260
a marionette right now.

310
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,440
Can you fly this plane and land it?

311
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,860
Surely you can't be serious.

312
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
I am serious.

313
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,740
And don't call me Shirley.

314
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,160
I am Shirley.

315
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,540
We're all Shirley, aren't we?

316
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,280
B.O.P.

317
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,260
B.O.P.

318
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:08,760
Bop.

319
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,140
B.O.P.

320
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,760
Bop-bop.

321
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,360
You are listening to the voice

322
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,540
of the Maria Radio Service.

323
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,540
Attention.

324
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,640
May I have your attention, please?

325
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,980
This regularly scheduled program

326
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,960
has been interrupted to bring you

327
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,460
the inaugural broadcast

328
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,480
of the Voice of Lemuria Radio Service.

329
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,340
My name is Captain Willard Vroom,

330
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
commander of the Lemurian airship

331
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,200
Spirit of St. Elmo,

332
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,720
the flagship broadcasting platform

333
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,140
of the Voice of Lemuria.

334
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,480
Currently cruising at 65,000 feet

335
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
above the Pacific Rim,

336
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,800
the Spirit of St. Elmo

337
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,420
is beaming this broadcasting

338
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,800
to conspiracy-occupied territories.

339
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
The Voice of Lemuria Radio Service

340
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,420
brings you information

341
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,400
and entertainment unavailable

342
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,700
in conspiracy-controlled media outlets.

343
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,120
This lack of worthwhile news

344
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,900
and music should be evident

345
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,740
to all but the most dim-witted

346
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,920
mass media consumer.

347
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,500
You have been consistently lied to

348
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,160
and force-fed bland, idiotic fare

349
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,040
in the form of pop culture

350
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,700
and infotainment.

351
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,100
Many are the forces that would keep you

352
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,480
ignorant,

353
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:35,760
and you are not.

354
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,240
Heartless, soulless corporations

355
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,160
grubbing for yet more money.

356
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,200
Sinister, vampire-like government entities

357
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
seeking to further their hidden agendas.

358
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,820
Cash-fattened, Texas-based religious cults

359
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,460
attempting to expand their sales

360
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,140
of t-shirts and marilades.

361
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,880
All of these groups would deceive you

362
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,180
to achieve their own twisted goals.

363
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,700
But no more.

364
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,620
The Voice of Lemuria is now available

365
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,960
to bring you the true sounds of liberty.

366
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,740
We offer you the opportunity

367
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,540
to learn the unvarnished truth

368
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,880
about the nature of reality

369
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,000
and how you can use it.

370
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,780
Break the bonds of ignorance

371
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,360
and satisfy your own wants and desires

372
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,520
and twisted needs.

373
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,920
The Voice of Lemuria can help you

374
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,140
achieve all of this.

375
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Lemuria represents the last

376
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,100
unsullied territory in this area

377
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,740
of the cosmos.

378
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,640
It is the final hope for all those

379
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,900
who realize that the general situation

380
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,480
has gone way past what can be

381
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,800
considered tolerable.

382
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,540
The Voice of Lemuria,

383
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,200
offers you truth and hope

384
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,580
through information and entertainment.

385
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,760
But enough of that for now.

386
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,440
I'll be back later with further information.

387
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,320
For now, just sit back, relax, and enjoy.

388
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,340
It's a man I love.

389
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,760
Maybe a governor in German, the party.

390
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,960
I was born in the land of the war.

391
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,040
I try to be a hero.

392
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,260
But the war,

393
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,640
they let me wait.

394
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,120
Watching.

395
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,360
Laughing.

396
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:37,940
texting.

397
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,960
Sit down.

398
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,760
Sixty feet.

399
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,080
And she says shouts.

400
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,860
You're a police officer.

401
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:49,860


402
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:49,860


403
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,480
You will never race

404
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,040
in this hall

405
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,220
to the German border

406
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,000
This moron

407
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,300
He is a hero

408
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,760
a hero

409
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,800
special

410
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:56,800


411
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:56,800


412
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:56,800


413
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,160
on the underground

414
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,180
work of p. c.

415
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,520
You are listened,

416
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:05,720


417
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:05,720


418
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,060
to the voice of

419
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,800
the Radio Service.

420
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,560
Oh, baby.

421
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,040
Here we go.

422
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,860
Yeah!

423
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,840
My TV is watching me.

424
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,200
My TV is watching me.

425
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,440
L. Ron Hubbard is messing with me.

426
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,660
The bats are flying, baby.

427
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,600
Can't you see?

428
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,860
Oh, the CBSI is watching me.

429
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,200
I need my lithium, baby.

430
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,180
Can't you see?

431
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,240
Oh, yeah.

432
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,020
My TV is watching me.

433
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,280
Oh, my TV is watching me.

434
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,760
You know, a solar flex ain't nothing

435
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,060
but a very expensive hat.

436
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,660
Crack, baby.

437
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,360
Oh, and my goal in life

438
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,120
is to be picking my nose on TV

439
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,440
because my TV is watching me.

440
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,100
I can't find my remote.

441
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,740
I can't find my remote.

442
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,700
I don't know where it's going.

443
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,420
My TV is watching me.

444
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,480
I see Michael Jackson

445
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,600
and Lisa Marie.

446
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,620
Malcolm X is a hat.

447
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,120
Martin Luther King is a street.

448
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,360
My TV is watching me.

449
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,460
I see the one, two, three faces of Bob.

450
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,960
I see the one, two, three faces of Bob.

451
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,720
Bob and the replacements.

452
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,320
Bob the subgenius.

453
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,840
Bob.

454
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,660
But I don't drink

455
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,560
to get me

456
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,840
Everybody say

457
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,140
My TV is watching me

458
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,340
My TV is watching me

459
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,040
I got Latter Day Saints

460
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,620
messing with me

461
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,440
And knock it on my door

462
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,860
Won't let me be

463
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,120
My TV is watching me

464
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,480
Well the outcasts will be heard

465
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,020
You gotta speak the truth

466
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,660
Make the weak and the greedy

467
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,420
It's crap in your pants

468
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,900
I'm weak and the greedy

469
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,800
Crap in your pants

470
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,300
I'm My TV

471
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,580
So watch me

472
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,520
Break me my lithium

473
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,020
Break me my lithium

474
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,460
My TV is watching me

475
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,800
My TV is watching me

476
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,940
My TV is watching me

477
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
Take your eyes off of me man

478
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Take your eyes off of me

479
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,220
Thank you for listening to this inaugural broadcast

481
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,300
This is Captain Vroom

Commander and DJ-in-Chief

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,180
Please forgive any minor mistakes

486
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,180
or technical difficulties

487
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,320
and glitches that may be encountered

488
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,400
during this very first broadcast

489
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,480
Our crack team of technical wizards

490
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,540
are still in the process

491
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,640
of fine-tuning the St. Elmo's

492
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,440
high-powered equipment

493
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,780
to bring you the optimum

494
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,180
in broadcasting quality

495
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,280
Similarly, once the expansive

496
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,460
broadcast studios and luxurious

497
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,980
guest orders have been fully refurbished

498
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,900
we will be expanding our repertoire

499
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,760
of entertainment and information

500
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,040
to the finest level attainable

501
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,720
including original musical programming

502
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,940
the trenchant and biting political commentary

503
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,440
of There He Is

504
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,360
and perhaps even trained chimpanzees

505
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,480
on roller skates

506
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,980
For now, we are proud to present

507
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,420
nostalgic entertainment from yesteryear

508
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,240
from the classic radio serial genre

509
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
Porgy and Mudhead

510
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,140
in High School Madness

511
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,740
Porgy

512
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,760
Tirebiter

513
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,560
He's a spy and a girl delighter

514
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Porgy

515
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,860
Firefighter

516
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,000
He's a student like you

517
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
If you're looking for a captain

518
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,880
of the ring ball team

519
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,880
You can bet he won't be there

520
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,480
You'll find him a-poppin' off

521
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,040
at Pop Sodium Shop

522
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,180
To trade in a red

523
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,900
with red hair

524
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,800
To be to a

525
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,920
Porgy

526
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,180
Tirebiter

527
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,440
Just a student like you

528
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,220
Like me?

529
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,940
Just a student like you

530
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,700
Just a student like you

531
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,260
Hey doll, come and get it

532
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,900
Your clam cakes are getting damp

533
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,400
Ten-four, Eleanor

534
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,540
Ha ha ha

535
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,480
Phew!

536
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,180
Defoliating!

537
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,940
Defoliating a victory garden

538
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,220
certainly works up an appetite

539
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,100
You sit down, father, and dig right in

540
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,300
Oh, that's right

541
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,260
This afternoon I'll be able to start digging the pit

542
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,440
If I can get some work out of that boy of yours

543
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,160
I can have the bunker finished by election day

544
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,800
Where is Porgy anyway?

545
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,900
He's up in his room

546
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,600
helping Nelson and make it to bed

547
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,600
Oh, Porgy

548
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,020
Oh, Pa, oh, Pa, oh, Pa

549
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,580
Porgy

550
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,320
Porgy Tirebiter

551
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,880
You've come

552
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,640
You're coming, mother!

553
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,020
You're coming, mother!

554
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,760
Stop calling me Fred

555
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,840
My name's Adolph

556
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,840
Oh, bombs away, Dad

557
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,940
Morning, Mom

558
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,540
Oh, hot dog!

559
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,700
Roast cakes again

560
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,020
Heavy on the 30-weight, Mom

561
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,220
Don't, don't eat with your hands, son

562
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,260
Use your entrenching tool

563
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,120
Aw, gee, Dad

564
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,480
I'm just trying to save time

565
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,660
It isn't every day a guy graduates from high school

566
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,580
How many times have I heard that before?

567
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,240
Well, you boys fight it out among yourselves

568
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,200
Okay, mother

569
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,880
Oh!

570
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,420
Oh!

571
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh!

572
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,520
Oh!

573
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,680
Oh!

574
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,280
Oh, boy

575
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,340
I've got to dress for my bridge club

576
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,860
Gee, Mom, isn't that bridge built yet?

577
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,820
No, son

578
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,980
And it won't be

579
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,660
until free hands on both sides of the big ditch

580
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,420
can press the same button at the same time

581
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,480
Okay, Dad, I give

582
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,600
Oh, boy, can I eat my breakfast now?

583
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,100
Only if you stay out of trouble, boy

584
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,300
Your shenanigans could cost me this election

585
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,620
Oh, come on, Dad

586
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,240
No Irishman can stop you

587
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,860
from getting the big dog killer this time

588
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,000
You're a natural-born man

589
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,380
You're a natural-born man

590
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,280
Don't wolf your food

591
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,360
Oh, oh, there's Mudhead

592
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,480
Congratulations, here I come

593
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,820
So long, Dad

594
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,780
Keep flying

595
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,660
Oh, that son of mine

596
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,360
He's not your son, Fred

597
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,620
Stop torturing me, Ethel

598
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,440
Come on, step on it, Mudhead

599
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,720
Oh, I'd love to, Porgy

600
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,820
But I got my two toes through the floorboard already

601
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,560
Well, okay

602
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,740
Then we could take the shortcut through Frogtown

603
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,480
All right

604
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,700
We could stop off at Pops and dig some junk

605
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,320
Some what?

606
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,000
All that Louise Wong's got a belt for you?

607
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,000


608
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,000


609
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,300
You could do Shakespeare, bro

610
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,600
Aw, not now, Mudhead

611
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,900
They need me at the last meeting of the Philatelist Club

612
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,360
I didn't know you could do that, sorry

613
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,840
Aw, creepies, Mudhead

614
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,940
Where's your school spirit?

615
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,100
That's in the rumble seat

616
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,660
You want to snort?

617
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,240
Oh, very funny

618
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,420
Gee, everybody at Moore Science High

619
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,260
has an extracurricular activity but you

620
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,380
Well, then Louise, pal

621
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,280
Only to ten, Mudhead

622
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,040
You know, that's just it

623
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,860
Just what?

624
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,600
Well, we're the leaders of tomorrow

625
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,180
Yeah, but it's today

626
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,380
Well, yeah, but what are you gonna do tomorrow

627
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,600
after we graduate?

628
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,000
Oh, well, I thought maybe we could do that

629
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,340
Go out and find a bunch of guys

630
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,000
and dress alike

631
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,820
and follow around

632
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,300
What?

633
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,240
Oh, quick, go pick up a couple of girls

634
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,100
Oh, is that all you think about

635
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,020
picking up things?

636
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,560
Golly, Mudhead

637
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,300
Don't you remember what Principal Poop

638
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,800
put down at the pep rally yesterday?

639
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,120
Principal Poop?

640
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,040
P-E-P-E-P

641
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,580
Moore

642
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,620
Pet Pills

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,800
Pet Pills

644

Pet Pills

645

Pet Pills

648

Pet Pills

Pet Pills

650

Pet Pills

Say something

660
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,400
Thank you, fellow kids

661
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,260
Quiet

662
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,580
In addressing for the assembly this morning

663
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Thank you

664
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,500
Thank you

665
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,900
I am recalling the words of the foundry

666
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,240
founder

667
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,200
of Morse Science High School

668
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Yucaipa Heap

669
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,560
who pressed the first bricks

670
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,000
with his own hands

671
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:12,900
hands. Knowledge for the people, he said. Give them a light and they'll follow it anywhere.

672
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:25,020
We think that is a fair and a wise guy for rule to be guided by. And we're not afraid of it,

673
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:33,540
are we? You bet. Raw, raw, raw. That's the spirits we have here.

674
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:42,560
Okay. So come on, kids. Line up, sign up, and reenlist today.

675
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:49,440
Because we need more schooling for more students for more science high.

676
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,800
Thank you.

677
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:02,180
So you see, Mudhead, it's like the pooper said. With counter-subversive educational

678
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,860
priorities the way they are, well, it really helps our side to reenlist.

679
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Is that what you're going to do? Oh, hell no. Right after I graduate,

680
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,520
I'm going to cut the soles off my shoes, sit in a tree, and learn to play the flute.

681
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,860
Hey, look, Mudhead. Watch it.

682
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,040
Where are you going to graduate from? Holy Mudhead, Mackerel.

683
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,000
More students.

684
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,700
Science high. It's disappeared.

685
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,180
I'm going to go to the library.

686
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,180


687
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,220
Isolation. Seclusion. Paranoia. Always looking over your shoulder to see if you're being watched.

688
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,560
And always keeping alert. Waiting for your chance to finally make contact.

689
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,540
These are the anxieties I know firsthand because I was a cultist for the ATF.

690
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,720
From actual court testimony and declassified government records comes the unusual story of Joseph Mama,

691
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,660
undercover agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

692
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:37,760
This is the real-life drummer of Agent Mama, who for nine fantastic years served America from deep within one of her most feared and notorious cults.

693
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,580
I was a cultist for the ATF.

694
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:49,300
When you pose as a cultist for the ATF, you're on guard constantly, always wondering if the church leadership suspects you.

695
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,860
You can never relax, never forget who you are and what you do.

696
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,640
You must always stay alert.

697
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,840
You never make a slip, never do or say anything wrong.

698
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,840
This is all part of my nine years as a cult member in the dreaded Church of the Subjunius.

699
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:12,180
In a moment, you will hear one of the many stories from the files of Joseph Mama, undercover agent for the ATF.

700
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,640
And now, a story based on the real-life adventures of Joseph Mama, undercover agent for the ATF.

701
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,580
When you're an undercover agent for the ATF,

702
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,740
you live the life of a spy.

703
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,600
You trust no one, tell nobody what you're really doing, not even your own family.

704
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,460
And, hanging over you every minute is the threat of exposure, of being found out.

705
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,460
You know what that can mean, so you stay on your guard.

706
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,900
But still, you can't cover everything.

707
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,520
Hello?

708
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,200
Hello?

709
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,080
Hello, Mama, this is Joe.

710
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:54,560
Son!

711
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,020
How, how are you, son?

712
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,280
I'm fine, Mama.

713
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,320
Any messages for me?

714
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,780
No, but there was a man who stopped by the house to see you earlier this evening.

715
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,940
A man?

716
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,180
What am I...

717
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,020
Yes, one of them.

718
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,700
One of those satanical...

719
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,480
You mean subgenie types, don't you?

720
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,040
Look, I have to know what he wanted.

721
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,460
He said something about a meeting at the station tonight.

722
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,660
Joe, when are you going to come to your senses and break away from this horrible outfit and...

723
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,300
Mama, Mama...

724
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,740
And move back home with the rest of us?

725
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,380
Mama, we've been through all this before.

726
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,840
But those people are crazy!

727
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,400
That man who was here?

728
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,920
His hair was wild and dirty!

729
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,060
He looked dangerous!

730
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I'm a satang, or whatever his name was.

731
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,820
I'm a satang?

732
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,120
Ivan Stang, what, was that his name?

733
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,220
Yes, that was it.

734
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:33,700
Stang.

735
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,620
Are you sure?

736
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,840
Are you sure that was his name?

737
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,760
Yes, I'm sure.

738
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,080
Joe, you're not in some kind of trouble, are you?

739
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:39,940
Trouble?

740
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,660
Of course not, Mama.

741
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,080
I gotta go now.

742
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,240
I'll be calling you later.

743
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,440
Bye.

744
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,520
Ivan Stang.

745
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,880
Mr. Big himself.

746
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,020
I didn't know what had brought him to town, let alone to my parents' place.

747
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,380
But it had me worried.

748
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,440
Stang was a self-proclaimed sacred scribe of the church.

749
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,200
He had written many of its most bizarre teachings.

750
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,900
The idea that the subgeniuses were persecuted by some sort of conspiracy.

751
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,740
The notion that church members were a master race, destined to rule normal human beings.

752
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,460
The mad dream that Bob Dobbs would one day rise from the dead to take over the world through revolution and murder.

753
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,400
These were all theories from the twisted mind of Ivan Stang.

754
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,640
Church prophet?

755
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,360
Leader?

756
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,400
An executioner, all in one.

757
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,320
I showed up at the station at 9 p.m.

758
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,940
It was a community radio station that the church had paid off to play their brainwashing radio series.

759
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,780
How Americans could actually listen to that crap made me sick.

760
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,260
But I had to play the part.

761
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,980
Three men were waiting in the conference room.

762
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,640
Dr. Howe and St. Jane are hyperplates, I knew.

763
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,300
But the third one was a silent stranger with long, stringy hair.

764
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,540
Joe, glad you could make it.

765
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,860
We've been trying to find you all evening, man.

766
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,840
Hey, Hal.

767
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,860
I'm sorry I'm late.

768
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,620
I didn't get home until early this morning, and Mom almost forgot to relay the message.

769
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,440
Oh, hey, Jane-er.

770
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,000
How's it going?

771
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,820
It was going fine until yesterday afternoon.

772
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,000
Yesterday afternoon?

773
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,540
What happened?

774
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,580
Uh, Joe, this is Reverend Stang.

775
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,860
He flew in from Dallas last night.

776
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,300
Ivan Stang?

777
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,240
The Ivan Stang?

778
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,340
Well, of course.

779
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,760
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

780
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,920
I've always wanted to.

781
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,540
I listen to your show all the time.

782
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,460
I think you're great.

783
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,620
You really get the word.

784
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:24,860
Bob?

785
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,000


786
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,000


787
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,900
Bob out to the masses.

788
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,740
You better shut up and listen carefully.

789
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,980
Brother Stang is here on important business.

790
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,520
Very important business.

791
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,580
Uh, yeah, Joe, uh, or Brother Mama.

792
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,000
We had a bit of a setback yesterday.

793
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,840
You may want to take a seat at the end of the table.

794
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,040
What's this all about?

795
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,240
Brother Mama, you said something about getting home early this morning.

796
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,660
Yeah, so?

797
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,900
Are you sure you even went home?

798
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,120
What do you mean?

799
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,840
Puzzling evidence was waiting outside your home all day in a parked car.

800
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,840
He just...

801
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,080
He just phoned and said you still hadn't shown up.

802
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,140
Hey, look, what's this all about?

803
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,440
What difference does it matter what time I got home?

804
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,000
And what's the idea of having Puzzler spying on me?

805
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,180
That's enough, Brother.

806
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,960
Just calm down.

807
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,240
There's no reason for you to get excited about a few questions.

808
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,660
Unless, of course, you've got something to hide.

809
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,780
Why all of a sudden the interrogation?

810
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,640
Everyone knows the work I've done for the church.

811
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,840
Perhaps we know only part of the work you do, Mama.

812
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,180
Janeer, I'll handle this if you don't mind.

813
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,820
Brother Mama, since I know you're working,

814
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:24,820


815
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:24,820


816
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,940
I'm wondering, let me tell you why I'm in town.

817
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,300
There seems to be a plumbing problem here.

818
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,400
We've been experiencing a few leaks of information.

819
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,340
My job is to find that leak and plug it.

820
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,640
I don't get it.

821
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,860
What does this have to do with me?

822
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,060
I'm getting to that.

823
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,960
But first, tell me what you know about Dobstown.

824
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,560
Dobstown community?

825
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,360
Why, it's a private compound.

826
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,520
The subgenius church finances to indoctrinate and brainwash new abductees.

827
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,380
Since it's across the border, the government has limited jurisdiction, of course.

828
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,460
Then again, if they knew what we did to the young women and children there,

829
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,900
they'd close us down in a heartbeat.

830
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,520
But we're careful. No messages get in or out.

831
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,620
Who knows about the stockpiling of weapons?

832
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,580
Just me, Brother Hal, and Janeer Hyperkleets.

833
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,500
And of course you.

834
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,000
We didn't want to give the government any legal grounds to cross the border.

835
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,260
But if they had found out about the stolen army weapons,

836
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,500
that would provide them with just such an excuse.

837
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,360
Exactly. Only four of us knew.

838
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,800
And yet, all four of us have understood

839
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,040
and questioned loyalty to Bob's church.

840
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,900
I don't get it, Stang. What are you driving at?

841
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,540
Just this. At 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon,

842
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,340
Dobstown was raided by the ATF and all our weapons confiscated.

843
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,060
Now they're holding members who they claim want sanctuary from the church.

844
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,600
Before you know it, civil suits will be filed,

845
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,680
and who knows what other problems will arise as a result of this raid.

846
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,760
All because someone got information about our stolen weapons.

847
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,600
I was caught off guard. I hadn't heard about the raid.

848
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,160
I needed time to think. The three of them sat there, watching for my reaction.

849
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,520
The heat was on. I could feel it.

850
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,100
Of all the lousy luck, how did they find out?

851
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,640
We were hoping you might know, Brother.

852
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,000
I sure wish I did. I don't see what could have possibly gone wrong.

853
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,320
It would almost seem as if the ATF had been tipped off about it.

854
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,100
Tipped off? No one knew about the weapons except the four of us.

855
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,100
Tipped off by whom?

856
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,920
Tipped off by you, you dirty rotten rat.

857
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,580
Now wait a minute, Janeer.

858
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,160
Mama, the evidence at the moment seems to bear him out.

859
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,500
Evidence? What evidence?

860
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,300
Puzzling evidence. And the process of elimination.

861
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,700
It seems highly unlikely that Janeer Hyperclete or Brother Howell would be traitors.

862
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,060
They've been in the church for years, almost as long as I.

863
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,080
Well fine, but why pick me?

864
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,220
You're the only other person that knew anything about the guns,

865
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,720
and that's the excuse they used for the raid.

866
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,380
So I'm elected, eh? Is that it?

867
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,720
I'm afraid so.

868
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,580
So unless we get different information from those still under arrest,

869
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,060
meanwhile, you'll check in at the Bandito Hotel with puzzling evidence.

870
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,200
He'll stay with you until we get all the information necessary to make our decision.

871
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,700
Stay with me? You mean guarding me, that's what you mean, isn't it?

872
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Yeah, you could call it that. Puzzling evidence will be guarding you.

873
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,140
Puzzler and I checked in at the Bandito Hotel about an hour later.

874
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,500
I was on the spot and I knew it.

875
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,220
But I did have one advantage.

876
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,740
I knew Stang and the others were only guessing.

877
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,520
They had no real proof of my connection with the Bureau.

878
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,500
If I could manage to slip a red herring, some other fall guy...

879
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,460
A plan began to shape.

880
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,300
Somehow I had to contact the ATF, and fast.

881
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,780
I got my chance when Puzzler took one of his all too rare showers.

882
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,760
I waited until he had the water running, then I eased the phone off the hook very gently and dialed the Bureau number.

883
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,820
If someone answers, then a speeding season.

884
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,980
If a fighter has not repaired something yet hemos diez Father's Instituto,

885
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,520
then nobody overseas knows again about gun tyranny being learnt.

886
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,760
Anim кнопona bipona bopona.

887
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,240
Aparat venom tonight, so-

888
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,200
Hey, sorry for making you wait!

889
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:11,920
We've got aPC.

890
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,860
We need to take a look at some of the available reporting sources.

891
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,080
So?

892
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,220
Hey.

893
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:15,780
What?

894
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:21,680
hotel room 417. Look, I need to make contact tonight. Okay, where? Downstairs in the Bandito

895
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,680
Grill in about an hour. Puzzling evidence will be covering me. It'll have to be smooth.

896
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,920
Check. Bandito Grill in one hour. We'll get to you. Be careful now.

897
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,060
Hey, Puzzler, what's the three-letter word for a disease-carrying rodent that resembles a large

898
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:44,540
mouse? Hey, how should I know? Three letters resembling a large dirty rodent. Hey, maybe it's

899
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:52,040
the ATF. Yeah, good guess. But the first letter is an R. Oh, gee, I don't know. I hate those things.

900
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,060
I hate puzzles. Look, you don't really think I work for the lousy ATF, do you? It ain't up to me,

901
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:03,580
Joe. All I'm doing is making sure you stick around until they make up their minds. After that, well,

902
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,900
I do what they tell me to. Well, I'll find out tomorrow. How about something to eat? You got

903
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,540
sandwiches or something? The grill's open downstairs. We can get something good there.

904
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,240
Who's buying? I'll buy.

905
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:20,080
Well, as long as it's still in the hotel, I don't see why not. Wait a second. 37 horizontal.

906
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:26,860
Slang term for a gullible person who is easily fooled. Four, five, six letters. Forget it, Joe.

907
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:34,660
I don't know nothing about that stuff. Oh, wait, I got it. S-U-C-K-E-R. Sucker. Okay, Puzzler, let's go.

908
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,980
The crossword puzzle was only a blind. I'd folded a piece of notepaper underneath it.

909
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,160
Along with working the puzzle, I scribbled some quick instructions,

910
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,880
passed along to the bureau, if they were able to make contact. It was all up to them.

911
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,200
It was a late supper crowd, and the grill was about half full when we walked in.

912
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,440
I took a booth in the corner and ordered some food. I looked around, trying to spot my contact.

913
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:07,080
No luck. Several minutes passed. Then some blonde number with a dress so tight it looked painted on

914
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,340
decided we were available. Hiya, boys. Mind if a lady sits down? Why, sure, baby. Just slide right

915
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,100
in beside me.

916
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,880
Nah, you're too anxious. I'm gonna sit over here by Mr. Woman Hater.

917
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,560
Where do you get the Woman Hater idea?

918
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,940
How'd you act like it? You're unfriendly. You know, you remind me of a fella I saw in the elevator.

919
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:31,560
He thought he was so cool, but all the time he was X, Y, Z. You know, his zipper needed examining.

920
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,540
Oh, I see.

921
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,300
Hey, the music stopped. Anybody got some spare change?

922
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,480
Why, sure, baby. What you wanna hear?

923
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,340
Play some Devo. I'm crazy about Devo.

924
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,440
Sure thing, darling.

925
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,580
Okay, honey, it's Agent X, Y, Z. Are you from...

926
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,720
Sally Bean, Washington office. I just got transferred here. What's up?

927
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,080
Plenty. They've got this goon on me until they decide whether or not I work for the Bureau.

928
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,860
Hold still. I'm slipping a paper into your pocket.

929
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,780
Got it. He'll be back in a second.

930
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:05,840
Most of the instructions are on the papers. Tell them to use Agent Jackson for the frame-up. My guard will recognize him.

931
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,520
Jackson for the frame-up. Check.

932
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,420
If they stick the coffee shop from 7 o'clock on, they should intercept Jayner. The meeting isn't till 8.

933
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,520
Right. And you?

934
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:14,840
Good luck.

935
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,380
Well, well, well. Joe Mama.

936
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,140
Uh, Jayner?

937
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,320
Where's Puzzler? And who's this chick you're with?

938
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,600
She ain't with him. She's with me. What are you doing here?

939
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,980
I live upstairs, you blockhead.

940
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,160
Oh, yeah, I forgot. This is your hotel.

941
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,240
Where were you just now?

942
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,600
Feeding the jukebox. What's eating you?

943
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
Get rid of the broad.

944
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:40,700
Now, hold on. What's coming off here? Hey, I bet you're a cop. A plainclothesman.

945
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,300
I said beat it.

946
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,980
Oh, why, sure. Sure, officer.

947
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,700
I don't know these guys. I've never seen them before in my life.

948
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,180
You didn't have to do that, Jayner. We was just having some fun.

949
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,500
You were given an assignment. Now get up to your room and stay there. Both of you.

950
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,360
Yeah, but...

951
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:06,000
Come on, Puzzler. He's frothing at the mouth already. He probably has some date of his own to meet down here. I wonder what the poor guy looks like.

952
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm gonna see you go down, Mama. You and that smart aleck mouth of yours.

953
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,180
Sounds to me like you've got a personal axe to grind.

954
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:18,400
I always thought the church came first. I wonder if you're as dedicated as you pretend.

955
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,160
Why, you, I oughta...

956
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,200
Give my love to what's-his-face. Toodle-oo.

957
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:32,920
Jayner was a rabid hate-monger. He carried a sullen, sadistic hatred towards the entire world. Even the other cult members detested him.

958
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:39,360
That's what I was counting on, because I had picked Saint Jayner Hypercleans as my fall guy.

959
00:41:48,360 --> 00:42:13,160
But that theory could be new before I triedpieces such as these came into existence.

960
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


961
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


962
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


963
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


964
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,160


965
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,400
Bob.

966
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:13,620
Bob.

967
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,500
Bob.

968
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,940
Bob.

969
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,840
You keep saying Bob.

970
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,280
Bob.

971
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,620
Bob.

972
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,000
Bob.

973
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,320
Bob.

974
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,580
Bob.

975
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,180
Thank you, Lemur.

976
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,140
And now, a word about I Was a Cultist for the ATF.

977
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,680
Part two is coming up.

978
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:45,160
It was produced at the huge X-Day drill of 1998 by the great Papa Joe Mama,

979
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,540
recorded in a large tent around noon on July 5th,

980
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:57,240
mere hours after the insane events of 7 a.m. July 5th, 1998, so-called,

981
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:03,460
when the world failed to end and I, Reverend Stang, was mocked and dunked and so forth.

982
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,880
I'd also gone without sleep the night before,

983
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,200
and you can hear the hoarseness and maybe,

984
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
leave some exhaustion,

985
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,680
and Papa Joe also had an exciting morning that day.

986
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,740
Some subgenius old-timers play themselves in the script,

987
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,100
but not all of them are present.

988
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,940
So, for instance, Puzzling Evidence is played by Potter Nostril,

989
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,040
and Janer Hypercleets plays himself,

990
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:32,600
and this was, in fact, the very last time that Janer performed under subgenius auspices

991
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,160
before pursuing his illustrious solo career as Mr.

992
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,020
T.V.

993
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,620
And now, back to the second act of our story based on the real life adventures of Joseph Mama,

994
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,040
undercover agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

995
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,960
I was a cultist for the ATF!

996
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,000
Janer followed us to the elevator to make sure we returned to our room.

997
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,740
What he did after that? Well, I can only guess.

998
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,700
Puzzler and I turned in. I lay there for a while thinking, as I had done many times before.

999
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,660
This cult wasn't just operating in South Africa.

1000
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:14,220
America or Europe. It was here in the USA in my own country. I had grown up and never even heard

1001
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:19,720
of the Church of the Subgenius until I worked for the ATF. Now it was all I heard about. Child

1002
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,240
abductions, mind control, drugs, armed shipments, revolutionary plots, the whole rotten mess.

1003
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:31,260
It was all here in my own backyard. Most of the world knows nothing of the Subgenius Church.

1004
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,020
Those who do think it's some kind of joke or religious satire. Well, the only ones who are

1005
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,160
laughing are the subgeniuses themselves. While the rest of society sleeps, the church busily goes

1006
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,880
about laying the groundwork for their bloody takeover. The so-called X-Day, where every non-cult

1007
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,180
member is eliminated in a general massacre. The only thing between the subgenius and their sick

1008
00:44:53,180 --> 00:45:00,460
goal was me and the ATF. It was just before daybreak when the knock came at our door.

1009
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,200
What's that? Who's there? You better answer it and find out. Who could it be at this hour?

1010
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:14,520
Good morning. Glad to see you're up. Brother Stang. Joe Mama, have a seat over there by the window.

1011
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:19,000
We have some talking to do. Puzzling evidence? You can go back to bed. This doesn't concern you.

1012
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:27,920
Sure. Whatever you say. Let us review the facts of this matter again. Now? This time in the morning?

1013
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,240
There's nothing as truthful as a drowsy witness. We've proved that often enough at the Subgenius

1014
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,880
Foundation. Suppose we turn the lamp just...

1015
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:42,060
But it's in my eyes. Exactly. Just another little technique of the Foundation.

1016
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:48,220
We've just lost a very important tool in our fight against the conspiracy. We seem to have

1017
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:53,940
a traitor in our midst. I'm sure you're eager to help assist us discover that traitor so

1018
00:45:53,940 --> 00:46:00,680
we can carry out the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs. So lean back, Joe. Relax. Look into the light.

1019
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,040
There's nothing to worry about, is there?

1020
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,000
The questioning went on.

1021
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:12,760
on and on. Stang was clever, very clever. He reworded phrases and used trick questions.

1022
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,100
But when he finally turned off the light and left, I felt fairly certain I hadn't given

1023
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:22,780
anything away. Not that I was any closer to being in the clear. That would depend on what

1024
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,000
happened outside the coffee shop between seven and eight in the evening.

1025
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,320
Well, it's a quarter past seven. I guess we've got plenty of time to eat and still make the

1026
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,380
meeting by eight o'clock.

1027
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,040
Yeah, plenty of time. How's the crackers?

1028
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,560
It don't matter. I'm so hungry I could eat a three-pound steak.

1029
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,020
Careful now, that would be normal food.

1030
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,660
Yeah? Wait till we take over and see what we feed then.

1031
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,840
No share-in-share like, brother?

1032
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:52,140
Not for those corporate yuppies. We'll be the big shots then. All us guys who've done

1033
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:52,840
the dirty work.

1034
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,000
What about the redistribution of the wealth? The slack for the common man?

1035
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:02,420
Ah, phooey. That's dogma for the dupes and you know it. We'll be the guys with the limos

1036
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,800
and harems. Anyone who don't like it will be.

1037
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,120
Bang! Zoom. Off the planet.

1038
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,900
You know something, Puzzler? You and I think exactly alike.

1039
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:17,120
I kept talking to Puzzler as we ate our meal, but all the while I kept my eye out for Jayner.

1040
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:21,060
I knew his habits. He always left early for the eight o'clock meeting, but when seven

1041
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:27,180
thirty came, there was still no sign of him. I began to sweat. Finally, I spotted him leaving

1042
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,020
the hotel and crossing the street right in front of our window.

1043
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,020
Look! There's Jayner leaving for the meeting. We better get going.

1044
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,020


1045
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,020


1046
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,020


1047
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,020


1048
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,040
Jayner? Oh yeah, there he is. Looks like he's running to a friend.

1049
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:46,000
Yeah, I've seen that guy before too. Can't remember where, but he obviously knows Jayner.

1050
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,520
Well, maybe not. Looks like he's just getting a match.

1051
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,640
That fellow's doing a lot of talking though.

1052
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,280
Probably another fellow that lives in the... No, wait. Now I remember. That's the guy who

1053
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,220
picked me up once on a handgun violation. He works for the ATF.

1054
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,000
What, him? Oh, you must be mistaken, Puzzler. He's a friend.

1055
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1056
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1057
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1058
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1059
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1060
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1061
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1062
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1063
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1064
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000


1065
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,860
A friend of Jayner's. Look, he's shaking hands with him and pounding him on the back.

1066
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,360
I ain't mistaking. His name's Jackson and he's ATF. How come he's so friendly with Jayner?

1067
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,580
I don't know, but I'm beginning to wonder. Why? What's to wonder about? Jayner's the

1068
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,880
guy they're looking for. He's the stool pigeon.

1069
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:28,700
Oh, there must be some other explanation. That match business is just a cover up. I

1070
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,240
bet he handed a report or something to Jackson right then.

1071
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:34,540
Or took something from him. That's it. A payoff.

1072
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,600
First stooling on Dobbs Town. Look, Joe, you saw it too. I ain't imagining it. You'll

1073
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,960
back me up, won't you? All right, if you insist I will.

1074
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,940
It was eight o'clock when we showed up at the deserted warehouse. Stang, Hal, and Jayner

1075
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:58,840
were already there waiting. We went inside. You're late, Mama. What's the matter? Afraid

1076
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,700
to face the music? I've got nothing to hide. Like I told Stang

1077
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,500
at this morning's, uh, discussion.

1078
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:04,980
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1079
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:05,740
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't want to be timid now.

1080
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:05,740


1081
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:05,740


1082
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,620
Well, have you come to a verdict? Joe, our lawyer got in to talk to some of

1083
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:15,720
the prisoners from Dobbs Town. They say they followed procedure completely. There was

1084
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,300
no way any information could have leaked out of that compound. They figure it was a tip

1085
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,080
off. A tip off from the outside. Then we're right back from where we started,

1086
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,460
nowhere. Nowhere? You're the only one it could have

1087
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:34,840
been. What more evidence do we need? You call me? Stay out of this evidence. So I get selected,

1088
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,640
nothing more than a wild guess.

1089
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,520
All the work I've done for Bob,

1090
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,800
the speeches, the publicity,

1091
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,060
the under-the-table stuff,

1092
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,600
all that doesn't mean a thing.

1093
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,420
It's a matter of security

1094
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,320
for the good of the cause itself.

1095
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,460
Don't you agree with that principle, brother?

1096
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,240
Why, of course I agree with it, but...

1097
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,600
Hold on a second.

1098
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,160
I've got a question here of my own I want to ask.

1099
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,520
You're only here on assignment.

1100
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,720
Nobody's interested in hearing your stupid little question.

1101
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,820
Oh, I think they might if they heard it.

1102
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,300
Yeah, we can deal with you after we've dealt with the traitor.

1103
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,500
But I'm not the traitor, I tell you.

1104
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,100
I'm...

1105
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,640
Jayner, who was that guy you met outside the hotel

1106
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,540
a few minutes ago?

1107
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,400
The guy you were so friendly with?

1108
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,020
I don't know and I don't care.

1109
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,420
This is more important.

1110
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,260
Jayner's right.

1111
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,460
This is hardly the time or the place to...

1112
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,640
The guy's name is Jackson.

1113
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,100
He works for the ATF.

1114
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,840
The guy who wanted the match?

1115
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,760
Yeah, the guy you talked to.

1116
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,960
Never seen the guy before in my life.

1117
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,580
Then why'd he shake your hand?

1118
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,860
How should I know?

1119
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,580
I just bumped into him.

1120
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,620
When he bumped into me, he arrested me.

1121
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,440
But when he bumps into you, he pats you on the back.

1122
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,880
I'd like to think there's another explanation, Jayner.

1123
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,860
But you gotta admit, it looks a little fishy.

1124
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,620
He commented on the weather.

1125
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,340
Small talk.

1126
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,240
Nothing more.

1127
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,700
He gave you something, too.

1128
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,420
What was it?

1129
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,020
Nothing.

1130
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:49,820
That's a lie.

1131
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,520
Search me if you want to.

1132
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,400
I think that's a good suggestion under the circumstances,

1133
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,100
if you don't mind.

1134
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,600
Go ahead, check me.

1135
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,620
Because they're lying.

1136
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,840
Both of them.

1137
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,760
I only know what I saw, Jayner.

1138
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,680
I didn't think twice.

1139
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,940
I didn't think twice about it until Puzzler recognized the man from ATF.

1140
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,900
Come to think of it, it was Jayner who accused Joe from the very beginning.

1141
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,840
Almost like he had it in for him.

1142
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,800
Of course he did.

1143
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,680
He was trying to cover up his own game.

1144
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,640
This is ridiculous.

1145
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,320
Everyone knows that...

1146
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,940
Quiet, Jayner.

1147
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,320
What's this in your coat pocket?

1148
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,040
An envelope?

1149
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,480
That's not mine.

1150
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,120
I never put it there.

1151
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,420
Of course you didn't.

1152
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,620
The tooth fairy did.

1153
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,620
Bet you know what's inside it, too.

1154
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,420
It's money.

1155
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,980
All hundred dollar bills.

1156
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,800
Got something going on here.

1157
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,040
You got it on the side, Jayner?

1158
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,160
It's a frame-up.

1159
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,660
Somebody planted it on me.

1160
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,060
We've got to get to the bottom of this and find out who's...

1161
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:39,920
Silence, Jayner.

1162
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:40,680
That's an order.

1163
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,060
We've listened to your advice enough already.

1164
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,040
Brother Mama, it seems we owe you an apology.

1165
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,120
Not at all, Brother Stang.

1166
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,860
I'm just glad I found out the truth.

1167
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,620
I'm happy I can go on devoting my life to Bob and the Church of the Subgenius.

1168
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,420
Thanks for the movie, Joe.

1169
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,080
I'm glad you're not sore at me

1170
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,580
for not taking your side earlier.

1171
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,900
Not at all, Puzzler.

1172
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,300
You were only doing your duty, just as we all should.

1173
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,020
I'll make it up to you, honest.

1174
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,200
Hey, why not let me treat you to dinner?

1175
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,220
I owe you one.

1176
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,000
And the grill's just across the street.

1177
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,640
It looks like it's still open.

1178
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,940
No, thanks, Puzzler.

1179
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,320
Think I'll grab a taxi and get back home.

1180
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,720
Maybe next time, then.

1181
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,760
I wonder what they'll do to Jayner.

1182
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,240
Oh, excommunicate him, probably.

1183
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,800
Beat him up and run him out of town, perhaps.

1184
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,700
I wish they'd let me do the pounding.

1185
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,900
The way he always called me Dumbo.

1186
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,100
And all the time he was working for the ATF.

1187
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,780
You just never know, Puzzler.

1188
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,140
You just never know.

1189
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,000
Joe, it's a body.

1190
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,920
Yeah, let's get out of here before the cops come.

1191
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,040
Pardon us, please.

1192
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,060
Excuse us. We gotta get through.

1193
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,400
Joe, that was Jayner.

1194
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,100
It was Jayner.

1195
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,560
He couldn't take it.

1196
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,840
He couldn't face the disgrace of being kicked out of the church.

1197
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,160
He took his own life.

1198
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,620
Maybe. But then again...

1199
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:09,340
I didn't know if Jayner had tripped or jumped or whatever else out that window.

1200
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,240
I still don't know for sure.

1201
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:16,320
But I do know that staying left town that same evening, as Dr.

1202
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,620
Howell put it, his work here was finished.

1203
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,140
I left Puzzler and walked along the street alone.

1204
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,460
I felt sick.

1205
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,020
Maybe Jayner deserved what happened to him,

1206
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,540
but I never planned on putting him in that kind of spot.

1207
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,020
I tried to push it all out of my mind.

1208
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,760
An undercover agent can't afford feelings any more than he can afford friends or family.

1209
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,660
My one main objective was still safe.

1210
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,040
I was on the job.

1211
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,660
Still a cultist for the ATF.

1212
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,600
I walked home alone.

1213
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,000
In a moment, Agent Mama will return with some closing comments about cults.

1214
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,480
This is Agent Mama.

1215
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,960
Many of these stories are based on actual events that occurred

1216
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,200
during my nine heart-stopping years as a cult member for the ATF.

1217
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,940
Although the names and places have been changed to protect the innocent,

1218
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,580
all events did take place as depicted within the continental USA.

1219
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,060
Our country, America, must be kept strong,

1220
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,900
must be kept free of the pestilence of unwanted cults.

1221
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:26,160
We, who love this country, must constantly be on the guard against these traitors.

1222
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,860
The Founding Fathers never envisioned the use of mind control techniques

1223
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,800
or brain-altering drugs used by today's sinister cults.

1224
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,500
That's why we, the ATF, must assume extra-constitutional powers

1225
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,240
to eradicate these weeds from America's sacred soil.

1226
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,720
Join us each and every week as we continue our crusade.

1227
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:55,520
This week's program is dedicated to real-life hero, Boston City Councilman Ken Reeves,

1228
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:59,540
who, after hearing an anonymous phone tip, activated local police authorities

1229
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,180
and banned the subgenius cult from recruiting in his fair city.

1230
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,100
The ATF salutes Ken Reeves and other real Americans for protecting our communities.

1231
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,680
Featured in tonight's story were Joseph Mama as Agent Mama,

1232
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,460
Ivan Stang as Reverend Stang, and Jayner Hyperkleets as Jayner.

1233
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,960
Tonight's cast also included Craig Mitchell as Puzzling Evidence,

1234
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:23,340
Nikki Michaud as Mama's Mother, Jeff Howe as Dr. Howe,

1235
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,840
Wayne Aiken as Agent Jackson, and Willie Gordon as Agent Sally Dean.

1236
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,520
Your announcer is Gary Allen.

1237
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,540
And this is the Blue Network.

1238
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,520
If you want to take it easy and you want to take a hike,

1239
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,000
then you'll get a Regal Pale and you'll always know you're right.

1240
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,600
It's the life and better, better together.

1241
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,260
Mellow, mellow brew, Regal Pale.

1242
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:40,880
Never afraid.

1243
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,740
It's the better, better brew for you and you and you and you.

1244
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,720
It's the better, better brew for you.

1245
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,760
Be a good member of the crew.

1246
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,600
You're doing great.

1247
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,240
Based on a reading of that book,

1248
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:17,240


1249
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:17,240


1250
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:17,240


1251
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:17,240


1252
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:17,240


1253
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:17,260
come find out who thestars star.

1254
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:17,520
We'll cut out a finished length and we'll shout theinson out of Arkansas go

1255
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:17,580
state is very sorry thatistance is over.

1256
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:17,580


1257
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,340
The amino acids.

1258
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:45,780
It's.

1259
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,560
Dear parent.

1260
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:56,520
This is.

1261
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,720
According to USA Today, I'm more alarmed than ever about the quality of our children.

1262
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,600
They're at an all-time low.

1263
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,400
For example, here at Arizona State University, science and math are dead last.

1264
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,160
According to USA Today, I'm literally staggering throughout America.

1265
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,020
The good news is, it just keeps getting worse.

1266
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,160
It just keeps getting worse.

1267
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,320
It just keeps getting worse.

1268
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,400
It just keeps getting worse.

1269
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,420
Oh, bad, bad, bad.

1270
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,360
And there's so.

1271
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,360
Much more bad.

1272
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,960
To be had at www.subgenius.com.

1273
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:39,660
That website will tell you about the living church.

1274
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,740
If it's money you want.

1275
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,120
Well, this is where you can write to the business office.

1276
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,260
Post office box 181417.

1277
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,220
That's post office box 181417.

1278
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,240
Cleveland.

1279
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:56,820
Heights.

1280
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,160
Ohio.

1281
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,240
A 44118.

1282
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,560
And praise Bob.

1283
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,420
Oh, and now more of this.

1284
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,560
This orangutan has clothes.

1285
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,400
No one likes it.

1286
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,560
This chimp clean and well-groomed.

1287
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,120
But it's no bonobo.

1288
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,340
But how can we prove that we can measure an.

1289
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:26,920
An animal's.

1290
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:27,540
Problems.

1291
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,040
Well, you can study these gentle red giants.

1292
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,080
But how can we know they are looking at themselves?

1293
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,620
Very few certainly do.

1294
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,200
One of the reasons they're so sociable.

1295
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,780
They do each other to play.

1296
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,140
This is monkey dolphins.

1297
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,260
Tourists are allowed to enjoy watching them.

1298
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,640
The Bahamas are the best place in the world in the wild in action.

1299
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,580
Each dolphin has its babies of their mothers.

1300
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,200
So it's no language.

1301
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,600
Which to many dolphin scientists picking the nose recognize themselves in social lives.

1302
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,720
But one slightly drains.

1303
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,420
So what?

1304
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,900
All great apes are looking after their loving tourists.

1305
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,140
It's possible to account for this.

1306
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,840
Some scientists may not be able to speak but does seem to be talking to his friends.

1307
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,320
He's been taught to reply using words.

1308
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,060
The scientists perform some odd.

1309
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,900
Tasks.

1310
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,040
Can you get the.

1311
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:28,960
Refrigerator.

1312
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,420
So these animal brains are probably the easiest to see.

1313
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,320
They look manipulating termites.

1314
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,780
Since then the males even have ties.

1315
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,240
They are fun.

1316
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,760
But our closest relative is an experience you'll forget.

1317
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:48,540
Friends.

1318
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,300
My internet friends.

1319
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,060
My beloved listener and.

1320
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,060
Close.

1321
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,120
Close personal friend.

1322
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:13,940
This is the internet only end of the show part where I remind you about the subgenius membership ministerial ordainment kit in fact whereby you can be a legal minister.

1323
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:21,420
Plus you get insights into the secrets of the church of the subgenius.

1324
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,780
And a big package of stuff.

1325
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,120
And there's.

1326
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:25,680
We also have.

1327
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,080
Of course t-shirts and decoder pens and bumper stickers and pens and.

1328
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,060
Everything you would expect.

1329
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,200
CDs for instance.

1330
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,320
Even a weekly radio show.

1331
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:37,960
You know that.

1332
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,980
Our books are the best but.

1333
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,400
Books.

1334
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,000
I think they're maybe they're just for old people.

1335
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,520
I don't know.

1336
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,040
Anyway.

1337
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,980
Some people get the impression that.

1338
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,440
If you're a real subgenius.

1339
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,100
You never send money to the.

1340
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,920
Subgenius.

1341
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:56,540
Foundation.

1342
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,100
You don't.

1343
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,360
Buy a membership.

1344
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,680
Because that proves you're really not a joiner.

1345
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,640
But that's actually wrong.

1346
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,420
I'm not sure where that came from.

1347
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,200
I think perhaps wishful thinking.

1348
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,620
But no we don't laugh at you.

1349
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,340
When you send in your 35 bucks.

1350
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:15,960
Finally.

1351
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,460
And we mail you that kit.

1352
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,460
Which is addressed by my hand.

1353
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,680
By the way.

1354
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,660
And.

1355
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,060
Yeah.

1356
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1357
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1358
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1359
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1360
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1361
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1362
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1363
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1364
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1365
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1366
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1367
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1368
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,080


1369
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,000
I actually do.

1370
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,620
Physically manhandled each package.

1371
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,160
And they also.

1372
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,440
There's a little letter in there.

1373
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,360
That's signed by me too.

1374
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:33,960
How about that.

1375
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,140
We actually care.

1376
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,240
We go to a lot of trouble.

1377
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,260
We keep track of.

1378
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,360
Who you are.

1379
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,700
At least until you move.

1380
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,140
Then we all forget about it.

1381
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:41,420
But.

1382
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,280
Yeah.

1383
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,020
Friends.

1384
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,040
Isn't it about time.

1385
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,100
Subgenius.com.

1386
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,060
Oh and we can.

1387
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,920
We'll take checks.

1388
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:50,460
You.

1389
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,480
This month.

1390
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,660
You can mail them to box 807.

1391
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,020
Glen Rose, Texas.

1392
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:55,060
And we'll see you next time.

1393
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,060


1394
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,060


1395
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,200
Whatever helps us.

1396
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:00,520
You know, we do that.

1397
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,020
I wouldn't be willing to sell глубy in the States.

1398
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:04,960
But, in in the meantime.

1399
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,760
The 물어�elas.

1400
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,900
Which every week.

1401
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,380
It's just about time.

1402
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:09,420


1403
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:09,420


1404
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,300
They didn't even.

1405
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,040
We hurry up.

1406
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:12,620
As soon as we check us.

1407
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:12,620


1408
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,540
The car just.

1409
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:14,540


1410
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,200
And that goes at them almost.

1411
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:16,200
