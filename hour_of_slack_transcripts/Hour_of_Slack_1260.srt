1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,140
From PR News in Washington, I'm in trouble.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,040
An Iranian civilian that France refused to extradite to the United States

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,000
is buying sensitive technology and illegally exporting it to Iran.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,320
He was buying electronics components through a Malaysian firm

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,540
and exporting them illegally to Paris.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,900
It is true.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,720
U.S. Envoy George Mitchell said this is PR.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,100
The Palestine Liberation Organization is supporting Israel.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,320
Israel.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,200
President Obama says small senior citizens will suffer and be compromised.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,260
But GOP critics crashed in to appear.

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,180
Authorities say seriously.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,040
There's been an explosion at a coal mine in Siberia.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,040
Russian authorities say because of a volcanic eruption in Iceland.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,960
Recovery is likely to come slowly to severely flooded parts of security secretary Janet Napolitano.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,440
The Reuters News Service is reporting possible PR news in the Gulf of Washington.

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:58,960
All right.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,260
Now, this minute, I'm going to do something that may overthrow the entire radio business.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,400
But I'm not going to say a word about laboratory tests

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,220
or quote you statistics or make medical claims.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,800
All I'm going to say simply and honestly is this.

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,120
Ladies and gentlemen, try, just try.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,840
The Sogenius Powerhouse.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,600
What?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,560
What?

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,380
What?

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,360
What?

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,240
What?

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,360
What?

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,560
What?

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,560


32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,920
What?

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


35
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


36
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


37
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


38
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


39
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


40
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


41
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


42
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


43
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


44
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


45
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


46
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


47
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


48
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,640
What?

49
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:37,000
Those other religions, they want 10 percent of your income right off the top.

50
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,200
They want you to provide for them in your will.

51
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,760
They want you to pressure your government for billion dollar contributions.

52
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,140
They want you to double your taxes so that they don't have to pay any.

53
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,760
And what does Bob ask for?

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,940
30 lousy bucks.

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
They're the ones with the extravagant cathedrals.

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,160
the lush synagogues, the giant mosques.

57
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,720
And what do we have?

58
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,580
One hour a week on non-commercial radio.

59
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,020
Now, forgive me if I go out on a limb here,

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,020
but doesn't that sound just a little lopsided?

61
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,160
Of course not.

62
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,120
It sounds a lot lopsided.

63
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,540
But we got something they don't have.

64
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,240
It's called slack.

65
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,560
Slack.

66
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,280
And I don't mean the artificial slack they try to market for a profit.

67
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,780
Hey, folks, play the lottery and win free slack.

68
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,180
Uh-uh.

69
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,660
I'm talking about real slack.

70
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,380
Internal slack.

71
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,180
Slack from within.

72
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,220
The kind that feeds on itself like a breeder reactor.

73
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,720
It radiates a warm, fuzzy glow that lights up our lives.

74
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,680
It's an inner peace they will never know.

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,120
And therein lies the basic.

76
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,520
There's a difference in our religious philosophies.

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,740
They stress pain, suffering, and sacrifice

78
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,260
because on the outside, they have everything.

79
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,760
But on the inside, they have nothing.

80
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,180
They're morally bankrupt.

81
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,000
Empty shells.

82
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,060
Just poor, pathetic souls

83
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,140
tormented by inner demons of guilt and self-loathing.

84
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,440
But we subgenie.

85
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,540
We are the exact opposite.

86
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,260
While on the outside,

87
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,620
we have so little,

88
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,940
on the inside,

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,700
we have everything.

90
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,340
And that's why we're smiling and Bob Dobbs is smirking.

91
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,260
Because we're rich with slack.

92
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,880
And for all their money,

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,780
it's not for sale.

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,320
Herein is the word of Bob.

95
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,260
Praise Bob!

96
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,700
Amen.

97
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:23,680
Transcription by Samuel Lyons

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,640
There is your vision wouldn't tell enough set.

99
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,960
Do not pick the just temperature.

100
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,480
We must try and approach in the action.

101
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,020
We throw some horrors, but can will do.

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,460
We are to assist with both of ancient.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,860
We approach.

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,620
Clarence will talk to the doctor.

105
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,560
Bloody.

106
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,820
For sit or dance.

107
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
Never be in the quiet.

108
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,780
You should all roll.

109
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,080
Friend will quickly in here.

110
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,240
You and a great in a great.

111
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,280
You are a great.

112
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,880
Miss all the experience.

113
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,400
To about which we make enough.

114
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,740
Is to remind to.

115
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,020
The.

116
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,300
The.

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,160
The.

118
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,160


119
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,160


120
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,680
The.

121
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:49,780


122
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:49,780


123
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:49,780


124
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:49,780


125
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:49,920
The.

126
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,120
The.

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,120


128
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,240
The.

129
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,140
The.

130
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:51,940
The.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000


145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,040
The.

146
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,340
Papa.

147
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,300
Joe.

148
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,000
Mama.

149
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,500
More of his stupefying work coming up.

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:34,600
The instrumental music was the waltz of the Mortgage Bankers by the Rudy Schwartz Project, Brain Abortion, of Reverend Joe Newman.

151
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:52,200
But now, from KPFA Berkeley, an enlarged clip mutilated by the large of the latest episode of the first subgenius radio show, Pungling Everdance.

152
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,480
What are you laughing at?

153
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,320
She was actually employed by Dr. Pretorius' intercession until the cosmic diffuser was not...

154
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,600
Are you going to fill out those forms, Dr. Howe?

155
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,460
I filled them out.

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,460
Here they are.

157
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,400
Description problem.

158
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,560
Microphone became soft and droopy, then liquefied and ran onto board as foul-smelling fluid.

159
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,820
Board sputtered and shot sparks, blue smoke bellowing forth, then foul stenches of a freshly opened grave.

160
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,900
Feedback and demonic laughter were heard, and headphones wriggled and writhed as if alive.

161
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,080
This is a bumpy section of track.

162
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,080
Locomotive should slow down and vent steam.

163
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,140
This is what we have to deal with here at the show.

164
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,880
Thank goodness for Dr. Howe's form-filling out ability.

165
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,580
He can fill out forms faster and better than any other subgenius radio show.

166
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,380
The genius fluttering tremors of acute paranoia and phobic reaction to Orwellian police state atmosphere.

167
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,080
Fills his own...

168
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,980
Has his own way of filling out the form.

169
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,160
Confusion and damnation.

170
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,020
I use the form simply myself.

171
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Nostalgia for unmonitored old studio.

172
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm always generating the form content during the show.

173
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Engineering comments.

174
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,200
By the time we get to the end of the show...

175
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,780
Roadbed needs upkeep along the line.

176
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,800
My form should have properly filled out.

177
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,560
Express trains must slow to take curves.

178
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:56,860
Intricate.

179
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,260
And files in their appropriate locations.

180
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,480
Before the next show begins.

181
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,080
And that was listener-sponsored radio.

182
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,200
And this is the Puzzling Evidence Show.

183
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,220
KPFA.

184
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,440
The Equipment Discrepancy Report.

185
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,700
The latest in important news and updates that you can't find on the regular radio.

186
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,320
I gotta hand it to you, Philo.

187
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,580
You brought this book, The Bobliagravon, in the Cyclopedia of Slack.

188
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,440
Pretty sharp to have a copy of this, little devil.

189
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,120
You know, that's the latest book published by the Church of the Subgenius.

190
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,120
And it's a mighty, mighty tome of forgotten wisdom and ancient knowledge.

191
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,040
It actually looks better to me than it did before, but what do I know?

192
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,700
It always looks better.

193
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,800
That's the great thing about all of the books of the Subgenius, is that they get better with time.

194
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,500
And they look better.

195
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,380
You'll want to go back and revisit them, and you'll find those words that you'll go,

196
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,720
I don't remember reading that last time.

197
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,920
Did they come here on their own?

198
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,500
Does this book actually multiply and get bigger?

199
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,720
And bigger over time?

200
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,400
Are they like certain magic books which can actually change between readings?

201
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
After all, you have to find out for yourself.

202
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,980
Some demons have the power to alter what is written about them.

203
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:27,300
Well, let's see, we're almost out of time, and more of our magical tricks and tropes will be on hand next time

204
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,460
when we bring you back through the winding, wondrous, mossy ways of the ancient revealed wisdom.

205
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:42,020
We here on the show at Puzzling Evidence Industries labor round the clock, 24 hours out of every day,

206
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,960
to bring you our beloved audience.

207
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,700
So true.

208
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,300
Our show prep never stops.

209
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,080
Listening listeners out there.

210
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,940
I'm preparing for next week's show right now.

211
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,300
Thank you.

212
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,800
The little people.

213
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,680
Billy Barty, Mickey Rooney, and all the many others out there.

214
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,080
Warwick Davis?

215
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,400
Yes, yes.

216
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,020
We are of a stature to be receptive to.

217
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,220
We are.

218
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,340
Our particular message, which we have been criticized for shooting from the hip,

219
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,460
and yet is something with absolute largeness.

220
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,740
And so I say unto you, writing, I have no tune, I'll find one.

221
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,240
Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.

222
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,900
I know everything.

223
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,440
I'm exhausted.

224
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,940
I don't know, man.

225
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,980
It's really coming to an end.

226
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm sure I have a headache.

227
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,580
Oh, my God.

228
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't take it out on the kids.

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,460
Oh, well.

230
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,700
We're all getting older and stupider by the second.

231
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,060
Oh?

232
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,340
But do not mind.

233
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,000
Just relax.

234
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,440
Thank you.

235
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,340
Ruined house, yellow dreams are blue.

236
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,260
a簣

237
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,340
it works

238
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,820
You a certain

239
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,420
fever

240
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,220
I had,

241
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,060
and had a

242
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,060


243
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,880
but I was

244
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,580
salt

245
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,880
but she said

246
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,220
déjà

247
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,420
say

248
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:12,880
you came

249
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,380
baseball

250
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,800
believe

251
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,060
you

252
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,340
can

253
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,680
catch

254
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,860
it for the truth

255
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,380
The show can't hurt us anymore.

256
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,520
And he'll always be remembered as Kennesaw Mountain Landers.

257
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,000
A fella named Joe Jackson was a fielder for the Black Sox.

258
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,400
And he always wore his black socks, but he never wore no shoes.

259
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,200
He weren't the nicest fella, and he had a couple problems.

260
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,860
Because he drank a lot, and he beat his wife, and he always acted rude.

261
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,120
He killed an ape, some babies, and he copped an attitude.

262
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,640
And the one man he hated most was Kennesaw Mountain Landers.

263
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,200
Mafia said, Shoeless Joe, you should really run this show.

264
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,340
You should be the guy who owns baseball.

265
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:11,140
All you really gotta do is help us make a buck or two.

266
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,600
We'll bet on the other team you'll lose the game,

267
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,100
but make it through.

268
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,760
We'll make it seem like nothing could be further from the truth.

269
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,400
Shoeless Joe did what they say, dropped a couple fly balls.

270
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,860
And he walked up to the pitcher, and he poked him in the eye.

271
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,700
In the seventh inning, with the Black Sox nearly beaten,

272
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,440
there was someone who was watching from his blank above the stands.

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,060
Cradling a rifle in his thick, empty hands.

274
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,900
As if you hadn't guessed yet, it was Kennesaw Mountain Landers.

275
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,100
Kennesaw said, drop that glove.

276
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,680
For I swear by God above.

277
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,920
I'll make you regret playing baseball.

278
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,080
Shoeless Joe looked up and saw.

279
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,760
Silver rifle's gaping more.

280
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,980
No one had noticed yet, his underwear was getting wet.

281
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,020
He beat himself in front of everyone.

282
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,500
Shoeless Joe was finished, but he couldn't quite admit it.

283
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,460
So he raised his middle finger up above the other four.

284
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,400
Kennesaw took careful aim and fired a single bullet.

285
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,800
And he shot that dirty finger off and dropped his trusty gun.

286
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Everybody in the stands knew he had won.

287
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:45,200
And today they still refer to him as Kennesaw Mountain Landers.

288
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,540
And so the whole story begins.

289
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,180
A brass band of exactly the same name at Notre Dame.

290
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,360
But that was in 1986 when MICH CολOMBUTE was found hanging down over the潤 Societe

291
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,360


292
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,360


293
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,040
The illnesses exteriortin Canine pinch the Hakamon.

294
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,120
There was nothing to here with.

295
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,820
The Golden Edge Uay Lag tormentor lost so he was out.

296
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,360
It was only that we really ref contribution right he never could be satisfied in thriller

297
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,900
play.

298
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,240
To have had the critics online The great Edward SD.

299
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,100
I have eight period of ga여 death, are you serious?

300
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,100


301
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,100


302
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,100


303
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,280
Yes, the critics all confused him with the great Elvis Costello

304
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,360
Jonathan Colton and the Attractions did that.

305
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,580
Kennesaw Mountain Landis is the actual title.

306
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,420
JonathanColton.com

307
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:47,700
Colton is spelled C-O-U-L-T-O-N dot com.

308
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,700
Oh, yes, dear friends, we are swiftly approaching X-Day, July 5th,

309
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:02,060
the greatest subgenius holiday, and for normal Earth humans,

310
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:08,920
the time of the judgment from space and the certain end of the world as they know it.

311
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,560
Yes.

312
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,500
In view of that impending deadline, accent on the dead,

313
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,720
we are preparing ourselves for this time of holy transition,

314
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:26,800
transition from these mundane jobs and bodies into much less mundane jobs and bodies.

315
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,100
And with this particular episode of the Hour of Slack, number 1260,

316
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:39,360
we strive to use up all the newer recordings so they get heard before the end.

317
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,880
And we'll mix them with classic older cuts that must not be forgotten

318
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:52,060
as we, the saved, rise up to our new homes aboard the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

319
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,420
Future shows, if any, my friends, will be perforce reruns,

320
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,020
probably related to previous X-Day drills,

321
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,440
so that if there continue to be radio broadcasts of any kind on the planet after July 5th,

322
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,540
they will consist entirely of...

323
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,780
paid-ups of geniuses gloating from their heavenly thrones

324
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,420
of the losers, zombies, corpses, and so forth

325
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:23,040
who stayed behind rather than pony up the tiny love offering that Bob asked for salvation.

326
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,500
Oh well, easy come, easy go.

327
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,220
Easy rise from the slime and muck through a billion years of evolution

328
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,160
to the point that we have radios and radio shows

329
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,540
and radio shows.

330
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:48,260
easy go back to the slime and devolution that will be the curse upon the unfaithful.

331
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:57,460
Those unfaithful, that is, who are unlucky enough to survive the first moments after 7 a.m. this July 5th morning.

332
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,380
Just in case the exes or Bob swing a different deal and spare the planet for yet one more year,

333
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,600
we're also readying ourselves for Starwood Festival, which paradoxically starts exactly when Ex Day ends.

334
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:22,280
But it's another clothing-optional festival in yet another clothing-optional campground, Wisteria,

335
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,880
in southern Ohio rather than western New York.

336
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:35,440
So forgive us, friends, if this is the last fresh hour of slack for a week or a millennium or two.

337
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:35,860
I do.

338
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,240
I assure you that we will play only the finest selected reruns as we leave the planet.

339
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,840
And once left, we will strive to broadcast our infinite gloatings.

340
00:17:50,760 --> 00:18:02,720
But for once, not from tar, paper, little rascals' radio stations, but from gleaming, vast ships of light.

341
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,360
Friends, we'll be here in...

342
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,860
We'll be hearing another song from the Rudy Schwartz Project called You Can Be a Republican Too.

343
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,040
You'll hear my and Onan's rant from last Ex Day drill.

344
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,340
The Varge.

345
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,460
An incredible discussion about Bob by Reverend Godrex and another mind-cracking Papa Joe Mama sermon.

346
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,680
But first, a clip from last year's Ex Day 12 Devival.

347
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,200
Lupus Pelum Mutat Momentum.

348
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Magna est veritas et prevalabit

349
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,740
Acta exteriora indicant interiora securita

350
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,900
Aequam mentore businadis avasalis

351
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,860
Fortes cadre sedere non potest

352
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,420
Fruttus non folis arborem est credits eteros

353
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,820
Quen pinitit peccasi pane est inuse

354
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,360
Do you sometimes feel your life is just

355
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,820
A ten pound sack of dog manure?

356
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,660
Does your wife throw up when you have sex?

357
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,200
Your kids are insecure because you want them to be clones

358
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,840
All these things are fine, dear friend of mine

359
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,540
There's just one little thing left to do

360
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,660
Trade your brain for Jesus Christ

361
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,480
Plastic fruit looks super nice

362
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,740
You should become a Republican too

363
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,380
Buy an extra loaf of Wonder Bread

364
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,220
A jumbo can of pork and beans

365
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,660
Stamp out smut and corn at your convenience store

366
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,380
But when you go on business trips be sure and buy a whore

367
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,860
Lock your doors up tight and only talk

368
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,640
To people who act just like you

369
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,800
Trade is for the best

370
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,540
And when decent you're a test

371
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,800
You should become a Republican too

372
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,700
The Conspiracy

373
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,560
So the conspiracy gets into everything

374
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,960
The conspiracy is of course as we know all about mind control

375
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,240
Would you mind if we nosing your business over here?

376
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,820
Would you mind if we nosing your business over there?

377
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,900
Friends, we are not here to mind you

378
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,020
We are here to re-mind you

379
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,780
We are here to undermine you

380
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,740
Mine out that old mind

381
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,740
And replace it not with mine

382
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,240
But with one much infinitely stupider than mine

383
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,820
A 2D mind

384
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,500
A button down mind

385
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,820
A veritable mined field

386
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,120
The bedotten mind of J.R. Bob Dobson!

387
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,060
That is what is going to help you make it through the work at egg world

388
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,560
This is America you can do it we can do it

389
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:42,840
Woah

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,200
Woah

391
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,240
Woah

392
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,320
Woah

393
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,500
Woah

394
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:46,740
Woah

395
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,160
Woah

396
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,540
Woah

397
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,040
Woah

398
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,200
Woah

399
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,820
Woah

400
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,740
Woah

401
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,040
Woah

402
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,160
Woah

403
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,180
Woah

404
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,200
Woah

405
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,220
Woah

406
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,620
Woah

407
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:18,820
Woah

408
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:18,820


409
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:18,820


410
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:18,820


411
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:18,900
Woah

412
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,160
Parce

413
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,260
Pic

414
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,440
C goods

415
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,440
Gaz

416
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,800
Woah

417
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:33,800


418
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:33,800


419
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:33,800


420
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,940
Every person had some flaky ideas.

421
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:44,780
Maybe somebody who seemed way over the top with their flaky ideas, seeing the light or whatever.

422
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,820
I picked what I thought was most representative of Bob's interests.

423
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,980
And how I remembered Bob's interests progressing.

424
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,460
He had a theory of...

425
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,820
Catastrophism?

426
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,500
Right.

427
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,260
That's it.

428
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:05,940
Gams.

429
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,740
His big, huge favorite love.

430
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,900
His focus at the end of his life.

431
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,880
Mandated the teaching of creationism in public school classrooms.

432
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,800
And said, well, you know, if you want to go that far, let's do the same with a flat earth.

433
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,060
And so he just changed a few words.

434
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,240
And sort of a reductio ad absurdum.

435
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,820
You can do that.

436
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,580
You can do this.

437
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,400
If he had have actually...

438
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,760
That's true.

439
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,460
Maybe farther.

440
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:40,860
I don't know.

441
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,220
We ought to believe that the sun orbits the earth.

442
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,780
Oh, yeah.

443
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,400
Oh.

444
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,700
Fascinating.

445
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,600
I didn't...

446
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,160
I...

447
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,620
I...

448
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,820
I...

449
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,740
I...

450
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:57,740


451
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:57,740


452
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:57,960
I...

453
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:57,960


454
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,280
I...

455
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,280


456
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,340
I...

457
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,340


458
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,340


459
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,340


460
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,340


461
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,340


462
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,460
I...

463
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,460


464
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,460


465
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,460


466
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,460


467
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,460


468
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,460


469
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,460


470
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,500
I...

471
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,180
I...

472
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,360
I...

473
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,620
I...

474
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:07,620


475
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,560
What makes a man?

476
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,820
Is it the power in his hands?

477
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,040
Is it his quest for glory?

478
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,260
Give it all you got to...

479
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,220
To fight to the top.

480
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,500
So we can know your story.

481
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:32,760


482
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,500
Yeah.

483
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:33,680


484
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:33,780
Yeah.

485
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:33,920
And so we have a ut彥iW hall.

486
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:33,920


487
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:33,920


488
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:33,980
So, we're a, you're content, right?

489
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:33,980


490
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:33,980


491
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,120
You are a man.

492
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,100
Man, man.

493
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,220
Man, man.

494
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,760
Man, man.

495
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,640
Man, man.

496
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,260
Man, man.

497
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,340
Man, man.

498
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,380
Man, man, man.

499
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:56,100
outs, man...

500
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,200
Don't just...

501
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,580
Live it.

502
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,100
Live it.

503
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,360
You have changed.

504
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,360


505
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,360


506
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,360


507
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,360


508
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,360


509
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,960
Life.

510
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,700
edy

511
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,860
What makes a man?

512
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,120
Is it the woman in his arms?

513
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,640
Just cause she has big titties

514
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,540
Or is it the way he fights every day?

515
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,340
No, it's probably the titties

516
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,580
Now you're a man

517
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,840
A man, man, man

518
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,700
Now you're a man, man

519
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,640
Man, man, man, man, man

520
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,940
Now you're a man

521
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,200
M-A-N, man, man, man, man, man

522
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,200
Now you're a man

523
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,720
M-A-N, man, man, man, man, man

524
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:08,820
M-A-N, man, man, man, man, man

525
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,440
Parker and Stone from their 1997 movie Orgasmo.

526
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,140
Man, I'd love to see them open for Tenacious D

527
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,700
and Spinal Tap and the Swingin' Love Corpses

528
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,480
and finally Mahogany Rush.

529
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,660
That would be my ultimate perfect dream concert.

530
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,940
But now...

531
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,060
The ultimate perfect dream subgenius sermon

532
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,700
entitled The Last Chance

533
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,400
by the great Father Papa Joe Mama.

534
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,340
The sermon tonight is entitled The Last Chance.

535
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,500
Yes, friends, 1998 is fast approaching

536
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,160
and a lot of people out there have come to expect the church

537
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,820
to start singing a different tune about the Judgment Day.

538
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,100
They say, hey, did you hear the news?

539
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,900
The Berlin Wall has fallen.

540
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,960
Things are getting better.

541
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,000
We say, is that so?

542
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,920
They say, hey...

543
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,460
Did you read the paper?

544
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,480
The Russians are now our friends.

545
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,820
Things are getting better.

546
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,100
We say, is that so?

547
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,840
They say, hey, did you see it on CNN?

548
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,600
We won the war.

549
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,860
Things are getting better.

550
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,320
Is that so?

551
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,400
And now they come a-running and a-cheerin',

552
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
saying, roll out the barrel.

553
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,040
We now have a new president.

554
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,720
The Republicans are out.

555
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,240
The recession is over.

556
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,780
It's the year of the woman.

557
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,000
Everybody get naked.

558
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,540
You poor pitiful little pigs.

559
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,400
Do you really think an eternity of sin can be erased so easily?

560
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,080
Are we now supposed to embrace the conspiracy

561
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,380
and call off the exodus invasion?

562
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,980
Do you actually believe you can diffuse an entire revolution

563
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,240
with a few scraps of conspiracy compromise?

564
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,720
Never.

565
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,300
These petty little sidelines that have a nice day news

566
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,560
don't divert our attention from the real issue,

567
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,780
not for a second.

568
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,360
Tate Line, Washington.

569
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,380
New conspiracy.

570
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,160
Conspiracy president sworn into office

571
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,620
promises new conspiracy health care plan

572
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,960
to keep worker drones healthy

573
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,800
and make more capable of serving the state.

574
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,900
More to follow.

575
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,280
Tate Line, New York.

576
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,840
U.N. meets for conspiracy roll call vote

577
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,200
of conspiracy agenda

578
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,760
for global conspiracy world domination.

579
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,600
Renegade nations refusing to conform to new world order

580
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,840
will be penalized.

581
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,760
More to follow.

582
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,460
Tate Line, planet Earth.

583
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,900
Conspiracy in last ditch effort to avert bloody overthrow.

584
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,820
Attempts to utilize all arms of conspiracy propaganda machine

585
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,820
to convince subgenius rebel rousers.

586
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,940
World is now A-OK.

587
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,720
Member for conspiracy high command states,

588
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,960
quote, conspiracy no longer hostile.

589
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,800
Conspiracy now friend of little guy.

590
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,560
End quote.

591
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,600
Well, well, well, the world is getting better.

592
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,440
We should just call off the invasion before it's too late.

593
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,260
Wrong.

594
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,560
You can fool some of the subgenies some of the time,

595
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,040
but you can't fool any of the overmen.

596
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,980
And any other time,

597
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,440
they're much too in tune to the wily ways of the wicked one.

598
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,520
I'm talking about you, Mr. Pete boy.

599
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,380
Yes, you.

600
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,460
The one with the firm handshake and the easy smile.

601
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,920
You're not tricking anyone with your bold new vision

602
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,160
or JFK idealism.

603
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,680
We in the church go by one credo.

604
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,860
Ask not what the conspiracy can do to you,

605
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,460
but what you can do to the conspiracy.

606
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,700
And come July 5th, 1998,

607
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,460
we're going to put that motto into simultaneous.

608
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,360
Global orchestration.

609
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,940
We're overthrowing the conspiracy and we're executing the ringleaders

610
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,640
along with anyone else who tries to stop us.

611
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,180
Now to some, this may seem a little extreme.

612
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,760
That's perfectly normal to the average man in the street.

613
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Witness in a public execution of a criminal may also appear extreme.

614
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,260
After all, chances are that the man is unfamiliar with the crimes of the criminal.

615
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,900
He was too busy making a living to notice what misdeeds the condemned

616
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,920
perpetrated.

617
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,680
On society before being brought to justice.

618
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,720
Add to that the criminal's emotional last words,

619
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,440
his pleas for mercy,

620
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,840
his insistence of his own innocence and his reciting of all the good deeds he ever accomplished.

621
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,920
Then imagine the prisoner's family stepping forth,

622
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,240
begging for his life and witnesses filing forward to testify to the innocence of this great man.

623
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,560
So wrongly accused.

624
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,320
It should be no surprise that even an intelligent but uninformed person would

625
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,420
feel sorry for the poor soul and wishing him a pardon.

626
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,580
If respected newspapers were produced and showed article after article supporting

627
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,720
the accused, even the most skeptical in the crowd would likely become sympathetic.

628
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,620
Why?

629
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,840
Because they would see in that individual before them,

630
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:53,060
not a criminal guilty of crimes against humanity, but themselves falsely accused

631
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,060
and condemned to death for crimes they never committed.

632
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,860
By now, the executioner should be more worried.

633
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,900
About their lives than the prisoner should his.

634
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,000
The crowd might well demand clemency and if refused,

635
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,280
storm the guards and free the prisoner by force.

636
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,160
If you were part of this intervention,

637
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:18,080
you would probably feel proud for the good deed you perform and the terrible injustice you averted.

638
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:25,520
But if a few weeks later you learn that the prisoner you saved was an insane serial killer,

639
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,020
that the witnesses that testified were all

640
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:34,000
paid actors and that the newspapers you believe were all frauds,

641
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,200
you might start to regret having been so compassionate.

642
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,680
Then by some quirk of fate, if you stumbled onto incontrovertible

643
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,720
evidence that the man you freed had devoted his life to destroying yours,

644
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,520
that his new obsession was to capture you, torture you and sell your loved ones into slavery.

645
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,840
Well, you'd probably start to feel anger.

646
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,580
Anger at yourself for being fooled.

647
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,240
Anger at the actors who tricked you and the newspapers that lied to you.

648
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,320
And anger at all the mental dweebs still running around out there claiming

649
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,400
the bastard is really reformed and just misunderstood.

650
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,720
This is how we at the church feel about the conspiracy.

651
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,640
Each and every one of us at one time or another believed the conspiracy.

652
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,820
Each and every one of us in one way or another.

653
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,480
Served the conspiracy.

654
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:38,960
And every single one of us in no uncertain terms knows that the conspiracy is out to get us.

655
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:44,200
Every day it tries to capture us, torture us and enslave our kind.

656
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,340
And every single time we get close to destroying the monster,

657
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:56,120
some well-meaning but ignorant bystander starts whining that we're being too severe, too extreme.

658
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,500
They say that

659
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,600
the conspiracy is actually innocent.

660
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,700
They say they know because they read all about it in the conspiracy newspapers or

661
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,640
saw it all explained to them on conspiracy TV.

662
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,620
They insist that our allegations are

663
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:17,660
exaggerated, that the conspiracy is getting better and that we should just mellow out.

664
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,900
They try to tell us that we are to give the conspiracy slack.

665
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,440
Dear, dear friends.

666
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,220
These poor misguided morons may be in the dark now, just as we were before.

667
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,460
And we may have acted back then just as stupid as they're acting now.

668
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,220
But that doesn't mean we don't have the right,

669
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,800
nay the duty to destroy the conspiracy while we have the chance.

670
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:55,420
Do not be taken in by any last minute media blitz that tries to convince you that the conspiracy has

671
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,640
suddenly turned over a new leaf because it hasn't.

672
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,520
The noose is around its neck.

673
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,980
What do you expect the conspiracy to say?

674
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,460
We deserve to die.

675
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,160
Kill us.

676
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,660
No, the conspiracy will look and act nicer now than it ever has before.

677
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,060
So don't be fooled if you hesitate.

678
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,160
Even for a second, you give the conspiracy a chance to win the crowd over.

679
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,680
And if that happens, you may find yourself on trial with no more X's around to pull

680
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,480
out the knife from the firing squad.

681
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,840
There's only one X day, dear friends.

682
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,060
Don't blow it.

683
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,920
July 5th, 1998.

684
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,780
Kill the conspiracy.

685
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,580
Cut off its head and launch it through the cosmos.

686
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,780
Here into the world of operates, Bob.

687
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,760
Amen.

688
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,380
I'm out of here tonight, Bob Ben-Q, to pour their name —

689
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,520
Michael Br accident strengthens by a dime.

690
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:10,880
I'm all I ever have.

691
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,160
But what arerest countries, black and white reality?

692
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,360
That must be huge.

693
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:16,680
But I have to promise you one few things to announce.

694
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,060
I told them to ban their

695
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:24,100
sphere how theyиться end of this …

00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,440
Fuck, I got my product

743
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,600
While I was buying kiCats

744
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,440
Been looking for it

745
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:43,440


746
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,500

I'll start this day timing

Time like a rocket time

784
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,240
You need to wait a while

785
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,420
Break out the Casio

786
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,220
Get your butt up, get your cop drop

787
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,680

When you have finished recording

You may hang up or press 1

00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,300
For more options

798
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,740
To leave a callback number

799
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,620
Press 5

800
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,100
Hi Connie

801
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,240
This is Bob

802
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,140
I was curious about your bulk honey

803
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,560
Yes

804
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,100
Just that kind of a thing

805
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,420
We

806
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,040
Bob

807
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,240
Bob

808
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:54,720
had some encounter with someone that the untrained eye, they don't believe in that.

809
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,220
Right.

810
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,560
Guess so.

811
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:58,600
Wow.

812
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,820
I guess weird America.

813
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,180
Original Koreshanity cult, the one whose name was borrowed by the Branch Davidians.

814
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,160
Did Bob ever have any of these great mock-ups like this?

815
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,700
I would love to see like a flat earth model or one of these.

816
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,780
I'd buy one.

817
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,120
He did not.

818
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:31,000
But he would make little 3D drawings and he had little drawings of the flat earth or the earth with different shapes on it and things like that.

819
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,100
But nothing but no scale models that I'm aware of.

820
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,580
Darn, there's some money waiting to be made there.

821
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,220
New guidelines are being designed to provide standardized information and recommendations.

822
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,720
Just an academic text rolled up in their pocket on a daily basis.

823
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:53,420

824
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,180
Does this make sense?

825
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:01,000
www.inwd.inica.blogspot.com

826
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,340
Is this understandable?

827
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,220
Comments are welcome through May 6, 2010.

828
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,680
By the summer.

829
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,980
This is National Institutes of the East, G. Allerma, and as the Institute of International Net at Bethesda, Maryland.

830
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,180
Hello, my name is Curtis Anderson.

831
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,720
You have seen me as Gleepy the Hen post to Google Group Scrub Genius.

832
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,040
I want to thank everyone for reading our little slice of kook-free heaven.

833
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,600
Friends, the public service denouncement on standardized information

834
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,960
was by, of course, Lemur.

835
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,820
The discussion about Bob was edited by Godrex.

836
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,440
Pseudobob evacuated or excavated the historic phone message

837
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,720
and that collage of hardcore beats,

838
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:10,340
the intense, long, pounding musical interlude of the most intensely ratcheted hardcore samples,

839
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,820
that was assembled by the mysterious entity known as The Large.

840
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,580
The music behind it was a piece of music that was made by the famous artist,

841
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:16,700
the famous composer, Bob.

842
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:23,360
The music behind me right now is Hans Salter and B.F. Skinner from Universal Monster Movies.

843
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,180
And what you're listening to now is the Hour of Slack,

844
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,700
the radio voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

845
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,740
Well, one of them, anyway.

846
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:38,620
And you can find everything about the Church of the Subgenius at subgenius.com.

847
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,700
Praise Bob.

848
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,320
Now, briefly, back to Perry Kingsley.

849
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,520
Thanks to Mr. Sister.

850
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,080
And the barnyard in orbit.

851
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,920
Church of the Subgenius.

852
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,200


853
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,200


854
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,200


855
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,200


856
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,200


857
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,960
I could tell you guys were breaking some ground while I was gone.

858
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,120
I think you broke ground.

859
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,360
I broke something, but it was worth it.

860
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,860
It was worth it.

861
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,500
This was some really great, really good news.

862
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,500


863
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,500


864
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,500


865
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,600
Really brilliant brown, brown graking.

866
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,340
It's a brown graking show.

867
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,560
I don't know what graking means, but brown, everybody knows what brown is.

868
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,320
It's a color that we all strive for in our lives.

869
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,480
We strive for the brown color, and then we, and then we grake.

870
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,080
We have brown graking.

871
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,140
We don't know what it means, but we do it anyway.

872
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,780
You mean graking?

873
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:09,620
Graking.

874
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,480
Graking.

875
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,460
And we, we are a K-I-N-G.

876
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,140
Graking.

877
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,000
We don't know what it means, but we still do it.

878
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,580
The end from Puzzling Evidence.

879
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,740
Dr. Philodrummond, Dr. Howland, The Large.

880
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:38,220
What's groundbreaking now is this poignant piece by Wilhelm Stahlhelm.

881
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:43,560
A classic called Ex Dei Memoir.

882
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,740
Here we go.

883
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,180
It's just a story now.

884
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,020
It's just a story now.

I'm going to do the list of the four.

913
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:33,360
Four.

914
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,620
Four.

915
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:37,320
Four.

916
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,680
Oh, I got the itinerary.

917
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,220
I need to check the itinerary.

918
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:43,700
Um.

919
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,520
Hang on.

920
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,460
Let's see what I got.

921
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:51,880
Next time.

922
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,620
Maybe.

923
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:57,600
Maybe.

924
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:58,820
Maybe.

925
00:53:59,540 --> 00:53:59,660
Maybe.

926
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,440
Girl.

927
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,700
Girl.

928
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:05,780
Girl.

929
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,180
Real.

930
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,920
Past year.

931
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,180
Naked.

932
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:14,500
Par замет.

933
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:16,560
Guy.

934
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:19,840
Guy.

935
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,220
Guy.

936
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:23,660
Girl.

937
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:23,740
Girl.

938
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,400
Girl.

939
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,540
Girl.

940
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,560
Guy.

941
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,240
Who are you?

942
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,480
Pastor.

943
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:34,900
Naked.

944
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,760
You're out of your kick.

945
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,300
Got it.

946
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,060
Next time.

947
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,240
Hang out in the sun.

948
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,120
Hang out in the sun.

949
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,520
Watch how I really go.

950
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,360
Pastor.

951
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,820
Naked.

952
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,520
Karate kick.

953
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,980
Got it.

954
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,380
Hang out in the sun.

955
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,840
Hang out in the sun.

956
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,480
Hang out in the sun.

957
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,340
Got it.

958
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,580
Next time.

959
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:22,920
Naked.

960
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,420
Karate kick.

961
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,840
Got it.

962
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,240
Got it.

963
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:49,780
Wilhelm Stahlhelm did that and now the song I'm Bob's Own by my own daughter at age 13,

964
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,680
Sivit Stag.

965
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,040
Sivit Stahlhelm.

966
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:08,520
On my own, pretending Bob's beside me.

967
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:15,780
In the dark, his dots and pipe, they guide me.

968
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,700
Without Bob, I smell his drop around me.

969
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,700
And when I have no slack, I touch my clown and Bob has found me.

970
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,500
Sivit Stahlhelm.

971
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:29,840
Naked.

972
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:29,840


973
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:30,860
Sivit Stahlhelm.

974
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:30,860


975
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:36,500
On my job, the noddles act like dumb shits.

976
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:43,600
Without slack, the sweat runs down my armpits.

977
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:49,560
On egg stay, I'll see the saucers coming.

978
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,040
And all I need is Bob and me forever and forever.

979
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,540
But until I do.

980
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,820
He doesn't help.

981
00:56:59,820 --> 00:56:59,840
I bet my такая.

982
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,200
I spend my thirty bucks

983
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,820
I'm just renting to myself and not to Bob

984
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,460
And although I know that I am screwed

985
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:24,360
Still I say there's a day of pain

986
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:30,880
I love Bob, but when the rupture's over

987
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:38,360
He'll be gone, the earth will be in ruins

988
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:45,400
Without him, the world around me changes

989
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,720
The conspiracy is everywhere, the malls are full of pink boys

990
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,340
I love Bob

991
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:54,340


992
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,000
I love Bob, but every day I don't spend

993
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,460
That thirty bucks, I'm only just pretending

994
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,680
Without me, Bob's world will go on burning

995
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,460
Our next debacle, half-dislected, I'll never know

996
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:23,440
I love Bob

997
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,540
I love Bob

998
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,940
I love Bob

999
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:36,280
But only on my own

1000
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:54,540
And yet

1001
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:59,660
not be sure. Sometimes these cases take strange forms. The victim becomes, in a sense, mediumistic.

1002
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:03,700
A vehicle for all the intangible forces in operation around her.

1003
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,580
Sounds like a lot of supernatural baloney to me.

1004
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:16,980
Supernatural, perhaps. Baloney, perhaps not. There are many things under the sun.

1005
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:26,200
A bonus just for subscribers, Hour of Slack home subscribers, and the internet listeners.

1006
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:35,860
This song, Fun, is by our friends at Kick Everything.

1007
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:38,000
Praise Bob.

1008
00:59:54,260 --> 01:00:00,820
Hey, stop, fuck, fuck.

1009
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:08,720
Hey, go, fuck, fuck.

1010
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:14,820
Hey, fuck, go.

1011
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,960
Hey, go, fuck, fuck.

1012
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:25,120
Hey, stop, again, I'm.

1013
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:32,620
Hey, stop, fuck, fuck.

1014
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,620
Hey, go, fuck, fuck.

1015
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:44,600
Penny, or plenty, or penny, or plenty.

1016
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,960
Penny, or plenty.

1017
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:52,460
Penny, or pretty, or plenty.

1018
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,340
Penny, or plenty.

1019
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,320
So lovely.

1020
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,320
Penny, or plenty.

1021
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,880
Penny, or plenty.

1022
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:15,900
Hey, few.

1023
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,960
Hey, few.

1024
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:16,960


1025
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:16,960


1026
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:16,960


1027
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:35,400
Fuck. Stop. Hey. Go. Fuck. Relax. Hey. Stop. Fuck. Ah.

1028
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,880
Fuck.
