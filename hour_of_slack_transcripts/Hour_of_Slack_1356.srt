Come on, how does it work?

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,780
The invisible visualizer balances the biometric forces behind most divorces,

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,020
yins the yang chain between the brain and the anus,

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,100
and double bonus, removes the onus betwixt animation and animus.

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,020
Plus, double fucked on the bus or in the crux between waxed biscuits or extra crust,

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,700
it does the thinking for you.

34
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,720
Now how much would you pay?

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,000
But wait, there's more.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,520
For a limited time only, if everybody on the planet gets their own individual invisible visualizer,

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,220
then peace and tranquility is guaranteed to rule for thousands, possibly even millions of years.

38
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,780
But until then, why not get your own and completely rule in every conceivable way

39
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,140
over your foolish friends and neighbors who will choose to bet a get one themselves

40
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,240
through this once in a lifetime TV offer, get yours today while supplies last.

41
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,720
The invisible visualizer is not recommended for actual use or misuse under any circumstances.

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,160
Thank you.

43
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,260
The healthy human mind doesn't wake up in the morning thinking this is its last day on earth.

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,580
But I think that's a luxury, not a curse.

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,900
To know you're close to the end is a kind of freedom.

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,920
Good time to take inventory.

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,860

Brothers and sisters

55
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,500
We must confront ourselves

56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,100
We know that all men and women are created good

57
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,940
We must understand why you have gone bad

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,620
You cannot play checkers with your life

59
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Jumping around like an old whirlwind

60
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,280
Wrapping your dishes and plates

61
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,160
And then unpacking them and placing them back on the shelf

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,100
This is not the way the Jehovah One has designed you to act

63
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,200
Unless you are willing to admit that you are a gnome

64
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,980
A pink boy

65
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,480
A lily

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,120
A twig

67
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,060
Only then can you decide where your path shall lead you

68
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,220
But we know inherently that we are all created good

69
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,420
By Jehovah One

70
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,420
Some of you got such bad luck sometimes in your life

71
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,620
You couldn't hang yourself with your own necktie

72
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,640
This is when you should look to Bob

73
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,180
When you look to Jehovah One and say

74
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,720
Bob, come into my life

75
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,700
And you should see one set of footprints in the sand

76
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,620
And that is when you will know

77
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,200
That Bob has charged you five dollars and not nine cents

78
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,260
And that is when you will know that Bob has charged you five dollars and not nine cents

79
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,260


80
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,780
To carry you to the nearest taxi

81
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Praise Bob and his divine ways

82
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,240
You got to know that life is like a vanishing twin

83
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,460
A baby inside of a twin

84
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,740
Inside of a woman's belly

85
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,620
That's how confusing this wiggly world can be

86
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,640
You gotta raise up above this wiggly world

87
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,480
And grab the hand of Bob

88
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,220
Praise him and all that flows from Bob

89
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,600
And the future has found Bob

90
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,400
Light your bright lights up and test me back

91
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,240
Well, welcome to the hour of slack

92
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,260
Praise Bob, Bob and Connie's rack

93
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,120
Yeah!

94
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,920
Welcome to the hour of slack

95
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,440
So friends, I want you to pray

96
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,040
I want you to pray to yourself

97
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,140
For slack

98
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:09,720
Don't be coming up to me or Jesus or somebody after the X Day Festival

99
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,780
After you've been ruptured going, well, hell

100
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,120
I gave you my thirty dollars, now where's my slack?

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,680
My friend, as long as you think slack

102
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,640
Is something that can be sold to you by anybody at all

103
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,420
You belong to the conspiracy

104
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,540
Because as long as slack can be bottled and sold

105
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,300
The conspiracy is ahead

106
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,600
But as long as it can't be bottled and sold

107
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,780
As long as they don't really know what it is

108
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,860
That they're trying to steal away from your friends

109
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,160
As long as that's true, then Bob Dobbs can't lose

110
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,800
And you know Bob can't lose

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,540
Because he's the luckiest, luckiest goddamn saver in the world

112
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,500
He may not be the smartest, sure

113
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,140
This may be a fucked up church of the subgenius

114
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,800
But Bob Dobbs, he's the luckiest

115
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,100
He's the luckiest

116
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,740
And it doesn't matter if we're neurotic and broke and poor and fucked up

117
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,840
We're still better than them

118
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,380
Why?

119
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,600
Only because of Bob

120
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,860
And because we're subgeniuses

121
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,980
We don't need any other excuse, none

122
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,000
No other explanation

123
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,860
That's what this religion is all about, friends

124
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,460
You don't need no Jesus

125
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,220
And you don't even need Bob

126
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,080
In fact, you don't need any pipe-smoking salesman or any aliens

127
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
You can't depend on him, man

128
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,980
We learned from the X-Day drills

129
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,800
Building up to this time

130
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,900
That while it's a good idea to buy your membership

131
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,620
You better also start building your own ship, my friends

132
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,880
Build your own ship or steal one

133
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,540
But in the meantime, we're all stuck together on this one

134
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,200
Rather large, rickety spaceship as it is already

135
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,440
And we're all stuck together on this one

136
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,920
We better try as best we can

137
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,980
Not to fuck it up for good

138
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,500
Because that's what the conspiracy will do

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,520
Trying to make a buck

140
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,300
You know it, I know it

141
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,360
But only we individually know what the hell we're gonna do about it

142
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,420
One thing you can't do

143
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,900
Is worry about it all the goddamn time

144
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,320
And that's why slack is so important

145
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,400
All we're doing here is giving you a pep talk, friends

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,320
Just trying to remind you

147
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,060
That what it comes down to

148
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,440
Is actually three simple things

149
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,860
Bob, slack, and the conspiracy

150
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,160
There really is a conspiracy

151
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,340
There really is slack

152
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,880
And there must be a Bob, friends

153
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,140
Or we would not be here preaching about what we have

154
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,500
So friends, there is hope

155
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,460
That's all we're trying to tell you

156
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,180
I sure am glad that I didn't kill myself that one time

157
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,160
I've had some rough times just like anybody else

158
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,300
And you know Bob said to follow the path of least resistance

159
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,280
But killing yourself is getting off the path entirely

160
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,100
So friends, if you were ever considering

161
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,340
Sure, of course, this is a totally fucked world

162
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,940
And you're lucky if you can get a few moments of pure slack

163
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,840
But the fact that you can get those clips

164
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,320
Proves that it's there for you

165
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,420
And just keep going for it, friends

166
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,900
Because just when

167
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,920
You know, Bob has a funny way of dealing with

168
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,180
Happiness and slack and stuff

169
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,020
You can work your ass off

170
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,060
Trying to get what your idea of happiness was

171
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,100
Do you think your idea of happiness

172
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,620
Is any better than Bob's idea of happiness for you?

173
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,180
So friends, you just

174
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,460
Every now and then he might fuck up your plans for happiness

175
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,100
But that might be what we call involuntary slack

176
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,560
Sometimes he forces you to stop at what you were doing

177
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,760
And at first it seems like a disaster

178
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,420
And then you realize later

179
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,560
It's the best thing that ever happened

180
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,780
That accident made you stop

181
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,080
And what the fuck you were doing

182
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,000
And made you realize what you really wanted to do

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,120
And the only way you can do that

184
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,820
Is to start doing it

185
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,660
Bob teaches magic

186
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,500
Yeah, we believe in magic

187
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,540
The first key of Bob's magic is this

188
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,140
I'm gonna give it to you free

189
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,600
Get off your ass

190
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
If you don't like what's going on

191
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,220
Move, baby, move

192
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,000
Inflate, rise

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,860
Get out of it

194
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,020
When you repent, quit your job and slack off

195
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,160
The worst thing that happens

196
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,500
Is you might get a better paying job

197
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,700
You just remember that, friends

198
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,540
And the next time the conspiracy

199
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,300
Tries to make you feel like you're some kind of a fuck-up

200
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,660
Just remember

201
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,140
Yeah, you may be

202
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,120
But you're not half as fucked up as they are

203
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,400

I find you humans quite interesting.

288
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:10,620
Even though you are a worthless, greedy lot.

289
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,160
How annoying that sound.

290
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,220
Fools. What fascinations there are on this planet.

291
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:33,060
Strange mortals with curious customs.

292
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,180
We'll have a storm now, and an earthquake if you like.

293
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,700
You must stand aside.

294
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
Out of the way.

295
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm in danger.

296
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,200
I can do no wrong.

297
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,440
For I do not know what it is.

298
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,200
Never mind them.

299
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,980
People are of no value.

300
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,020
We could make more sometimes.

301
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,020
If we need them.

302
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,120
We pick! Quit your job!

303
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,260
SWAT OFF!

304
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,920
You have been driven to the brink of insanity by the conspiracy!

305
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,320
Time to hear the pattern.

306
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
Bob, if you owe me hope!

307
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,900
You're a lot closer than you even think!

308
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,520
Bob is the way!

309
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,840
Bob is the path!

310
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,860
Believe, or die!

311
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,020
Bob is not the answer!

312
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,180
And neither is anything else!

313
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,000
Bob!

314
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,120
Screw Bob!

315
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,640
What does he know?

316
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,760
Don't believe anything Bob tells you!

317
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,520
Blasphemy!

318
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,900
He's the one who's going to get you!

319

334
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,900
He's the one who's going to get you!

335
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,360
He's the one who's going to get you!

336
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,600
Blasphemy!

337
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:11,880


338
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:11,880


339
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,620
to be resurrected and become your personal savior.

340
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,380
Bob is in the back of his limo right now,

341
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,660
getting ahead from your girlfriend.

342
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,560
Grab your favorite doll,

343
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,000
come and whack his head off.

344
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,860
Whack it!

345
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,080
And place it in the trophy cage

346
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,460
right next to the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

347
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,440
That's right, Bob is a sinner just like you.

348
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,920
The second coming of Bob will be a slaughter

349
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
with the boss from a day above.

350
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,460
I'm bleeding the fuck off.

351
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,260
Bob!

352
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,240
Kill Bob!

353
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,700
Kill Bob!

354
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,200
Kill Bob!

355
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,740
Kill Bob!

356
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,420
Kill Bob!

357
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,600
Kill Bob!

358
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,000
Kill Bob!

359
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,280


360
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,940
Kill Bob!

361
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:53,500


362
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,300
Forgive me, Bob!

363
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,920
Oh, Bob, I have sinned against you.

364
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,920
I was possessed by the anti-Bob.

365
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,080
Please forgive me!

366
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
Praise Bob!

367
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,220

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,960
Praise Bob!

371
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,480
Praise Bob!

372
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,200
Praise Bob!

373
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,200
If they would love him,

374
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,560
but to do money,

375
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,980
we would never have any problem.

376
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,660
He is the king of all kings.

377
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,960
I am the king of all kings.

378
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:39,760
And I have act,

379
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,700
my power,

380
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,900
while my pride is at stake.

381
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,460
On the 해� �uary,

382
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:43,740
I am the 자기of everyone.

383
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:43,740


384
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,140
In the same moment as a mess or chaos.

385
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,480
Don't ask my damsel,

386
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,020
or I'll get rid of the hoes.

387
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,300
Jerry still has a job

388
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,640
Newman sucks at writing.

389
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:02,500
It's what you learned earlier.

390
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,660
Think about it,

391
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,000
what I lose

392
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,060
is now.

393
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,940
tender grip, its mercies,

394
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,720
its gentle cradle, until

395
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,680
we've approached the moment

396
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,660
of wisdom, at which time

397
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,460
it turns its hand down

398
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,540
and its cold, icy stare

399
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,920
out of it. And so we know

400
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,420
that Godzilla will be back

401
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,060
again

402
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,220
to teach man a lesson.

403
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,800
Only this time

404
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,120
he will

405
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,820
come to man

406
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,620
in the form of a friendly little

407
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,760
puppy named Joy Boy.

408
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,560
We have already seen

409
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,680
these things. Dr. Panaram

410
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,240
and Dr. Patel and I have

411
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,640
spent hours and hours in mystic

412
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,680
dreaming, and this is our prediction

413
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,580
that not only will

414
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,700
the white buffalo return,

415
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,560
but the cute little puppy will be

416
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
the messiah of mankind.

417
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,340
Oh man, that's a

418
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,260
lousy prediction.

419
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,060
Thoughts that were on a level,

420
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,180
and a kind of thoughts that seem,

421
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,520
that they interpret as paranoid

422
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,380
and I think it's like a, just

423
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,860
anyone who, it's like

424
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,400
it's like

425
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,980
1984 or something.

426
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,220
It's like anyone who really

427
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,460
thinks against the, who thinks

428
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,900
in a different, they've got it set up

429
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,300
so that they interpret

430
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,560
anyone who tries to put together

431
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,300
a creative understanding of

432
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,360
the way things work in a way

433
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,060
that they, that there's too much

434
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,280
controlling, like too much

435
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,860
like, too much with free will,

436
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,520
too much like, they've got to

437
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,020
admit that you're just completely,

438
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,640
in a certain way and that's it.

439
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,240
You've got to admit, you can't really change

440
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,360
things, you've got to admit you can't really

441
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
do that much, you can't really,

442
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,240
things aren't that weird, things aren't weird,

443
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,700
things are, you know,

444
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,800
it's all set,

445
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,240
it's like 1984,

446
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,560
if you think too differently

447
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,580
they're going to label you schizophrenic

448
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,360
because they're scared of you.

449
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,060
They don't even know they're scared of you,

450
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,740
they just think, ooh,

451
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,260
you're, you know,

452
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,000
they think you're just,

453
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,560
crazy, you know, it's the,

454
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,380
it's all the system is all set up to,

455
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,060
to just suppress people.

456
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,760
It's just, my identity is screwed,

457
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,720
I have no identity.

458
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,760
It's just, my identity is like

459
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,700
at the basis of all universes,

460
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,580
it's at the, it's at the,

461
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,760
the big bang.

462
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,920
My identity is just, is atomized

463
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,080
and I'm down choosing between

464
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,120
the left and the right,

465
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,740
at the very source of everything.

466
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,660
So,

467
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,300
so I'm completely shattered.

468
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,540
So I can, you know, whatever I see,

469
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,400
I feel like I am,

470
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,060
or I'm the opposite of.

471
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,980
I'm just like an atomized creature.

472
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm just horribly,

473
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,720
just in effect,

474
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,320
in, just sort of nothing,

475
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:52,840
nobody,

476
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,700
more than I ever was before,

477
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,500
nobody.

478
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,160
Because I,

479
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,500
it's just, it's just not,

480
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,320
I was, I was connected to my inner motivations,

481
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,620
I knew what basically they were,

482
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,380
I knew, I knew what this is, that and that's this, so,

483
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,620
of course I'll follow this,

484
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,760
but if now I think,

485
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,700
this is not this,

486
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,720
this is the opposite of this,

487
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,580
or this is the opposite of that,

488
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
everything becomes totally like atomized,

489
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,660
like I don't know what is what,

490
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,680
I don't know what I am.

491
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:15,920


492
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,020
everything is just,

493
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,140
it's, it's,

494
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,480
because I'm right at the source of everything,

495
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,720
so everything, it's right, you know,

496
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
you choose at the beginning,

497
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,000
left, right,

498
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,740
at the very beginning of everything,

499
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,280
and that's where I am,

500
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,660
right at the source of everything.

501
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,820
There was a point,

502
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,280
where I, I was,

503
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,740
I was paranoid,

504
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,860
and I was kind of,

505
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,000
you know, making sure,

506
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,940
I was kind of keeping things at a distance,

507
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,540
a certain way,

508
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,240
I was paranoid,

509
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,300
and I was,

510
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
I was, you know,

511
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,900
up to that point,

512
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,200
you know, I was trying to figure out things,

513
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,100
kind of rationally,

514
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,180
and then at some point,

515
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,140
at that point,

516
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,280
I kind of put everything together,

517
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,060
and I said,

518
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,200
oh, it's all,

519
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,660
I get it,

520
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,060
it's like,

521
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,380
it's,

522
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,260
you know, it's like the,

523
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,120
everything is,

524
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,380
it's the fault,

525
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,600
these fears are false,

526
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,040
they're,

527
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,200
they're things put in,

528
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,920
they're not true,

529
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,260
you know,

530
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,260
I can just let it go,

531
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,740
naturally,

532
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,520
and not worry,

533
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,420
and not get paranoid,

534
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:08,960
just,

535
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,040
just get into things,

536
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,420
then everything is fine,

537
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:11,820
and it was,

538
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,740
then it,

539
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,780
because it just started flowing,

540
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,880
and there was energy,

541
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,220
it just,

542
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,620
energy,

543
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,860
energy was just coming out of me,

544
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,220
I was just,

545
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,540
I had super power in me,

546
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,180
and it came in,

547
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,200
and it went out,

548
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,440
and I,

549
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,640
And you control the guys

550
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,800
on the radio station,

551
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,920
you control their minds,

552
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,180
right?

553
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,400
I do,

554
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:26,760
I,

555
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,240
I projected this,

556
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,620
this,

557
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,680
this philosophy,

558
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,000
this understanding of existence,

559
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,980
this basic understanding,

560
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,440
and they picked up on it,

561
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,560
and I was like,

562
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:36,560


563
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,280
because I just,

564
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,160
because the things they were saying,

565
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,600
it was just like,

566
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:38,740
oh,

567
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,480
that's what I was thinking,

568
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,080
so I,

569
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,740
and they were like,

570
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,480
they're acting like,

571
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:41,640
oh,

572
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,980
they just got revelations,

573
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,120
and it was from me,

574
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,960
I knew it was from me,

575
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,480
Those exact same thoughts you had,

576
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:46,800
right?

577
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,120
Yes,

578
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,380
yes.

579
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,580
Oh,

580
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,460
yes,

581
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,020
dear friends,

582
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,840
and as you may have figured out by now,

583
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,880
this particular hour of Slack,

584
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,520
number 1,356,

585
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,780
was not assembled by yours truly,

586
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,980
Reverend Stang.

587
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,940
In fact,

588
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,260
it's a bit of a mystery,

589
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,260


590
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,260


591
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:16,620
a subgenius by the name of Reverend Bucky Argyle assembled all of this from very old subgenius stuff,

592
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,120
and brand new things that I've never heard before,

593
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,460
a lot of it pulled from YouTube.

594
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,580
Reverend Bucky Argyle,

595
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,840
who I think I only know from the Euro subgenius Yahoo list,

596
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,680
one of many Church of the Subgenius forums,

597
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,180
anyway,

598
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,840
the thing we just heard was somebody called Mike Wood,

599
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,180
with noise added by Bucky Argyle from some video.

600
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,820
He gave me a list of what was on it,

601
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,720
but it's kind of incomplete.

602
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,640
Before that,

603
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,680
we heard yours truly ranting,

604
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,120
I think it's X Day 99 with Einstein Secret Orchestra,

605
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,540
Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar there,

606
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:03,920
chess,

607
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,600
and keyboard.

608
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:11,940
The music in the background right now is by Lectro Girl called No Rap,

609
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,520
No Rock.

610
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,660
We heard Kings of Feedback,

611
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,960
Reverend Bill T.

612
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,940
Miller doing the song Kill Bob.

613
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,240
There was a clip from the film by Will Vinton,

614
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,460
Mysterious Stranger,

615
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,420
which is really by Mark Twain.

616
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,880
Will Vinton did a claymation Mark Twain movie long ago.

617
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,300
Before that,

618
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,480
something called GPS Math Girl from Noise.

619
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,560
The song Teen Devil Worshipper was by Idiot Flesh.

620
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,880
We heard some Vedic chanting from Ravi Shankar.

621
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,100
Me ranting again with Einstein Secret Orchestra.

622
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,360
Message to Anonymous Subgenius.

623
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,660
I can't remember the name of the guy who does that rant.

624
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,680
Before that,

625
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,100
something from YouTube.

626
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,160
Not sure what it was.

627
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,860
The Incredible Invisible Visualizer was by Bill Cates and Reverend Alex Orichio.

628
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,360
I should say Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

629
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,500
not Bill Cates.

630
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,200
Anyway,

631
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,720
I'll let this music continue and I'll give some more credits at the end of the show.

632
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,700
Praise Bob.

633
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,760
We'll listen here to Lectro Girl.

634
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,500
No rap, no rock.

635
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,460
Yeah.

636
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,200
Crank it up.

637
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,100
Haha thegenson is gonna beat us to a pulp.

638
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,100


639
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,100


640
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,740
Feelin' gave it another name going on.

641
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:27,740


642
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:27,740


643
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:27,740


644
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:27,740


645
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,040
I gottaaborugSUBLUIPO notebook record etc.

646
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,740
child生活. We gonna film a show. You know, if you follow along with that, your body may not editing. I'm just being made up. So don't no. Like what? You brush my ocher between us your hair aside mikki I'm bешzwaj Literature babysitter muha dak juz'ta miror about it maybe wallow in fact else, in the past a little bit or in Washington,ollo jaq tut

647
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,620
I had very little wrong with it.

648
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,820
But now that spirit has found an avenue of unbelief.

649
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,340
And he'll keep working at that and working at that until he gets you to kill yourself.

650
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,200
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:51,660
But now, the difference here is divine healing comes from the word through your spirit into your body.

652
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,420
Yes.

653
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,860
And that's primary.

654
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,760
But the body also has to be taken care of.

655
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:05,620
The mind, mental food that is divine, renews the mind.

656
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,820
Comes from the spirit of God in the form of revelation.

657
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:18,580
From the word of God by faith, which comes into your spirit and into your mind to renew it.

658
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,200
Yes.

659
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:26,800
But if you don't take the time to feed your mind on the word of God,

660
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,520
the revelation.

661
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,360
You can never get up there and do it.

662
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,020
It's too bad.

663
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,020
You are like flies fighting.

664
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,880
Magazines and TV programs and motion pictures.

665
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,600
Trash.

666
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,640
Let's look at the word.

667
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,620
So, Jesus.

668
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,560
It does not simply mean just below a genius.

669
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,800
Sub G intelligence level can range far, far below genius.

670
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,520
The sub genius does not pretend to super knowledge, but to self knowledge.

671
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,520
Knowledge of the under things.

672
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:19,640
The hollow earth from whose darkness issue the Nazi hell creatures and other demons of the abyss.

673
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,200
It is in contemplation of the under things.

674
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,280
The underwear lurking just below the clothing of existence that the sub G.

675
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,740
It is in contemplation of the under things. The underwear lurking just below the clothing of existence that the sub G.

676
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:41,200
It is in contemplation of the under things that the sub G there, so it can't even be recognized as hacia it is just había's

677
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:53,600
Not lion mouse, not fox believe, are rituals relate to Hari or what have you what have you,

678
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,520
Cars and time to Frank and pushed bodies, will me at knock your system.

679
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,240
Was it a matter of restarting, or you?

680
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:03,780
infinite supply of it, but the conspiracy has most of it now. They don't even know what it is,

681
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,860
but that hasn't stopped them from stealing it away. How do you think you ended up a slave to

682
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:16,680
their so-called work? True slack is by definition indefinable. It is a kind of direct perception,

683
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,100
unbettered by common sense. It is not mere laziness. It is rather a kind of active sloth.

684
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:30,420
And slack in its pure form makes happiness seem like agony by comparison. Next to slack,

685
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,200
the nirvana known to mystics and saints is like endless torment. Slack is different from

686
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,140
controversy. One might call it something for nothing. But the normals, the mediocratons,

687
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:47,560
the somnambulax, and pseudo-subslans have tried to make it something which we have been led to

688
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:53,320
believe we must work to buy. It is this yearning for slack that separates us from the normals.

689
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,900
The

690
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,080
Shackles

691
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,080


692
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,660
A human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness,

693
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,040
his hours consumed by meaningless toil, interspersed with meaningless leisure,

694
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:11,360
yet he never feels cheated. He thinks it is natural. Perhaps we should pity them, but face it,

695
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:17,740
most people are evil jerks, half-witted cattle, racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse

696
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:24,080
and stampeding you along with them. Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocrits?

697
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,280
Earthlingsü

698
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,360

littering beemin lenders

703
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Blacklessness may soon come to an end.

704
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,800
Oh, it won't happen without a bitter struggle.

705
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,520
But at least there is hope.

706
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,080
We have seen the coming of a savior, a beacon of slack,

707
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,440
a banner behind which we may all unite.

708
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,760
It is the coming of J.R. Bob Dobbs

709
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,200
and his mighty Church of the Salt Genius.

710
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,320
What the hell do you think you're doing?

711
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,700
Dragging your butt through the day,

712
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,220
selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?

713
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,680
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them?

714
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,500
Tired of getting all of the guilt but none of the sex?

715
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,780
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

716
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,480
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

717
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,840
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master

718
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,640
and his Church of the Salt Genius.

719
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,960
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal,

720
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,360
for Bob comes to justify our sins,

721
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,780
to unmask the conspiracy and to get us back.

722
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,280
The slack they stole away.

723
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,560
It's us versus them.

724
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,380
Are you going to fry in hell on earth

725
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,580
alongside the pink boys?

726
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,580
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes

727
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,240
and accept Bob into your mind?

728
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,680
Repent, quit your job, slack off, and praise Bob!

729
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,900
The Church of the Salt Genius,

730
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,340
eternal salvation, or triple your money back.

731
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,620
Okay, when a sperm and egg go together to make a baby,

732
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,700
only one sperm goes up in the egg.

733
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,960
And when they touch, there's two contact points

734
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,460
that touch before the other two.

735
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,900
And then it's carried up into the egg.

736
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,980
And when they fuse, it's like nuclear fusion,

737
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,140
except it's human fusion.

738
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,600
There's a mass loss of the proton.

739
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,980
One heat abstraction goes up in the electron,

740
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,220
spins around, comes back down into the proton

741
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,600
to form the mind, and the mind can be reduced to one atom.

742
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,820
Or you take the brew on the side on the time,

743
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
and you take the bottle right,

744
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,160
and you take the bottle right,

745
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,880
and if you take the drink,

746
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,820
and you're all able to bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee,

747
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,540
and you're all able to bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee,

748
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:48,480
and you're all able to bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee,

749
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,380
bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee,

750
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,140
bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee-

751
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,020
bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee-

752
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,460
Oh, genius.

753
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,400
Powerful.

754
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,920
Oh, dear, gods unhigh.

755
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,880
Though you push me down a thousand times,

756
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,160
I'll climb back up,

757
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,080
until I'm more than a man,

758
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,740
until I stand among you,

759
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,480
your equal.

760
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
Like in the daytime, when I'd be outside in the sun,

761
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,360
I used to show my friends things that they hadn't seen

762
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,560
before like the halo see like halo when i was 19 when i was a preacher i had my trial ceremony i

763
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,740
seen a little light on my shadow on the ground in the daytime and then now from ever since then

764
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:34,020
it's like the light coming further down on my body around my shadow and hold my body around

765
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,640
my shadow and i see the light which is your halo i mean your aura and that's why everybody can't

766
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,080
see that well if you if you see you got something to do the drugs too we say and now i don't know

767
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:52,080
what for real i know what i see but i don't know for real or not and so that's why that's why you

768
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,040
see people different and say like that anointing like see like sometimes when i come outside

769
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:03,120
um i can see uh when i look at the tree the wind started blowing but we know we got oxygen from

770
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,460
the plants and we get them carbon dioxide and so it's the wind usually blow sometimes but

771
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,280
they don't blow all the time like when i'm in the house a long time it broke real strong

772
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,220
let have slack

773
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,200
Very well, thank you.

774
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,060
Thank you.

775
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,160
Thank you.

776
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,140
What does this mean?

777
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,640
Thank you.

778
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:34,840
Goodness gracious, what a simply horrible patchwork of noise that Church of the Subgenius is.

779
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:41,660
I listen every week to gather evidence and ammunition for the citizens for normalcy.

780
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,060
Let me tell you, we're not going to get those citizens.

781
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,300
The Subgeniuses, we're going to get them right in the gonads.

782
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,660
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

783
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,420
I don't use words like that.

784
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,240
This tape, all about Satanism, drugs, and rock and roll,

785
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,640
is proof positive that this so-called church is going to send the world to heck in a handbasket.

786
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,160
All those demented Beelzebub kissing hop heads make me want to toss my Nestle's dollhouse cookies

787
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,040
with their talk of buckets of pills.

788
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,860
From that low-life pusher J.R. Bob Dobbs.

789
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,180
Where they're so high on drugs that they can't even keep any continuity in their tapes.

790
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:29,420
Too many children listen to these tapes and subscribe to the insane doctrines of the Subgenius Foundation.

791
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,620
They're led down a deceptive road to what these weirdos call slack.

792
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,920
Like that heathenist idea of nirvana.

793
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,720
I say that slack should be taken up like the excess yarn in my knitting

794
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,020
and pulled until it sees the end.

795
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,020


796
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,260
In the light of a normal day like the rest of us do.

797
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,060
So what should any decent-minded American do when faced with one of these zombies for Bob?

798
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,360
Well, first off, give them a bath in Pine Sol.

799
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,660
They usually stink to high heaven.

800
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,160
Then ship them off to the nearest normally accredited deprogrammer.

801
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,900
Well, they'll get bombarded with enough People magazines,

802
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,820
arid extra-dry deodorant, and Regis Philbin fan club material

803
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,760
so they won't be able to think anymore.

804
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,920
No way.

805
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,600
It should be.

806
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,560
Then they'll feed them real dogma about the glories of the home shopping club,

807
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,060
Wingo, Zingo, and the evils of Mandingo.

808
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:30,940
We cannot stand by while our standards and principles are made light of by these possessed fools.

809
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,480
Normals of the world unite.

810
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,060
Dr. Cinema.

811
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:37,980
Dr. Cinema.

812
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,860
Dr. Cinema.

813
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,440
Dr. Cinema.

814
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,020
Dr. Cinema.

815
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,020


816
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,400
Dr. Cinema.

817
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,680
Dr. Cinema.

818
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,800
Dr. Cinema.

819
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,980
Dr. Cinema.

820
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,320
Dr. Cinema.

821
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,140
Dr. Cinema.

822
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,760
Dr. Cinema.

823
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,320
Dr. Cinema.

824
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,840
Dr. Cinema.

825
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:20,040
I've seen hubanno overhausen und det Grafische Halde 세

826
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:38,820
I'm only interested in meraat κα 좞

827
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:32,540
tir

828
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,760
Don't relate to me.

829
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,840
I'm not going to do this.

830
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,260
I'm just going to go with it.

831
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,340
I'm going to make it the first year.

832
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,560
I'm going to give it my all.

833
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,420
I'm going to do it.

834
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,900
I'm going to do it.

835
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,060
I'm going to do it.

836
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,740
I'm going to kill if I'm on the plane.

837
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Scoop in the stairs, you'll hear the sound.

838
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,580
Then move the other train.

839
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,420
I don't need these wings to die.

840
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,380
They are partly covered there.

841
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,440
It's the clear I need first.

842
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,380
It makes me feel like I'm alive.

843
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,120
I've got an invitation.

844
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,240
I've got an invitation.

845
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,260
I've got an invitation.

846
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,440
I've got an invitation.

847
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,080
I've got an invitation.

848
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:51,760
I've got an invitation.

849
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,680
The oceans below me

850
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,560
Expanding like a fuse.

851
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,340
My vision holds purest land.

852
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,960
And brings me land to lose.

853
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,100
Away.

854
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
A fire party.

855
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,920
Soon there'll be my end.

856
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,160
I'll get through my vibrations.

857
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,980
With the music of my spirit.

858
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,080
I don't need these wings to guide me.

859
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,940
They are partly covered there.

860
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,300
It's the clear I need first.

861
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,680
It makes me feel like I'm alive.

862
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,580
I've got an invitation.

863
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,740
I've got an invitation.

864
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:38,800


865
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:38,820


866
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:38,820


867
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,820
I've got a little taste of you

868
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,500
Would you tell me a bedtime story?

869
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,080
Can you tell me what the 60s were like?

870
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,900
Was it really like an Oliver Stone movie?

871
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,680
I don't think it was a good movie.

872
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,720
I think it was a good movie.

873
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:34,400
I think it was a good movie.

874
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,980
Coming up, rerun of Laugh-In.

875
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,020
Hey, remember body painting?

876
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,840
You keep awful records in your basement real loud.

877
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,180
A cheap high five.

878
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,140
Yeah, yeah, and painting it black

879
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,160
and putting those black light posters up like,

880
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,380
like, look at this one.

881
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,340
When the light hits it,

882
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,740
you can practically see it.

883
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,700
They're twitching there.

884
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,640
Dang.

885
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

886
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,160
Wow, man.

887
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,360
Vaughn Meter dead ahead.

888
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:21,280
Boy, that brought those colors out, man.

889
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,960
Everybody on the floor, let's dance.

890
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,280
It's the 60s.

891
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,240
It's the electric baboons, man.

892
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,660
60s slang, they really swung.

893
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,940
I'll show you how to handle a hornet.

894
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,900
It's a pig, man.

895
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,140
When the pigs bust through my door,

896
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,700
then the people are gonna have to bring

897
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,200
the power to the peephole

898
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,640
and peep on those pigs out through the poop hole.

899
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,400
Oh, wait.

900
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,220
This is the sensitive part of the 60s.

901
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,980
You know, when you were coming down off the ass

902
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,780
and you thought, I love everybody.

903
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,380
See, you have to have a sensitivity treatment.

904
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,600
Wow, it was cool then.

905
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,560
Yes, all of the rock stars are now, as you say,

906
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,460
a rock star.

907
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,140
Sensitive.

908
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,280
Like me.

909
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:06,460
Yeah, sensitive.

910
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,760
Yeah, like us.

911
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:08,660
Rock on.

912
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,700
Ah, you're about as sensitive as a power shovel.

913
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,200
Wow.

914
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,200
What do you see in our country?

915
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,060
Here comes the hurdy-gurdy.

916
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:19,840
Ow!

917
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,440
Oh!

918
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,280
Oh!

919
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,840
Here comes the hurdy-gurdy.

920
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,240
Hurdy-gurdy.

921
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,560
Hurdy-gurdy.

922
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,000
Hurdy-gurdy.

923
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,220
Hurdy-gurdy.

924
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,580
Rikki-tikki-tobby.

925
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,580
Rikki-tikki-dos.

926
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,600
Rikki-tikki-gurdy.

927
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,200
So Superman.

928
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,040
Rikki-tikki-gurdy.

929
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,540
Rikki-tikki-gurdy.

930
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,620
Singing songs of the world.

931
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,440
I don't think you should have brought up the 60s.

932
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,000
It was kind of a confusing period for us all.

933
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,680
The 60s, huh?

934
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,140
I'm bringing them up now.

935
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:41,740
Murder.

936
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,260
Murder.

937
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,880
They did it.

938
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,060
The 60s.

939
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,100
Here, just write in this.

940
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,380
Write in this green tambourine.

941
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,500
Well, how was that?

942
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,000
Was that a nice story of the 60s?

943
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,180
Well, there you have it.

944
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,040
The 60s.

945
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,400
We are here in investigating a rather jolly good time control.

946
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,920
But a time machine, I say.

947
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,920
Also, Kuya's relic modification by nuclear, you know.

948
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:01,760
My goodness me.

949
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,180
You can control time?

950
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,620
You can adjust the passage.

951
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,400
Yes, I believe it.

952
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,140
It's true, Alshap.

953
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,640
You can control and adjust the passage of time, I say.

954
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,200
Well, how do you make it?

955
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,820
Well, don't worry, I say.

956
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,000
I've got one right here.

957
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,300
In fact, as you can see, a strange and mysterious artifact of sorts.

958
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,980
And I dare say, observe here.

959
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,240
We shall go outside, I say, like so.

960
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,020
And come to me.

961
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:20,880
Would you look at this, fellas?

962
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,420
Prepare your eyes, I say.

963
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,980
It is a very time-controlling machine of sorts.

964
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:25,900
Well, it's just a clock.

965
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,060
No, it's not a clock, I say.

966
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:27,440
Look, Al.

967
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,120
We shall set the clock mode to p.m. like so.

968
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,960
And then it'll join first at 12 p.m.

969
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,060
And then at 3 o'clock.

970
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,180
And then at 6 o'clock.

971
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,160
And then at 9 o'clock.

972
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:35,880
And observe, old boy.

973
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,220
My goodness.

974
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,960
The body time is changing in real time, I say.

975
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,820
Well, I can't believe it.

976
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,640
Put it to 12 in the afternoon to prove it.

977
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,160
Ah, indeed.

978
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,760
Observe here, boy.

979
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,860
I say at 12 p.m. like so.

980
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,660
And there you go, I say.

981
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,140
Bob's your jolly time machine, young boy.

982
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:47,420
It's amazing.

983
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,180
Go do this.

984
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,300
The power of controlling time in your very hands.

985
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,340
It's a spinning show.

986
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,900
And I dare say, not only that, old boy.

987
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,500
If I observe.

988
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:53,900
Ah, yes.

989
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,260
Observe the position of the sun there.

990
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:55,580
Yes.

991
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,080
You will adjust the speed of time to times two or times five, I say.

992
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,000
My goodness, it's going to be very, very quickly now.

993
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,420
Precisely.

994
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,100
It's going to be up to a month's rate.

995
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,180
And now we shall stop the whole play field together.

996
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,720
It's very well stopped, I say, good to be old boy.

997
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,320
There's nothing happening.

998
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,060
Precisely.

999
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:09,800
My goodness me.

1000
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,260
Good to be old boy.

1001
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:10,760
I say at all times.

1002
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,240
Can you do it again?

1003
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,040
You, I fairly well stopped it.

1004
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,780
You can also, yes, indeed, you can make it flow in reverse or indeed speed up.

1005
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,080
But I say observe here, friends.

1006
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,380
Yes.

1007
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:22,020
With times stopped like so, the body water doesn't flow anymore because the body time

1008
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:22,600
stopped, you know.

1009
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,320
Goodness me.

1010
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,580
When the time stopped like so, the body water stops to flow.

1011
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,740
But precisely, old boy.

1012
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,860
Also, it affects by a lot.

1013
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,060
Yes.

1014
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,040
What do you look at that?

1015
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,660
The lava's remaining stationary, old chap.

1016
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,140
It's a pure block.

1017
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,860
It's a giant breakthrough and giant time machine of thousands, I say.

1018
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:35,680
My goodness me.

1019
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,200
Goodness me.

1020
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,740
Controlling time in the very elements.

1021
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,340
You're yourself in your very hand with your time control machine.

1022
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,940
It's absolutely spiffing, old chap.

1023
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,460
I could admit that you go, chaps and chaps, with the chance of passing through time with

1024
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,900
your very own personal time machine of sorts, I say.

1025
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:48,420
Goodness me.

1026
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,740
You can just stay in bed all night forever and ever or you can get up and run around

1027
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,920
in the daytime all the time forever and ever, do you wish?

1028
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:55,860
Precisely, old boy.

1029
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,240
Well observed.

1030
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,520
Thank you, buddy, for that kind observation.

1031
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:57,920
Good to be.

1032
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,920
I say to you, my love.

1033
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,080
Now, this hasn't even a game round about the observation of a rather jolly good Sequoia's

1034
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,180
reticle time control machine modification, I say.

1035
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,300
Put it back in the chest with your safe, I say.

1036
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,720
I shall admit we will place it back in there for safekeeping, your boy.

1037
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,880
Good show, I say.

1038
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,300
Yes, you need it.

1039
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:09,520
I say.

1040
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:12,420
Why?

1041
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:12,840
What?

1042
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:13,580
What?

1043
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,340
What's going on?

1044
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,300
It's a plating platter.

1045
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:19,960
Oh, what?

1046
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,040
Ah.

1047
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:22,520
What?

1048
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:23,720
What?

1049
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:25,540
Oh.

1050
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:26,540
Oh.

1051
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:26,920
Oh.

1052
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,820
I don't know what I think I want to say about this!

1053
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,960
I don't know what I think I want to say about this!

1054
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,860
I don't know what I think I want to say about this!

1055
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,380
It's a time-dimensional space-time shift!

1056
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:44,000
Rift! You've been using that machine and it's caused a huge split in the very fabric of creation itself!

1057
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,540
It's a time dimension that's blown the whole ice to pieces!

1058
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,280
Well I can see that because the time's going in fine times as normal speeds!

1059
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,080
It's all gone wrong!

1060
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,220
But what's going on here?

1061
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,760
Well I don't know, you better get out of the picture!

1062
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,260
It's starting to raise its...

1063
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,800
It's a huge space-time dimension rupture, I say!

1064
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,320
This is... this is very thunderous but this is the process of the...

1065
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,000
Yeah! There goes the rope!

1066
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,760
I'm a warrior in this year!

1067
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,540
What will be the next stage?

1068
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,860
Oh no, I just don't know!

1069
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:17,500
Escape day and night. Merged. Night. Merged. Merged.

1070
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,900
Rewind. Replay. Memory module malfunction. Hold for evaluation.

1071
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,080
Access the memory module and rewind memory holograms

1072
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,780
to starting the...

1073
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:34,780
point six hours ago rewind commence playback to present time and recap after years of secretly

1074
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:40,040
monitoring the public we were astounded so many people would willingly publicize where they lived

1075
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,720
their religious and political views an alphabetized list of all their friends personal email addresses

1076
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,780
phone numbers hundreds of photos of themselves and even status updates about what they were

1077
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,760
doing moment to moment it is truly a dream come true for the cia it's not just the wars and the

1078
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,920
awards that win them it's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture

1079
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:11,740
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes it's not just the terminal folds of nunu

1080
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,780
it's not just the child zombies that murdered their mediocrity parents

1081
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,700
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet

1082
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,020
it's not just those starry old vex on the park benches with

1083
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:29,920
looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of belson and auschwitz

1084
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,700
it's not just the anesthesiologist for needy

1085
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:41,160
it's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you

1086
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:50,740
it's not just the dino bones for wotan it's not just the broken headlights snapped antenna and

1087
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,560
human excrement

1088
00:52:51,780 --> 00:53:00,280
on your car hood it's not just that the old ways were best it's not just the bastardization and

1089
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:07,020
perversion of every honest means of self-expression it's not just the killer ganja from the dark

1090
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:13,980
side of the bush it's not just the pinoy snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop

1091
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,160
it's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet

1092
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:27,820
it's not just mongo in the congo with fafafas the size of basketballs

1093
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,320
it's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness

1094
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:38,500
it's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland nun entity son of a

1095
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:44,860
who thinks workers are property it's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil

1096
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:51,520
it's not just the battling eco freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is

1097
00:53:51,780 --> 00:54:11,940
needed to our breath and use it to help us survive it's not just the

1098
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:20,000
living dead

1099
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,880
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

1100
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,700
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum show.

1101
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:33,880
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

1102
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,460
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

1103
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:44,580
Shot salvation and fighting Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

1104
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:49,520
No, he's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

1105
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,060
In his back pocket, just you try it.

1106
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:59,080
But, scientists have no clue where exactly the tipping point lies.

1107
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,720
They have no clue, they're smart guys.

1108
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,060
They're smart, but they don't know, because this is a situation which has never been experienced before.

1109
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:17,560
You dysfunctional, retarded, mentally ill derelict, demon scum, antichrist, spewing worthless, constipated balls of dung

1110
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,240
from your funk and waggonel.

1111
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,440
Ed para la chabolida.

1112
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,920
Hija chavalera

1113
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,660
that is

1114
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:28,660


1115
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:28,660


1116
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:28,660


1117
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:35,660
you ornncassifää

1118
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:35,820
epic

1119
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,900
Adivas fact

1120
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:52,060
of death, the giant echo of no trickling down from overpaid, overfed lackeys.

1121
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,980
The Gucci overlords and conservatives have always been black-hearted demons, and all

1122
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:02,880
WTO representatives are their mutated, half-human, retarded stepchildren.

1123
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,520
You're incontinent pond scum.

1124
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:12,180
You spineless vegetable head of dead lettuce with the mental capacity of a swatch battery,

1125
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:17,280
the cognitive skills of a pigeon, and the intelligent quotient of a dirt clod.

1126
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:22,100
A blood clot for a brain and a softened skull you can poke your finger in like a stick of

1127
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:22,740
hot butter.

1128
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:29,260
Those little rodent eyes like two shiny black BBs that never blink, gazing away into empty

1129
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,680
space, and a third eye on the side of the skull dripping ice knot, combing your hair

1130
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,480
over so as not to scare children.

1131
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,540
A dead third eye just above the right ear like a milky black protruding mole.

1132
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,160
You're incontinent.

1133
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,160


1134
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,160


1135
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,700
You black magician and puppet master, trained by Aleister Crowley and raised by feral goats.

1136
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,560
Your entire philosophy is a bunk corporate hand job, and all your heroes are evil.

1137
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,460
Ayn Rand is a walking brain hemorrhage.

1138
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,480
Rush Limbaugh is a whimpering dehumanized thug.

1139
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,660
Ronald Reagan is a diseased midget steeped in chocolate slim fast.

1140
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,220
A plastic toad.

1141
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,380
A horrible scab-infected abortion.

1142
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,240
A demonic fascist.

1143
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,140
A pathetic worm with dogmatic sermons for an entire life.

1144
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,180
An industrial cesspool.

1145
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,400
A space heater filled with human waste and cat hair.

1146
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,280
A fan of John Tesh.

1147
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,480
A corporate shill.

1148
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,440
A floating green turd in the punch bowl of life.

1149
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:32,220
Oh yes dear friends, and that was either James Inman or Adam W. Lewis dot com.

1150
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:39,600
Anyway, it's called Hilarious Video of Seattle Man Addressing City Council.

1151
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,240
And that's all I know.

1152
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:49,280
This show, Hour of Slack, was not assembled by I, Stang, or me, but by Reverend Bucky

1153
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,940
Argyle.

1154
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,300
Before that last bit, we heard a little bit of the Puzzling Evidence show.

1155
00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:02,720
We heard G. Gordon Gordon doing the classic rant, It's Not Just The, which I believe

1156
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,300
he recorded in Bolivia in the early 80s.

1157
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,680

1161
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:25,100
Up in Reverse Time with Relic, a YouTube.

1162
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,900
Reverend Bucky may be British, and it may be easier for them to understand that.

1163
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:37,240
Before that, Puzzling Evidence on the 60s with Phineas Narco and Dr. Howell.

1164
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:41,200
The 13th Floor Elevators did the song Levee.

1165

1166
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,200

The song Traveling with Berlitz was by Crust.

1172

1173
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,020
