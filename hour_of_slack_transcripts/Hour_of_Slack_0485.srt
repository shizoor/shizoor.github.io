1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:19,800
Well, now, you keep talking about this Bob, and I've seen pictures of him, certainly a

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,120
lot of drawings of him, and yet I've never heard, you sent me several of the books and

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,760
the tapes and stuff over the years, I've never actually heard Bob's voice.

4
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,220
I've never seen a photograph of him, as far as I know.

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,060
Well, you've seen plenty of photographs of him.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,840
You pick up any old Better Homes and Gardens, Popular Science, from the 50s and early 60s,

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680
Bob modeled for ads.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,120
He's that guy with the pipe, the grinning, sort of a Ward Cleaver-ish, Dick Van Dyke

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,900
looking fellow with this sort of slightly crazed grin.

10
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,100
And he's got a pipe.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,620
You may have seen pictures of him spray painted on bridge abutments and dumpsters and so forth.

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,220
Here and there.

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,600
Greenwich Village is a bar on Avenue A and 7th Street, I think 7A and then...

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,360
Are you a voyeur?

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,780
Do you like to watch?

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,380
Uh-huh.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,780
What's your name?

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:17,780
Bob.

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,620
Hi, Bob.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,500
What are you going to do with it, Bob?

21
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,280
Tell me.

22
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,820
Tell me how you like it.

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,680
If I came in your room right now, what would you do to me?

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,300
Oh!

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,800
If you came in my room right now, I'd want you to put your...

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,500
Oh, boy.

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
Oh, yeah, Bob.

28
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,520
Oh, yeah?

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,260
Uh-huh.

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,300
Do you think you can find...

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,600
Oh, yeah?

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,340
Uh-huh.

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,920
Do you think you can find my sub-G spot, Bob?

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,540
No.

35
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,840
Come on, baby.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,960
Find it for me.

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,320
Yeah.

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,440
Oh, Bob.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,700
Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,640
Yeah.

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,640
Oh!

42
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,140


43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,200
Four, three, two, one, fire!

44
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,820
Welcome to the...

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,380
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

46
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,860
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

47
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,560
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,920
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,940
and only in the city of...

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,040
I was talking to you about my plans to think of something

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,540
absolutely new and revolutionary.

52
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,360
We should change the whole face of the world.

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,820
Right, but the function of the Order of Dionysus Abasios

54
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,680
is both the destruction of Christianity

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,920
based on the principles of the Satanic Bible

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,720
as written by Anton Zondor-Levay,

57
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:51,120
and so the ODS follows strictly 100% almost that philosophy,

58
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,740
but in the...

59
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,120
...being of teenagers from authoritarian slavery

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,240
as...

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,080
...adolescence is only a social invention.

62
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,660
By nature, teenagers actually are adults.

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,060
Should...

64
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,580
Adolescence is only a social invention.

65
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,080
By nature, teenagers actually are adults.

66
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,080
Should be treated as such as puberty

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,200
is nature's endowment of adulthood.

68
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,220
And so they should be...

69
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,600
Teenagers should be free to go out

70
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,760
with older adults regardless of how much older...

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,420
...you mean...

72
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,460
Now, this is a lobbying group

73
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,720
that does not mean that we're actually going out

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,080
and breaking the law before the law is changed.

75
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,200
And or the intermingling socially and sexually

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,160
with actual teenagers

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,920
to become like a teenager,

78
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,080
to become one of them again.

79
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,920
Do you remember these?

80
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,920
Mother sits there and looks at the young child.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,080
She says, my dear child,

82
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,720
we're going out into the wide world

83
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,860
and you're going to meet an awful lot of strange people.

84
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,980
You must listen to your mother.

85
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,180
Don't contradict her

86
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,140
and always remember these words.

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Don't take gum.

88
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,240
Don't take candy.

89
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,220
Don't get in strange cars.

90
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,340
Don't talk to strange men.

91
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,800
Keep your legs crossed, your panties up

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,940
and come home from school in a group.

93
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,640
The poor little girl gets in a modern car today.

94
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,340
Even a Nash, just for an instance.

95
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,540
Boy, the guy settles the car,

96
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,900
pushes the button, the bed comes down,

97
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,780
he gets your head caught in the trunk.

98
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,680
You don't even know you had it.

99
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,020
Right.

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,960
Because trying to prove that there is,

101
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,620
you know, that there is or isn't a heaven or hell

102
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,420
is like trying to prove that little pink elephants

103
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,880
don't exist in a...

104
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,860
another galaxy somewhere.

105
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,500
We can't prove it, but personally,

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,160
Satanists do have principles,

107
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,860
whereas an anarchist will do just whatever he wants to do

108
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,600
with your life.

109
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,580
And being out of control is very unsatanic.

110
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,280
Do you like lying?

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,580
Because your name's not Eric

112
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,020
and you're the jerk of the day and goodbye.

113
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,220
And oh no, don't tell me they gave me Ron from Seattle.

114
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,980
Bobby, how's my lying, pandering carnival barker

115
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,900
of hate and misinformation today?

116
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,860
Excuse me?

117
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,860


118
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,860


119
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
Excuse me?

120
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,940
Bob, listen, please give me my time.

121
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,720
Let me quote it.

122
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,620
I created light and created darkness,

123
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,880
created goodness and created evil.

124
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,800
I, the Lord God, do all these things.

125
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,740
God is the source of evil and he admits it.

126
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,720
What's the burr under your saddle?

127
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,520
So in other words, what's good about this subgenius organization

128
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,380
is you can find enlightenment in bafflement,

129
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,900
is what you're kind of saying here.

130
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,900
Well, Bob is...

131
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,700
Is not what you would call a brilliant man.

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
Hence the word church of the subgenius.

133
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
You notice this isn't church of the genius.

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,140
Some geniuses out there may have noticed that by now.

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,520
But it's not...

136
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,120
What Bob has been trying to say is that

137
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,040
it's not the intelligence that counts.

138
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,080
It's just plain, plain old sense.

139
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,820
Horse sense, common sense, sense of humor,

140
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,260
and most importantly of all, dollars and cents.

141
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,000
Bob?

142
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,240
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

143
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,400
That's right. I'm Terry Carr for The Voice Midlands,

144
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,480
Midlands Radio, all the way from Leeds, Lancashire.

145
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,560
And tonight we're going to have a very interesting guest.

146
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,840
He says he's the man who is responsible for,

147
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,480
if you've heard of it, I'm sure some of you have,

148
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,220
the church of the subgenius.

149
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,640
I'm sure you've all heard of the name Bob

150
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,840
and seen some of the graffiti around town lately.

151
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,780
And is it a satanic cult?

152
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,360
Or is it just another little hyper-clicker,

153
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,760
a group of crazies on the lam, looking for some fun?

154
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,040
We'll be back in five minutes after some words.

155
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,280
We'll be talking to Reverend Armitage Sane.

156
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,420
Praise Bob!

157
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,840
Praise Bob!

158
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,200
Once a gal to call his own.

159
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
You've enjoyed Garrison Keillor's homespun storytelling for decades.

160
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,980
Now delight as America's heartland humorist

161
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,080
brings to life the most memorable event of the decade,

162
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,560
Garrison Keillor's L.A. Riots.

163
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,840
Old Mrs. Laramie was surprised at the ease

164
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,600
with which she was able to waltz out of that electronic,

165
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
store with the new stereo boombox.

166
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,680
But then the store was owned by the man.

167
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,480
And of course she didn't know how to hook it up.

168
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,940
So she put a call out to fix-it man, Otis Brown.

169
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
And he said to her, he said,

170
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,400
Mrs. Laramie, he said,

171
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,260
you got blood all up on the side of this thing here.

172
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,900
And then she remembered just how on her way home

173
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,900
she had used that boombox to clock a Korean grocer.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,520
So, you know, she knew.

175
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,120
Garrison Keillor's L.A. Riots.

176
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,420
Available on cassette from the Public Radio Catalog.

177
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,760
You get going.

178
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,940
Two, three, four.

179
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,180
guitar solo

180
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,760
Like I said, some troopers

181
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,280
Want us all to think alike

182
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,860
But you're stopping over here

183
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,300
With all your nevity

184
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,460
With all your idiot might

185
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,360
Won't take a cold bullet

186
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,040
But you love that we can love

187
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,920
Meanwhile, Ed has a bush

188
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,940
Here's a poison in the cup

189
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,820
Hey, Mr. Correct

190
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,480
Don't tell me what to do

191
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,280
No matter how many rules we got

192
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
You're still gonna die

193
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,980
With missionary zeal

194
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,540
He spit on the fur coat

195
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,640
Debt to rent

196
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:25,840
Debt to rent

197
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:25,840


198
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:25,840


199
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:25,840


200
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,580
A leather jacket

201
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,460
And we cheese from a goat

202
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,340
Yeah, you march and you write

203
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,240
And you groan and you scream

204
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,000
All you're doing, buddy

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
Is scratching a big ugly machine

206
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, Mr. Correct

207
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,640
Don't tell me what to do

208
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,460
No matter how many rules you got

209
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,540
You're still gonna die

210
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,880
With a gem on the habitat

211
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,840
I'll only teach you how to

212
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,200
To read to and for

213
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,240
The mind of the mind

214
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,240


215
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,240


216
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,240


217
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,240


218
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,240


219
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,240


220
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,060
Gerade since the first time

221
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,960
I'm gonna break

222
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,620
My record

223
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,300
I'm gonna make

224
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,260
The world into Earth

225
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,260


226
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,560
For more

227
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:21,860
In order to

228
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:21,860


229
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,960
Well, that's my thing

230
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:22,960


231
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,420
I throw all my putτεeth

232
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:23,420


233
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,640
Teens

234
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:24,800
Heyus

235
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:24,920
I'm like hoorah

236
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,280
prune

237
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,840
The food jostler

238
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,400
You've been sucked into the corporate death fence

239
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,960
Who owns that Mercedes-Benz, Mr. Current?

240
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,500
Don't tell me what to do

241
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,940
No matter how many rules you got, buddy

242
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,580
You still gotta die

243
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,860
Foo, foo, foo, foo, you a fool

244
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,740
Lying idiot, bandwagon puppet

245
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,580
Lying a jerk just like us, but you think you're above it

246
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,100
Nothing but a prude, you're afraid of sex and nudity

247
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,980
A vegetarian in Doc Martens is the king of stupidity

248
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,040
Mr. Current

249
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,820
Don't tell me what to do

250
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,640
Don't tell me what to do

251
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,040
Do that part again

252
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,520
Oh, Mr. Current

253
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,220
Don't tell me what to do

254
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,100
No matter how many rules you got

255
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,000
You still gotta die

256
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,920
Foo, foo, foo, foo, you a fool

257
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,660
No matter how many rules you got

258
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,520
You still gotta die

259
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,100
Foo, foo, foo, foo, you a fool

260
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,200
Hey, Mr. Correct

261
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,060
Hey, Mr. Correct

262
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,900
I'm talking to you

263
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,760
Oh, Mr. Correct

264
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,580
Hey, Rick and Rick

265
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,620
Hey, Rick and Rick

266
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,200
Ahhhh

267
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,820
I bet you ride your bike to work every day

268
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,140
And live in a solar-powered house probably

269
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,620
Isn't that true? Yeah, Ricky

270
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,280
You liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar

271
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,820
Hello, friends, and welcome.

272
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,740
The sermon tonight is entitled

273
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,100
What If

274
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,600
It is called that for good reason

275
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
Because, you see, everywhere I go across this great nation

276
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,420
Everywhere I tour, every performance I give

277
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,960
Some sincere but misguided Christian

278
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,240
Accompanies me in the parking lot

279
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,700
And barks a curse we've all heard a million times

280
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
For the last two thousand years

281
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,160
Sinner!

282
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,320
They shriek, eyeballs bulging and bony finger pointing

283
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,220
You may laugh now

284
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,980
But come judgment day

285
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,580
What if

286
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,720
You're wrong

287
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,100
If I had but a dime

288
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,260
For every time that thinly veiled threat was hurled towards a subgenius

289
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,140
I'd have more money than all the trial lawyers in California and New York combined

290
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,880
Yet, as mean-spirited as this rhetorical question sounds

291
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,920
It is, in fact, a legitimate challenge

292
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,820
What if, Bob forbid, we are wrong?

293
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,320
Such a premise is difficult for subgenies to contemplate

294
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,640
Because one of the cornerstones of good salesmanship

295
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,020
Is confidence in the product

296
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,680
We will succeed

297
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,140
Because we know we will succeed

298
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,160
It is a self-fulfilling prophecy

299
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,180
To even question the outcome is not only defeatist

300
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,040
And anti-Dobbsian

301
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,020
It is subgenius sacrilege

302
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,720
And yet, in the interest of open theological debate

303
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,840
We will consider just this once

304
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,300
The question of what if we're wrong

305
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,240
Now, theoretically speaking, I think that's a good thing

306
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,140
Not that it is statistically probable

307
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,080
But hypothetically, imagine if you can

308
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,960
A world come July 5th, 1998

309
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,220
Where there is no excess invasion

310
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,980
Oh, it's painful, it's painful, dear friends, I understand

311
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,660
But remember, this is only theoretical

312
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,540
A planet that is not surrounded by an angry alien spacecraft

313
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,640
A globe not littered

314
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,920
A globe not completely polluted

315
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,120
With the corpses of conspiracy theorists

316
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,900
And doobs

317
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,740
Oh, dear friends

318
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,620
It would be a sick society

319
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,380
Still dominated by pinks and normals

320
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,440
An earth where corporations, governments

321
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,100
And well-equipped armies still loyal to the system

322
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,160
Continue to uphold the status quo

323
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,380
They fight to maintain their tight totalitarian grasp

324
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,900
On the very throat of freedom

325
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,800
Oh, it's a nightmarish vision indeed

326
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,960
One that makes my head spin

327
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,280
But one we will contemplate nonetheless

328
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,900
In the interest of free and open debate

329
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,540
Yes, dear friends

330
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,300
This dark future of dobsian defeat

331
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,040
And conspiracy conquest

332
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,460
This desperate future

333
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,040
Where the last subgenius forces

334
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,240
Are holed up in the underground bunkers

335
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
Awaiting the final onslaught

336
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,620
By conspiracy mercenaries

337
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,060
Is a vision we do not want to contemplate

338
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,600
But will this one last time

339
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,460
As the Kelvin bombs explode far above

340
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,740
On the planetary surface

341
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,640
Staying in his subgenius generals

342
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,720
Huddled beneath a flickering light bulb

343
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,920
Pouring over maps of subgenius tunnels

344
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,100
Subway tunnels and underground sewers

345
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,580
Examining any and all possible attack routes

346
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,700
They will be determined

347
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,120
Determined to fight to death

348
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,900
And take the maximum number of normals with them

349
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,700
Why?

350
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,360
Because we hate you!

351
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,680
They will be dedicated to honoring Bob

352
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760
Through a dignified dobsian death

353
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,720
It is even

354
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,120
It is then that some weak of heart

355
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,540
Heretic will step forward

356
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,560
Probably some Bobby

357
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,280
Who always dreamed of being a real subgenius warrior

358
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,020
For wartime

359
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,520
But when the chips are down for Dobbs

360
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,720
Wants to cash out

361
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,040
This weak-willed wannabe Bobby

362
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,800
Will show his first real courage

363
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,500
When he steps forward and whines

364
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,220
The Reverend Stang

365
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,500
Bunker!

366
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,900
You promised we'd have something to show

367
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,840
For our membership fee

368
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,540
The bunker will fall silent

369
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,680
Like a tomb

370
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,260
The collected gasp

371
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,220
Will cause the barometric pressure to plummet

372
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,920
The bobbing above will pause

373
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,500
In divine reverence

374
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,640
Stang will slowly turn

375
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,320
To the trembling traitor

376
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,600
Glare into his frightened little face

377
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,140
And with the thunder

378
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,600
Of Daniel Webster

379
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,900
We'll proclaim the same answer

380
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,820
I gave the Christian in the parking lot

381
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,120
And that is this

382
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,920
Even in hell

383
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,580
We'll have the one thing

384
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,000
The conspiracy tried to deny from us

385
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
All our living lives

386
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,140
The one human right

387
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,280
They'll never be able to take from us again

388
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,600
No matter how much they lie about what we did

389
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,860
Or what they didn't do

390
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,580
It's the one human right

391
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,620
The one virtue Christians will never obtain

392
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,480
No matter how much they beg

393
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,080
Pray

394
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,920
Or grovel to their God

395
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,460
I'm talking about respect

396
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,160
Self-respect

397
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,000
The only commodity

398
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,580
That can't be bought

399
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,280
Traded

400
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,160
Negotiated

401
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,840
Or stolen

402
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,680
In any of the conspiracy marketplaces

403
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,520
Appreciate it

404
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,920
Hallelujah!

405
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,800
It's a concept

406
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,580
Foreign

407
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,260
To all pinks and normals

408
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,320
Who serve the system

409
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,540
They may have stolen our freedom

410
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,560
Our slack

411
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,020
And even our lives

412
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,560
But by virtue of our very defiance

413
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,580
To them and their ways

414
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,920
We've earned a self-respect

415
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,540
They can't even pretend to want

416
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,540
And you want to know why?

417
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,700
Why?

418
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,320
Because their religion

419
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,760
Is based on submission

420
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
While ours is based on independence

421
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,300
Praise God

422
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,420
Give me a praise ball

423
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,000
Praise God

424
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,760
Praise God

425
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:45,920
Praise God

426
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,200
So that dear friends

427
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,620
Is our answer

428
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,360
That's what we get

429
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,180
Even if we're wrong

430
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,720
Come judgment day

431
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,540
The honor and dignity of self-respect

432
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,680
Earned through a lifelong fight

433
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,060
For independence and freedom

434
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,140
Only the devil

435
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,600
Could possibly resent a man

436
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,080
For wanting to be free

437
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,800
Any God

438
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,180
That wouldn't want his followers to be free

439
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,940
Is no savior

440
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,180
But a tyrant

441
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,560
An enslaver of souls

442
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,720
A devil in disguise

443
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,560
And that leads me to my question

444
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,720
To the Christian

445
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,840
It's terribly original

446
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,220
So brace yourself for it

447
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,040
What if

448
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,920
We were to be

449
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,280
What if

450
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,500
You're wrong

451
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,680
Come judgment day

452
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,960
Please think carefully

453
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,320
Before you answer dear friend

454
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,200
Because remember

455
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,700
Your very soul

456
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,620
Dangles in the balance

457
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,380
Hear it

458
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,240
It's the word of God

459
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,440
Praise God

460
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,160
Amen

461
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,480
Praise Father Joe Mama

462
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,340
Oh yes dear friend

463
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,180
Praise Father Joe Mama

464
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,180
A beautiful beautiful

465
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,500
Sermon there

466
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,160
From the Pittsburgh Devival

467
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,200
A couple of weeks ago

468
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,100
Sponsored by the Eye of Horus Bookstore

469
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,380
Yes and what else do we have there

470
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,520
Mojo Nixon's song Mr. Correct

471
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,700
From his new album

472
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,940
Whereabouts Unknown

473
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,460
We heard Garrison Keillor's L.A. Riots

474
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,500
From the Not For Broadcast album

475
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,400
By The Onion

476
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,280
And a little bit of Bleepo Abernathy

477
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,180
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave

478
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,800
Trying to introduce the church

479
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,380
Interspersed with distracting media barrage material

480
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,260
From Reverend Nick Nolan

481
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,400
And of course Bob Larson

482
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
But you know what friends

483
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,300
What Father Joe Mama was saying

484
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,760
About that one side of the conspiracy

485
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,340
It makes you wonder

486
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,920
It makes you wonder

487
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,720
Which side of the conspiracy is running things

488
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,360
I started getting paranoid about

489
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,280
Well

490
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,500
Uh

491
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,340
The Masons

492
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,400
Let's say

493
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,420
Let's just say

494
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,000
For all I know

495
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,300
I'm really worried about the Illuminati

496
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,000
But uh

497
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,820
You know it started with that

498
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,160
America Online logo

499
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,720
Which is a triangle with a circle in the middle of it

500
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,420
Looks just like the old eye in the pyramid

501
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,380
Or the eye above the pyramid

502
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,360
You know and uh

503
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,200
I mentioned that to my friend Emot

504
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,360
And Emot said

505
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,020
Oh that's just the beginning of it

506
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,780
Haven't you noticed

507
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,960
Those uh triangles

508
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,200
And the eyeball shapes

509
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,240
Are just everywhere

510
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,880
And in fact they've even gotten quite obvious about

511
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,560
The names of these businesses

512
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,300
He goes

513
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,760
Ever noticed the red arches

514
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,180
That form a big M of the Sonic hamburgers

515
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,780
Get it

516
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,220
Sonic

517
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,740
Masonic

518
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,460
I think I'll have Masonic burger now

519
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,620
Or he goes

520
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,420
Did you know that Philip Morris cigarettes

521
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,180
And General Motors cigarettes

522
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,180


523
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,180


524
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,180


525
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,180


526
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,180


527
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,180


528
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,180


529
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,180


530
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,780
And the original foods were both owned by this gigantic conglomerate

531
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,020
Kraft Foods

532
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,980
Kraft

533
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,140
The as in

534
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,760
The Kraft

535
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes friends

536
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,660
And not to mention when they replaced that Popeyes

537
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,760
Place next door with Church's fried chicken

538
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,540
Uh huh

539
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,660
But it doesn't stop there

540
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,540
If you look around

541
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,300
Next time you drive through town friend

542
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,160
Just keep your eyeballs open

543
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,760
You may see things you didn't want to see

544
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,660
Buildings one after another that look like

545
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,440
Well like the Temple of Solomon

546
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,020
If it's not the arches

547
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,920
It's that Temple of Solomon shape

548
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,760
That you see etched onto Masonic aprons and symbols

549
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,260
Uh my old supermarket nearby here

550
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,800
Menards

551
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,440
He pointed out

552
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,360
Looks just like that

553
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,380
All of the Sam Walton stores

554
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,220
Walmart

555
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,060
Sam's

556
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,620
Hypermart

557
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,760
They're in the grand Masonic design my friends

558
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,080
Computer places

559
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,540
Uh Computer City

560
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:08,740
Disney

561
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,520
Discovery Zone

562
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,800
The Best Buy stores

563
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,580
All subtle Masonic symbols

564
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,140
Then go buy your local water pumping station

565
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,520
The Gas Company

566
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,220
Uh

567
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,260
The Gas Company in most small towns is in the same building

568
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,100
As a Masonic lodge my friends

569
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,720
The Electric Company

570
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,960
They all

571
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,880
All of them

572
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,240
My friends

573
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,400
Are part of one conspiracy or another

574
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,180
You know

575
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,320
But what do they

576
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,960
What we

577
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,380
You try to talk about things like this and

578
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,600
They call you

579
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,420
Well the polite term

580
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,680
Conspiracy researchers

581
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Or conspiracy buffs

582
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,780
Or conspiracy nuts

583
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,760
Or conspiracy kooks

584
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,260
Or conspiracy crackpots my friends

585
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,920
Then those

586
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,300
Those are the real polite terms for

587
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,000
The folks who attempt merely to lift the veils

588
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
Peer under the rocks

589
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,180
And pry into the business of the uh authorities

590
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,880
Uh so called

591
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,100
What I wanna know is friends

592
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:19,380
How come the conspiracy researchers get worse pressed than some of the conspiracy perpetrators

593
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,180
Heh it must be a conspiracy

594
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,980
Uh you know I can wax as sarcastic as the next guy about some conspiracy theories

595
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,820
I like to think I'm skeptical to the bone

596
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,160
But I actually do believe a large percentage of the conspiracy theories are true

597
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,500
Those conspiracy theories

598
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,280
Heh

599
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,980
Heh

600
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,920
And worse still I believe in the conspiracy

601
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,200
Yes the plot

602
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,220
By ordinary normal everyday people to label conspiracy researchers as loonies

603
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,960
Or as a part of a conspiracy

604
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,740
Now contrary to unpopular opinion friends

605
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,300
It's still possible to use mass media to expose mass media conspiracies

606
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,520
But you have to couch your expose carefully

607
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,220
You have to make it look like a satire

608
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,420
Or a comic book

609
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,840
Or a radio show

610
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,240
Like this one which is pieced together from the dead parts of history books

611
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,540
Heh

612
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,140
Heh

613
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,140
And of course some conspiracy theories are just that

614
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,960
They're just theories

615
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,940
Improbable

616
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,720
Paranoid

617
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,540
Predicated on few facts

618
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,880
Like the one about the masons creating the greys

619
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,620
They've obviously got it backwards

620
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,880
Others are founded on pure coincidence

621
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,960
And these I would consider kooky wouldn't you

622
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,040
But then you know one man's paranoid lunatic is the next man's dedicated researcher

623
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,820
And uh you know the problem is the domino effect though

624
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,600
There's those who see conspiracies everywhere

625
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,680
Literally everywhere

626
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,540
The crazy old bircher lady who fears commies under her bed is just a stereotype

627
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,000
Nor is the religious nut who sees satanists everywhere

628
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,940
Nor the UFO cultist who mistakes satanists everywhere

629
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,200
Something that could be cured with Prozac for messages from the space brothers

630
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,180
But you know there might be something to some of it

631
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,960
And once you're fairly sure of one conspiracy theory

632
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,720
It starts to tie into neighboring conspiracy theories

633
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,900
And pretty soon you're believing quite a few conspiracy theories

634
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,380
And you start to sound like one of those nuts

635
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,660
Unless you're selective about who you tell it to

636
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,500
And that's one of the things that inclines you towards the conspiracy view of history

637
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,440
Is the way the more trusting people around you respond to the very idea

638
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,880
You know try discussing the CIA's more heinous misdeeds in polite society

639
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,540
People edge away

640
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:02,960
They just can't allow themselves to believe that men whose portraits still hang in city halls and corporate headquarters

641
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,900
Were in fact

642
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,820
A more of monsters and eager collaborators with nazis

643
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,280
Cause that would imply that that smiling rosy cheeked glad handing politician they just voted for

644
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,700
Might be involved in something worse

645
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,520
Paranoia has a bad rep these days

646
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,420
But as the ancient saw goes

647
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,580
It's not paranoia if they really are out to get ya

648
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,140
And they are

649
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,580
People should be a lot more paranoid

650
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,340
And a lot of so called normal people are

651
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,500
Oh they're in fact as paranoid as you can get

652
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,920
They're just paranoid about the wrong things

653
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,220
Since the FBI has no proof for organized satanic ritual murder cults

654
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,820
The many little christian fundamentalist conspiracies have invented them

655
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,440
The same guy who can't believe the army could ever do anything evil and anti-american

656
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,840
May be convinced that the devil sends heavy metal bands out to corrupt our youth

657
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,740
He's paranoid about marijuana

658
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,760
He's a bunch of fiends

659
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,480
But he drives drunk

660
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,260
He's paranoid about sex and violence on TV

661
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,740
But thinks everybody should have their own automatic weapon

662
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,760
He's learned that the media is controlled by liberals

663
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,300
Because he listens to right wing blather all day long on the radio

664
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,080
Shut up little man

665
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,540
Nobody asked you to say anything

666
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,140
Shut up little man

667
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,100
Shut up little man

668
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,800
What's the burr under your saddle?

669
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,100
The burr under the saddle is you trying to shut us up and tell us where to hell

670
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,960
Jesus says believe in me or to hell with you

671
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,240
And I don't like that I'm getting tired of you guys trying to tell us where to go

672
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,060
What to do

673
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,340
I'm not telling you where to go and what to do

674
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,460
God's telling you what to do or where you're going to go if you don't do it

675
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,500
But you know what?

676
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:56,960
What?

677
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,960
That's not a choice that's coercion

678
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,180
How do I know I'm not talking to a disembodied alien right now?

679
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,020
Well if you don't have a clue that you're talking to a human being then you're pretty stupid

680
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,940
How do I know?

681
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,960
Prove it to me, you can't prove it to me can you Bill?

682
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,440
See ha ha ha, you can't prove it to me Bill, you can't prove it to me

683
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,020
Bill, Bill

684
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,840
Empirically you cannot prove it to me beyond any doubt

685
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,900
Anybody that you've ever talked to Bob, how do you know you've talked to anybody?

686
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,220
You just live in a fantasy world behind a microphone

687
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,920
Prove you've talked to anybody including me Bill

688
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,840
Because there's repetition

689
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,060
Because, because my friend

690
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,980
I'm a human, I have a human voice, that's how you know

691
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,900
Odds are you're talking to a Bill

692
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,880
Get real

693
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,500
Just because you have a voice doesn't mean you have a brain

694
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,400
Correct

695
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,400
I would be more of what I would call a uh,

696
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,180
Pubophilic Satanist as opposed to a pedophile

697
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,840
Because everything that he says makes 100% sense

698
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,980
And there is little or nothing that he says that you can argue with

699
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:08,540
I'm a human, I'm a human, I'm a human, I'm proud to say I'm a jelly-billed dog

700
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:19,800
If me, I'm a human, if me, I'm a human, if me, I'm a human, I'm a jelly-billed dog

701
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:25,380
My little boy, he ain't a spankle-chackle-dink-dona, he is a jelly-billed dog

702
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,540
Hey Bob!

703
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,940
He wants a gal to call his own

704
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,860
Is she blonde, is she tall, is she dark, is she small

705
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,400
Is she any kind of dreamboat at all

706
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,160
No matter, he's hers and hers alone

707
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,720
Cause Dobby has to have a girl to call his own

708
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,100
I must have a girl to call my own

709
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,000
For I am Dobby, son of Goom

710
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:11,240
You pitiful, fixed-legged Earth fools milling about in your cage of only three dimensions

711
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,820
Dobby, go find me a nymph

712
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,700
Maynard, bring me a woman

713
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,840
Bring me a bongo, bongo baby

714
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,980
Give me a fury

715
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,340
A hundred of little furies

716
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,360
I want more

717
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,920
Bring me Harvey

718
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,480
Harvey's with chests of steel

719
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,540
Bring me the furies themselves

720
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,980
I want Medusa

721
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,980
Yes, I will make love to Medusa

722
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,880
Let her turn me to stone

723
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,320
I could be no stonier of heart than I am already

724
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,300
If only the fools would leave me in peace to complete my experiments

725
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,960
They want to know who I am and what I am

726
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,220
Well, I'll show them, I'll show them all

727
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,080
It's here in this dark cave on the Aegean Sea

728
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,640
Where lights have been seen for scores and scores of years

729
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,860
Fishermen have noticed lights in this cave for a period of five weeks at a time

730
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,880
During the summer solstice season

731
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,640
And after that time the lights appear to...

732
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,860
These crop circles, or frop circles as they're called

733
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,120
Originally appeared in wheat fields in England and...

734
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,780
Ireland, Scotland

735
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,740
Lately they've been appearing as concrete circles in the center of New York City in Chicago

736
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,640
Decorated with the bodies of mutilated cattle

737
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,240
Mysteriously mutilated cattle

738
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,180
What could this mean?

739
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,320
There are no secrets in the Church of the Subgenius

740
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,340
And I will not be endangering myself or my family in any way

741
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,060
Despite rumors to the contrary

742
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,780
Because you, dear listener, will probably not believe a word of it

743
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,720
It's all just more quaint fiction to you

744
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Just a lark, a joke

745
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:26,700
Eh, well, if the frop circles and the smoke from Bob's pipe are just a joke

746
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,960
Then what is your life?

747
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,160
Your very life, my friend

748
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,680
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

749
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,340
Where to begin? Where to begin?

750
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,720
There are so many impossible stories and bizarre events

751
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,440
Associated with the Church that it is hard to choose where to start

752
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,180
This is so like the Venusians and the Hollow Earth

753
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,400
The Nazis, the weird man, the dimensions from...

754
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,940
I mean these people from the Nefertiti

755
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,780
To set the tone

756
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,140
Let me tell you what I've seen with my own eyes

757
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,780
While visiting Palmer Vreedies

758
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,580
Actually, the artist Hal Robbins

759
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,160
A.K.A. Dr. Hal

760
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,780
In his San Francisco apartment in 1993

761
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,560
Hmm...

762
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,300
Well, I...

763
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,720
Well, I...

764
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,120
Lies and Vreedies began an apparently innocent brag fight

765
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,680
Each proclaiming their abilities in the most outrageous terms

766
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,140
But after a quarter hour without significant gain

767
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,160
Vreedies became agitated

768
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,320
And suddenly swept lamp and telephone from an end table

769
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,800
He then seemingly lifted the table into the air without touching it

770
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,720
It shot out the window and crashed onto the sidewalk

771
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,240
Two floors below where it burst into flame

772
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,300
Vreedies changed the subject immediately

773
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,640
And the event was never spoken of again

774
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,600
Having set the tone with that story

775
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,380
I can pretty much say anything I want to

776
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,860
And be assured that no listener will believe a word of it

777
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,520
On the same visit, I took a trip into the desert

778
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,700
With D. Woodman Atwell of puzzling evidence

779
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,260
A harrowing experience all around

780
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,520
For I saw him apparently drive his truck through a concrete wall

781
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,540
Without damage of any kind to anything

782
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,360
I was then shown a series of missile silos

783
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,580
From which shone beams of bluish green light

784
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,980
For a period of about two hours around midnight

785
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,020
This is February of 1992

786
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:39,920
There were a number of unusual gravitational and magnetic events in the area around this time

787
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:47,140
There were also a number of what I took to be very large sandstone rock formations

788
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,340
Which appeared to change positions when I wasn't watching

789
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,000
Think about it though friends

790
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,960
I mean really

791
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,940
Reality

792
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,300
And even its distant relative history

793
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,700
Are actually a hell of a lot weirder than any science fiction

794
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,420
If something as farfetched as Nazis getting paid by the CIA

795
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,060
To train Middle Eastern fanatics to fight the commies can be real

796
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,340
And it is

797
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,460
Then why not the CIA?

798
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,220
And aliens conspiracy

799
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,140
Huh?

800
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,680
I mean if the CIA conducted mass experiments on the citizenry

801
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,780
With LSD

802
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,760
And it did

803
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,820
Then why wouldn't it use some cover Christian organization

804
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,440
To turn earnest young weirdos into Manchurian candidates

805
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,860
And make them kill anti-establishment rock stars or even presidents

806
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:55,660
Just to make all earnest young weirdos look more insane than they are?

807
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,100
And the CIA?

808
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,520
It's infuriating

809
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,040
You know you can't just uncover a conspiracy and leave it at that

810
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,960
You always have to take into account the deliberate disinformation possibilities

811
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,940
For instance maybe the feds pay Bob Lazar

812
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,780
To talk about crashed saucers on air bases

813
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,520
And soul stealing grey aliens

814
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,600
In order to distract researchers from something far worse!

815
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:31,940
The murkiness level can become literally maddening

816
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,020
And that just might be the whole idea

817
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,360
No doubt about it

818
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,940
You can go overboard

819
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,240
Transway overboard

820
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,220
There's those who believe the holocaust was a hoax

821
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,360
And all the rest of us are crackpots

822
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,540
You know heck if you're gonna go that far

823
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,020
You might as well believe that World War II didn't happen

824
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:01,360
And the next logical step is to believe that nothing the press ever reported really happened

825
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,260
And pretty soon, praise Bob

826
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,220
You've got mountains of proof that you're always right

827
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,340
And everybody else is always wrong

828
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,120
And of course naturally the conspiracies that people tend to believe in

829
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,880
Are the ones that make them look good

830
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,480
And absolve them of responsibility

831
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,500
Over a hundred years ago

832
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,460
Some anonymous anti-semitic Frenchman

833
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,980
Pinned a hoax called

834
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,300
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion

835
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,080
And to this day, thanks to that hoax

836
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,740
Thousands of frustrated nasty old rednecks

837
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,580
Believe that the Jews control the world

838
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,380
Now believing that lets them off the hook

839
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,100
The reason for their poverty and misery

840
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,920
Isn't that they're a bunch of lazy ignorant alcoholic po-buckers

841
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,420
It's the Jews' fault!

842
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,440
By the same token, bitter black people who think that all of us are the same

843
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,100
And white people must be out to get them

844
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,200
Can find plenty of reinforcement in the nation of Islam cult

845
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,320
Inevitably, friends, those who are the most paranoid about a particular conspiracy

846
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,460
Become a conspiracy themselves

847
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,540
So where is the balance?

848
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,860
Which conspiracy theories should you believe?

849
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,300
For that matter, which conspiracy should you join?

850
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,220
Well friends, we're here to tell you about

851
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,100
The Church of the Subgenius

852
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,660
You know, we started a lot of those conspiracies ourselves

853
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,900
You can always come to Bob

854
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,760
To find a conspiracy made just for you

855
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,000
You can write to Bob, I'm gonna give you that free information post office box

856
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,520
Just say, Bob, send me that free information

857
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:48,940
And Bob is at post office box 140306

858
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,480
That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas

859
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,700
75214

860
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,320
That's right, Dallas, Texas

861
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,200
That's where we're at

862
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,140
I remember a time when I thought all that babble about multiple gunmen in Dealey Plaza

863
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,340
And the Oswald Doubles and so forth was silly

864
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,800
And it is getting awfully crowded up there on the grassy knoll

865
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,140
But you know, as I got more educated about the JFK puzzle

866
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,980
I learned a terrible truth

867
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,820
If you investigate deeply enough

868
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,580
Sometimes you become part of the conspiracy

869
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,840
I'm now a participant in the JFK cover-up

870
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:36,640
I know why the Kennedy family had to go along with the Warren Commission

871
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,260
But if I told, it would jeopardize lives

872
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,180
Stop laughing

873
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,400
I'll tell you man, you start out paranoid about them

874
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,480
And the next thing you know, you're one of them

875
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,700
And maybe it's an infinite regression

876
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,480
Maybe there's no escape

877
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,860
Maybe there's no one single truth that everybody should believe in

878
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,920
Not even Bob

879
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,000
Maybe everything is a conspiracy

880
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,060
Who knows, maybe one of these days we'll find out even that's not so funny after all

881
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,360
Good thing this is just a comedy show

882
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,760
This is nothing compared to the bizarre political and extra-legal connections of the Church of the Subgenius.

883
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,260
Ivan Stang is known to have made trips to England and South America in the past few years to meet with, among others,

884
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:42,940
high-ranking members of the P2 Masonic Group and an organization of which the Priory of Zion and Bilderberger Group are sanitized fictionalizations.

885
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:55,200
Stang and Drummond are known to be 33rd-degree masons, and Stang's position in a control group hinted at as a Texas mafia is hereditary through his father, an ex-district attorney for Dallas.

886
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:04,120
Stang has employed a man named Doug Smith to pose as the real-life person of Ivan Stang.

887
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,980
Stang, however, is his real name, although he now uses the Smith name in his daily affairs.

888
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,920
I have met Smith and can assure you they are two very different people.

889
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,900
They are people of entirely different capabilities.

890
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:21,620
Smith seems to be a victim of arrested development, and though he is the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet,

891
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,040
Stang is perfectly correct in calling him dumb as Dave.

892
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:37,740
I have never met Drummond, but the stories I've heard, uh, are strange as anything yet. Relate.

893
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,620
Now, I've seen the real Doug.

894
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,180
I've seen the real Doug.

895
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,500
And he is just as smooth as buttermilk pie.

896
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,660
He would never do a harmful thing to another human being.

897
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,100
This other man, now, you can see there's a big difference.

898
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,500
Look at his chin right there.

899
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,400
There's a big scar on his chin, and I don't see how they can get away with that.

900
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,860
I've told all my kin so far that this is it with me, boy.

901
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,720
I'm just giving up on everything the government ever says ever again.

902
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
I just don't believe it.

903
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,020
Did you see what they had on Donnie here the other night?

904
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,740
They had a man who could actually make you mad, make you mad, make you mad, make you mad, make you mad.

905
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,100
Oh, you rag.

906
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,200
Uh, let's say pour about eight identical glasses of tap water.

907
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,640
Send your loving energy selectively into one of them.

908
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,380
Basically bless the water.

909
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,240
Leave the room.

910
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,140
They'll switch the glasses on you, and then go up to the water's glasses with little dowsing rods.

911
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,720
And you'll find that the one that had been blessed is the one with the largest energy field.

912
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,380
Not only that, but it's also the one that tastes the best.

913
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,180
It's the story of the lost jewelry of Atlantis.

914
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,140
Not that again.

915
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,340
Well, there it is in all its effulgent splendor.

916
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,820
Because we have with us Philo's brother.

917
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,240
Oh, yes, that's right.

918
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,220
It's only in nomenclature.

919
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,200
That's true.

920
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,100
But, you know, I suppose there are areas, there are places where Philo is his brother.

921
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,020
That's true, but it's never brought up quite that way.

922
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,000
And so even on his business card, it says Philo's brother.

923
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,060
Yeah, well, I don't know what the future is in that.

924
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,820
My mom sometimes refers to Philo as my brother, though.

925
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,500
Your brother, I just can't believe what he did this time.

926
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,280
I just have to get to the bottom of it once and for all.

927
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,660
Whether a preference for poop dog hats runs in the family.

928
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,500
Actually, it does.

929
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,500
She doesn't ever say Sphinx's brother, though.

930
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,420
It's your brother.

931
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,440
My brother?

932
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,800
Yeah, your brother.

933
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,780
That doesn't make any sense, because she doesn't even know my brother.

934
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,520
My brother, the Sphinx?

935
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,940
Or doesn't know Hal's brother.

936
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,000
So if you know our brothers, you can call us.

937
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,540
And if you know we are brothers...

938
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,640
Brother, go find your brother.

939
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,820
And all out there within the reach of my voice are truly my brothers.

940
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,840
Related to me by intimate ties of love.

941
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,080
Indeed.

942
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,940
My goodness, what an extremely good memory you have.

943
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,980
Now let's go over that again.

944
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,720
You say you saw some sort of monster?

945
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,000
Yes.

946
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,340
It was my pet parakeet.

947
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:08,800
Pete.

948
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,280
And what happened to it?

949
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,500
Oh, well, he used to be, uh...

950
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,920
Whoa, and there goes some...

951
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,420
Uh-oh.

952
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,520
Well, that's what happened to pet parakeet Pete.

953
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,980
He was hurled out of a speeding taxi in the middle of a busy downtown intersection.

954
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,880
Then dragged in a phone booth while trying to make a phone call.

955
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,680
You know Philo's brother's here.

956
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,320
Then forced to...

957
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,260
Oh, yeah, that's right.

958
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,740
Look at that. Look at that. Look at that.

959
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,620
This is not just a show.

960
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,980
I mean, Philo's brother's here, so...

961
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,300
If you have a question for Philo's brother, that's right now what you want to do.

962
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:36,700
That's right.

963
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,320
The topic tonight is Philo's brother.

964
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:38,700
Philo's brother.

965
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,640
Do you have a question for...

966
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,600
Journey to Arizona.

967
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,840
Or, uh, comments about Philo's brother.

968
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,400
Oh, my brother.

969
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,520
No, that's not your line.

970
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:45,880
That's the other guy's line.

971
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,620
We're talking about Philo's brother.

972
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,500
He says who's his brother.

973
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,420
And then down here, the scratched out part, it says, yeah, don't be scared.

974
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,140
Don't be scared.

975
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,360
What's going on?

976
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,860
Your flesh will creep.

977
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,620
Your heart will bump, uh, et cetera and so forth.

978
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,740
Uh-oh.

979
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,880
Punch the wrong brain.

980
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,280
Punch the magic dragon.

981
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,840
Okay, don't be scared and hang up.

982
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,760
Just speak now.

983
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,520
Don't walk.

984
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,000
Don't walk.

985
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,540
Green light.

986
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:07,820
Speak.

987
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,680
Go through the door.

988
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,720
And speaking of dragons, I could tell you about...

989
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,120
And answer the phone.

990
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,100
...the very next...

991
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,360
And if you're watching Channel 2, you see that we've synced up every single sound effect

992
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,700
to the caller pulled in.

993
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:17,900
Hello?

994
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:17,900


995
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,320
It's a slim lead, I know, but it might get us some...

996
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,460
Hello?

997
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:20,820
Hello?

998
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,400
Just one.

999
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:22,920
Just you.

1000
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,940
Turn that caller to the cold and damp.

1001
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,460
There he goes.

1002
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,740
Oh, Hal just turned him around.

1003
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,100
Now he's all cold and damp.

1004
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,300
Well, it gets him evenly done on all sides.

1005
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,060
So, uh, state short question, please.

1006
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,320
The phone's busy, so...

1007
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:33,500
Yeah.

1008
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,520
So, go ahead and talk.

1009
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,160
You see, there's so many different approaches to this question of mind over matter or transcendental

1010
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:47,720
reality is when I breathe in, I visualize the energy of the universe, which is very

1011
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,840
abundant by the way.

1012
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:54,540
This is the same kind of energy, I think, as the Tesla technology energy is.

1013
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,820
It's similar to the energy of consciousness or mind over matter.

1014
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,700
It's a very powerful energy.

1015
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,500
So you imagine this energy.

1016
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:04,500


1017
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,720
You see this energy coming into your belly button as you breathe in.

1018
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:13,140
As you breathe out, you breathe that energy through, in this case, through the tips of

1019
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,780
my fingers, laser-like into the spoon, and I become at one with the spoon.

1020
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,520
Oh, yes, friends.

1021
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:26,440
You too can become at one with the spoon if you're ready to give your all to Bob, or at

1022
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,980
least a 32-cent stamp.

1023
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,380
Come on, go for it, man.

1024
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,580
Write for the free information.

1025
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,300
Here's that number again.

1026
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,600
It's got music by Arnold Mathis in the background.

1027
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,740
Okay, here it comes.

1028
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:50,840
Just write to Bob, my friends, at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1029
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:58,220
Once again, that's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1030
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,100
And as I said, this is Arnold Mathis in the background.

1031
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,280
Before that, Bob.

1032
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:03,280


1033
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:03,280


1034
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:10,460
Before this, we heard a little bit of puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell on the KPFA Berkeley

1035
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,000
subgenius or anti-subgenius show, whatever it is.

1036
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,880
And coming up more and having been more of Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1037
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,700
That's ESO radio brought to us from WCSB in Cleveland.

1038
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,120
Praise WCSB.

1039
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,200
Oh, and praise Reverend Mike Cole.

1040
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:33,280


1041
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:41,360
For interviewing that Satanist, Joe Autrich, which we've heard little bits of in between.

1042
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,520
We're just scavenging WCSB like crazy.

1043
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,400
And thanks to Steve Bevilacqua, who rescued that on tape and put horrible music with it.

1044
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,020
Oh, what's...

1045
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,460
Who else should I credit?

1046
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,460
Oh, Nenslow.

1047
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:02,640
Some of the disinformation about the Church of the Subgenius, which I was reading there

1048
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,780
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz on that ESO show.

1049
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,140
That was written by Nenslow.

1050
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,280
I should definitely give Nenslow credit for that.

1051
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,160
Those particular lies about the Church of the Subgenius.

1052
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,640
I thought they were very effective lies myself, one way or another.

1053
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,520
And so we'll plunge back in.

1054
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,280
Thank y'all.

1055
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,740
Thank you.

1056
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,200
Well, I just don't know.

1057
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,660
I just don't know.

1058
00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:01,980
I wandered into this little spook house restaurant or whatever it was that they were...

1059
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,620
I don't know.

1060
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:02,620


1061
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:02,620


1062
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:02,620


1063
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:02,620


1064
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:02,620


1065
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:02,620


1066
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,880
They were all having some kind of a party.

1067
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,600
And then they set fire to the walls and just kept partying away while the place burned

1068
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,600
down around them.

1069
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,520
It was like a vision of hell itself.

1070
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:22,020
But people just kept paying money, walking in, swigging drinks at the bar, their clothes

1071
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:22,940
on fire.

1072
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,780
They just laughing it up.

1073
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,480
It was as if they didn't feel any of it.

1074
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,500
It was kind of a cult.

1075
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,620
And in the end, they were all dead.

1076
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:32,620


1077
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,340
I was a pre-molecular externa.

1078
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,460
I stood outside, watched the place burn to the ground.

1079
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,380
And it was like they all acted like this was something they did every night.

1080
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,320
So, you got me.

1081
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,520
Don't ask me.

1082
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,940
I don't know nothing about it.

1083
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,600
I'd just as soon stay here working at the quick shop for a buck 280 an hour.

1084
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:02,620


1085
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:02,620


1086
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:02,620


1087
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,240
I ain't gonna send my money to that preacher.

1088
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,940
That's just what he wants me to do.

1089
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:17,720
I'm supposed to believe in some kind of deliverance by alien space fellers.

1090
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:24,500
And if I believe on Bob, then I'm gonna get to ride them escape flying saucers.

1091
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,300
And I just, I don't buy into that.

1092
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,060
Some of my friends, some of my friends are believers.

1093
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,620
A psychic virus has been discovered.

1094
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:32,620


1095
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:32,620


1096
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:32,620


1097
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:32,620


1098
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,000
Some of my friends are believers.

1099
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,160
I'm not trying to put them down.

1100
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,760
But I ain't gonna give away all my worldly goods.

1101
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,500
I've already been through.

1102
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,460
I had religion once.

1103
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,280
I was in the Jehovah's Witnesses.

1104
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,720
Had me give my Cadillac away.

1105
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,680
And the world was supposed to end on April 23rd.

1106
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,560
We all sat around the hilltop waiting for the end of the world.

1107
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,080
After a while, we got bored waiting, wandered off.

1108
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,600
So, I got up.

1109
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,780
I ain't gonna fall for none of that stuff this time.

1110
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,880
But you know what I heard that was really sad?

1111
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,220
I saw on this newspaper it said the Loch Ness Monster was dead.

1112
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,240
I seen it right on the cover of that newspaper.

1113
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,340
It was so sad.

1114
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:26,020
It looked like a giant prairie squid or a big oyster with flippers on it and a cute

1115
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,100
little otter's head.

1116
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,400
And she was, did you know it said in there?

1117
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,340
She was over.

1118
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,460
Over a thousand years old.

1119
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:38,820
And left a little tiny baby Loch Ness Monster homeless.

1120
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,600
Friends, you don't want to let that little baby Loch Ness Monster go hungry, do you?

1121
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,560
No, for in her belly are thousands of spider eggs.

1122
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:57,600
Well, here in the Church of the Subgenius, we offer special food and toys and modeling

1123
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,840
clay and clothing to those slackless children.

1124
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,240
You know.

1125
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:02,680
I'm sure you've seen the pictures of the kids in the toilets.

1126
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,240
Those kids that you see the pictures of on milk cartons, they're not lost, friends.

1127
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,320
They've just found Bob.

1128
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,680
They are frolicking with the baby Loch Ness Monster now in a special swimming pool at

1129
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,680
the home for slackless children in Malaysia.

1130
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,340
Oh, there is no secret Neptune agenda.

1131
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,900
Loch Ness is, Nessie's dead.

1132
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,380
It was all a big hoax.

1133
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,680
Well, we'd prefer not to go into too much detail.

1134
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,780
At this time about the origins.

1135
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,400
Since our own research is not complete.

1136
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:45,280
But the Church of the Subgenius does seem to have a direct connection with the program

1137
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,520
known among conspiracy nuts as the Neptune agenda.

1138
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,620
And in fact.

1139
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:51,980
The Neptune agenda.

1140
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,260
Yes, the Neptune agenda.

1141
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,680
Which we can trace the beginnings back to the discovery of sonar in 1915.

1142
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,660
It's a watery fishy thing.

1143
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:01,660


1144
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:01,660


1145
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,160
The theory of philosophy and conspiracy.

1146
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:09,880
Well, it seems that after the first use of sonar to detect German U-boats in the North

1147
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:15,600
Atlantic, unusual and cryptic Morse code messages began to be received by listeners in many

1148
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,380
different areas.

1149
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:21,320
A separate code of a logarithmic nature was created to communicate with what turned out

1150
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,300
to be aquatic mammals.

1151
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,180
I probably shouldn't elaborate further here because some of the things I've picked up

1152
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,660
about this seem very new and unusual.

1153
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:31,660


1154
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:31,940
I'm not sure if you've heard of the U-A-G.

1155
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,840
Yes, he is.

1156
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,600
It's stupid.

1157
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:41,800
Having to do with ley lines and a global network of crystal skulls used as mind control transmitters

1158
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,760
to direct the actions of technologically advanced or left-brained humans.

1159
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,940
I can hear the teller occurrence.

1160
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,960
This is the way I navigate.

1161
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,900
I move my body close to the earth.

1162
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,160
The teller occurrence.

1163
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,300
It was on the inside of my ears.

1164
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,500
Sonar.

1165
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,480
It's full.

1166
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,160
Sonar.

1167
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,640
It's full.

1168
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:01,640


1169
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:01,640


1170
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:01,640


1171
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:01,640


1172
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:07,980
You can hear the whales of the briny deep moan out their love songs.

1173
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,660
Lonesome cowboy Dave up there on the prairie could hear them whales all the way out in

1174
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:20,180
the ocean and he knew he wasn't going to be lonesome for long.

1175
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:30,200
He'd heard from old Bob what fun a giant cetacean seagoing mammal could be.

1176
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,640
Oh yeah.

1177
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:36,240
They're not that different from human beings really the way their bodies are set up.

1178
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,120
They're warm blooded.

1179
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,180
Warm blooded.

1180
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:38,360
Mmm.

1181
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:47,760
When you're in the freezing frigid Atlantic Ocean and you got you a kind of romantically

1182
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:56,420
inclined she whale and you're a particular lonely cowboy preacher with a guitar.

1183
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,640
You smell that ambergris floating on the sea shore.

1184
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:01,640


1185
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:01,640


1186
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,700
Oh yeah.

1187
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,520
Oh yeah.

1188
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:12,720
You'll drop your sheep and your horses and just shuck your chaps and go swimming right

1189
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,340
out there.

1190
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,660
Oh yeah.

1191
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:19,120
Lonesome cowboy Dave riding them dolphins all the way out to meet his queen.

1192
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,560
The great blue whale in the center of the North Atlantic.

1193
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,120
Yes.

1194
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,320
Dave Tristand.

1195
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,540
Just as had his mentor Bob.

1196
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:42,620
But unfortunately whereas Bob was man enough to handle a female blue whale Dave got tangled

1197
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:51,860
in the harpoon ropes and was last seen with his wooden leg a flopping as she sounded one

1198
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,780
last time.

1199
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:59,380
From the blue depths of David Jones Lager we've got a thousand pretty stories of Neptune.

1200
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,300
Nothing but the blue.

1201
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:00,300


1202
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:00,300


1203
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:00,300


1204
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:00,300


1205
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,700
Yep.

1206
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:08,780
Dave's back down there underground underwater underneath the great web.

1207
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,140
I can't breathe.

1208
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,200
I feel like I'm suffocating.

1209
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,180
This is not as fun as it was before.

1210
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,820
I'm just going to relax this spandex bit.

1211
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:27,420
He was deep deep inside the blowhole of the she whale.

1212
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,280
He thought he was going to be having some kind of a good time.

1213
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:30,280


1214
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:30,280


1215
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,620
He was kind of a big hot date that night and here he was stuck halfway in the blowhole

1216
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,620
halfway out.

1217
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:41,000
She couldn't spout and that's about all he could do.

1218
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,580
Oh baby Leviathan be thy name.

1219
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,620
I got a wooden leg.

1220
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,080
He was.

1221
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:56,480
But they later got over their marital differences and Dave took up residence inside Mrs. Monstro.

1222
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,120
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1223
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,260
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1224
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:00,260


1225
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:00,260


1226
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:00,260


1227
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,340
I'll take all the garbage.

1228
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,560
I will take all the garbage.

1229
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,760
I'm going to take all the garbage.

1230
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,360
I'm in the garbage.

1231
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,660
All he had to do was occasionally empty the garbage out of Mrs. Monstro.

1232
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:21,900
He'd scrape up the old license plates and tin cans and used syringes and so forth that

1233
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,360
washed into her stomach that managed to get through the baleen's.

1234
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,580
He'd have to empty that stuff out now and then.

1235
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,260
He was like a baby.

1236
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,860
He was like a parasitic life form inhabiting the body of the she-whale.

1237
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,260
Little manage here, little manage there, little harpoon cleaning here, little oh it's

1238
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:40,840
so shiny.

1239
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:51,660
Their only natural enemy was Eskimos and Norwegians who had broken, and Japanese whaling

1240
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:56,320
boats who had broken the international laws against such things.

1241
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,240
Dave was, Dave of the West.

1242
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,680
He led the whales.

1243
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,940
I'll learn this baby's song and then I'll record it and make a million dollars.

1244
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:12,220
And Dave thought he was going to be a big rock and roll star with Cetacean Whalesong

1245
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:12,660
Rock.

1246
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,600
See now, these songs last about a year and a half.

1247
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,300
It takes about two years to compose them.

1248
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,460
I figure if I just shrink it down on a data bank and I'll take a whale all the way down

1249
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:25,740
to like, say, three vibrations for every 25 seconds or something I can have a perfect

1250
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,100
three minute pop rock song.

1251
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,900
Whale of a whale of a whale of a whale of a whale.

1252
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:29,900


1253
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:38,260
But unfortunately, the new age composer, Yanni, beat him to it and made all the big money.

1254
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:48,460
Dave and his wife, the female blue whale, Mrs. Monstro, were left in the gutter singing bad country western songs

1255
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:57,680
hoping for spare change from the citizenry and tourists who would walk down the boardwalk there.

1256
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:06,620
A bleak ending for a man who'd never learn to live his life and let it be that way.

1257
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,460
Lost from the whale like that, a man like that, there's something wrong with him.

1258
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:21,660
Well, no, actually, like I said, the whale is not like it's a different order of animals.

1259
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:26,580
They're mammals. They're not that different from a person.

1260
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,880
They have a vestigial sort of height.

1261
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,640
They have a fine leg and rather a longer tail than people do.

1262
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:39,840
But, you know, they breathe air. They cry tears. They weep tears just like you or I.

1263
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,440
Well, like you, anyway.

1264
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,300
And they don't seem to be able to take very good care of their fingernails.

1265
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,120
Why is that?

1266
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:56,040
This fungal growth seems to have traveled all the way to the base of the spine.

1267
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,360
And this basal area here is completely covered.

1268
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,240
Fungus.
