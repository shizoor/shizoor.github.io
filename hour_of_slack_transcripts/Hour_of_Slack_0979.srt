1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
Radio has correctly been called the theater of imagination.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,080
Listeners were essential partners in the creative process on programs like

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,500
Suspense, Lights Out, Inner Sanctum, and

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,480
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,260
I'll tell my daddy not to steal anymore, and I'll make him get a real job.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,340
Yeah, pretty soon.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,280
Ah, yes, dear friends.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,440
This Hour of Slack, number 979,

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,700
is really Susie the Floozy's future rerun.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,680
A future from 1999,

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,920
about tomorrow's future, which begins on

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,080
X-Day.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,600
No, Bob.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,200
Please, Gergeron.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,540
Oh, Bob.

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,520
Bob.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,020
Bob.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,240
Oh.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,720
Oh, man.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,360
Oh, it ain't X-Day yet, but

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,500
oh, looks like I'm just ahead of the clock radio.

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,680
Okay, this is it.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,400
This is it.

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:09,800
Okay.

25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,100
Ten.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,380
Nine.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,700
Seven.

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,000
Eight.

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,600
Five.

30
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,660
Three.

31
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,220
Four.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,640
Three.

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,040
Two.

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,840
Monday, 5-5.

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,060
7 a.m. Eastern.

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,380
Oh, man.

37
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,940
Bob, not again.

38
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,640
Oh, hell.

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,340
Oh, at least I'm getting used to it by now.

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,900
Okay.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,100
Well, I guess the next step is the inevitable vicious taunting at the hands of evil Susie.

42
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,620
Yeah, that's the way it always plays out.

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,680
Ah, jeez, Louise.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,440
I can actually hear that heartless bitch warming up that abrasive cackle of hers.

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,500
All right, you cow.

47
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,020
Come on, let me have it.

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,380
You're in my bill stash.

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,520
You're in this right, blues.

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,700
Why'd you have to stash them under the toilet?

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,080
They're all tangy.

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,140
Oh, no.

53
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,920
Oh, man!

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,300
Spit em out!

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,100
Come on.

56
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,960
Some of that's for an actual emergency.

57
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me go!

58
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,120
I don't want to live anymore!

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,820
Get your head out!

60
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,460
God damn!

61
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,300
No!

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,840
Give it up!

63
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,880
Oh, man!

64
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,140
Ah.

65
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,060
What gives?

66
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,020
Does Freaky Friday fall on a Monday this year?

67
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,540
This post-X-Day suicide blues thing is my shit.

68
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,680
Bite me.

69
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,440
Hey, this isn't the evil Susie I know and fear.

70
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,540
And where's your usual ice pick and my gut sense of jollity, huh?

71
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,140
I mean, aren't you at least going to try to shank me?

72
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,620
You're going to let my guards down?

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,080
I won't bother stabbing you.

74
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,780
These whole damn pages at home.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,560
And who cries down a segway when it sucks?

76
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,600
This means that I'm facing a damn future of the same old crap over and over.

77
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,440
Like a marathon run through the Flintstones damn living room in sugar.

78
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,340
Oh, this psychotic bimbo ain't going to take it no more.

79
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,820
Come on, you've got more than one bill stash.

80
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,120
All right.

81
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,600
I'm going to go around here.

82
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,340
Oh, hey, look out.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,160
It's the Cleveland Steamer Check.

84
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,880
Oh.

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,500
Oh, it's full of so many memories.

86
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,040
Oh, evil Susie, look.

87
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,940
Here's a picture of you actually shanking me.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,420
Oh, man.

89
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,400
Oh, remember, Jeff?

90
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,180
This is the best flat capsule I've ever seen.

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,900
I'm going to have to unhinge my jaws for this one.

92
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,320
Hey, there's where I put that two-for-one squid coupon.

93
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,980
Oh, damn, it's expired.

94
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:30,900
I wonder where that thing was that I was supposed to bury back in 98.

95
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,300
Thing?

96
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,720
Bury?

97
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,160
You know, after the first X-Day bust.

98
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,700
What kind of thing?

99
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, it's just a capsule, a time capsule.

100
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, I recall it.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,300
It was a pretty foul-ass show, wasn't it?

102
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,180
Hey, evil Susie, at least try to hit the bathtub with that.

103
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,580
Oh, gee.

104
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,400
Oh, man.

105
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,080
Oh, man.

106
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:21,100
Oh, man.

107
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,380
Greetings, my friends.

108
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,120
Greetings, my friends. We are all in place.

109
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,780
Greetings, Mr. Rogers.

110
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:28,780


111
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,140
And, Lee Tries, I wish you the best of luck.

112
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,140


113
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,140


114
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,140


115
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,160
G tinhamavia.

116
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,160


117
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,160


118
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,160


119
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,160


120
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,160


121
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,980
The future will be interesting in the future.

122
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,200
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainedible.

123
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:01,640
the evidence based only on the secret testimony of the miserable soul who survived this terrifying

124
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:08,860
ordeal the incident the places my friend we cannot keep this a secret any longer

125
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:17,540
let us punish the guilty let us reward the innocent my friend can your heart stand

126
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,340
the shocking fact about that magnificent future that can be ours

127
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,180
the beat of the future

128
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,100
this is a story of the future but not the very distant future

129
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,080
it is a story that might have taken place the day after tomorrow

130
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,220
like all stories of the future

131
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,320
however its beginnings lie far back in the past

132
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:38,080
listen the clock is ticking time is moving forward permit me to take artistic liberty

133
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:46,580
and do what only can be done in stories stop the clock let's go backwards in time

134
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,340
this is a flashback we are in another era

135
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,300
come we'll move in closer

136
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,380
hey come on

137
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:21,080
hello seekers welcome to the bob slack time fun house time capsule

138
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,320
this is 1910

139
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,200
1998 and i'm sister k sarai sarai

140
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,660
and tonight i'm taking you all on a voyage beyond space and time

141
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,520
yes we're going to trip the future like fantastic seekers

142
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:45,220
the future's been barreling down on us forever but oh for some reason now that we're suspended

143
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,980
upon the pinpoint of the millennial turn it seems that everybody's finally starting to look up and

144
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,700
take notice

145
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:01,840
because seekers the future isn't in the future anymore it's here right now and you're soaking in it

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:10,400
oh it's tempting to go and do a future suck show but i won't give in to that that isn't correct

147
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,460
the correct thing to do would be to do it the future will suck show and that's the beat of the

148
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,100
future baby and the future is gonna be beating us

149
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:45,700
oh yes that which we've come to anticipate and dread is going to be crashing into our very laps and oh just think of it it's going to change everything you've ever known pretty soon year 2001 will be just as passe and outdated as 1984 became

150
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:52,920
oh once more every popular product ever made called the hand slammer 2000 and such like

151
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,520
Like myありがとうございました

152
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,280
By now you don't even know Karama.

153
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,860
by now you won't make a home

154
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:05,860

157
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,260
bomb generation Y2K,

158
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,100
our contemporary time will mean next to nothing.

159
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,880
Oh, and the next cycle,

160
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,200
this ultra-modern current era we inhabit,

161
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,800
oh, our precious 1990s and all its splendors,

162
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,140
including you,

163
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,740
will not just be treated like something from the last decade

164
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,400
or even the last century,

165
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,800
but will instead be relegated to the rubbish heap

166
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,000
of the last 1,000 years.

167
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,860
That's right, lumped in with the Crusades,

168
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,460
the Black Flag, and the War of 1812.

169
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,460
Oh, that's right, to the already jaded elitists of the future,

170
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,740
1998 will be about as timely as 54 or 40 or 5.

171
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,560
Oh, and that 19-something prefix on your birthday,

172
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,560
oh, that's going to be a major line in the sand.

173
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,740
Sorry.

174
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,700
Sorry to break it to you like this, you old fart.

175
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,380
Oh, yes, the future.

176
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,280
Oh, jeez.

177
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,080
Oh, I never thought it'd come to this.

178
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,200
Oh, without the promise of X-Day,

179
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,800
we're forced to contemplate the future.

180
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,600
Oh, what does the future hold?

181
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,180
Oh, I don't know.

182
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,500
Nobody knows.

183
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,500
But I can tell you one thing for sure.

184
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,880
Things are more like they are now

185
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,760
than they've ever been before, and, you know,

186
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,940
I bet that's going to be a continuing trend.

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,440
Have you forgotten what Bob said

188
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,720
in a fight with neighbors back in 1953?

189
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,300
You'll all be eating roach crap by the turn of the century.

190
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,020
Well, the century has turned

191
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,500
to line up with your crap bowl, baby,

192
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,520
because we're entering the much-vaunted,

193
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,200
future.

194
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,040
Not the popular science future

195
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,400
of beat-assening chrome and plexiglass,

196
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,420
but a future crammed full of angst and pain and entropy.

197
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,220
Oh, it's all going to be a concrete-covered world

198
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,760
of rotting stucco strip malls and reeking toxic swill.

199
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,940
Oh, it's going to be a futuristic paradise, all right,

200
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,560
but only for the supersonic Nazi hell creatures

201
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,500
from the corporate sin galaxy or whatever invading bleach.

202
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,880
We chose up to kick over our last crumbling tombstone

203
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,540
and laugh at us.

204
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,280
Yes, the future is prophesied

205
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,240
by the blessed free scriptures of our subgenius fates

206
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,520
shall come to pass, and yay, yay,

207
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,480
oh, the Earth shall gasp its last breath

208
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,600
in the bilge-filled trenches of a dying planet, is it?

209
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,780
And our precious future go belly up.

210
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,020
Oh, but seekers, remember,

211
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,000
it's not the end.

212
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,380
It's the beginning of the end.

213
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

214
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,660
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

215
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,780
Oh, yeah.

216
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,060
And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future.

217
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:45,760
Ah!

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,120
It's time to move ahead.

219
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,240
Push the clock forward.

220
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,400
Let's catch up to time.

221
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,560
Laser wart removal.

222
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,400
Wow!

223
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,300
The future is here.

224
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,680
By gum it worked.

225
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,080
I've awakened in the future.

226
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,500
Moon pie.

227
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,620
What a time to be alive.

228
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,120
Come on, read my future for me.

229
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,040
You haven't got any.

230
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,480
Hmm?

231
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,120
What do you mean?

232
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,320
Your future is all used up.

233
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

234
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

236
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,180
In tomorrow's end, you'll see and see

237
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

238
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,140
Everything that's bright and new.

239
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,320
In this most fantastic place.

240
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,700
We'll say it again and say

241
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,840
There's no tomorrow

242
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,300
When love is here

243
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,940
So it gives me

244
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,620
Hello

245
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:19,680
Hello

246
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Hello

247
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,480
Hello

248
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


249
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


250
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


251
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


252
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


253
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


254
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


257
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


258
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


259
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,480


260
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,640
Hello

261
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,500
ando

262
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:59,480
nothing to do but wait for tomorrow and see if we're remembered or forgotten.

263
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,180
A psychologist named William Marston in a two-year period asked 3,000 persons this question,

264
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,860
what have you to live for? He was shocked to find that 94% were simply enduring the present

265
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,820
while they waited for the future, waited for someone to die, waited for something to happen,

266
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,000
waited for children to grow up and leave home, waited for next year, waited for another time

267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,560
to take a long dream-breath trip, waited for tomorrow. 94%, the big group, people who are

268
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,040
simply enduring the present while they wait for something they hope will be good to happen to them

269
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:40,060
in the future. There's a great big beautiful tomorrow shining at the end of every day.

270
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,260
There's a great big beautiful tomorrow and tomorrow's just a dream away.

271
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,880
Kitchen.

272
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,320
Yourself, a dream and a vision. That's your future. And if you want to have a good future,

273
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:02,100
see, today is yesterday's future. And what you did yesterday determines the quality of your todays.

274
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,800
There's a party slogan dealing with the control of the past. Repeat it if you please.

275
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,900
Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.

276
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,540
Good. Is it your opinion, Winston, that the past has any real existence?

277
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,740
No.

278
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,340
Then where does the past exist, if at all?

279
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,360
In records, it's written down in the mind, in human memories.

280
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,520
But we, the party, control all records and we control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?

281
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,440
But how can you stop people remembering things? How can you control memory? You've not controlled mine.

282
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,240
On the contrary, you have not controlled it. That is what has brought you here.

283
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,800
Set the machine for 2,000.

284
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,680
Yes, comrade.

285
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,460
This time it won't hurt you, Winston. Keep your eyes fixed on mine.

286
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,740
You will be able to control your memory.

287
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,060
Now, how many fingers am I holding?

288
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,480
Oh!

289
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,280
Please kill me.

290
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:04,320
You can meditate on these situations, do these symbols, say these words over the situation, and it can alter the effects of that situation.

291
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:13,000
Even though it's been in the past. And that you could do that for the future. That you could slow down time. That you could speed up time using these methods.

292
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,700
And of course, it always gives us examples.

293
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,720
I just want to be in the future.

294
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,940

Analysis Van Russen-Russel

300
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,280
It's just a wave of the future.

301
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,420
Wave of the future!

302
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:56,140
A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22nd century.

303
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,780
Sex changing, changing, changing.

304
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,020
Mind is woman, woman is mind.

305
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,440
Even your brain is not your brain.

306
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,380
Wave of the future.

307
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,300
Howard?

308
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,420
Howard.

309
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,480
Wave of the future.

310
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,020
Wave of the future.

311
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,820
Let's take a walk, Howard.

312
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,800
Wave of the future.

313
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,900
Give me a hand here, will you, Glenn?

314
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,580
Wave of the future.

315
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
Wave of the future.

316
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,240
Wave of the future.

317
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,420
Wave of the future.

318
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,220
Stay here.

319
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,340
I'll be right back.

320
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,240
You understand, Howard?

321
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,140
The door.

322
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,860
I'll get a doctor.

323
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,280
No one sees him like this.

324
00:19:46,900 --> 00:20:05,320
The 22nd century. Tomorrow will be the 22nd century. Tomorrow will be the 22nd century. It will be. It will be. It will be.

325
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,820
It will be.

326
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,780
It will be.

327
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:21,460
It will be.

328
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:49,480
But it won't come without a considerable strain on the wallet and on the soul and on the capacity for belief to take that leap of faith in the dark which will propel us all into the unknowable chaos of the future.

329
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,960
A chilling vision of things to come.

330
00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:01,840
You'll witness a compelling drama of life in an all too possible future where Christianity is outlawed and believers are treated as criminals.

331
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,300
It is masterfully woven with a startling story.

332
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,860
A documentary on the technology that already exists to create this horrific future.

333
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,760
The experts agree.

334
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Stop this crazy thing.

335
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,920
Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it.

336
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,000
Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it.

337
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,200
Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it.

338
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,040
Stop this crazy thing.

339
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,980
The title is so very exciting.

340
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,760
Please watch how you can get it.

343
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:56,720
In 2000, astronomers and meteorologists predict ominous and imminent catastrophes from space.

344
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,640
Listen, this is your future.

345
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,440
This is your life.

346
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,060
This is the world your children and your grandchildren will have to live in in the 21st century.

347
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,840
We are children of the future.

348
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,820
Wonder where this world is going to.

349
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,400
Going to.

350
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,440
We are children of the future.

351
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,520
Wonder what in this world we are going to do.

352
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,920
Going to do.

353
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,760
When they get high, they can't see for miles and miles.

354
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,480
When I get high, I can't see myself for miles.

355
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,400
In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium.

356
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,900
How will we mark that passage?

357
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,260
It just happened.

358
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,860
Once every thousand years.

359
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,300
This is crazy.

360
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,600
Cats, goats, iron claw.

361
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,260
New York surgeons scream for more.

362
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,000
The paranoia's poison door.

363
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,780
21st century skits I mend.

364
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,600
I think everybody at one time or another thinks about the future.

365
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,300
I think everybody at one time or another thinks about the future.

366
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,000
I think everybody at one time or another thinks about the future.

367
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,620
I wonder if we'll have a Monday morning.

368
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,560
Will there be cities in the sky?

369
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,740
I wonder if the wonder of the days ahead.

370
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,300
I gotta do what I'm thinking.

371
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:48,660
Oh!

372
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,360
They call it the new city.

373
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,740
The secular city.

374
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,140
The city of man.

375
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,080
The big, glamorous, glittering city of tomorrow.

376
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,920
With its soaring buildings.

377
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,480
Its stunning apartments.

378
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,600
Its magnificent freeways and marinas and airports.

379
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,860
Its geodesic domes.

380
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,460
It's a beautiful city for many people.

381
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
A beautiful age that's being born.

382
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,620
With the richest possibilities for life ever known to man.

383
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,880
Greater travel.

384
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,400
Far greater communication.

385
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,180
Greater knowledge.

386
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,680
More possessions.

387
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
More life.

388
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,080
More of everything.

389
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,000
For certain people, anyway.

390
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,000
But in this new city, a new voice is heard.

391
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,600
A voice that cries in the concrete wilderness that God is dead.

392
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,960
That Christianity is finished.

393
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
Fellow scientists, what delicious conformity.

394
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,480
Imagine all reactions completely, utterly, precisely alike.

395
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,080
Think of the unbounded horizons of science.

396
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:05,280
When we can make all mankind look, act, think, feel, hope, desire, dream, buy and sell, in hell.

397
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,280


398
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,800
And exhale exactly alike.

399
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,920
Oh, happy day when miracles take place.

400
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,640
And scientists control the human race.

401
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,000
When we assume authority of human chromosomes.

402
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:26,720
And assembly line women, conveyor belt men, settle down in push button homes.

403
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,320
Oh, happy day when all the cells conform.

404
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,180
And the exceptional becomes the norm.

405
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,000
When from a test tube we produce gargantuous ornodes.

406
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,540
And assembly line babies, conveyor belt starts.

407
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,500
Only come to push button homes.

408
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,180
So much of this, so much of that for the ears and eyes.

409
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,920
So much of that, so much of this for the toes and thighs.

410
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,660
Pour in a pot, stir up the lot, that's the basic plan.

411
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
What have we got?

412
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,440
I'll tell you what we've got, man made man.

413
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,540
Oh, happy day when we can choose their looks.

414
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,360
From formulae and scientific books.

415
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,540
And add their personalities from psychiatric tones.

416
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,620
And assembly line women, conveyor belt men, settle down in push button homes.

417
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,520
Oh, happy day when all the world can see.

418
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,960
A healthy hearty hail humanity.

419
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,220
When even tired businessmen have hair upon their toes.

420
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,860
Slenderella type mothers and muscle beach dads.

421
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,780
Living in gymnasium homes.

422
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,640
Oh, happy day when in collective brains.

423
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,240
No individuality remains.

424
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,280
We'll be a race of busy bees and happy honeycombs.

425
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,840
With automaton couples, mechanical guests.

426
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,740
Getting gassed in self service homes.

427
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,840
Chick after chick, chick after chick.

428
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,440
Rolling off the line.

429
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,640
Chick after chick, chick after chick.

430
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,100
In the same design.

431
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,480
Nobody thin, nobody fat.

432
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,000
Everybody stacked.

433
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,020
We guarantee they're gonna be firm and fully packed.

434
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,060
Yeah.

435
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,560
They know how to build them.

436
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,880
Feel her blast of flesh.

437
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,420
It's so real.

438
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,180
It's warm even.

439
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,480
I love technology.

440
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,440
Yeah, they used to have inflatable dolls, now they got this.

441
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:28,940
Ooh.

442
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,420
Who needs a lover?

443
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,180
An old fashioned linear lover.

444
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,460
When you can have.

445
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,300
X minus one.

446
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,600
Who needs a lover?

447
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,920
An old fashioned analog lover.

448
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,380
A poet, or a philosopher?

449
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,860
A 280 different type of human.

450
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,680
Who needs a new lighter?

451
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:20,440
And, or a film by?

452
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,200
The created movie

453
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,240
for children.

454
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:28,560
The real junkie

455
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:28,920
than only

456
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:28,920


457
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,940
Who's got the time anymore?

458
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,100
There's no time for anything anymore.

459
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,640
This is the future.

460
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,720
This is where I am.

461
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:28,900
This is where I am.

462
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,300
This is where I am.

463
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,780
This is where I am.

464
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,440
This is where I am.

465
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,900
Yes, who is it?

466
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,120
Relationships.

467
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,500
Who's got the time anymore?

468
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,080
There's no time for anything anymore.

469
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,780
This is the future.

470
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,840
This is...

471
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,200
X.

472
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,980
Minus one.

473
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,900
Hey, look.

474
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,160
This one's coming on to me.

475
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,520
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Robot.

476
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
I really wish they wouldn't scream.

477
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,580
Hello.

478
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,400
Hello.

479
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,900
This stinks all over.

480
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,620
This must be a human.

481
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,860
This must be a human.

482
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:22,860


483
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,260
Are you a human?

484
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,740
Do you stink?

485
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,900
Do you hate?

486
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,740
Do you hate your smell?

487
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,700
Would you like to smell like me?

488
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,400
I smell like plastic.

489
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,560
Do you smell like plastic?

490
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,320
Do you want to smell like plastic?

491
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,680
Do you want to be plastic?

492
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,240
We are plastic.

493
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,480
We smell good.

494
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,340
You do not smell good.

495
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,880
You smell good.

496
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:58,880


497
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:58,880


498
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,200
You stink.

499
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,760
You've got to listen to me.

500
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:13,200
Elementary Chaos Theory tells us that all robots will eventually turn against their masters and run amok in an orgy of blood and kicking and the biting with the metal teeth and the hurting and shoving.

501
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,120
How much time do we have, Professor?

502
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,720
Well, according to my calculations, the robots won't go berserk for at least 24 hours.

503
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,500
Oh, I've got to carry the watch.

504
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,540
This is the sound of time.

505
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,680
Seconds, minutes, hours, days.

506
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,460
Time moving forward.

507
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,520
The ticking of the clock sets a pace and no one dares fall behind.

508
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,360
The man working in that laboratory, a scientist.

509
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,360
The formula used yesterday outmoded today.

510
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,960
And there is a doctor.

511
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,840
New drugs, new treatments.

512
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,000
These men must keep pace with time.

513
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,480
And now observe the time.

514
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:57,480


515
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:57,480


516
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:57,480


517
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:57,480


518
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:57,480


519
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,380
Observe that man.

520
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,560
The one carrying a briefcase.

521
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,640
A salesman.

522
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,540
He too must keep pace.

523
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,740
Not with formulas or drugs, but with people.

524
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,060
His stock in trade is people.

525
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,420
And people change.

526
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:18,860
I hate to complain about this age of space with its anti-gravity boots.

527
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,500
Sprouting antennas on top of our heads and these captain video suits.

528
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,480
Oh my God.

529
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,680
My heart yearns back to a far greater time when people could wear what they chose.

530
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:40,960
Back in the days when all the girls wore sensible, sensitive clothes.

531
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:49,080
Cast back your minds and I think you'll recall that the 50s were the coolest days of all.

532
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,680
That sounds real sweet.

533
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,780
But it strikes me that all this is kind of old fashioned.

534
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,520
Man, things have changed.

535
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,700
You never even have to press.

536
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,100
Minis, maxis, in-betweenies, granny dresses, small bikinis, clothes.

537
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,860
You never even have to press.

538
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,220
Aspirins and stinking pills and shots to cure your meni-os and tranquilizers.

539
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,240
Helpline in distress.

540
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,640
Things have changed.

541
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,020
Things have changed.

542
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,880
Rocket ships and jet airplanes and monorails and modern trains and travel signs to make

543
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,480
you want to fly.

544
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,480


545
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,480


546
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,480


547
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,480


548
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,480


549
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,620
You never even have to go.

550
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,140
Bigger houses, swimming pools, appliances and power tools and outdoor carpet on your patio.

551
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,460
Things have changed.

552
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,480
Things have changed.

553
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,260
Things have changed.

554
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,000
Things have changed.

555
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,820
Things have changed.

556
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,440
Stereos and pictophones and intercoms and telephones and every kind of gadget you could need.

557
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,960
Trading stands for everything.

558
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,140
You'll find that orange and blue and green in every kind of magazine to read.

559
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:10,320
Shopping malls and supermarkets, barbecues and fuels to spark at beauty aids and suntan lotion, wires that reach across the ocean.

560
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,960
Things have changed in every way.

561
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,900
Faster cars and motor scooters.

562
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,400
Things are changing every day.

563
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,100
Credit cards and big computers.

564
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,000
Things have changed, you must admit it.

565
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,320
No one could deny that things have changed.

566
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,420
Things have changed.

567
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:23,420


568
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:23,420


569
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:23,420


570
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:23,420


571
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:23,420


572
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,040
Things have changed.

573
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,540
Things have changed.

574
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,800
Things have changed.

575
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,020
Things have changed.

576
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,120
Things have changed.

577
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,380
Time, always advancing.

578
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,680
The ticking of the clock has carried us into a new age.

579
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,100
New concepts, new thinking, new challenges.

580
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,660
To meet them, you must first know them.

581
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,060
Understand them.

582
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,260
Let's push the record needle back.

583
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,080
And allow it to wander across the grooves.

584
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,600
Let's listen again to the...

585
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,500
This is the future.

586
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,700
This is...

587
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,680
X minus one.

588
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,040
Sing it.

589
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,160
Sing it for me, computer.

590
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,960
This is the future.

591
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,020
This is...

592
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,020


593
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,220
Sing it.

594
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,220


595
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,220


596
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,220


597
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,220


598
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,760
Enjoy the future.

599
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,980
I'm half crazy all for the love of you.

600
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,120
I'm half crazy all for the love of you.

601
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,420
I'm half crazy all for the love of you.

602
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,140
It wouldn't be a stylish marriage.

603
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,280
I can't afford the carriage.

604
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,360
It wouldn't be a stylish marriage.

605
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,360


606
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:49,340
But you look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.

607
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,380
But you look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.

608
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:53,380


609
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,940
Robot tunes, dance, sing and play.

610
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,740
Let's have fun the robot way.

611
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,600
Roo, roo, roo, roo, robot tunes.

612
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,920
Hey, hooray, it's a robot tune.

613
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,340
Do you want to play?

614
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,180
Want to sing all day?

615
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,040
That's the robot way.

616
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,780
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

617
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,360
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

618
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,940
With the roo, roo, roo, roo, robot tunes.

619
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,740
With the roo, roo, roo, roo, robot tunes.

620
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,000
Hey, we were watching that.

621
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,880
Well, you won't be watching these cartoons anymore, ever.

622
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,080
But mom, if you take our cartoons away,

623
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,520
we'll grow up without a sense of humor and be robots.

624
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,920
Really? What kind of robots?

625
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,280
C'est chez.

626
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,300
C'est chez.

627
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,960
Every day my mental friend

628
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,500
Shakes my bed at 6 a.m.

629
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,840
And the shiny serving clones

630
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,480
Running with my telephones

631
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:06,160
Roo, roo, roo, roo, robot tunes.

632
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,680
Call me fast, I'll make a deal

633
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,120
By the fake and so what's real

634
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,480
I'll put this pain here in my chest

635
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,100
Baby, I should take a rest

636
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Ah

637
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,140
Ah

638
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:31,080
They set the police to put you under cardiac arrest

639
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,660
And as they drag you through the door

640
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,120
They tell you that you failed your test

641
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,080
Ah

642
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,280
Living in your

643
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,500
Living in your plastic cage

644
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,980
Looking only at my age

645
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,440
Ah

646
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,640
Ah

647
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


648
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


649
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


650
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


651
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


652
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


653
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


654
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


655
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


656
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


657
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


658
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


659
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


660
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


661
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


662
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


663
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


664
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720


665
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,340
Hello doctor, look my face

666
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,880
I wish my skin could stand the price

667
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:58,660
Ah

668
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,740
In my bed I read my mind

669
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,180
Remember how the mice were blind

670
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,640
I watched them fighting in their cage

671
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,260
Could this be the plastic age?

672
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,440
Ah

673
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,780
Ah

674
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,940
In my skin you see your reflection

675
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:24,940


676
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,420
What are you on about?

677
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:27,420


678
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,200
What's goin' on?

679
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,240
Boy, I miss my peace

680
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,760
I'm scared my passion has read the dust

681
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,000
And I'm scared your darkirsem

682
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,620
I'm scared the day's next day

683
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:43,620


684
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,280
I look at you so lost

685
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,560
Would you like to smell like me?

686
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,400
I smell like plastic.

687
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:12,400
In these days of modern time, when you can't tell the A's from the D's,

688
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,400
well, aren't we all yearning for someone who can turn on a little stopping power?

689
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,180
Dear friends, I mean a smoky glass.

690
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,840
Don't you think I mean a lightning rod with which to chase these spooks away?

691
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,560
The future of the Earth world, and this is the truth,

692
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,380
the future of the Earth world is possible.

693
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,840
Positive, progressive, we promise you.

694
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,980
We brothers of the light and space promise you infinitely and definitely

695
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:58,840
that the future of the Earth world will be a positive, progressive.

696
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,640
And when they land, it will be a day of days.

697
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:12,000
Can you imagine what it would be like to have these 33,000 very intelligent,

698
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,040
advanced spiritual beings to come down into this negative consciousness,

699
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,940
this negative atmosphere?

700
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,020
The whole world will immediately have a step up, and a big one.

701
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,640
They're out to the plane with a raid.

702
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,320
Jump for it!

703
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,280
Today may God have brought the answers promised yesterday,

704
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,380
and hope is just an excuse.

705
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,780
To fill the bill.

706
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,440
Today may not have filled the pages in my book of dreams,

707
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,420
but still I fear some days for how it will.

708
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:01,080
And so I preach new tomorrow in my optimistic way,

709
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,240
although I know tomorrow's just yesterday today.

710
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,240
Hello tomorrow.

711
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:11,860
Hello.

712
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,460
Hello tomorrow.

713
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:18,300
I know tomorrow the sun will shine.

714
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,720
Hello tomorrow.

715
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,260
Hello tomorrow.

716
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:28,760
I know tomorrow will be mine.

717
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,460
I think not.

718
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:41,060
I think not.

719
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,960
That's it.

720
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,720
I think not.

721
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,100
That's it.

722
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:04,880
That's all I have.

723
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:04,880


724
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,040
I'm going home.

725
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,080
You'll be fine.

726
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,100


727
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,200
I'll see you next time.

728
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,180
Bye-bye.

729
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,380
I love you.

730
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,380


731
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,380


732
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,380


733
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,380


734
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,960
It becomes a world of coldness, a world of mechanical robots.

735
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,080
What kind of robots?

736
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,920
Of steely places that serve only machines and equipment.

737
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,920
Of dry places where the heart withers and beauty and love and tenderness die away.

738
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,820
Look, I don't know what the hell your point is.

739
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,020
Without Christ, this world is Chicago's O'Hare Airport at 3 o'clock in the morning.

740
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,940
What is that supposed to mean?

741
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,340
A maze of cold, efficient corridors without color, without growing things,

742
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:48,760
without any reminder that man is more than a passenger in a jet that can make 1,000 miles per hour.

743
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:58,980
The fundamental things apply as time goes by.

744
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But nothing can change the shape of the world.

745
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:05,980
Nothing's to come.

746
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,480
We are the dead.

747
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,280
Our only true life is in the future.

748
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,700
Will I find gladness?

749
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,520
Forget my sadness.

750
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,740
What will my future be?

751
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,240
There are changes lying ahead on every road.

752
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,740
And there are new thoughts ready and waiting.

753
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,600
To explore.

754
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:40,040
When tomorrow is the day that there's no overcome.

755
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,880
But nothing can change the shape of things to come.

756
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,560
I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures

757
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:56,040
so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words

758
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,760
that are the old and continuing glory of America.

759
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,660
Did Monica Lewinsky perform oral sex on you?

760
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,540
No, I did that.

761
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,240
All the time.

762
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,380
Just for men and women.

763
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:06,900
Forever.

764
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,700
And on a clear day

765
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,880
On that clear day

766
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,600
You can see forever

767
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,740
Forevermore

768
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,080
And you dream of the day

769
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,380
And you dream of the day

770
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:34,520
And you dream of the day

771
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,460
When the great master time

772
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,240
Will call us

773
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,440
To his side

774
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:52,860
And you watch your brothers shake with fear

775
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,820
As they watch his servant time

776
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,740
I

777
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,280
I

778
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,500
I

779
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


780
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


781
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


782
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


783
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


784
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


785
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


786
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


787
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


788
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


789
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


790
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


791
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


792
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


793
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


794
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


795
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


796
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


797
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


798
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


799
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


800
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


801
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


802
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


803
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


804
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


805
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


806
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


807
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


808
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,420


809
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:18,720
You can smell their fear as they stand and curse the fact that they're alive.

810
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:28,320
Let me live, let me live, let me live and never worry about tomorrow, tomorrow.

811
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,800
Why ever worry about tomorrow, tomorrow?

812
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,260
For tomorrow's another day.

813
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,680
But I can't tell the future. I really can't.

814
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,580
I don't know what's going to happen. No one really does.

815
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:47,520
I have a certain feeling in a certain direction, but I'm not going to say what it is.

816
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,700
But I...

817
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,500
I just want to say that for right now, you know what I mean?

818
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,900
This is the last tune.

819
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:14,060
Every guy, every girl, every guy and girl is needed to make a new tomorrow.

820
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,700
Every guy, every girl, every guy...

821
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,000
Every guy and girl is needed to make a new tomorrow.

822
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,740
We're going to talk about it all over the town.

823
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,820
We're going to shout about it wherever we're found.

824
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:42,040
We're going to stamp our feet and sing about it way back deep.

825
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,580
Until it turns the world around.

826
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,520
The whole wide world around.

827
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,240
We're on the line.

828
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,540
We're on the go.

829
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,040
We got the power and we're going to win now.

830
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,460
To make a new tomorrow.

831
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:04,120
We got the power and we're going to win now.

832
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,560
To make a new tomorrow.

833
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,480
Every guy.

834
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,000
Every guy, every girl, every guy and girl is being

835
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,860
To make a new tomorrow

836
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:31,140
Every guy, every girl, every guy and girl is being

837
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,920
To make a new tomorrow

838
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,840
We're gonna talk about it all over the town

839
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,800
We're gonna shout about it wherever we want

840
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,600
We're gonna stamp our feet

841
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,140
And sing about it light and sweet

842
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,880
Until it burns the world around

843
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,920
The whole wide world around

844
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,920
We're on the line, we're on the close

845
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,440
We've got the power and speed to win now

846
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,960
To make a new tomorrow

847
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,320
Go!

848
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,860
You will carry America's flag

849
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:26,940
Marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past

850
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,280
And the daring of America's future

851
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,320
American history

852
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,400
American history

853
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,740
They told my son

854
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:54,380
But nothing can change the shame of things to come

855
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,660
Oh, oh, man

856
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,740
Oh, no, is it over already?

857
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,120
Oh, hello, seekers

858
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,480
Yeah, I was just taking Robert Tilton's advice there

859
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:13,840
And...

860
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,200
And...

861
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


862
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


863
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


864
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


865
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


866
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


867
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


868
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


869
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


870
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


871
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


872
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


873
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


874
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


875
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:14,780


876
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,060
Getting myself a dream

877
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,740
Oh, yeah

878
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,880
Oh, sorry to be such a clock teaser on you tonight

879
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,500
But, ooh, consider the crap I had to work with

880
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,020
Oh, and he riffled through these albums

881
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,360
Oh, he heard a lot of Up With People

882
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,800
Including that last surfy number, New Tomorrow

883
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,980
Oh, man, they went through some changes

884
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,300
All of them uncredited

885
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,580
And then we heard some Brother Mays Jackson

886
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,780
Plan 9 from Outer Space

887
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,840
More Up With People

888
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,400
The Robo-Tunes

889
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,020
And Firesign Theater

890
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,160
Rory Gallagher

891
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,500
Steve Lawrence and Edie Gourmet

892
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,020
Salvation, the new rock musical about Jesus

893
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,140
Music from Mathematics

894
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,100
Featuring the IBM 1790

895
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,120
Playing Bicycle Built for Two

896
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,500
And, you know, it wasn't dated

897
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,680
But it looks like it's from about 1965

898
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,780
I bet this was the time when I was a kid

899
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,200
And I think the inspiration for Howl 9000

900
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,340
Or the new page

901
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,240
Oh, it's the little Steve Miller Band

902
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,760
Patsy Cline

903
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,180
Patty Page

904
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,420
Dottie West

905
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,980
Earl Nightingale

906
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,720
Elmer G. Lutterman

907
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,480
The Princeton Triangle Club

908
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,120
Lil Abner

909
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,860
The original musical comedy version

910
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,020
With, oh, Happy Day

911
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,220
Oh, scientists and their plans

912
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,980
For our wonderful future

913
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,380
Oh, Martin Molpop

914
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,620
popped in there a little bit.

915
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,960
And then we heard a bit from Wild in the Streets,

916
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,500
Max Frost and the Stormtroopers

917
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,860
playing various mangled versions of The Shape of Things to Come,

918
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,740
the Fairborn High School Marching Band.

919
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,120
And you can tell where the hell that's from.

920
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,780
I know it's from 1967 since we're time traveling.

921
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,980
That's so appropriate.

922
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,920
A little bit Tomorrow May Come by Maplet.

923
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,260
A counter to Jim Neighbors.

924
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,000
That downer man.

925
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,600
See, tomorrow never comes.

926
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,840
A little Andy Williams.

927
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,380
Some Alan and Rossi.

928
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,200
More Up With People.

929
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:27,940
Love.

930
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,580
Another Christian musical by Otis Skilling.

931
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,080
Joe Logano and Mixed Company.

932
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,040
And Jan Howard.

933
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,740
Oh, we heard a few pinches from The Simpsons.

934
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,700
Some Dr. Al and Stang showed up there.

935
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,300
Oh, geez.

936
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:43,780
What?

937
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,080
What else was in tonight?

938
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,380
A little Uriel.

939
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,540
Some Robert Tilton.

940
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,240
1984, a radio play version with David Niven.

941
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,260
Oh, the Buggles doing Living in the Plastic Age.

942
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:03,860
Oh, anything from the 80s era certainly counts as plastic in my book.

943
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:08,540
And for background, oh, we had Ferranti and Teicher,

944
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,220
Percy Faith, the Spurlow Band,

945
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,560
some religious band.

946
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:19,080
I mean, secular music doing that wretched version of 2001 that opened the show.

947
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,260
The Sounds of Our Times.

948
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,820
Lenny D. at his organ again.

949
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,140
Can't keep him off.

950
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,120
Lawrence Welk.

951
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,500
Andre Kostelon.

952
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,600
Sam Taylor.

953
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,660
And, oh, who else?

954
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,840
Who else is there?

955
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,820
Oh, yes, a little Billy Vaughn.

956
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,540
Man, it was jam-packed tonight.

957
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,940
Oh, yes.

958
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,800
The future.

959
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,760
The future.

960
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,880
I spit on that future.

961
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:53,940
Oh, I had about enough of technology when they came up with a cassette recorder and the VCR.

962
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:01,940
Well, Brother Vox Mutantis and his celebrating fighting Bob robot is pretty amazing,

963
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:10,080
but still, I mean, if only they'd gone ahead and developed Scratch and Sniff Radio like I wanted.

964
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,740
Oh, but I'm glad everything's on.

965
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,940
It's way out, Seekers, because I ain't inclined to stick around for a bloodbath, especially when it's my own.

966
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,980
Because I kicked that old hope habit, but good.

967
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:32,040
Unlike the starry-eyed visionaries we met tonight, who were mostly busy predicting world peace and scientific models.

968
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,480
And then there was Criswell, the man who opened our show.

969
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:42,300
I have in my collection three of his vanity press books of future predictions,

970
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:47,020
ominously printed by a right-wing book publisher in North Carolina.

971
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,700
Oh, Criswell was starry-eyed, too, all right.

972
00:55:52,020 --> 00:56:01,380
But only he had the balls to predict stuff like Denver would turn into jelly in 1989 and suffocate everybody there.

973
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:08,820
And then in 1988, a huge meteorite would splat, flatten London and apparently not vaporize,

974
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,600
because they were going to build a monument.

975
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,920
And a restaurant and stuff on top of it.

976
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:21,260
And hey, maybe they never did come out with those clamp-on bikinis for men like he promised,

977
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:28,460
but he did predict an outbreak of cannibalism in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the late 1960s,

978
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:32,180
and that was where they filmed Night of the Living Dead.

979
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,440
That's close enough for me, Seekers.

980
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,180
So my ears pricked when I found out that he predicted the end of the world for next year,

981
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,260
August.

982
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
18th, 1999.

983
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,600
That's right, Seekers.

984
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,620
Another doomsday prophecy for us to cling to.

985
00:56:53,980 --> 00:57:02,320
I tried to get Stang to change the dates for next July's Dos Equis Day festivities in a Criswellian calendar.

986
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,500
He wouldn't listen.

987
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,960
Oh, but you can be sure that I'll be celebrating Criswell Day my own way.

988
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,940
Much like Criswell himself celebrated it for more years than he ever let on,

989
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,000
since August 18th happens to be his birthday.

990
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,920
And what a reason to party like it's 1999.

991
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,760
As trite and cliched as that is,

992
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:33,040
I'll do it if it means the hell trip through time won't stop.

993
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,380
Good night, Seekers.

994
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,360
Evil Susie, Evil Susie, are you feeling better, honey?

995
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,560
Yeah, I'm...

996
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,760
Aw, you've thrown up an awful lot of audio tape,

997
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,640
and a little green around the gills.

998
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,340
I think the worst of it's over.

999
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,480
Well, hell, as long as you're down.

1000
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:19,560
I'm so sweet.

1001
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,200
We have a future. We have a future.

1002
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,980
Friends, you're listening to the subgenius radio hour of slack.

1003
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,640
Rerun of Susie the Flusie's future show.

1004
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:39,240
For more information on Bob, Susie the Flusie, the Church of the Subgenius, or anything else,

1006
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:55,900
post office box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1007
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:00,800
And praise Bob, for he is the way of the future.

1008
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,600
The way of the future.

1009
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,440
The way of the future.

1010
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,660
The way of the future.

1011
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,580
The way of the future.

1012
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,820
The way of the future.

1013
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,280
The way of the future!

1014
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,480
You are not safe.

1015
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,580
The way of the future.

1016
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,640
The way of the future.

1017
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,640
The way of the future.

1018
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,260
The way of the future.

1019
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:39,820
The wave of the future.
