1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,000
Whoa!

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,160
Whoa!

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,480
Whoa!

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,440
Whoa!

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:09,880
Whoa!

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,380


7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,980
Did you know?

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,080
Did you did you see your pretty?

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,820
Did you did you see your pretty?

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,080
Did you did you see your pretty?

11
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,340
Did you did you see your pretty?

12
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,100
You like it? Pick yourself up!

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,780
You got all the money your husband has!

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,060
Lookie Joy!

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,940
Lookie Joy!

16
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,860
Lookie Joy!

17
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,300
She had one or two things on her mouth.

18
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,020
I think she had a job.

19
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,220
I think she had a job down at the bakery.

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm about to turn up loud.

21
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,620
I'm about to turn up loud.

22
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,800
I'm gonna ride on this river.

23
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,760
I'm gonna ride on this river.

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,220
hair

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,060
hair

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,040
Do we always see í™©

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,660
I'm gonna dance, gonna shout, gonna turn this function out.

28
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,860
I like to dream, yeah, just right between a sound machine.

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,440
On the town side, I drink in the night, any place that goes is right.

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,660
Ghost bar flies near, putting stars away from here.

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,040
Well, I'm gonna dance, gonna shout, gonna turn this function out.

32
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,560
You don't know what we can find.

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,260
Why don't you come with me, little girl, on a magic carpet ride?

34
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,400
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,220
The Self Genius Hour of Swag.

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,720
Watch!

37
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,640
It wasn't something limited, again, by time and space.

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,760
We want to bring God down to our realm.

39
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,180
We can't bring God down to our realm.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,960
And all the powers...

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,980
Raise the...

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,940
We didn't mean any harm.

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,840
We just wanted to help.

44
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,320
We did.

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,000
We did.

46
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,620
We did.

47
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,860
We didn't need to have a swimming pool and a dishwasher and clothes washers and fryers and air conditioning and...

48
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:30,960
We didn't need to have a swimming pool and a dishwasher and clothes washers and fryers and air conditioning and...

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,600
Just plain stupid ignorance.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,100
I'm...

51
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,840
Come on, girl, let's wrap this time.

52
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,700
Instead of TV, the one you take to bed with you...

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,860
What?

54
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:46,720
What?

55
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,580
Jerk spurt sex work.

56
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,360
I'm gonna go out and shake my pants out on the front lawn.

57
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:20,720
Sorry, Reverb.

58
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm feeling better now.

59
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah, Reverend Susie the floozy is back and loaded for fair.

60
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,860
Oh, jeez, look at all this junk all over the funhouse.

61
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,340
Oh, I'm going to have to clean house so I can get over there to my good stuff.

62
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,740
Oh, hey, look.

63
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,500
My missing Hassel Atkins.

64
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
This gives me an idea.

65
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,320
Come on, everybody.

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,960
Take off their pants and shake their pants.

67
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,260
Let's shake our pants now.

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,260
Take off your pants.

69
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,660
Shake them, please.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,740
Weatherman commands you to...

71
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,300
Oh, tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.

72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,740
Oh, it creeps in from outer space from day to day

73
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,920
to the last tailed leader of recorded...

74
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,560
Oh, it's a little bit of a mess.

75
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,320
...and all our cigarettes have lighted subgeniuses the way to bad breath.

76
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,560
Yeah, well, we'll get back to that later.

77
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,080
I just figured...

78
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,940
Out, out, brief flashlight batteries.

79
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:45,760
Life's but a walking broken hard drive, a poor player who struts and frets his hour of slack

80
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,320
upon the airwaves and then is heard no more.

81
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,500
...dirty facts wrecks sex.

82
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,000
It is a rant.

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,540
Yeah.

84
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,660
The

85
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,860
Hello, friends, and welcome.

86
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,520
Oh, everybody, be quiet.

87
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,980
The sermon tonight is entitled, The Smirk of Bob.

88
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:39,300
You see, a lot of folks, especially the pinks and normals, mistakenly think that subgenies are a bunch of happy-go-lucky slackers.

89
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,120
They think we don't have a worry in the world.

90
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,740
We just live one day at a time, never looking back in the devil with the future.

91
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,440
They look at Bob's picture, they see that smiling face and perfectly proportioned pipe,

92
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,780
and they can't imagine that there's any tragedy, pain, or suffering in having been a subgenius.

93
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,900
Oh, the Christians, they plaster crosses everywhere to remind us that Jesus was nailed to the cross.

94
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,920
The Jews, they build Holocaust museums and go on and on about the Nazis and the gas chambers,

95
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,200
while the Muslims whine about the Crusades and the plight of the Palestinians.

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,080
Everyone's a victim. Everyone suffers more than we do.

97
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,540
But when one realizes that the Vatican is the largest landowner in the world,

99
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,140
or that Israel gets $3 billion in U.S. aid alone every year,

100
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,440
or that the Saudi Arabians, just the Saudi Arabians, have so much oil money

101
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
that they have servants that literally wipe their butts.

102
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,260
One.

103
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,960
They can't help but wonder, are they really suffering that much?

104
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,340
They complain bitterly that we don't work hard enough, or that we're immoral,

105
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,520
or that life is too easy on us, when in reality, they're the ones acting like hedonists,

106
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,700
living high on the hog.

107
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,880
My dear, dear friends, just because we don't run around and scream about suffering more than everyone else

108
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,380
doesn't mean we've never suffered at all.

109
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,720
We could have made the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer our traitor,

110
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,440
or our trademark, if we wanted to play that game.

111
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,160
But we're not a religion of guilt or self-righteousness.

112
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,560
No, sir!

113
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,340
We're a religion of holy humor.

114
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,560
That's why we used Bob's smiling face instead of Arnold's bleeding stump.

115
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,260
That, and certain copyright restrictions.

116
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,760
We refuse to dig up historical calamities just so we can excuse our current luxuries and indulgences.

117
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,340
We don't need to remind people of being fed to the lions,

118
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,740
getting killed by crusaders, or being burnt in ovens in order to create a smoke screen for our current sins.

119
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,300
If we're not really guilty, why bother pointing fingers at everyone else?

120
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,800
Well, I think I know why.

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,940
It's to keep the spotlight off you and your own misdeeds,

122
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,720
Mr. Christian, Mr. Jew, Mr. Moslem.

123
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,160
All the pretense of poverty and pain is nothing more than a Madison Avenue attempt

124
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,700
to hide your own greed, luxury, and wealth.

125
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,720
Oh, we've seen it all.

126
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,040
We've seen it all before.

127
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,400
Whenever the rich try to impress us with their humbleness,

128
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,280
Hollywood liberals speak out for the poor and passionately plead for care and understanding.

129
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,560
They make commercials for charities, do benefits for the homeless,

130
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
and sing, We Are the World.

131
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,840
Then, when the show is over, they drive home in their limousines,

132
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,760
feed the Dobermans a few steaks, and turn on the electric fence,

133
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,240
then retire to their oxygen tents.

134
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,720
The Black Bookstore.

135
00:09:46,740 --> 00:10:03,300
That message is available online at tayt submit.com.

136
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,140
cliche

137
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,220
Now, I'm not gonna throw a bunch of statistics at you and quote how many popes, preachers,

138
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,500
rabbis or oil-rich clerics drive around in Mercedes Benz, but I can't promise you this.

139
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,740
It's a million times more than we do, because you know how many subgenius ministers own

140
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,820
a Mercedes Benz?

141
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,320
Zero.

142
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,760
Not a one.

143
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,880
Heck, we're lucky if we even own an economy car free and clear.

144
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,920
We are the poorest church, the poorest religion, and the poorest paid preachers in the world,

145
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,100
bar none.

146
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,880
In other words, we have the greatest need of all existing religions.

147
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,840
But do you see us asking for the greatest share of contributions?

148
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,260
No, sir.

149
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,740
Those other religions, they want 10% of your income right off the top.

150
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,820
They want you to provide for them in your will.

151
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,220
They want you to pressure your government for billion dollar contributions.

152
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,860
They want you to do it.

153
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,360
They want you to double your taxes so that they don't have to pay any.

154
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,860
And what does Bob ask for?

155
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,860
30 lousy bucks.

156
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,640
They're the ones with the extravagant cathedrals, the lush synagogues, the giant mosques.

157
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,100
And what do we have?

158
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,840
One hour a week on non-commercial radio.

159
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,940
Now, forgive me if I go out on a limb here, but doesn't that sound just a little lopsided?

160
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,940
Of course not.

161
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,800
It sounds a lot lopsided.

162
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,060
But we got something they don't have.

163
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,560
It's called slack.

164
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,440
And I don't mean the artificial slack they try to market for a profit.

165
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,820
Hey, folks, play the lottery and win free slack.

166
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,200
Uh-uh.

167
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,980
I'm talking about real slack, internal slack, slack from within, the kind that feeds on

168
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,760
itself like a breeder reactor.

169
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,320
It radiates a warm, fuzzy glow.

170
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,920
The fuzziness of the air.

171
00:11:59,920 --> 00:11:59,920


172
00:11:59,920 --> 00:11:59,920


173
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,060
It lights up our lives.

174
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,760
It's an inner peace they will never know.

175
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,320
And therein lies the basic difference in our religious philosophies.

176
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,700
They stress pain, suffering, and sacrifice because on the outside they have everything,

177
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,040
but on the inside they have nothing.

178
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:28,020
They're morally bankrupt, empty shells, just poor, pathetic souls tormented by inner demons

179
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,860
of guilt and self-loathing.

180
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:29,920


181
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,960
But we subgenie.

182
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,040
We are the exact opposite.

183
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,880
While on the outside we have so little, on the inside we have everything.

184
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,260
And that's why we're smiling and Bob Dobbs is smirking.

185
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,060
Because we're rich with slack.

186
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,280
And for all their money, it's not for sale.

187
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,700
Herein is the word of Bob.

188
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,580
Praise Bob.

189
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,960
Amen.

190
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,140
1

191
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,980
Yes, dear friends, used as feedback for sale.

192
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,680
And where are we?

193
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,740
Where are we tonight?

194
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,240
What have we been hearing?

195
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,640
The preaching there was, of course, by the great Father Joe Mama, also known as Papa

196
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,300
Joe Mama.

197
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,800
We've got some brand new Jainer hyperclites.

198
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:29,920
Come on.

199
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,240
We've got some coming up.

200
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,200
Some Suzie the Floozy and Reverend Nolan Void.

201
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,680
And there's so many other subgenius shows out there I could play excerpts from that

202
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,740
we'd end up never doing any of our show.

203
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,440
But also we've been hearing some from negative lands.

204
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,720
New CD, relatively new CD, Sex Dirt.

205
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,520
Beautiful.

206
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,400
So full of lilting sounds.

207
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,620
From Sealand Records there.

208
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,880
I should give you Sealand Records address.

209
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,220
For those who forgot, you can write for it.

210
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,700
Negative Land has a great new catalog out, by the way.

211
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:19,840
You can write to them at 1920 Monument Boulevard, MF1.

212
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,720
Concord, California, 94520.

213
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,920
We've got some great new CDs out.

214
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:29,920


215
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:29,920


216
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:29,920


217
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:29,920


218
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:29,920


219
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:29,920


220
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:29,920


221
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:29,920


222
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,500
We're moving to Concord.

223
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,340
We're moving to Concord.

224
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,440
We're moving to Concord.

225
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,480
Oh, anyway, yes, friends.

226
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,400
Well, hello to all the stations out there, the new stations,

227
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,840
and also to our new listeners on the Internet.

228
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,760
That's becoming easier and easier for us to deal with now,

229
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,420
thanks to Jesus and the compression programs and so forth.

230
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,560
Yes, yes, the evil Internet.

231
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,120
But it's not like occult or anything.

232
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,220
This isn't like one of those Egyptian occultists, you know, scary.

233
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,900
Nothing, this isn't one of those satanic deals.

234
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,780
When we worship the great spot,

235
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,260
we worship the great spider at the center of the web.

236
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,720
It's not like we're, you know, just trying to condone evil

237
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,420
or human sacrifice or anything like that.

238
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,340
Oh, that's just a spinning woman.

239
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,820
No, no, no, or...

240
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:42,960
Grandma.

241
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,920
No, no, we just want you to have fun.

242
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,860
We want you to join with us in the brotherhood, in the sisterhood,

243
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,740
under the web of the great spider who protects us.

244
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,160
Yes, she protects us.

245
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,200
She nurses us.

246
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,240
We may nurse at the peak,

247
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,820
at the information peak of the great spider of the sticky, sticky web.

248
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,880
All we make for the shared glory is a new life of spam.

249
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,560
Look at Chaz fiendishly playing that gigantic organ of his

250
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,640
with that wax mask on his face.

251
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,720
Look, it's weird sneaking up behind him.

252
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,780
She's tiptoeing up behind Chaz.

253
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,960
She's reaching out as if to lift the mask from his face.

254
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,560
She's going to do it.

255
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,580
She's grabbed the mask.

256
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,720
He turned around.

257
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,160
His hideous, hideous face.

258
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,880
You ready for me?

259
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,880
Better be ready to face the consequences.

260
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,860
It's never too late to redeem yourself.

261
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,860
One last chance.

262
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,160
That's all you have.

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,160
It's up to you.

264
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,000
You ready for me?

265
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,980
No escaping my eyes.

266
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,580
You'll see them at every street.

267
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,220
You ready for me?

268
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,720
You ready for me?

269
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,020
You never escape the eyes.

270
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,780
You'll never escape the eyes.

271
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,380
You will never escape the hypnotic eyes of Bill T. Miller.

272
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,600
That's one of my favorite pieces there.

273
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,520
And you can get more information on the king of slack,

274
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,960
Reverend Bill T. Miller,

275
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,080
at 1-617-LICK-O-B-E.

276
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,760
If you haven't done that yet, that's 1-617-LICK-O-B-E.

277
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,260
That's a phone number.

278
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,960
You're in trouble.

279
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,900
You're in trouble.

280
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,820
You're in trouble.

281
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:22,820


282
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,480
You're in trouble.

283
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,040
You're in trouble.

284
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,020
You're in trouble.

285
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,780
Lovely, lovely.

286
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,620
The soul canisters are stacking up here at the church.

287
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,620
Dear friends.

288
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,180
It's so inspiring and enlightening.

289
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,480
Why, it just makes me so happy.

290
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,820
You know, we've got to make a million souls by X day, friends.

291
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,260
We've got to save that many people.

292
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,380
We've got two years to do it in.

293
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,280
And friends, you need to remember that we are having

294
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,240
We're having the biggest subgenius bash ever on July 5th.

295
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,360
Every year from now until the for real X-Day, we call these the X-Day Drills.

296
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,900
And you can call the subgenius hotline, the information hotline.

297
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,860
I'm about to give that phone number for you.

298
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,440
Or you can write to our P.O. box for a wonderful little flyer that we threw together about that.

299
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,660
July 5th, 1996, the first X-Day Drill in Sherman, New York.

300
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:36,000
And that phone number to call, the subgenius hotline, the DeVival hotline is 216-556-0338.

301
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,940
8, 8, 8.

302
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,820
And we ate this soul.

303
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,700
216-556-0338.

304
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,060
And you might, well you could call 1-900-990-5085.

305
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,300
And you might, well you could call 1-900-990-5085.

306
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,540
That's 1-900-990-5085, extension 324.

307
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:08,020
For the dial-a-dobbs, Church of the Subgenius Sacred, 900 number, $2 per minute, under 18 needs parents' permission.

308
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,460
Touchtone phone required.

309
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,700
Maximum calls, 5 minutes.

310
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,140
Mystery Playhouse, Tallahassee, Florida.

311
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,660
That's put together by Father Joe Mama.

312
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,300
And friends now for the news.

313
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,600
Teens bloodlust blamed in spree.

314
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,640
I love that word, spree.

315
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,040
Fort Myers, Florida.

316
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,640
Members of a teenage mother.

317
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:34,400
Militia charged with killing a high school band director and burning down a church were consumed by, quote, bloodlust and arson, authorities said.

318
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:43,000
The group organized a month ago and called itself a militia, even though members could not define what that was, police said.

319
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:49,560
The group was led by 18-year-old Kevin D. Foster, whom other members called God.

320
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,160
Mr. Foster is Mr. Foster.

321
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,480
Mr. God, do you?

322
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:54,780
Buddy.

323
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:04,940
Is accused of pulling the trigger in the slaying of Mark Schwebes, band director of Riverdale High School, where Mr. God Foster was once a student.

324
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,660
Mr. Schwebes, 32, was shot with a 12-gauge...

325
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:16,240
It was like a vortex of bloodlust and arson, Sheriff John McDougal said.

326
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,680
It was consuming fame.

327
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,300
They couldn't get enough.

328
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,260
I know how they feel, friend.

329
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,160
But these kids, their head's in the right place, but they're thinking on a small scale.

330
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,200
That's the problem.

331
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,340
The group's master plan...

332
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,840
Now, this...

333
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,060
I like this, though.

334
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:46,340
The group's master plan was to steal costumes at Disney World and go on a shooting spree that would target pinks, according to an unidentified member quoted Sunday in the news press of Fort Myers.

335
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,640
I wouldn't put anything past them, Sheriff McDougal said.

336
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,620
I have no doubt whatsoever that they would have carried it.

337
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,940
They would have carried it through.

338
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,880
Every other plan they had, they executed.

339
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,720
Not to mention the high school band director they executed.

340
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:09,280
But friends, you know, really, stealing costumes at Disney World and then going on a shooting spree.

341
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,300
So, uh, well, now you know who to vote for for president, friends.

342
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,800
The Unabomber in 1996.

343
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,700
He's hot, he's got a point, he's got the credentials, down with the propaganda machine.

344
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,000
Wait a minute.

345
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,600
This recording is...

346
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,340
requires better, uh, more forceful background music here.

347
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,740
For this, uh, inter...

348
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,040
Unabomber for president routine here from Paranoia.com.

349
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,820
Uh, friends, you know, because the Unabomber...

350
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,780
The point is, the Unabomber did a...

351
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,840
end run around the media monopoly and published without editorial clearance.

352
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:53,880
The Unabomber has, by the magnitude of his plan, exposed the media for what it is.

353
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:01,020
A closed communication system and bourgeois propaganda device owned and operated by the corporate power elite.

354
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,520
What we are engaged in is essentially a struggle for communication.

355
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:17,840
The corporate industrial complex is a heavily armed fortress dictating the baloney propaganda we are fed daily via multimedia channels.

356
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,400
We hear only what they want us to hear.

357
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:29,120
So long as the man prevents the message from reaching the masses, justice is impeded.

358
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:35,240
The Unabomber used terrorism to gain publicity as an end in itself.

359
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,480
Notice how the press seeks to channel the public's interpretation of the Unabomber,

360
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,200
covering it as a serial killer story of crime and insanity,

361
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,340
while deliberately excluding consideration of the ideas themselves.

362
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,180
Imagine, if you will,

363
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,340
mass communications not subject to corporate control.

364
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,220
Why, people might say anything, even things not fit to print.

365
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,380
Exactly.

366
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,060
When the ABC nightly news gets renamed Disney World,

367
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,180
you'll cherish the memory of your Unabomber vote.

368
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,240
Don't waste your vote, friends.

369
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,660
Unabomber in 1996.

370
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,060
Whoa!

371
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,080
And, uh...

372
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,060
Yes, that was from www.paranoia.com,

373
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,520
which is a fun little website.

374
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,820
What else have we here?

375
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,220
Oh, a new dinosaur may break T-Rex's size record.

376
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,740
New York, an amateur fossil...

377
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,420
Wait a minute.

378
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,380
What should we...

379
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,800
What if we put on some pleasant music that Nenslo sent us?

380
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,820
There.

381
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,160
An amateur fossil hunter has discovered what may be the biggest meat-eating...

382
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,420
dinosaur known.

383
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,780
A fearsome beast that looked like the long-time record holder Tyrannosaurus rex.

384
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,940
This new creature was 43 feet long and weighed 6 to 8 tons

385
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,140
when it roamed the froplands of what is now Argentina.

386
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,020
Scientists estimate, uh, in honor of the discoverer, Ruben Carolini,

387
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,160
the huge dinosaur has been named Giganotosaurus Carolini.

388
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,340
Carolinii.

389
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
Or Giganotosaurus.

390
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,860
Giganotosaurus Carolinii.

391
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,620
Yes, and they've got a...

392
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,040
Quite a good chunk of the skeleton.

393
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,640
There aren't many Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons around, and this is...

394
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,880
Uh, well, I guess this is a new one.

395
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,420
Jack Horner, the great Jack Horner, at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana.

396
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,920
That's Bozeman, Montana.

397
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:50,660
It's said that comparing the sizes of Giganotosaurus and T-Rex is tricky because dinosaurs grew

398
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,140
quickly.

399
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:57,580
They grew continuously until they died rather than stopping at some adult length.

400
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,480
So, in other words, as long as you could...

401
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:06,620
As long as a Giganotosaurus could keep chomping down on those little no-account pink vegetarian

402
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:14,840
dinosaurs around him, why, he could grow so huge that his ponderous weight would not be

403
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,140
supported by his bones, and they would splinter beneath the immense...

404
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,340
The...

405
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,180
Uh, yes, dear friends.

406
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,960
And yet, this animal was probably a scavenger, like a subgenius.

407
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,820
Not a predator, not a hunter, nay, but living off the discomfort of others.

408
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,280
Ah, yes, praise Bob.

409
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,540
And that's what we've always been into here at the Church of the Subgenius.

410
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,640
My gosh, look, we're coming down near the end of side one of the show.

411
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,740
We'll just have to...

412
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

413
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,320
I'm sorry.

414
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


415
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


416
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


417
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


418
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


419
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


420
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


421
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


422
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


423
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


424
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


425
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


426
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


427
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


428
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


429
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,320


430
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,240
I'm sorry.

431
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,240


432
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,900
We'll just have to, uh, find some hideous media brawge that will work...

433
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,040
Whoa!

434
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,340
Whoa!

435
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,560
Whoa!

436
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,780
Whoa!

437
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:58,780


438
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:58,780


439
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:58,800


440
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400
Whoa!

441
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,400


442
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,800
Whoa!

443
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,280
Whoa!

444
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,380
Whoa!

445
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,660
Whoa!

446
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,000
Whoa!

447
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,420
Whoa!

448
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,420


449
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,420


450
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,420


451
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,660
Whoa!

452
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,520
Whoa!

453
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,020
Whoa!

454
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,400
This is negative land.

455
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,840
Negative land sex dirt here, dear friends.

456
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,540
It feels so pretty and dirty and spitty and so sexy.

457
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,220
Ah, that bloodlust, that arson.

458
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,340
Expert hex sex.

459
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,440
Yeah, and all that.

460
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,540
Sex dirt.

461
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,060
Make her hiss.

462
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,460
We get these things mixed up sometimes.

463
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,140
Sex, dirt, violence, death.

464
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,500
You know.

465
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,500
Baby, baby, baby.

466
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,900
Uh-huh.

467
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,680
Baby, baby, baby.

468
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,040
Baby, baby, baby.

469
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,940
P to the U to the M to the P to the G to the A to the G.

470
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,940
The weatherman is a sex god.

471
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,360
Come on, pump bag.

472
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,540
So what can you do?

473
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,160
You can join up with the church of the subgenius,

474
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,720
or you'll be singing in the choir.

475
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:44,260
Tonight, I am offering you a personal flotation device

476
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,020
to keep your head above this rising river.

477
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm offering you a personal flotation device.

478
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,740
In the form of this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

479
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,260
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

480
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,300
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

481
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,700
It is no accident that you are all here.

482
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,660
You all have been chosen.

483
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,760
Don't you realize how much Bob loves you?

484
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,500
He loves you so much that he's willing to offer you

485
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,300
a chance to have your every person,

486
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,200
your every perverse desire, be brought to life.

487
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,700
Your every sick sexual fantasy shall be made flesh before you.

488
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,420
Remember, it is far better to be a speeding car

489
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,060
than it is to be a blind man crossing against the light.

490
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:44,700
Lick the crack.

491
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,340
I can't do it.

492
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,740
Here we go, ready?

493
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,780
Lick it.

494
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,260
Do it.

495
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,920
Now.

496
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,720
I let my imagination escape all bounds.

497
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,480
Lick the crack.

498
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,680
There it goes.

499
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,740
Into my dumb little cup.

500
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,760
No social conformity is imposed inside my mind.

501
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,080
Lick the crack.

502
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,960
Inside my mind.

503
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,040
Lick the crack.

504
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,680
Eager, ready.

505
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:18,760
Ready.

506
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:18,760


507
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,240
I'm ready.

508
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,260
Lick the crack.

509
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
Eager, ready.

510
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,440
I'm ready.

511
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,100
Lick the crack.

512
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,080
My trick worked!

513
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,160
Lick the crack.

514
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,280
Lick the crack.

515
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,400
Make her hiss.

516
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,000
Woo!

517
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,480
Six-thirt!

518
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,260
It's coming.

519
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:41,820
It's coming.

520
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:41,980
It's coming.

521
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,680
No!

522
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,020
No!

523
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:52,580
The Library, Why We Fight the Wars, Volume 9, The March.

524
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,840
The march continued through the hot, humid jungle air.

525
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,420
The war raged all about them.

526
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,840
Which war? It's all wars.

527
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,520
It's every bloody, filthy, stinking war all rolled into one

528
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,260
and stuffed into the end of a rifle like a bayonet

529
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,960
jammed into your belly by a screaming, pasty-faced gook.

530
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,300
The sun beat down hot and hard on the sweat-grinched faces of the men,

531
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,300
and the mosquitoes sang a bleak song of malaria.

532
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,460
Minutes seemed like hours. Hours seemed like years.

533
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,600
Years seemed like centuries.

534
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,920
A century seemed like unto a millennium,

535
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,700
and the millennium seemed like unto an eternity.

536
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,040
And yet still, the march continued.

537
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,780
An eternity.

538
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,800
An eternity seemed like eternity plus one.

539
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,300
Eternity plus one seemed like unto forever squared.

540
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,680
And yet still, still, the march continued.

541
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,360
We sweated sweat for the sake of sweating sweat.

542
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,700
Spat spit for the sake of spitting spit.

543
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,160
And on the field of battle, God help our souls,

544
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,880
shed blood for the sake of shedding blood.

545
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,660
And on the field of battle, God help our souls,

546
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,500
shed blood for the sake of shedding blood.

547
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:22,240
Around the campfire at night, we shared a canteen and spoke of home.

548
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,340
What's the first thing you got to do when you get home, Brooklyn?

549
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,020
Johnson inquired.

550
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,300
The first thing I do when I get home,

551
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,060
I'm gonna be sitting on the front row of a Dodgers game

552
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,240
With one arm wrapped around my back,

553
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:46,720
my best skirt and my other paw wrapped tight around an ice cold brewski. Brooklyn crowed.

554
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,640
Home. It seemed as though we would never get back home. Perhaps our combat boots knew the way back.

555
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,140
Home.

556
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:16,920
Suddenly there was an explosion. Brooklyn had stepped on a landmine. The others turned and

557
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:24,520
gazed in horror as he lay flailing on the ground. A helpless cripple. Brooklyn's face was drenched

558
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:37,040
in sweat. His mind was broken. He was laughing. I haven't got no legs.

559
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,780
boatner waves

560
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,980
I I got no legs.

561
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,180
For the love of god. I ain't got,

562
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,920
I ain't got any mother lovin bleedin likely

563
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,600
ny charlie

564
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:06,600


565
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,060
Sarge will

566
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,240
Wielded around angrily.

567
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,520
For the love of God, I ain't got any mother-loving bleeding.

568
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,580
Yeah!

569
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,960
What, Private?

570
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,160
He barked.

571
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,240
For the love of God, I ain't got no mother-loving bleeding.

572
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,480
Yeah!

573
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,560
Sir!

574
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,760
Brooklyn snapped obediently.

575
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,080
I can't hear you, Sarge barked.

576
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,000
For the love of God, I ain't got no mother-loving bleeding.

577
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,840
Yeah!

578
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,060
Sir!

579
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,620
I can't hear you!

580
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,300
For the love of God, I ain't got no mother-loving bleeding.

581
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,160
Yeah!

582
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,340
Sir!

583
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,300
Brooklyn boomed.

584
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,500
Attention!

585
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,060
As well as a legless man flailing on the ground could snap to attention,

586
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,820
Brooklyn snapped to attention.

587
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,720
What are the three most effective ways

588
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,740
the enemy has of concealing a booby trap, Private?

589
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,060
But Sarge, I'm bleeding to death!

590
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,060
Don't back sass me, Private, or I'll have you court-martialed.

591
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,440
Method number one, sir!

592
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,220
Explosive is concealed underneath brush or buried under dirt, sir!

593
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,140
Method number two, sir!

594
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,740
A wire is stretched across a jungle path, which then trips,

595
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,700
sets off a grenade or another force, sir!

596
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,000
A form of explosive, sir!

597
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,680
Method number three, sir!

598
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,360
Method number three, sir!

599
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,380
Brooklyn's voice seemed to trail off mysteriously.

600
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,160
Method three, Private.

601
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,580
A small hole is dug into which impact ignition explosives are placed.

602
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,080
Hole is then covered with leaves and dirt, Private.

603
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,560
If you added stupid Army manual number 4672 more carefully,

604
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,680
instead of...

605
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Now go brick and dirt boot camp, you wouldn't be in this mess, Private.

606
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,360
Johnson, put him out of his misery.

607
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,680
But Sarge, there's a village hospital just three miles up the trail.

608
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,340
Brooklyn pleaded.

609
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,840
Yeah, and there's a freak show on Coney Island.

610
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,060
We got more important things to do right now than witness a gimp.

611
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,680
We got a little war to fight, Private.

612
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,140
Or have you forgotten that?

613
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,380
In the midst of your little problems, Johnson, shoot his head off!

614
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,600
A volley of machine gun fire rang from Johnson's firearm.

615
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,360
A rain of bullets covered Brooklyn's face and upper body.

616
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,360
Baker, check his heartbeat, Sarge ordered.

617
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,900
Baker, the company medic, placed his stethoscope on Brooklyn's heart,

618
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,020
which was now lying on the jungle trail,

619
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,180
having been ripped from his chest by the volley of machine gun fire.

620
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,240
He's dead, Sarge, Baker reported.

621
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,640
I guess he'll never get to see that Dodgers game he was always talking about.

622
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,440
My guess is that he's watching that Dodgers game right now, upstairs,

623
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,540
somewhere with a big man, you know, the chief of staff.

624
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,540
He always wanted to say...

625
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,100
He always said he wanted to be a third baseman.

626
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,680
Now he looks more like a third base, Johnson lamented.

627
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,820
And to think I once called him a coward.

628
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,840
Now that I've seen him in battle,

629
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,380
I think of a lot of other things I could have called him.

630
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,140
But, Sarge, but, Sarge, what are we gonna tell the woman that he loves?

631
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,420
And more importantly than that, what are we gonna tell his wife?

632
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,900
Tell her he was a brave warrior who died a hero's death in battle.

633
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,920
Tell him we're gonna get that seat at that Dodgers game.

634
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,900
We're gonna reserve it just for his combat boots.

635
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,700
Hell, boys, we'll reserve a whole section of that stadium.

636
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,280
We'll order a whole case of brewskis just for Brooklyn.

637
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,140
In other words, we'll lie.

638
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,080
I know I might seem like a mean, hard-assed old bastard.

639
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,020
And by the time this march is over, you men will probably hate my guts.

640
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,160
But one day, you'll be sitting in a foxhole, surrounded by the enemy.

641
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,280
And then, by God, you'll hate me even more.

642
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,240
All right, enough rubbernecking, you bunch of gold bricks.

643
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,260
Let's move out.

644
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,740
The march continued.

645
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,460
And continued.

646
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,060
And continued.

647
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,600
Is it ever really the end?

648
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,240
Oh, yes, dear friends.

649
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,500
Radio Free Janer.

650
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:27,920
The great Saint Janer Hyperclete's there with the march.

651
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:35,020
Done for his own new radio show there on KABF in Little Rock.

652
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,880
Hello, Little Rock.

653
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,400
And howdy, Janer.

654
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,400
And I believe that was Calvin with him.

655
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,640
I'm not sure.

656
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,040
It might have been Bobby Free or maybe one of the Samuels brothers.

657
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,620
He's one of them rednecks, you know.

658
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,920
And what else?

659
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,280
Let's go to our kook collection, friends.

660
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,820
What?

661
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,140
There are so many wonderful tapes here in the kook collection.

662
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,240
We'll try this little...

663
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,620
It's sort of a tape letter to us we got recently.

664
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,080
Crap.

665
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,360
According to my records, I've sent you 33 pages of information plus a postcard.

666
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:19,380
Most of what I sent you proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that much of what you've sent me is crap.

667
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:26,800
Only a person like you, with your almost total lack of any intelligence, honesty, sanity, or any other kind of intelligence,

668
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,220
knowledge, understanding, etc., would claim otherwise.

669
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,940
As I've said, you lie too much.

670
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,740
The idea that your communications to me are enlightened is ludicrous.

671
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:46,120
There's nothing enlightened about insanity, stupidity, dishonest, laziness, lying, cheating, mysticism.

672
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,980
You keep sending me long letters with all kinds of misinformation and disinformation in them,

673
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,480
which I've proved to you over and over and over again in my letters back to you.

674
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,600
On the order of 2 plus 2 equals 5.

675
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,680
I keep writing back to you that no, 2 plus 2 doesn't equal 5,

676
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:09,320
and you keep writing 2 plus 2 equals 5 back to me again and again and again and again and again.

677
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,980
2 plus 2 doesn't equal 5.

678
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,800
Much of what you've sent me is crap.

679
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,460
You either have no real idea of what you keep sending me,

680
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,460
which is quite possible for a person who's obviously as insane as you are,

681
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,460
or you do know and are delusional.

682
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,460


683
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,540
You're deliberately lying your head off.

684
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,920
I am very new to the top of the emotional tone scale.

685
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:37,180
I am not having a strong emotional reaction to the garbage you keep sending me at all.

686
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:44,200
A person that was reacting emotionally obviously wouldn't send you dozens of pages of information back.

687
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,180
Information that's sensible, rational, logical, correct, true, sane, right, at all.

688
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,980
You're way off.

689
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,840
Well, that's kind of depressing, friends.

690
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,980
That's from some crackpot out there.

691
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,440
His name, Nenslow or something, I don't know.

692
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:08,100
That upsets me so much, in fact, that it seems like we should turn to our new guru,

693
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,560
our new Shorterpersav, Joe.

694
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,140
Yes, praise Joe.

695
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:20,340
Let's see what Joe, probably he will impart his wisdom tonight in the form of a song or a ditty.

696
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,320
Let's find out at random.

697
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,900
I could sleep.

698
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,780
Oh, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee.

699
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:41,520
It's supposed to be an imitation of a young girl who has to go to the bathroom really bad

700
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,120
and she's looking up the stairs toward the bathroom and freaking out thinking she's not going to make it in time.

701
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,100
Could sleep.

702
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,220
Dozer.

703
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,460
Does.

704
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,620
Bop.

705
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,200
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

706
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:04,020
Some people who have heard me act this way, there's one guy, he asked me if I sit around and spank my monkey as I do this.

707
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:13,540
Hey, when I'm spanking my monkey, I'm laying down on the floor, pressing it against the floor, concentrating.

708
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,520
I don't need to be making those noises as I do it.

709
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,640
I make different kind of noises, like when I have the orgasm.

710
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,080
Ooh, it feels pleasant. Ooh, it feels pleasant.

711
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:41,260
Or if I'm getting an orgasm thinking about pleasure through pain, I'm chanting, it doesn't feel pleasant, but really it does.

712
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:48,740
As I'm getting off, I'm saying, it doesn't feel pleasant. Doesn't feel pleasant.

713
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,620
You know what I call teenage growth?

714
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,640
Girls, little squirty honeys.

715
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:00,860
And when they say, but my name isn't honey.

716
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,800
Or, oh, don't call me that. I don't like it.

717
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,520
I say, well, I don't care. Your name is honey.

718
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,500
Squirty means squirt, as in, you're a little squirter. Hey, you little squirt.

719
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,220
I suppose it could also mean, if I wanted it to, they squirt out all their openings.

720
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,360
Well, thanks, Joe.

721
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,420
Joe Offrecht there.

722
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,320
The amazing Joe Offrecht of Cleveland.

723
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,880
One of the great geniuses discovered by Jesus.

724
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,840
The sub-Jesus, who just walked back into the office.

725
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,500
You're supposed to be at that desk.

726
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,460
I'm sorry, Stank. Sorry, Reverend Stank.

727
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,240
Most of the time, he's a hard-working boy.

728
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,320
He still kind of craps a little close to the house, if you know what I mean.

729
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,040
Once again, I'm the guy that has legal notices in the paper.

730
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,880
And I have another legal notice for you to practice your business.

731
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,300
I'm the new age of discovery legal notice.

732
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,560
About a half-page story about permission to declare my bachelor minutes.

733
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,080
That's legal notice to the courts.

734
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,700
It's shortly after the Dr. Galakowicz incident.

735
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
And I get spattered.

736
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,740
And they don't even know if I know who I am anymore.

737
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,780
Nancy started hunting men.

738
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,600
And Clemency police went after her.

739
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,440
And other things.

740
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,740
Put them under their seat.

741
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,620
And surrender the keys to the zoo.

742
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,960
First industrialist family.

743
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,600
I've been arrested in animal rights on my land.

744
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,980
Animal behavior specialist.

745
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,660
Blood infectious disease.

746
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,240
And glandular medicine.

747
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,200
Microcircuitry and glandular corrections.

748
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,760
And a stolen doctor's estimate.

749
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,080
I got spattered by the same bunch of bird brains again.

750
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,880
Said I got my brain spattered.

751
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,600
I'm a doctor.

752
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,160
I'm okay.

753
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,240
I'm the guy with my legal notice in the paper.

754
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,780
I have some more legal notices for you.

755
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,780
I've got a story about word play.

756
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,840
And I'm entitled to what they call orange.

757
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,660
And I've got a story about the Euclid police and code.

758
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,600
And a bunch of entitlement packages come in.

759
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,780
And I'm entitled to orange or triple orange.

760
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,900
What they call triple orange.

761
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,120
It's an effervescent.

762
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,680
It's like 7-up.

763
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,580
A monster.

764
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,340
Like a Pepsi.

765
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,380
It's very interesting.

766
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,120
And I'm entitled to orange.

767
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,820
Extremely scientifically or soil preparation.

768
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,100
Woman, color temperature in orange.

769
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,660
Real orange or kingly orange.

770
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,040
I'm entitled to all the natural grazing colors.

771
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,560
Soil conditions of.

772
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,900
Then I'm entitled to white.

773
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,440
And a big game in who's entitlements or what.

774
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,400
Over at the Euclid police department.

775
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,000
They've been playing games with entitlement and code breaker police over there.

776
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,940
Yes, sir.

777
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,160
I'm the man with my legal notice in the paper.

778
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,500
If you want to start your own checks.

779
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,320
Man, the legal documents guy.

780
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:15,000
Friends, that's quite an amazing tape.

781
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,480
It goes on like that for.

782
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,720
What is it, Lord?

783
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,360
About like half an hour.

784
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,660
I think it's an hour.

785
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,620
An hour of one minute messages.

786
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,660
And to leave each message, he had to wait through a five minute outgoing recording.

787
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:37,060
So, this was a truly dedicated individual, friends, with a message and with legal documents.

788
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,340
Legal notices in the paper.

789
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,000
The fierce guard dog here can be heard in the background.

790
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,860
You know, friends, it's sad.

791
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,340
We're all.

792
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:49,540
We're all in this together.

793
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:49,640
We are not.

794
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:56,020
We used to be on a radio station in Dallas for ten years, but they sold out to the conspiracy

795
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:01,820
and now we're forced to produce these shows here in the subgenius office, kind of like

796
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:08,380
some portal crackpot militia fellow, you know, cranking out his awful little cassettes.

797
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,860
But yet, we persevere, friends, because if nothing else, we can always grab subgenius

798
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:18,820
shows done by better connected subgeniuses who are still allowed.

799
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,380
We're going to break a lot of records here today, folks.

800
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:25,800
Ha ha.

801
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
You stupid.

802
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,780
Susan Anton Wilson.

803
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,320
Yes, I remember her writings.

804
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,680
She exposed the conspiracy with a smile and a simper.

805
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,940
So, what would you think?

806
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,500
And a great deal of erudition as she tossed her blonde curl.

807
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,460
Why don't you be a little stupid?

808
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,760
Susan Anton Wilson, the famous writer.

809
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,780
And I was sorry to say, I was going to be a little stupid, but I'm not.

810
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:48,780


811
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:48,800
I'm not.

812
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


813
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


814
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


815
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


816
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


817
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


818
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


819
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


820
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


821
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


822
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


823
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


824
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,800


825
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,900
I'm just wondering that maybe I should use some long-slimmed air.

826
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,000
Susan, I think I'm stupid.

827
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,500
Well, you know, sometimes doing the old show here seems like swimming upstream through

828
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,580
a slow, sluggish, erupting volcano of lard and molasses.

829
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:01,740
You stupid head.

830
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,120
I know you are, but what am I?

831
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,000
You stupid bastard.

832
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,620
We can hear you down there.

833
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,100
Behind the sound effects, stop making decisions.

834
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,340
I'm sorry.

835
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,220
That was stupid of me.

836
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,100
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

837
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:18,080
Well, you know, a saint stupid would have been here, but unfortunately, he had a prior engagement.

838
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,780
You're lying.

839
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:18,780


840
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:18,780


841
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:18,780


842
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:18,780


843
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:18,780


844
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:18,780


845
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:18,780


846
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,780
By the way, let me enlighten you.

847
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,600
I am not operating the control board.

848
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,120
How dare you?

849
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,420
And, well, it's...

850
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,560
Come back here, you stupid, stupid.

851
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,460
That's what I pay them for, you little fool.

852
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,520
I'm not here to...

853
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,420
And I would, if I could.

854
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,720
Sign you up.

855
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:41,320
Once again, dear friends, poor Dr. Howell fighting the sound effects there at the KPFA

856
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:47,560
show, puzzling evidences supplying the sound effects, so as to make the show more puzzling

857
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,780
and interesting.

858
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,320
I'm not going to go into all the details.

859
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:50,380
I'm not going to go into all the details.

860
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:59,520
But, you know, I want to check out this Susie the Flusie and Nolan Void yard sale show from

861
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,200
Bob's Slack Time Fun House.

862
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:07,920
It's kind of like a long radio play, and I can't run the whole thing, but we can certainly

863
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,220
do some excerpts about this wonderful white trash queen, Susie the Flusie, and followed,

864
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,280
I think, by a song, a poorly...

865
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,780
Quite poorly recorded song.

866
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,260
Which we'll play anyway.

867
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:29,140
It's our fault for the recording of Joe Newman, the great Joe Newman, and Sphinx Drummond,

868
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,500
and the gang there with Booger 9000.

869
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,260
Thank you.

870
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,620
I'm sorry.

871
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,460
I'm sorry.

872
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:37,540
I'm sorry.

873
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,620
I'm sorry.

874
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,260
I'm sorry.

875
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,680
I'm sorry.

876
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:44,540


877
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:44,980
I'm sorry.

878
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:44,980


879
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,620
I'm sorry.

880
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,100
I'm sorry.

881
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,100


882
