1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
And, okay, well, so this is an hour of slack right now.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:14,900
A peaceful hour of slack after a scary morning of having to go back to get up early and go back to sleep again.

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,560
Are we going to get to see Stan looking like the dreamer or the dud?

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,460
One minute. One minute.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,780
You know, I almost, I'm almost going to miss this place.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,220
I'm going to miss worrying about money constantly.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,420
I'm going to miss the gnawing anxiety about whether I'm going to make it through the next day.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,820
I'm going to really, really miss the arthritis and making subgenius membership packs.

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,780
And you know what I'm going to miss most of all?

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,400
Changing the number a hundred times every time I put a new hour of slack out.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,080
All these, oh, okay, I better quit whining.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,500
I'll be stuck in here.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,120
You know, if you're whining about your existence,

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,140
you'll be stuck there.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,380
You'll be stuck there forever.

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,360
God damn it.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,260
Right, I'll be stuck here in this spot with a bunch of people staring at me.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,100
Is it?

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:17,020
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,740
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,040
I blame the dubstep.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:40,080
Yes, the fury of the elements a few moments ago made itself known.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,220
Now we're in a lulled period of relaxation and contemplation.

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:57,900
What did Bob or the exes mean when they either changed the schedule or handed us the wrong date or lied or were wrong?

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,060
What did they mean?

26
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,140
What did they mean by being, by someone being wrong?

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,760
You are convinced that they meant well.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,340
Well, no, not at all.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,280
I don't, you know, the funny thing is we've all for 20 years now, we've been anxious to go,

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,460
well, everyone assumes that we're somehow going to Planet X with the exes.

31
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,240
But do we really?

32
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,820
Is there any doctrinal?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,600
spot in the pamphlets or the books that says where we're going?

34
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,140
Yes, there's an extensive diagram.

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,260
Oh, that's right.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,200
But what about Planet X itself?

37
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,260
I mean, we have all of our own...

38
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,280
No, that's the subgenius afterlife, isn't it?

39
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,340
Yes, the subgenius afterlife.

40
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,680
The saucers take you to the port authority building

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,660
from where you begin the long progression into the many subgenius afterlives.

42
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,100
And one can assume it has to be a rocky Earth-like world

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,780
with our same or less gravity, but certainly no more.

44
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,640
In the Goldilocks zone, they call it.

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,680
Yes, exactly.

46
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,680
A planet that's just right.

47
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,860
No, you can have a just right planet in the Goldilocks zone

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,320
with gravity four times that of Earth, can't you?

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,640
Yes.

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,920
And in fact, I believe that the nearest happy-looking planet

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,320
is indeed four times the gravity of Earth.

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,480
So if we were to...

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
Oh, say the Xs never show up.

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,620
We have to build our own ships and go to the nearest planet.

55
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,800
At light speed, it would still take us 22 years,

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,400
and when we got there, I would weigh 600 pounds.

57
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,520
Yes, forget that.

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,460
We don't need a heavy-gravity world.

59
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,980
If anything, we need a light one.

60
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,380
We need a planet of female human breasts

61
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,820
so that Mr. Sister's dream of the sea of titties can come true.

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
His and our crumbs.

63
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,960
Oh, really?

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,240
Oh, you didn't see that cartoon?

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,040
I thought that was a sea of keisters.

66
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,500
Well, you got that, too.

67
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,640
And then there's the Hal Robbins 50-mile road of knives.

68
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,520
That wasn't...

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,980
That wasn't a good thing.

70
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,500
No.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
No, not any more than Dr. Legume's planet of broken glass,

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,220
which I'm sure he'd like to send us all to just for fun.

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,540
Well, you have to ask Dr. Legume about that.

74
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,080
Well, I guess we don't have to worry about planning our rupture for another year.

75
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,680
We are far away from having to plan that than we will be later on in the year.

76
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,320
So, uh...

77
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,660
The year...

78
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,240
The human mind is always circled around knowledge of such things,

79
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,760
but has never attained it.

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,860
Well, it sure scares the hell out of me.

81
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,380
Should we do a traditional second countdown?

82
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,680
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.

83
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,920
Hey, guys! Welcome to the...

84
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,260
Oh, they don't count in base ten. That's the problem.

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,100
Oh, it's always something.

86
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,140
The hell?

87
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,100
Well, I'm Junior Whispero Baptist.

88
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,660
He faced us.

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,340
I'm Junior Heaven's Gate?

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,400
Same difference.

91
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,660
Well, smoke if you got them.

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,400
Well...

93
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,880
Damn.

94
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,620
Well...

95
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,560
Now, remember, folks, don't look at me and don't blame Bob.

96
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,400
It was the men from Planet X that made that whole...

97
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,480
I want triple my money back.

98
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,620
Not yet.

99
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,760
Although...

100
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,620
We did that already.

101
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,080
There's one thing that we haven't publicly announced,

102
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,680
and I guess this would be the time to mention it.

103
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,960
You know the original handwritten note that says,

104
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,400
the world ends July 5th...

105
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,160
7 a.m. July 5th, 1998.

106
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,600
And you know there was the little mix-up with the 1998

107
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,940
where it appeared that it had somehow been written upside down

108
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,120
and then turned back over, and so we weren't sure.

109
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,840
Well, we did a carbon dating on the note.

110
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,400
And everything was fine,

111
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,120
except that it's...

112
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,280
It seemed that the words...

113
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:32,200
The letters L-Y had been added to the J-U years later.

114
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,340
Like, most of the note dated from around 1953,

115
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,280
which would make sense.

116
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,420
But then the L-Y was added carefully

117
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,400
with a very similar ballpoint pen,

118
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,060
but not quite the same ink.

119
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,260
And that was where the FBI detected the little discrepancy.

120
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,520
So it...

121
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,240
Could have said June 5th.

122
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,860
Just to let everybody know, this is new information.

123
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,000
It could be June.

124
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,780
There was somebody added the lie.

125
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,340
I don't understand. I don't get it.

126
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,680
Now, we have a spare microphone up here.

127
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Yes, we can call for another yakker.

128
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,440
One more.

129
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,860
Fat Mandy is waving her hand.

130
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,360
She might just be the one to save this so-called show.

131
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,280
Well, she wasn't up at 7 a.m. this morning, and we were...

132
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,260
Oh, no, Fat Mandy. Do we have a chair?

133
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,140
Oh, um, no. All the chairs...

134
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,080
Here.

135
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,840
We will, in just a moment.

136
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,960
We have a chair and a cherub for Fat Mandy.

137
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,540
No, we have the chair.

138
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,780
We have the chair and the cherub.

139
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,740
Can you get a seat?

140
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,620
And that cherub is yours.

141
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,060
Test your microphone there.

142
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,800
Now, see, there's somebody who knows how to use a mic.

143
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,160
Yes, you put your lips right near it instead of being way back here.

144
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:17,500
For some reason, we couldn't get our other ranters to perform basic radio maneuvers like putting the lips near the mic.

145
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,420
But at least we have one that does now.

146
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,660
I like putting my lips near a mic.

147
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,540
Next to you, putting your lips near a mic.

148
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Next to Ivan, putting his lips near a mic.

149
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,260
And we all three are putting our lips near a mic together.

150
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,300
The triumvirate of hovering lips.

151
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,860
I'm in love, baby. Let's get married.

152
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,000
Can such...

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,600
Can we all get married later?

154
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,760
...closed lips perceive?

155
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,120
We can all get married now.

156
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,220
We can all get married now?

157
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:46,920
By the power invested in me, I now pronounce us all man, wife, thing, it, and wallet.

158
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,440
Irrevocably married.

159
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,020
Okay, that's done. We're all married.

160
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,560
Yay!

161
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,720
Oh, I don't know.

162
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,400
I can't wait to consummate it.

163
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,280
You are all forgiven for any sins, and you can do anything you want to from now on.

164
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,840
That's it. Easy, wasn't it?

165
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,180
Well, that's worth the price of salvation right there, I'll tell you what.

166
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,020
I have to put in a slight warning. There is a qualification.

167
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,080
The police can still also do whatever they want as well.

168
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,220
Ah, Senator Speck is here.

169
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,640
That means we'll have the beat. The beat.

170
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,780
Right.

171
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,760
The thing that makes the kids go wild. The beat.

172
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,600
Is it gonna be a dance party?

173
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,340
Yeah, there is gonna be a... There'll be a dance party as soon as I can get to it.

174
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,460
I like dancing.

175
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,040
A dance party in my pants.

176
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,400
Where are we dancing?

177
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,600
At... actually, the...

178
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,080
Right here.

179
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,620
...the ball. I don't know where the ball is.

180
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,320
I thought it was here.

181
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,040
We don't know yet.

182
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,240
We don't know yet.

183
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,720
We don't... You know, and that's the mystery.

184
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,980
At this time, we haven't been told.

185
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,760
The beauty...

186
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,400
The search of the subgenius, we don't know yet.

187
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,000
But unlike most of the bullshit religions, we admit it.

188
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,420
...don't know where the ball is.

189
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,520
Oh, what about...

190
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,540
We don't know a damn thing.

191
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,740
We don't know where the hell the ball is.

192
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,360
Except...

193
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,500
We know we can trust in Bob.

194
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,740
Praise Bob.

195
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,580
We can trust Bob to screw us.

196
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,560
But he'll probably do it the good way. Some ways are fun.

197
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,420
As G. Gordon Gordon once said.

198
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,640
He said a lot of things, that G. Gordon Gordon.

199
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I quote...

200
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:28,560
Well, you know, the early doctors were fed a lot of Bob's garbage.

201
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:35,560
He would flush his thoughts directly into the heads of whoever he could find.

202
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,640
And there weren't that many subgeniuses in 1980.

203
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,860
And all of them have their...

204
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,340
They're on the board of directors now.

205
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,320
Every single one of them.

206
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,420
We...

207
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,500
You know, to some of us, Dr. Legume is a new kid.

208
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,620
Well, it's a pity.

209
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,760
G. Gordon Gordon couldn't be among us at this X-Day.

210
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,220
But we have every confidence that in the fullness of time, he shall return.

211
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,180
Not this year.

212
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,160
You sure have a pretty mouth fat, Mandy.

213
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,960
I'll put some glitter on it for you later if you're lucky.

214
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,700
Is that where all that glitter came?

215
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,500
I keep finding...

216
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,220
I'm still finding glitter all over me.

217
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
It's pervasive.

218
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,220
It never goes away.

219
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,200
Does it just grow at outdoor festivals, glitter?

220
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,340
It gets in your eyes and cuts tiny little cuts into your cornea?

221
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,000
The animals that try to eat each other...

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,800
Glitter causes eye butthurt.

223
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,380
Eye flutter?

224
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,420
Eye butthurt.

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,860
Oh, eye butthurt.

226
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,900
Glitter causes eye butthurt.

227
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,220
Eye butthurt New York.

228
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,580
How would you spell that in glyphs?

229
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,260
I don't know.

230
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,200
I've got a great idea.

231
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,200


232
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,200


233
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,200


234
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,200


235
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,140
Somebody made a shirt that's Eye Dobbshead New York.

236
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,280
It's my second favorite to the one with Eye King Kong New York.

237
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,380
Well, first you have to get to New York.

238
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,540
Yeah, right.

239
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,620
Then you need your giant monster or to become a giant monster.

240
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,480
To channel or unleash your own inner giant monster.

241
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,820
I thought I was going to be a giant monster by now.

242
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,740
Honestly, I thought we were going to get aboard those saucers at seven.

243
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,720
I'd be a giant monster tearing up Tokyo or Dallas.

244
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,240
There will be other times.

245
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,420
Dallas has never been destroyed by a giant monster.

246
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,280
Not yet.

247
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,440
Yeah.

248
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,840
Yes, and what kind of giant monster?

249
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,740
Perhaps grasshoppers.

250
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,180
Huge grasshoppers like at the beginning of the end.

251
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,140
They were in Chicago.

252
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:41,460
With wings of flame.

253
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,380
Huge grasshoppers invaded Chicago.

254
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,140
I don't know if anything ever invaded Dallas though.

255
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,720
They were so powerful.

256
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:48,720


257
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,400
They were so powerful that they could leave their shadows on the sky.

258
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,520
As they crawled up buildings, they would keep crawling, go off the building onto the sky.

259
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,120
And it would just die the sky with a giant flying, flaming cricket shadow?

260
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Well, it was an easy special effect.

261
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,000
They had a photograph of buildings on a...

262
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
With grasshoppers crawling on them.

263
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,060
But we shouldn't really destroy the magic by telling how it's done.

264
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,080
And then Las Vegas was invaded by the amazing colossal man, you know.

265
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,160
You know, he'd have to be a lot more colossal to invade Las Vegas now because it's much

266
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,560
bigger than it was in the amazing colossal.

267
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,960
We could bring locusts.

268
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,380
I brought locusts to a gig once, a puppet show.

269
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,740
Puppet show locusts during the trials and tribulations of Dirty Santa.

270
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,280
Locusts.

271
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,460
Did people freak out to have insects in the room?

272
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,300
Well, not so much because we made them out of paper and rice inside.

273
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,000
And we shook them and they made...

274
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,160
And another locust came and carried away a grain of wheat.

275
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,080
I hate it when my wheat's missing.

276
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,900
Until finally, Pharaoh was bankrupt, as you know.

277
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:07,280
I may have mentioned this, Dr. Legume made a pinata filled with locusts just to scare the girls.

278
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,120
But the girl who broke the pinata happened to be an insectologist.

279
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,220
So she loved it when Legume's insect legions showered down on her.

280
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,440
Yeah, you can...

281
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,300
Locust failed.

282
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,260
So, Fat Mandy, are you going to be performing tonight with your new cherub?

283
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,260
I'm going to be performing tonight.

284
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,200
I hadn't worked a number out with the cherub yet, but she could come to rehearsal.

285
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,060
We have to have rehearsal.

286
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,560
Do we still have time for rehearsal?

287
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,020
Dr. Hal and Princess Weed, do we still have time?

288
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,980
Well, I don't know.

289
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,040
We're going to have to make some time.

290
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,520
Maybe.

291
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
I wanted to play...

292
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,560
I wanted to do the...

293
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,480
I wanted to debut...

294
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,520
Dr. Hal's hit single, X Day, My Subgenius Home.

295
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,480
I thought we rehearsed that in Pittsburgh.

296
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,800
Yeah, but Hal wasn't there.

297
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,640
We wandered into some bar and just took over and rehearsed for X Day.

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,780
We did.

299
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,040
It was like a dress rehearsal that we charged people to come to.

300
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,040
And we made tens and tens of dollars.

301
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,120
Then I awoke.

302
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,740
It was just a dream.

303
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:20,720
My thirst for Slatnot in pain I find.

304
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:30,820
I wrote out a check to Ivan Stang and signed the bottom line.

305
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,200
Oh Bob, won't you let me live?

306
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,000
And all that is mine, I, John, surely will give.

307
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:54,320
Oh lift me away in your great shining ship To my Subgenius home.

308
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:09,520
Oh wear me away in your great shining ship To my Subgenius home.

309
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,480
Vamos a effectivement.

310
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,480


311
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,480


312
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,480


313
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:13,520


314
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:13,560
This stage is quiet, though invite the audience.

315
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:13,640
It's good.

316
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,640


317
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,640


318
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,640


319
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,640


320
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,640


321
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,640


322
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,640


323
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,640


324
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,440
Reverend Angry Larry, do you know if the slot rods are going to be playing tonight?

325
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,980
Oh, good. Okay, so that's three extra things on the...

326
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,860
This will be a packed night.

327
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,500
It'll be a marathon, epic night.

328
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,880
We want as many girls dancing on stage as possible.

329
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,040
Oh, that's good. I'm wearing my mermaid costume.

330
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,420
Did you hear that, everyone?

331
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,480
It's a surf beach party.

332
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,720
Enough preaching. I want to hear Tommy Amoeba.

333
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,220
Enough. Enough.

334
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,960
Reverend Angry Larry wants a beach party tonight.

335
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,660
He wants girls in swimsuits dancing on stage during the performance.

336
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,240
I want girls in swimsuits dancing on stage during the slot rod set as well.

337
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,060
Well, you just have to make it known, and then it can happen.

338
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,180
But who brings a swimsuit to a clothing optional campground?

339
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,580
Well, a bikini thing is a surf thing.

340
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,320
Production needed to send out a memo about this.

341
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,760

guitar solo

369
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,980
guitar solo

370
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,040
Anyway, that's all part of the beach party.

371
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,380
It will crown the evening's entertainment.

372
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,420
I think there's going to be crowning?

373
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,780
It will be the summit of the whole Fandango.

374
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,680
Therein we supply our own Annette Funicello.

375
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,820
Stick was telling us he's going to dress up as Annette Funicello.

376
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,420
Nice.

377
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,460
Yes, Annette Funicello.

378
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,240
Yes.

379
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,980
Star of stage screenplay.

380
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,800
And other important notes.

381
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,560
There's this stuff out there that seems to try to capture your feet called mud.

382
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,720
I don't know if you're familiar with mud.

383
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,100
It has a consistency not unlike the Play-Doh you ate as a child.

384
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,460
The romance of mud.

385
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,520
Please be careful in the mud because unlike the Play-Doh you ate as a child, it is very slippery.

386
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,440
You can't hurt mud.

387
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,900
You can stomp on it.

388
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,800
No, I'm more worried about them, not the mud.

389
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,460
Oh, okay.

390
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,060
I trust the mud can take care of itself.

391
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,260
That's right.

392
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,080
The mud does quite a fine job taking care of itself.

393
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,340
And in fact, apparently it's very prolific in reproduction, I've noticed.

394
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,560
It'll try and kill you.

395
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,200
It will.

396
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,460
It will try to kill you.

397
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:31,360
But now we have the sunshine and the mud will be busily melting away until the next down blast from the heavens.

398
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,160
And since the Exist didn't show up again.

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,560
Occupied as they were by their own concerns.

400
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,460
And we won't even worry about who to blame, Stang.

401
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,940
But I now that the planet isn't going to be destroyed today.

402
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,300
It actually was.

403
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,900
As far as we know.

404
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,480
It was.

405
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:04,160
We're all on the same pleasure dome because I got a text message and apparently the rupture happened and we just didn't notice.

406
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,740
Well, whatever.

407
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,440
Whatever planet we're on.

408
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,820
It's ours for now.

409
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,900
So please clean up your crap.

410
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,960
Huh?

411
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,040
Thank you.

412
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,140
You know, I mean, we're stuck with this one for at least another year.

413
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:22,920
Okay.

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,420
So could you please pick up the crap you left out?

415
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,240
Leave no trace.

416
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,860
Right.

417
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:28,580
Yeah.

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,580
Okay.

419
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,560
Could you please organize your crap into neat orderly piles?

420
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,540
And the crap that you wish to no longer.

421
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:36,900
Keep.

422
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,220
There's an organized pile called a trash can.

423
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,520
Just throw the crap pile.

424
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,760
Thank you.

425
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,560
Thank you.

426
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,520
Well, I mean, not to be all Mama Pisces and all.

427
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,780
You don't throw your beer bottles down the pooper scoopers.

428
00:21:52,840 --> 00:22:04,240
You know, Mandy, I think you may be part and I'm not sure, but I've been informed that any any subgenius that has boobs.

429
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,660
Boobs.

430
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,340
Or.

431
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,400
And or a vagina is part of something called the matriarchy.

432
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,700
The matriarchy.

433
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:13,580
Yes.

434
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,620
Apparently, the matriarchy is some is different than the hierarchy.

435
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:33,800
We are some other group who are secretly controlling everything, including we and Petal and all of the other and the other females in the church are apparently I was informed are taking over.

436
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,460
Oh.

437
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,460
And the matriarchy is.

438
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,260
Well, just let me know when the meeting over.

439
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,640
Good.

440
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,520
They can take over all the responsibility and do all the work.

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,100
It's about time.

442
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,640
You know, we get credit.

443
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,460
Been too unequal for so long.

444
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,160
Yes.

445
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,500
You're the maniarchs.

446
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,820
Yes.

447
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,500
The maniarchs versus the matriarchs.

448
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,460
Friends.

449
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:58,860
Roman.

450
00:22:59,500 --> 00:22:59,980
Subgeni.

451
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,540
Yeti.

452
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:02,980
Please.

453
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,480
When playing with your purse, would you so with safety?

454
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,000
I got a brand new two tone dad.

455
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,220
Do I got it just for you?

456
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,640
You know, I can do with my friend.

457
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,700
You do.

458
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,180
Don't die.

459
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,260
Do I simply hope the hairs do not hide away?

460
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,120
Then you might.

461
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,320
Don't that.

462
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,000
Do this.

463
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,320
They already think.

464
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,880
So I'll show it to you anyway.

465
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,900
I can't.

466
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,420
You.

467
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,760
We are.

468
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,800
I mean, I'm not.

469
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:44,980
Yeah.

470
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,780
I'm not.

471
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm not.

472
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm not.

473
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:56,560
You don't need to go all the way into town and try to find out and find a laundry mat.

474
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,560
No, no, no.

475
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,620
You don't need to do that.

476
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,900
You can go over to that merchandise table and buy with cash money.

477
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,780
New clean mud.

478
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,290
Beer and sweat free clothing for you to wear.

479
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:16,750
And you can anoint it yourself with your own mud, beer and sweat while performing a good

480
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,030
service and donating to the home for slackless children.

481
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,770
So please pay attention to priestess Pisces admonition.

482
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,210
Wow.

483
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:33,830
We have a wonderful T-shirt showing an egg is growing a chicken for the bulldog auction.

484
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,930
Just a preview of the.

485
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,010
Bulldog auction.

486
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:43,930
It's kind of a small size that we might need it for a small person like Mickey.

487
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,690
Large small.

488
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,650
Large.

489
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,950
It's a small large.

490
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,250
Large ain't as large as it used to be.

491
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:57,490
I thought shirts came in small, medium XL, extra large, elephantine and circus tent.

492
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,970
Well, anyway, it's it'll fit most people apparently.

493
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,010
Small, large for large, small.

494
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,030
Small.

495
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,650
Oh, okay.

496
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,370
Well, you know, the bigger they are, the nicer they are.

497
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,510
Why is there poo poo on this table?

498
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,990
I thought Reverend Stang had given up poo poo.

499
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,310
No, not at all.

500
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,890
Those were brought up as a gift.

501
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,890
And unfortunately, the octopus inside that can is dead.

502
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,970
He was chewing on that octopus the other day.

503
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,110
And I think we all partook of it in some degree.

504
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,990
Perhaps taking into ourselves some of the life.

505
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,170
The likeness of the octopus.

506
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,810
It's insortado.

507
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,350
They're just so smart.

508
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,150
And that's really the thing that freaks me out about eating them.

509
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:47,310
It's not the squeakiness of their flesh and the suckers as they grasp at my gums so much

510
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,570
as the fact that I know it's really intelligent.

511
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,850
And it's full of proteenas.

512
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,910
It is full of proteenas.

513
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:01,410
You see, the primitive believes that by consuming something, one gains its attributes.

514
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,970
And so perhaps we can be similarly similar.

515
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,030
Primitive.

516
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,450
Or just let Stang have all the octopus for himself.

517
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,710
Give me that poo poo.

518
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:21,370
Now all this stuff is going to be filtered and organized and then appear in some form on the radio at some future time.

519
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:28,070
Just as the poo poo is filtered and organized after Stang consumes it and appears in...

520
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,110
Never mind.

521
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,750
Well, you can carry that analogy along, certainly.

522
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,750
I saw a man make pasta out of squid once.

523
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:44,550
It doesn't say very nice things about our broadcast, but as soon as our broadcast is flushed out into the greater world, it can have some effect.

524
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,010
Can you make squid out of pasta?

525
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,210
Squid pasta.

526
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,730
Squid pasta.

527
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,410
He pureed the squid and he formed it like through a...

528
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,990
We were talking about the Play-Doh earlier.

529
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,870
Oh, okay.

530
00:26:54,930 --> 00:27:02,730
Kind of like a culinary Play-Doh machine that shot out all the crushed little squidlet bits into this long, strong...

531
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,530
It's stringy pasta, so it's like squid pasta.

532
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,150
But isn't squid kind of long and stringy anyway?

533
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,430
It sort of seems like...

534
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,850
It's long, but not necessarily stringy.

535
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,490
It has a nice al dente resilience.

536
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,730
I can tell you, as one who lives in San Francisco and has eaten plenty of squid...

537
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,930
Yeah, squid has always seemed to me like the bagel of the sea.

538
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,790
You bite into it and it fights back a little.

539
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,790
It bounces back.

540
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,750
Good bagels and it's not very sore.

541
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,770
It tests the temper of your teeth.

542
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:37,890
Well, and the amazing thing is if you look out in the audience, there are people who are really awestruck by the concept of actually eating squid.

543
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,710
They were doing something totally different with the squid than eating it.

544
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:50,370
You can see the sort of shocked expressions that you would actually eat a squid and not do other things with the squid.

545
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,510
A Squidly Diddley cartoon.

546
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,730
Yes, Diddley Diddley Squidly.

547
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,530
Some squids are for...

548
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,310
Wow, that's a beautiful pie you got there.

549
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,590
So what about that...

550
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,570
That pie that was inspired by Pisces dream that Princess We made last night.

551
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,070
That pie was an endless key lime pie.

552
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,810
It was. It was incredible.

553
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,150
And practically everybody here had some...

554
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,250
There might even be more.

555
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,030
It was a god pie.

556
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,190
There might even be more of the endless god pie.

557
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,910
A goddess pie. It was a pie of the goddess.

558
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:29,410
It was as if we had become sort of like Jesus with the loaves and the fishes, but instead it was with key lime pie.

559
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,550
A family key lime god pie.

560
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,690
A family key lime god pie.

561
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,750
A family key lime god pie.

562
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,870


563
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,210
A family key lime god pie.

564
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,110
It's coming man.

565
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,210
It's coming man.

566
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:42,310
It's coming man.

567
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,730
It's coming man.

568
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,390
It's coming man.

569
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,470
Actually the Greek gods used to do that.

570
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,570
But that's why it was key lime pie.

571
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,910
Jesus had been...

572
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,550
He wasn't very creative.

573
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:48,950
Jesus had been a girl.

574
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,650
He would have absolutely multiplied pie and not fish.

575
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,670
I know. I mean it was the best he came up with at the time.

576
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:55,730
It was a very male thing.

577
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,330
You know what I mean?

578
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,570
These crusty old peasants didn't eat a lot of pie in Jerusalem in the first century.

579
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:00,570


580
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,570
Speak for your ancestors.

581
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:12,810
Well, at any event, these pie eating prophets couldn't realize the culinary ambitions of today.

582
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:19,950
Because with our greater equipment, we have the ability to produce finer and larger pies.

583
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,010
I've dreamed about your greater equipment for so many years, Dr. Hal.

584
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,810
Yes, in today's scientific world.

585
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,550
I wake up sweating in the night wondering about your greater equipment and princess Weedle.

586
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,070
Oh, Bob.

587
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,010
Well, it's hard to keep everything in mind.

588
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:41,570
To keep all these mental plates in the air as one juggles them and compartmentalizes.

589
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,710
Always with the circus analogy.

590
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,250
But as subgeniuses, we're good at it.

591
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,790
The mental plates of mine tend to be metal plates and they clang a lot against each other.

592
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,510
Metal plates on the end of poles or broom handles.

593
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:52,990
Yes, yes, yes.

594
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,570
They crash a lot and they clank.

595
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,110
Stacked by greater equipment.

596
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,450
And they reflect light and blind my vision.

597
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:00,530
I'm not sure if you're a fan of metal plates.

598
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:00,530


599
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:00,530


600
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:00,530


601
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:00,530


602
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,050
Yes, it's thinner than normal.

603
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,050


604
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,070
They flash upon the inner eye when the sun hits them.

605
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,330
They flash upon that inner eye that is the bliss of solitude.

606
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,730
I get blinded a lot in my...

607
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,590
Mine's eye.

608
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,830
I don't think it's my third eye.

609
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,170
On the inside of mine.

610
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,250
I think it's my sixth or seventh eye and...

611
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,890
Painfully dry is the inside of mine inner eye.

612
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,510
And then I've got that other eye.

613
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,070
I think it's the fourth eye that is the one that has the cross-eyed problem.

614
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,130
Like the angels that the prophet Ezekiel saw that had multitudinous eyeballs.

615
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,950
My third eye has a horrible stigmatism.

616
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,670
I'm sorry to hear it.

617
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,070
A wandering, lazy eye, eh?

618
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,890
No, I have a Dobbs head on my left retina.

619
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,330
I think it's my left retina.

620
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,830
You know, these days they can make

621
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,090
those things that fit in your eyes,

622
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,450
you know, what are they called?

623
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,770
Contact lenses.

624
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,950
Yes, with little Dobbs heads on them

625
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,730
and other things on them.

626
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,810
If you want to go that far,

627
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,390
they'll put anything on a contact lens.

628
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,350
So you can have slit reptile eyes

629
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,530
or eyes with little faces or whatever.

630
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,270
There's a company that does it.

631
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,770
There are crazy, crazy pinks

632
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,830
who will actually tattoo their eyeballs.

633
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,330
Oh, they tattoo their eyes.

634
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,530
I've seen the tattooed eyes.

635
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,990
They will tattoo their eyeballs.

636
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,190
I think it guarantees blindness

637
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,590
in like seven to ten years, I think.

638
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,130
I don't know nothing about that.

639
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,370
I recently discovered something else

640
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,850
that was quite interesting,

641
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,010
which is that lightning,

642
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,350
when it strikes some individuals,

643
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,690
in some cases produces not a fatality,

644
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,950
but a beautiful tattoo that looks artificial,

645
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,990
but goes down the arm with all sorts of curlicues

646
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,410
and twists, but it's actually subcutaneous damage

647
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,990
from a lightning strike.

648
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,870
Has anybody ever seen or heard of this?

649
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,510
Pretty amazing, huh?

650
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,510
No, but could you do it like,

651
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,950
do you think the tattoo parlors of the future

652
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,810
will have mini Tesla coils?

653
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,050
No, because only God can produce this.

654
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,790
You can't get this tattoo and you might just get fried.

655
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,830
You have no idea whether you're going to get

656
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,390
a lightning tattoo or not,

657
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:09,010
but you can see pictures of lightning tattooed individuals

658
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,570
on the internet and they've got fairly cool marks

659
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,390
that just come from being struck by lightning.

660
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,690
But they'll try anyway.

661
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,310
They'll go to the tattoo parlor

662
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,370
and they'll demand that they be electrocuted.

663
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,050
If they're cheapskates

664
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,490
and don't want to pay for an artist to do it.

665
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,550
And they'll try anyway.

666
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,550
It's the sad thing that us,

667
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,010
this is, have you noticed,

668
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,690
Dr. Hal, that more and more

669
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,230
you look around and you realize

670
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,670
that there's a huge problem

671
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,070
because the subgenius is the smartest,

672
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,250
most responsible person in the room?

673
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,070
That can't be.

674
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,110
That's a terrible comment.

675
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,630
It is an utterly frightening situation

676
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,650
where you look around

677
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,190
and it's like, that just can't be.

678
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,470
Why am I, the subgenius,

679
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,770
the most intelligent

680
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,870
and responsible person in this room?

681
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,370
And that's why I love X-Day

682
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:57,990
because, you know,

683
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,330
because I'm not.

684
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,510
I'm not.

685
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,330
I'm not.

686
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,290
You're saying there's something unpatriotic in people's minds

687
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:35,350
about singing the Star Spangled Banner with your fist down your throat?

688
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,030
Well, that wasn't what it was.

689
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,470
Oh.

690
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,610
I can't remember what I did.

691
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,350
Was I tap dancing?

692
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,190
You were.

693
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,990
Was it the tap dance?

694
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,950
Just the hat tap dance?

695
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,550
Because Mimi does the Star Spangled Banner with her fist in her mouth.

696
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,830
I consider myself a very patriotic person.

697
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,190
I do.

698
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,630
What it was, was she was.

699
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,430
I love my country.

700
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:56,070
She was singing and jumping up and down with Uncle Sam's eyes on her breasts

701
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,290
and Uncle Sam's face painted on her body and a giant Uncle Sam hat.

702
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,270
And it was.

703
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,670
It was a tribute to 9-11.

704
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,130
And perhaps you were tap dancing.

705
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:05,850
They just hate boobs.

706
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,230
I was in the back, but the management took it all wrong.

707
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,510
I meant it with sincerity.

708
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,110
No, they just hate boobs.

709
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,050
They're boob haters.

710
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,910
You have to deal with these Philistines.

711
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,290
They're not artistic souls with an artistic temperament.

712
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,050
They're bigoted towards boobs.

713
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,010
If they hate boobs, they probably hate Bob.

714
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:28,470
Because as Reverend Angry Larry said, the only difference between Bob and boob is 1-0.

715
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,830
1-0?

716
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:30,930
1-0.

717
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,230
1-0.

718
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,870
1-0.

719
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,290
1-0.

720
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,070
And everybody likes boobs.

721
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:40,550
So, to summarize, tonight there are all sorts of things packed into the evening.

722
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,290
Involving boobs.

723
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,270
So much that no one person can hardly hope to attend them all.

724
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,650
You're going to have to check what act you want to see.

725
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,930
But they will follow in dizzying, bewildering succession,

726
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,350
making this the greatest X-Day variety show act night of all time.

727
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,350
I forgot how many O's.

728
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,010
Bob.

729
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,450
Bob.

730
00:34:59,450 --> 00:34:59,730
Bar none.

731
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,750
It's going to be good.

732
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,810
And we can keep it moving because we still have that big shepherd's crook that Reverend 808 made.

733
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,150
The hook.

734
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,830
It's big enough to pull a whole band off of the stuff.

735
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,730
Yes, if you're grandstanding, you might see that hook coming your way.

736
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,230
But just to keep things happening.

737
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,970
Was it a band band?

738
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,490
Such as in SF, Ed Holmes uses on Michael Pepe all the time.

739
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,330
The shepherd's crook of a hook.

740
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:26,430
The shepherd's crook.

741
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,650
But let's throw the discussion open to new things and new business.

742
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,470
I'll bet you have some new topics for us, Mandy.

743
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,030
I was still thinking about booze.

744
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,130
It was a band band, the date rapists.

745
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,030
Because one of them was a...

746
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,570
Who banned the date rapists?

747
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,530
Well, one of them crapped in the hot tub.

748
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,490
All right, crapping in the hot tub.

749
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:54,870
Crapping in the hot tub is well worth banning.

750
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,930
You should be banned for that.

751
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,070
I have no sympathy.

752
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,650
I was wondering if there was a band band.

753
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,850
Yeah, that...

754
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,310
I mean, you can be banned for a legitimate reason.

755
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,550
You can be an asshole, and that's why they ban you.

756
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,550
But, of course, we're talking about martyrs who were banned for their art.

757
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:09,810
Right, right.

758
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,430
That's what I was thinking.

759
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,650
Did you hear about that girl in Pittsburgh at the CMU who got banned?

760
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,870
She was dressed as the Pope from the waist up,

761
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,910
and she was naked from the waist down,

762
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,690
and she'd shaved her pubic hair in the shape of a cross.

763
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,550
That sounds holy, holy.

764
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,310
And, yeah, I can't...

765
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,310


766
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,190
I remember she got...

767
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,650
It was in the Carnegie Mellon University Art Parade

768
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,290
for their annual tech fair,

769
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,730
their little nerdy carnival that they throw.

770
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,470
It's a pretty cool event.

771
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,270
And, yeah, there was an art parade,

772
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,750
and she dressed as the Pope,

773
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,850
and I can't remember exactly what she was protesting.

774
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,450
Lord knows it's an awful lot to protest in the Catholic Church.

775
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,450
Even with this new Pope who's all humble

776
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,010
and washes people's feet and so on?

777
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,290
I didn't know the new Pope gave pedicures.

778
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,490
He washes your feet, just like Jesus,

779
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,430
only he doesn't dry them with his hair because he hasn't got any.

780
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,370
But he's as humble as can be.

781
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:03,770
Wow, old Pope.

782
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,090
Yeah, I've heard the new Pope is a little cooler than the old Pope.

783
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:07,110
And they're terrified.

784
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,290
They're terrified of this Pope

785
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,390
because he's threatening to give away the store.

786
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,410
He came out and said that

787
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,750
it really doesn't matter if you're a Catholic.

788
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,670
As long as you're good, you'll come to God.

789
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,290
What?

790
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:21,450
Yes, and so the church fathers immediately put out a press release saying,

791
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,550
well, of course, the only way to God

792
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,610
to God is through his revealed church.

793
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,290
And the only way to the saucers

794
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:28,610
is $35.

795
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,090
To add to the confusion, there's still the old Pope wandering around.

796
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,950
The Pope Emeritus.

797
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,230
It's like the Middle Ages when there were two Popes.

798
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,050
We've got that again.

799
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,830
Although one is not the official guy.

800
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,330
So anything could happen

801
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,190
in these end times.

802
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,550
And you can, as a subgenius,

803
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,170
be a Pope if you'd like.

804
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,230
Or a Popess, or a Priestess,

805
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,110
or a Bishop.

806
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,070
And I would imagine

807
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,550
there's hundreds of subgenius Popes

808
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,790
running around.

809
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,210
Raise your hand out in the

810
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,750
live studio audience

811
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,790
if you are a Pope.

812
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,130
Do we have any Popes?

813
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,190
There is a Pope there.

814
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,050
You have a Pope card.

815
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:07,770
You're a Pope.

816
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,450
They're a Pope.

817
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,310
Everyone a Pope.

818
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,050
Oh, and lovely Joy has decided

819
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,810
that she would like to be a Pope today as well.

820
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,530
There's another Pope over there.

821
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,030
A father.

822
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,230
We definitely have more Popes

823
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,030
than the Catholic Church.

824
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,350
I certainly know we have more Bishops.

825
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,850
And I think that gives us

826
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,050
a one-up on them, honestly.

827
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,550
I think that definitely proves that

828
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,590
while we may not have gilded thrones

829
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:34,930
and

830
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,930
written boy apartments

831
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,190
above the hierarchy

832
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,590
trailers and

833
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,770
none of that, but we do have

834
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,010
many more Popes.

835
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,590
And Bishops.

836
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,130
And they have a power that the Pope

837
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,870
of the Vatican would kill

838
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,050
for, which is the power to fail.

839
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,410
We have fallible Popes

840
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,010
based on the great fallibility

841
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,530
of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

842
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,470
who makes a million bucks

843
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,770
every time he screws up.

844
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,090
Yes, and then he never shares it

845
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:08,350
with his friends.

846
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,790
That extra power.

847
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,150
I appreciate the power to fail.

848
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,630
It makes me feel so much better

849
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,170
that if something's not working out,

850
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,250
I can just say, fuck it.

851
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,530
But you don't have that

852
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,230
chicken John fail to win thing

853
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,790
where...

854
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,690
Oh, I got that book.

855
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,650
That's a good slogan.

856
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,390
Fail to win.

857
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,610
That's his slogan.

858
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,850
That's why there's that mural

859
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,710
of him sitting on a tree limb

860
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,670
sawing it off.

861
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,030
He believes somehow that there's a good thing

862
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,990
about failing, or claims that he does.

863
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,830
I preferred his previous

864
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,670
pronouncements.

865
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,150
He used to say,

866
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,930
we who have done so little

867
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,170
for so long

868
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,710
for absolutely no reason.

869
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,490
I'm messing it up.

870
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,450
We who have done so much

871
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,230
with so little for so long

872
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,210
are now completely qualified

873
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,030
to do anything at any time

874
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,070
for any reason.

875
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,310
Okay, enough free publicity

876
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,430
for chicken John.

877
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,610
He really doesn't need it.

878
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,370
He's a meaning well soul.

879
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,790
Oh, he's okay.

880
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,450
He's fine.

881
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,250
He doesn't need help

882
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:10,250


883
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,530
He's not as hot as you are, though.

884
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,210
That's for sure.

885
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,550
He's busy with his wonderful,

886
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,390
notable wonders and undertaking.

887
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,210
Hal has such a sexy brain.

888
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,870
Hal has a sexy everything.

889
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,730
We should also be creating

890
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,390
new subgenius developments

891
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,430
all the time.

892
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,730
I think you and I should create

893
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,270
some new subgeniuses right now.

894
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,670
We're not going to rest

895
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,750
in the old forms,

896
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,230
but come up with new stuff

897
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,130
all the time.

898
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,530
We're malleable.

899
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,110
It's frothy.

900
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,770
It's frothy and churning.

901
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,730
Bob himself takes his

902
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,510
mystical, large,

903
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,770
strong hands

904
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,890
and squeezes

905
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,770
and molds up

906
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,110
us.

907
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:52,830
Whoa.

908
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,210
He shall mold thy spirit

909
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,810
and by giving,

910
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,890
make it ask.

911
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,650
Make it ask?

912
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,930
Make it ask.

913
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,290
It's a rhythmic, gentle

914
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,290
tugging that moves us

915
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,650
towards

916
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,150
sleep,

917
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,190
somnolence, unconsciousness,

918
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,690
blissful

919
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,090
oblivion.

920
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,750
I usually roll over and sleep afterwards.

921
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,630
Yeah, I will agree.

922
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,770
Well, I suppose we,

923
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,870
we can roll that over

924
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,310
and continue.

925
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,530
From PR News in Washington,

926
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,730
I'm getting bigger.

927
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,570
Widened by more than a third.

928
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,470
PR's report says

929
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,030
the Army sought tax-exempt status.

930
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,750
IRS senior officials have testified

931
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,350
that the agency's actions

932
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:39,990
were inappropriate.

933
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,810
They were driven by

934
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,230
illegal political bias.

935
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,430
Vladimir Putin says

936
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,150
weakness reflects strength

937
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,290
and sophisticated

938
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,750
air defense activity.

939
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,370
Russia says

940
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,530
Vladimir is backing

941
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,730
Walmart's hands.

942
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,330
Walmart says

943
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,290
this is PR.

944
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,790
Walmart says

945
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,370
it will cut out PR news.

946
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,630
Everything will happen.

947
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,170
It's just a matter of when.

948
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,450
And can,

949
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,150
and, and that's okay.

950
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,030
We'll just yell really loud

951
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,190
and say it's right now.

952
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,910
That thing that you wanted to happen

953
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,410
will happen.

954
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,490
That thing.

955
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,230
That thing is going on right now.

956
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,710
Are the movies gonna happen?

957
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:19,730
The movies are gone.

958
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,670
The movies happen all the time.

959
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,350
The movies are gone.

960
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:21,750
The movies left.

961
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,530
The movies,

962
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,030
the movies took a nap.

963
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,510
What about Grindhouse?

964
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,310
Grindhouse runs 24 hours.

965
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:27,650
Oh, oh, there's the,

966
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,030
those movies are on.

967
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:29,410
Yes.

968
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,450
Any time.

969
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,110
Oh, I'm sorry.

970
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,010
I meant to say

971
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,870
you can take a nap.

972
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,170
There'll be one in progress.

973
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,230
There's an always,

974
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:35,650
you know,

975
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,310
Monster movies?

976
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,430
There'll be always

977
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,330
a place to sit

978
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,290
and watch the monster movies.

979
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,570
And we were,

980
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,530
we dropped in on

981
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,110
From Beyond the other night

982
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,090
on the all-HP Lovecraft night.

983
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,510
There's always something

984
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,790
entertaining running

985
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,050
down at the Grindhouse.

986
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,330
And last year,

987
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,730
Jehovah One tried to stop

988
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,410
the Grindhouse

989
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,150
by hurling a lightning bolt

990
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,530
while we were broadcasting,

991
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,710
which traveled down the hill

992
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,230
into the grotto,

993
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,390
but didn't reach

994
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,250
the Grindhouse.

995
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,850
It sounds like a tattoo attempt.

996
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:06,890
It sounds like somebody

997
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:07,570
had an appointment.

998
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,150
Yeah, Reverend Feitzee Todd

999
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,570
saw the lightning bolt

1000
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,830
coming and threw himself

1001
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:12,710
in its path,

1002
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:13,850
shielding his equipment.

1003
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,610
We saw it.

1004
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,070
We were sitting right here

1005
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,050
and it blasted right out there

1006
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,870
during the day.

1007
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,110
I'll make room on this office.

1008
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:21,650
It's the one.

1009
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,970
Holy head shit.

1010
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:25,990
We have just...

1011
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,770
Don't worry, bro.

1012
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,170
I'm going to interrupt briefly

1013
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,410
for a point of business.

1014
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,170
You have 15 minutes

1015
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,190
to buy clean...

1016
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,290
I'm aware.

1017
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,030
...T-shirts with no mud,

1018
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,130
no beer,

1019
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,110
no vomit,

1020
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,030
no urine,

1021
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,330
no sweat.

1022
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,470
You won't have to do laundry.

1023
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,990
There are clean T-shirts

1024
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,670
over there.

1025
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,570
There may still be

1026
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,350
a beer koozie or two.

1027
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,870
And of course,

1028
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,830
as we talked about,

1029
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,510
the rare printings

1030
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,070
of Revelation X.

1031
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,230
Revelation X, yes.

1032
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,150
Bumper stickers

1033
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,050
and a number of other things.

1034
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,770
You have 15 minutes.

1035
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:04,470
Bumper stickers,

1036
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,290
but collectible.

1037
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,830
15 minutes left

1038
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,670
to go get off your butt

1039
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,110
and buy things.

1040
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,110
If they want to do that.

1041
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,670
Yes, these bumper stickers

1042
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,530
are so obsolete

1043
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,430
they have the Dallas

1044
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,990
post office box on them.

1045
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,330
They are intact.

1046
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,330
Intensely collectible.

1047
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:23,750
And we can't recommend

1048
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:24,410
them too much.

1049
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,250
And what about

1050
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,390
the little grinning

1051
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,370
Dobbs head pin?

1052
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,490
Don't you want to wear this

1053
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,170
during your non-subgenius

1054
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,510
downtime the rest of your life?

1055
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,270
When that mafia dude

1056
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,030
is about to blow your brains out,

1057
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,570
if he notices that pin

1058
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,610
at the last second,

1059
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,930
that could save you.

1060
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,910
Because as we know,

1061
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,910
criminals are a cowardly

1062
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,370
and superstitious lot.

1063
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,110
Are they afraid of

1064
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,210
cloisonnier?

1065
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,030
Aren't those cloisonnier?

1066
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,490
Is that how you pronounce it?

1067
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,970
They were.

1068
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,150
I don't really know.

1069
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:53,970
The cloisonnier.

1070
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:54,990
They used to be.

1071
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,750
They used to be cloisonnier.

1072
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,830
They're made by tiny children

1073
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,390
in the People's Republic of China

1074
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,930
these days.

1075
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,410
I love them.

1076
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,210
They have to paint every dot

1077
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,410
on that Dobbs head

1078
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,230
just right.

1079
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,070
That's right.

1080
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,710
They are forced to

1081
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,030
beating the shell and suit.

1082
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,090
Takes away their cigarettes.

1083
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,190
These are powerful objects.

1084
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:11,930
Also,

1085
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,410
Dobbs cufflinks.

1086
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,010
I mentioned these the other day.

1087
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,270
For all of you

1088
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:17,330
I see out there

1089
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,530
wearing French cuffs.

1090
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,330
But they could be

1091
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:20,810
conversation.

1092
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:21,870
conversation starters,

1093
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,710
conversation enders,

1094
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,950
conversation pieces.

1095
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:25,810
Are there any

1096
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,910
Dobbs head pasties yet?

1097
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,050
Do we have Dobbs head pasties?

1098
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,130
We've got to answer

1099
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,330
these things in advance.

1100
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,590
You have to cut them out.

1101
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,950
You have to cut the Dobbs head

1102
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:36,730
out yourself.

1103
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,490
And then you stick it on.

1104
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,510
We should get some nice

1105
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,070
Dobbs head pasties.

1106
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:41,490
Well,

1107
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,990
don't let me keep you back.

1108
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,570
Prepare them during the year

1109
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,610
before X-Day.

1110
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,110
And then we will ascend

1111
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,970
to glory in the saucers.

1112
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,410
Perfectly accoutered

1113
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,330
in the saucers.

1114
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,330
All our Dobbs head knick-knacks.

1115
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,690
Last time you and I

1116
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:55,510
got accoutered

1117
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,130
there was a dust storm

1118
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:58,850
and we couldn't see

1119
00:45:58,850 --> 00:45:59,930
anything for miles.

1120
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,690
I picked a large tick

1121
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,190
off myself at the pond

1122
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,550
but that's all the

1123
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,370
accoutering I got this year.

1124
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,770
I thought accouter

1125
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,350
means turtle

1126
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,490
in the language

1127
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,110
I was raised on.

1128
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:12,710
Well, it can

1129
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,890
because of the incredible

1130
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,770
flexibility of

1131
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,490
American colloquialism.

1132
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,170
It can be a turtle

1133
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:19,790
or a fish

1134
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,890
or a louse.

1135
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:21,530
Even.

1136
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,730
Well, a lot of people

1137
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:23,870
use the word cooter

1138
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,010
to describe a

1139
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,330
vagina.

1140
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,210
Like, as in

1141
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,410
I sure would like to

1142
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,030
sniff that bicycle seat

1143
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,030
after her cooter's been on it.

1144
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1145
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,430
At last I have control

1146
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,350
of your radio tubes.

1147
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:42,790
And I do too.

1148
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:43,910
Good.

1149
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,270
This is Ren Hoack.

1150
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:46,810
And this is Stimson J. Catt

1151
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,270
of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

1152
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,350
And you're listening

1153
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:50,730
to the Hour of Slack.

1154
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,590
Keep listening, you idiots.

1155
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1156
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,910
Else I shall kill you.

1157
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,270
You know, I put together

1158
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,030
a book of subgenius history

1159
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,470
that's much like that

1160
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,690
only it costs $150

1161
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,230
and it takes the form

1162
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,750
of an online class

1163
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,030
that goes on for eight weeks.

1164
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,350
Not a successful business model.

1165
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,370
That's how long it takes

1166
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,810
just to download

1167
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,770
the material offered

1168
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,730
in the eight weeks.

1169
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,970
The history of Church of the Subgenius.

1170
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:19,730
I am weary

1171
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:20,350
and what it takes

1172
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,270
to run your own

1173
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:21,690
cult.

1174
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,830
I thought you did that

1175
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:24,970
as a webinar series

1176
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,510
where you take questions

1177
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,110
and answers.

1178
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:27,750
You don't do that?

1179
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:28,290
Oh, no, no.

1180
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:29,870
I just make a lot of...

1181
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,890
We have chat.

1182
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:31,570
We have to

1183
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,350
online chat things

1184
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,910
two or three times a week.

1185
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:35,670
I need to learn

1186
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:36,950
how to run my own cult.

1187
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,010
Do you have a scholarship program?

1188
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,050
We have less than ten minutes

1189
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:39,490
to continue

1190
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:39,510
the so-called broadcast.

1191
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,550
Most people who take the course

1192
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,270
decide after taking it

1193
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,870
that running their own cult

1194
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,370
looks like too much trouble.

1195
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:48,930
The word cult

1196
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,810
comes from the Latin word colo

1197
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:51,170
meaning

1198
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,610
to join together

1199
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,530
as in collation.

1200
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,390
You know,

1201
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:56,430
you're collating things,

1202
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,350
you're joining together.

1203
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,430
If you are in a cult,

1204
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,810
you're joined together

1205
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,370
with the other members

1206
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,330
and that is all.

1207
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,730
The whole pejorative thing

1208
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,630
about being a brainwashed robot

1209
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,250
is only characteristic

1210
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,350
of some cults,

1211
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,250
not all cults.

1212
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:13,890
Well, our Bob

1213
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,230
is not a jealous Bob.

1214
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,030
No, our Bob

1215
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,170
is quite ecumenical

1216
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:18,770
and in fact,

1217
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,830
the Church of the Subgenius

1218
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,090
is yoked.

1219
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,690
It's not.

1220
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,110
Ecumenically,

1221
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,090
with many other

1222
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:24,670
religious groups

1223
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,910
like Bishop Joey's

1224
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,450
First Church of the Last Laugh.

1225
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:27,870
Yeah.

1226
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:29,690
Right, Stan?

1227
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:30,450
Oh, yeah.

1228
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:31,350
Yes, absolutely.

1229
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,730
And the Church of the

1230
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,550
Living Bull.

1231
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:35,570
Yes.

1232
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:37,510
Dennis and Linda Murphy's cult.

1233
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,170
Not the Church of the Bronze Bull.

1234
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,090
There's a Church of the Living Bull?

1235
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,590
Yeah.

1236
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,930
Is it related to the Bronze Bull?

1237
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:44,930
I thought it was a golden calf.

1238
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:45,910
And the Church of the

1239
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:46,870
what looked like

1240
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:47,690
it dropped out

1241
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,090
of a tall cow's ass.

1242
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,110
You know who we've had

1243
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,250
almost no contact with?

1244
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,430
The one we've had

1245
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,090
contact with, though,

1246
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,510
is the Flying Spaghetti Monster people.

1247
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:54,870
I was just about to ask

1248
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,010
if the Pastafarians

1249
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:56,310
had anything to do with it.

1250
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,250
No, there's a whole lot

1251
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:57,590
of crossover with it.

1252
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:57,990
Flying Spaghetti Monster

1253
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,890
has a kind of

1254
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,350
Lovecraftian appearance,

1255
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,050
you know?

1256
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,310
It has some potential.

1257
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,190
He looks so happy, though.

1258
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,870
There's no hate in those people.

1259
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,170
And he sticks to the wall.

1260
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:06,550
These days,

1261
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,610
the Lovecraft Monster Cthulhu,

1262
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,170
which was supposed to be

1263
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,550
so hideous

1264
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,690
that it's literally indescribable

1265
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,630
and can drive people mad

1266
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,170
just by looking at it,

1267
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,710
is now a plush toy.

1268
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:21,250
I have a question.

1269
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:21,250


1270
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:21,250


1271
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,330
What's a bunny Cthulhu?

1272
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,770
And not only that,

1273
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:24,910
but it's a damn plush toy

1274
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,090
that you see everywhere.

1275
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,090
That's a pink version of Cthulhu.

1276
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,130
Cthulhu is never properly...

1277
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,670
People don't read the text.

1278
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,410
They don't describe it properly.

1279
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:36,870
Just how beautifully horrible

1280
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:37,990
he really may be.

1281
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:38,870
There's tentacles.

1282
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,270
There's some kind of a face.

1283
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:40,850
A metal idol

1284
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,370
which depicts it properly.

1285
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,010
Somewhere along the line,

1286
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,090
it became a logo Cthulhu.

1287
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,610
A logo Elder God.

1288
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,790
That's just wrong.

1289
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,890
I have a handmade bunny Cthulhu

1290
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,630
The girl that runs the bookstore

1291
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,290
in Pittsburgh,

1292
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,050
I want you to come and do a thing at.

1293
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,010
She made me a little

1294
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,490
crocheted green

1295
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:00,010
zombie bunny Cthulhu.

1296
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,630
Well, that's just adorable.

1297
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:02,750
Yeah, it is.

1298
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:03,890
Sweet little thing.

1299
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:04,310
Now, the actual...

1300
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,410
You're saying the actual Cthulhu is...

1301
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,670
The actual Cthulhu

1302
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,010
does not have two little

1303
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,870
cute button bright eyes.

1304
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,850
It has multiple bulging pulpy eyes

1305
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:16,810
all over the front of its head.

1306
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,970
And eyes around the sides, too.

1307
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:20,270
Pulp.

1308
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,470
Pulp.

1309
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:20,830
Pulp.

1310
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:20,870
Pulp.

1311
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,870
Its body is grotesquely obese.

1312
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,510
And it's got long...

1313
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:25,430
Obesity is a disease.

1314
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,510
...claws on four feet and hind feet.

1315
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,010
It's different from all these

1316
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,250
cutie pie Cthulhus

1317
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,450
that people are coming out with

1318
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,270
who don't even bother

1319
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,510
to go back and read the text.

1320
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,830
And Cthulhu in the Lovecraft pantheon

1321
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,890
is the marine god

1322
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:45,870
who is comparable to Poseidon

1323
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,410
or Neptune.

1324
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,190
Then there is Nearthar-la-Tohep

1325
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,170
who is the messenger

1326
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,230
comparable to Mercury

1327
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,490
and, of course,

1328
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,490
the black goat of the woods

1329
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,450
with a thousand young

1330
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,230
Shub-Niggurath,

1331
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,390
the Aphrodite,

1332
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:01,290
so-called,

1333
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,270
of the Lovecraft pantheon.

1334
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:05,510
And the old boy,

1335
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:06,570
the Zeus,

1336
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,150
otherwise called

1337
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,210
Yog-Sothoth.

1338
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,250
Or Jehovah-One.

1339
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:13,350
I never knew that.

1340
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,050
And Jehovah-One is the one

1341
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,310
who sent the lightning bolt

1342
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,990
to try and kill

1343
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,170
Fightsy-Thor.

1344
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:20,690
And he's a great attache

1345
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:21,770
at last year's Grindhouse.

1346
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,690
He's crotchety

1347
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,350
for the last few million years.

1348
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,490
He's in his dotage

1349
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:26,730
in his old age

1350
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,510
but may still be propitiated.

1351
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,670
And you may remember

1352
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,370
if you read your Bible

1353
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,090
there's nothing he likes more

1354
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,690
than the taste and smell of blood.

1355
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,530
That's why he turned down

1356
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,550
the sacrifice of Cain

1357
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,490
and accepted the sacrifice of Abel.

1358
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,650
God was not a vegetarian.

1359
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,510
He liked it if you killed things

1360
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,410
and cut them up

1361
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,610
and put them on his altar.

1362
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,190
And he disdained

1363
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,350
the sacrifice of fruits

1364
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:53,890
and nuts

1365
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:54,410
and oats

1366
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,050
and groats

1367
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:55,930
and so forth.

1368
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,830
Now all he just wants money.

1369
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,590
Money is now so covered with blood

1370
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:02,750
that he's satisfied

1371
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,670
to get money.

1372
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,510
Or blood diamonds.

1373
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,790
Anything that has caused

1374
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,130
blood.

1375
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,330
And what's interesting about that

1376
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,430
is that the delight of demons

1377
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,730
is the anguish of human souls.

1378
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,490
This makes God

1379
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:18,830
a sort of giant demon.

1380
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,170
Just as the devil is.

1381
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,270
The delight of imps

1382
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:21,950
is the irritation

1383
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:22,890
and frustration

1384
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,470
of human souls

1385
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,670
in minor matters.

1386
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,250
Give me that for me.

1387
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,210
It was good for me.

1388
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,070
It was good for me.

1389
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,950
Give me that.

1390
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:33,090
Give me that for me.

1391
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,050
It was good for me.

1392
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,550
It was for me.

1393
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:37,350
Give me that.

1394
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,430
Give me that for me.

1395
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,770
So now we are bringing our...

1396
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:43,490
Well, no.

1397
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,610
Reverend Angry Larry just joined us

1398
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,390
so we can blabber on

1399
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,390
for a few more minutes.

1400
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,770
I'm for blabbering on

1401
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:50,150
as long as I can.

1402
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:50,670
As long as possible,

1403
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,470
but Pisces is cracking the whip

1404
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,590
on the new schedule

1405
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,490
and we don't have

1406
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,090
all the time in the world to burn.

1407
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,570
I don't see any whip cracking.

1408
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,510
Well, you may not see it.

1409
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:00,570
Whip crap?

1410
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,630
Never mind any of that.

1411
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,790
Let's hear from Reverend Angry Larry.

1412
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,290
Whip's crack.

1413
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,910
No, let's not hear from Reverend Angry Larry.

1414
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:08,870
Because he has an important announcement

1415
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:10,650
about tonight's show.

1416
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:11,550
Oh, do I?

1417
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,030
Subgenius Beach Party.

1418
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,570
Oh, well, the Subgenius Beach Party.

1419
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:15,890
We just need as many

1420
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,390
girls up there on the stage

1421
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:19,970
dancing with or without clothes.

1422
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:20,990
They're very skimpy,

1423
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,450
whatnots, that sort of thing.

1424
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,050
Aren't bikinis preferred

1425
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,770
for your AIP-type beach party?

1426
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,230
Yeah.

1427
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,150
So there you have it.

1428
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,650
Things like frisbees

1429
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,390
and things like that,

1430
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,290
people end up taking them,

1431
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:32,730
which is fine with me.

1432
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,530
So we'll see how the Subgenius version

1433
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,930
of that pans out.

1434
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:36,690
We're hoping.

1435
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:37,790
There's enough water around

1436
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,150
where it's more like a beach.

1437
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,750
Well, there may be,

1438
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,590
but right now we've got sun.

1439
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:44,630
The sun has chosen

1440
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,690
to pay us a visit.

1441
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:49,370
It's not all rain and gloom

1442
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:50,150
here at X-Town.

1443
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:50,370
It's a day.

1444
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,410
I'm going to make a shameless plug

1445
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,150
that August 3rd,

1446
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,630
the Amino Acids new record

1447
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,230
will be out.

1448
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,950
And if you're not in Detroit

1449
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,230
on August 3rd,

1450
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:06,390
you can go to my store's website,

1451
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,390
which is weirdsvillerecords.com,

1452
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,650
and you can order it there.

1453
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,230
It's a seven-inch,

1454
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,430
all-white vinyl

1455
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,670
with six songs on it.

1456
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,930
Plus there'll be a digital download

1457
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,690
of when the Amino Acids

1458
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:19,650
first arrived here

1459
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,150
in 1936.

1460
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,150


1461
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,150


1462
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,670
In 1965,

1463
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,930
they played at a bowling alley

1464
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:23,990
in Allen Park, Michigan,

1465
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,530
and someone found a tape

1466
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,270
of them playing

1467
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,930
in a bowling alley in 1965,

1468
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,230
and that will be included

1469
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:31,270
on the digital download.

1470
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:31,970
Hot damn.

00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:32,550
Yes.

1472
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:34,770

1474
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:36,910

1481
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:44,170

1482
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:45,530
well, they're a long way

1483
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,090

1484
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,590

1485
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:48,370

1487
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:50,710
Now, they call themselves

1488
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,050

1489
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:53,190

1490
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,070
Oh, I'm sorry.

1491
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:54,430
Excuse me.

1492
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,250
They're the Amino Acids,

1493
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:57,850
and tonight,

1494
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:58,690
