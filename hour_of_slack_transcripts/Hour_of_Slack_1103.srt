00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
This is PR. Ready for citizenship.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,300
Hello? Hello? Hello?

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,280
It's PR on PR and PR on your radio.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,100
Some people who haven't been civilized properly or socialized properly

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,040
do save kitchen chemicals and lab chemicals to use as weapons.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,280
We're all gonna die.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,320
Well, I think we are all gonna die.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,720
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,060
But I think most of us, we're gonna die.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,580
Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,900
Cancer or heart disease or stroke or many of the d-

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,780
PR. Ready for Kansas City.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,840
I often miss the more interesting, richer dynamics of this part of life.

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,160
I hope you'll try to squeeze religion into categories of for and white, black and against.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,200
PR on your favorite PR to PR.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,900
It's PR.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,240
Hello?

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,720
And in all this world of anguish, he found none to help.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,100
For he fed the captive, clothed the hungry, and comforted the naked.

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,480
It's time for

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,500
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,400
Oh, wow, man.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,080
All right, now, men, I've asked you to meet me at the Banning Home

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,380
because we've got a terrible job on our hands.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,920
And it's going to require every bit of courage we've got to see it through.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,840
Whether you can believe it or not, the facts are here and we've got to face them.

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,580
A creature that's been alive for over 3,000 years is in this town.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,300
And it's brought death with it.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,900
We've got to run it down.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,080
Bob?

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:41,080
The conspiracy has been trying to squelch abnormality since time began, practically.

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,360
It goes so far back and it's so ingrained in our culture

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,660
that it's gotten to where the conspiracy leaders don't have to do anything

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,620
because it's an endless cycle of normalcy.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,680
It's the exact opposite of what would be natural.

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,100
I am now learning to apply creative and corrective procedures

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,980
and to do it.

38
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


39
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,200
To bring back to normalcy and a state of perfection

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,460
any abnormality or imperfection found within any given manifestation of matter,

44
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,820
any given plane, any given depth.

45
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,100
I can easily do anything that I want to do.

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,480
I can.

47
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,060
I can.

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,860
I'm a winner.

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,960
Pursuant to Section 28A, Article 4B, Paragraph 2 of the Internal Security Regulations,

50
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,400
I now hand over to you rejected applicate number 578293BO21.

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,260
And so right on his face.

52
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,200
Hey, uh, when am I going to get paid?

53
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,980
Yeah, life sucks.

54
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,920
Yeah, life sucks.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,720
I've had it up to here.

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,020
I hate myself.

57
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,360
I hate everyone else.

58
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,620
I'm not done.

59
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,100
Can you hear me?

60
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,140
What the heck is going on out here anyway?

61
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,220
I need to talk to Bob.

62
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,800
Bob.

63
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,220
Bob.

64
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,600
Bob.

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,360
Bob.

66
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:46,900
Bob.

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,340
Bob.

68
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:47,560
Bob.

69
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:47,860
Bob.

70
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,000
Bob.

71
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,160
Bob.

72
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,240
Bob.

73
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,320
Bob.

74
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,680
Bob.

75
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:48,700
Bob.

76
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:48,720
Bob.

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:48,740
Bob.

78
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:48,840
Bob.

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:48,840


80
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,420
There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices,

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,040
to be found only in the minds of men.

82
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,320
Bob.

83
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,620
Bob.

84
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:58,920


85
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,160
Bob.

86
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,860
Bob.

87
00:02:59,860 --> 00:02:59,980
Bob.

88
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


89
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


90
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,100
Bob.

91
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,200
Bob.

92
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,660
Bob.

93
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,920
Bob.

94
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,800
Bob.

95
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:16,840
Bob.

96
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,620
Bob.

97
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,660
Bob.

98
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,980
Tell me what you think, Bob.

99
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


100
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,980
The hour of slack.

102
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,320
The hour of slack.

103
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,520
Tell me what you think of the hour of slack.

104
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,420
Crazy problems, my homeboy.

105
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,920
The hour of slack is amazing.

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
It's fucking crazy, my homeboy.

107
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,900
This is the best thing that's ever happened to me, my homeboy.

108
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,420
My homeboy.

109
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,300
I'm the fucking eternal son incarnate.

110
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm the fucking eternal son incarnate.

111
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,000
Stop for a minute, Bob, my homeboy.

112
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,020
Hello, hello, hello.

113
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,360
Hello.

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,080
Hello.

115
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,380
I'd like to welcome you to a normal sounding subgenius forum.

116
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,660
Now you can hear the level, balance, and fair remarks.

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,500
This is the editorial of our subgenius staff.

118
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,820
This sounds good.

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,420
I think I'll just stay on this side.

120
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,080
Dr. Philo Drummond and, of course, puzzling evidence,

121
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,340
fighting it out for quality control of the airwaves.

122
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,360
There, um, oh, I see, yeah.

123
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,460
Is there a control?

124
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,540
I just have raw volume, but I'm not even, I'm there, but you're not.

125
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,440
That's the kind of spirit we have here.

126
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,500
That's right.

127
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,380
You hear me there?

128
00:04:59,540 --> 00:04:59,760
Yeah.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,940
But you're not there.

130
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,380
It's disconcerting.

131
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,120
So it's somewhere in here.

132
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,000
In where?

133
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,560
Hey, wait a minute.

134
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,200
You can't disassemble the XL5 right here while we're using it.

135
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,120
That's, uh, not in the radio rule book.

136
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,460
I know last time I left the station, I forgot to, uh, uh, padlock the portcullis and heave the log,

137
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,960
which is always very important.

138
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,660
Well, I can't, uh, be expected to remember.

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,660
I'm not going to do everything.

140
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,200
I really just started this business as a solo operator.

141
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,340
Otherwise, I was with the old grind for more than 20 years.

142
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,500
Oh, I was quite a young spring then.

143
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,600
It all started back when I was reading the comics when I was just a child.

144
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,980
You know, it's times like this that make me glad I'm a subgenius.

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,900
And, uh, uh, a word about the Teneri Code to, uh, talk about what happened.

146
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,280
At the Bacockay Festival.

147
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,180
When chickens squawked, they're doomed.

148
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,900
Now, did you see those weird little ads inside that magazine from the future?

149
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,920
Yeah.

150
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,680
Yeah.

151
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,800
Especially the one for subgenius military.

152
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,180
Uh-huh.

153
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,860
It seems that they have some sort of ad, but let's not judge these future people.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,380
They're too harshly, after all, the meaning of advertising itself might be different in the future.

155
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,500
What about those Viewmaster slides of Dobstown?

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,200
I can't find my Viewmaster slide projector.

157
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,640
I still have the slides, but I don't have them.

158
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,940
Oh, that's a shame.

159
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,480
I don't know how you make it.

160
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,180
And maybe, I just realized I might be aware of it.

161
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,440
Did you look for, you know, the last time I saw it, did you look for the big red straps?

162
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,880
Because maybe they were just at the end of the big red straps.

163
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,980
So, yeah, you should be listening to all of this.

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,700
I mean, all of the features of the subgum Demi that will be on the musical.

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,100
Yes, the delicious subgum chow Demi.

166
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,260
But out there on the Internet, everybody's dancing around the guy.

167
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,360
It's not easy to do this kind of acting.

168
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,680
These gestural kind of acting.

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,780
Wait, no, that's not phylo.

170
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,480
That's different than just emoting on a camera.

171
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,740
It's not a tower.

172
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,820
Even on a video cam, to do silent film acting is...

173
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,060
You know, you've heard of three-fisted tales of Bob.

174
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,620
Well, this is six-lipped tales of Connie.

175
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,980
Yeah, now we could all get wound up in a box.

176
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980


177
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980


178
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980


179
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980


180
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980


181
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980


182
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980


183
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980


184
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,600
That and nine-inch worms and three-day...

185
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,380
Stubble.

186
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,900
Yeah.

187
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,060
That was something nobody could remember.

188
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,980
Yeah, it's horrible.

189
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,740
What's that?

190
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,420
Everyone's falling apart.

191
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,360
Oh, we were...

192
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,480
On April 1st, because of the weariness of being a star all day, we were forgetting names

193
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,380
like crazy later in the evening.

194
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,600
Yeah, that was crazy.

195
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,060
People and bands.

196
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,340
Crazy, I tell ya.

197
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,680
I remember when we were at that book signing, we were forgetting everything.

198
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,660
We were forgetting everything, folks.

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,980
And that was the fun of it, actually.

200
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,920
It was a great little gathering, due to the administrations of...

201
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,980
Oh, geez, I forgot her real name.

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,700
Sadie Loon, but her real name for that thing.

203
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,900
Stiglana Harley.

204
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,260
And John Shirley and Michael Pepe.

205
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,260
All three of them giving wonderful rants.

206
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,580
Yes, but it didn't get going until she started, really, which is...

207
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,620
Yeah, when she did that, so she stepped forward and took the ropes in hand and moved the show

208
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,500
out into the new world.

209
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,760
There's the dinosaur.

210
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,620
Wrong.

211
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:29,960
It's a dinosaur.

212
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


213
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


214
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


215
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


216
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


217
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


218
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


219
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


220
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


221
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


222
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:29,960


223
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,360
And you, too, can be part of this amazing overflow of slack.

224
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,920
Out from the cracks of the chair where goodwill upholsterers maintain a bloodstream level

225
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:49,800
of froth molecules so high that it doesn't even register on the sleeve scale.

226
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:56,840
Now, Philo did give some very straightforward answers about how froth only grew on the stools

227
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,540
of certain holy men or so.

228
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,360
Nothing.

229
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,100
Oh, nothing.

230
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,680
And those froth cigs were thick and long and had spatters of brown bloodstains on them.

231
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,260
Yeah, all of the subgenius demigods that had smoked of the froth going into the project.

232
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,480
We're going home.

233
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,340
They had, had they no wonder.

234
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,360
The hard red cherry ate its way towards Connie's vacuuming...

235
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,300
At the bottom of a vortex.

236
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,340
Well, the problem was that Connie couldn't find one shoe that she could use to get her

237
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,440
out of the vacuum.

238
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
She really wanted for that outfit.

239
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,900
And it's true, if she could have found it, they were more Connie-like shoes than the

240
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,660
ones that she had.

241
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,860
And what Connie shoes they were.

242
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,300
That's Dr. Howell and Philo Drummond on Puzzling Evidence Show.

243
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,860
And now, Lemur will erase everything.

244
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,860
Listen.

245
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,840
Hello?

246
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,820
Say, look, miss, my friend Bob...

247
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,020
Goodbye.

248
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,340
Bob's going around in circles to give you his version of Star Wars.

249
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,340


250
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,340


251
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,340


252
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,340


253
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,340


254
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,340


255
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,740
And Bob!

256
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,140
Yes, yes, stop, Bob.

257
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,920
Well, here is Bob.

258
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,620
And Bob!

259
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,360
Hey, Bob!

260
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,240
Hey, Bob!

261
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,720
Well, Bob, I forgot to tell you.

262
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,540
Goodbye, Bob.

263
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,820
So long, Bob.

264
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,620
Oh, well, that was easy.

265
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,320
He usually stays until he comes home.

266
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


267
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


268
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


269
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


270
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


271
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


272
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


273
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


274
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


275
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


276
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


277
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


278
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


279
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


280
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


281
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


282
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


283
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,320


284
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,960
stays and stays. Yes,

285
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,800
Stop Bob

286
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,860
from Fernanda Nandeli

287
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,860
Murr, who did the openings

288
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,800
and the closings and much in between.

289
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,080
And Norel Pref,

290
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,900
who did Bob

291
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,860
Is My Homeboy, using calls

292
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,000
to the subgenius answer

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,140
message phone. We're in

294
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,180
puzzling evidence zone a lot

295
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,500
this show, number 1103,

296
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,280
with recordings from that

297
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,120
hoary KPFA

298
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,760
Berkeley anchor

299
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,960
of Insanity, the puzzling evidence

300
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,780
show. We're getting ready for X

301
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,760
Day, you see, and so we're whipping

302
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,580
through shows in advance,

303
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,980
using these other sub-full

304
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,800
radio shows. Hearing

305
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,920
puzzling evidence, my friends,

306
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,200
is like going back in time,

307
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,020
in that they actually do

308
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,320
have a time machine in the studio.

309
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,060
And then we get to participate

310
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,980
in the old-fashioned radio before

311
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,520
the internet swallows it up.

312
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,840
No, that's not right.

313
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,980
It's our...

314
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,120
And, um, in my backyard

315
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,620
I have a Jesus 3.

316
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,900
And, uh,

317
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,520
I got a Jesus bucket.

318
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,720
I don't have a Jesus 3 on my list of bills here.

319
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,740
And I...

320
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,720
On the way to the beach.

321
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,980
On the way to the beach.

322
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,120
When you're weighing the anchor on the way

323
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,820
to the beach, then you have to

324
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,380
wave and weep at the crowd

325
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,960
when you think of how

326
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
you have been betrayed

327
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,920
by the general mass.

328
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,640
How about over here?

329
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,100
Where was he?

330
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,140
Over here in this box?

331
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,900
Yet, still give them some

332
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,080
signal to show that

333
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,380
you are of their own.

334
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,640
Okay, now I'm back.

335
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,360
And we're waiting for the bus.

336
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,160
And there's a dump button in here that you're supposed to press

337
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,180
if you want to take a dump.

338
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,480
Oh.

339
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,760
That makes me take a dump, so...

340
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,780
Where will you take it? That's the question.

341
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,960
For you, tonight.

342
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,520
Take it to the limit, of course.

343
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,460
You know, if you join the church in the sub-genial...

344
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,500
That's under two words.

345
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,340
It's giving me a fuck.

346
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,300
You could be like many other new members

347
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,760
that when you get there, you say,

348
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,660
this is my church.

349
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,380
And we're aiming the show

350
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,060
toward your mind.

351
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,460
It's much like you think

352
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,440
about your gun.

353
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,080
You think about your church.

354
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,120
You say, this is my church.

355
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
There are many like it, but this one is mine.

356
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,640
My church is my best friend.

357
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,100
It is my life.

358
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,140
I will master it as I will master my sacred abnormality.

359
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,880
Without me, my church is useless.

360
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,980
Without my church, I am useless.

361
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,440
I must keep my slack true.

362
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,300
I must get more slack than my enemy

363
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,860
who is trying to normalize me.

364
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,920
I must convert him before he converts me.

365
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,060
I will.

366
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,420
Before Bob, I swear this creed.

367
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,740
My church and myself are defenders of this country.

368
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,960
We are the masters of our enemy.

369
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,900
We are the saviors of earth.

370
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,160
So be it until there is no conspiracy,

371
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,260
but slack or death.

372
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,160
This is the voice of the slack alone.

373
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,600
The messenger of dawn.

374
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,500
He who came to earth on that winter's day,

375
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,380
now more than 20 years ago,

376
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,900
to bring the light of the celestial countenance

377
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,620
to the troubled hearts of you.

378
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,480
Dr. Cassino to ICU.

379
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,300
Dr. Cassino to ICU.

380
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,100
Then, in hospitals across the land,

381
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,100


382
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,680
a new generation is born,

383
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,160
gestated by the seed from the cold leeches

384
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,700
of interstellar space.

385
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,500
Sorry, I got to drop the show here, but apparently

386
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,100
what's happening is the doctors,

387
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,500
the old term for referring to the sub-gum PDs,

388
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,480
are on the move.

389
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,620
are on the move against humanity.

390
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:18,620


391
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,780
Oh, really? Where are they moving to?

392
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,640
Into the subgenius musical, that's what I heard.

393
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:22,840
Into the subgenius musical, that's what I heard.

394
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,920
I heard that phylogrammin and probably their work

395
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,080
there is a problem.

396
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,080


397
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,780
They're doing a libretto right now, I heard.

398
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,360
By the inexorable laws of evolutionary development.

399
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,680
John Shirley is helping Philo with the libretto.

400
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:34,860
John Shirley is helping Philo with the libretto.

401
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,060
...supere scientific breathing techniques.

402
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,020
So, watch out for that one, folks.

403
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,920
Pretty soon they'll have an entire opera.

404
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,420
Ultimately, only subgeniuses will be left

405
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,820
Ultimately, only subgeniuses will be left

406
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,980
after the master plan has been enacted.

407
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:47,380


408
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,400
They can take our instruments and set them

409
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,660
They can take our instruments and set them

410
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,060
as far apart as they want.

411
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,860
I do like Bob.

412
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,900
I do like Bob.

413
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,420
I do like Bob.

414
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:03,440
I do like Bob.

415
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,660
I like his look.

416
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,480
I like his look.

417
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,740
I read his words.

418
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,700
I got the pamphlet.

419
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,340
I'm waiting for the book.

420
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,680
I'm waiting for the book.

421
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,980
I do like Bob.

422
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,060
I do like Bob.

423
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,440
I do like Bob.

424
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,720
I like his shirt.

425
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,620
I like his shirt.

426
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,400


427
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,580
I like his shirt.

428
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,600
When I'm wearing it,

429
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,420
I like his shirt.

430
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,500
When I'm wearing it,

431
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,500


432
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,540
I've never been hurt.

433
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,040
Bob feels so strongly about Dobby.

434
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,160
for the pinks that rather than wear a hair shirt, Bob is much spiffier than that, he

435
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,860
wears polyester shorts so he can receive the fullness of polyester that plagues the life

436
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,240
of pinks and understand their problems more fully. Bob's compassion is as infinite as

437
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,460
his handicap. Bob itches for your sins. Does that help him with his stench? The stench

438
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,000
of Bob is a psychophantasmagoric aura of odor which fills the seven continents and

439
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,720
twenty seas. Most human beings cannot withstand the glory of this Bob. Only when the third

440
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,160
nostril has been properly opened by the necessary corrective administration of green energy.

441
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:42,060
I do like Bob. I like his shoes. I like his shoes. And when I'm with him.

442
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,820
You know I never

443
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,640
walked a blue.

444
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,900
Bob will return all on his own.

445
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,540
Bob is coming. Bob is coming.

446
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:04,540
Speaking as the Pope of New York, whose power at its most minimal equals the Pope of the

447
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,640
Holy City of the Vatican, is proven by the fact that I am not, in fact, infallible. I

448
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,560
have the power to fail and fail often. Let me point out to you that the Roman Catholic

449
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,420
Church specializes in suicide.

450
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,320
Very important.

451
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:26,740
And not only suicide but suicide with guilt. We suggest you open yourself to the living death in life. That is the infinity fulsomeness of, excepting of, Bob.

452
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:34,800
I do like Bob. But I never want his job.

453
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,580
Through subversive measures, Devo passes on the word of Bob by a

454
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,300
man named Bob.

455
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:54,600
If you take a look at our last album cover, his name has been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines of each of the band members.

456
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,340
Right next to the word sex.

457
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,220
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

458
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,620
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex.

459
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,600
There's nothing like some men and no. There's nothing more than what you know.

460
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,640
About the only slack that I get anymore is worshipping at the Holy Temple of the Yoni.

461
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,180
Tell us about that.

462
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,540
What's that?

463
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,600
I'm sure your audience knows what the Holy Temple of the Yoni is.

464
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,120
Bob here been pulling off all them crimes.

465
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:41,080
Really? I know Bob. Bob tough. Bob bigger. Bob modest. Bob fine.

466
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,960
Shit. That's Bob.

467
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,780
Oh, so it is.

468
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,300
He's a bad one.

469
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,100
I don't think he's so bad.

470
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,600
They tried to say Bob was Bob.

471
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll be seeing ya, sucker.

472
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,060
Youth was on the rampage.

473
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,340
I'm gonna ride in your car, mister.

474
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,380
Keep your mouth shut and forget about Bob.

475
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:11,600
In the meantime, I have secure positions in the hierarchy with guarantees of bonuses at the end of the trail.

476
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,700
I represent the right wing arm of the Church of the Genius.

477
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,640
Oh yeah.

478
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,800
The right wing arm?

479
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,280
The slack squad.

480
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,280
Yeah, the seven braided wind laker.

481
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,500
We have that, but that includes me, myself, and many, many, many others of myself as well.

482
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,360
Many of your me shows banded together.

483
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,520
But I'm also pink.

484
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,580
Wow.

485
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,280
So you claim once again your ancient genetic heritage?

486
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,760
I worship the owl god, President Bush.

487
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,260
It's a great scene up there.

488
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,400
Your bludgeon is prophetic and profitable.

489
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,680
Oh, how is this dish?

490
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,900
Is it got good music in it?

491
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,040
So you're up there with the big guys, huh?

492
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,640
Prescott Bush is the most evilest man in the world.

493
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,820
It wasn't Aleister Crowley.

494
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,680
No, it wasn't.

495
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,100
It was Bush.

496
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,040
No, the younger Bush is more evil than the older Bush.

497
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,720
I bought this, put it in the player, started to listen, and immediately pulled the movie off the shelf.

498
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,280
He's the most evil person that ever existed.

499
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,260
Except in his house, nobody.

500
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,840
Oh, it's a wonderful...

501
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,440
It was great in the theater to see this.

502
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,680
In his house, they all try to be equally evil.

503
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,180
He's the most evil.

504
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,600
He is.

505
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,320
Where is that Korean movie?

506
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,420
I think it's at Embark.

507
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,840
When the Bushes get home, they all, like, compete to see who can be the most evil.

508
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,920
Like, you know, they torture dogs before dinner and burn cats after dinner and stuff like that.

509
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,760
You know who tortures dogs or did was Rudy Giuliani's wacky wife.

510
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,720
Well, I don't know who they are, but all I know is they're just evil evil.

511
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,340
And I have to say, you know...

512
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,760
It's true.

513
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,720
Clam up and let me clobber them.

514
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:52,420
Front-running Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani's wacky wife worked for dog mobiles.

515
00:20:52,780 --> 00:21:08,760
According to extended records, Judith Giuliani once demonstrated surgical products for a controversial medical supply company that used dogs, which were later killed, in operations whose only purpose was to sell equipment to doctors.

516
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,600
In other news, Nazi Ken Gall mauls zombies.

517
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,980
The American administration invades lower Berkeley.

518
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,420
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, I came here to do something.

519
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,360
And I think the top of our list is provided for the safety and security of terrorists.

520
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,080
The world has spoken and said the president's policy is a failure.

521
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,920
It is huge.

522
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
And no amount of fun can fix it.

523
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,300
Arbitrary Bloody Summer lies ahead.

524
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,560
The world's Soviet mass derisor bar is the arbitrary timetable for withdrawal.

525
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,560
The world's Soviet mass derisor bar is the arbitrary timetable for withdrawal.

526
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,940
The world's Soviet mass derisor bar is the arbitrary timetable for withdrawal.

527
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,700
What we found is that governments are using, it seems.

528
00:21:51,080 --> 00:22:02,220
The United States has been a serious human rights violator and has, in fact, led the events of 9-11.

529
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,600
Well now I show these signs in the heavens and signs in the earth.

530
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,540
Bloodbentures from the earth. Right now. events of 9-11. fig 2. 21 1988 Jesus 옷ここ.我觉得这些是故意的。

531
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,380
My light to the sky, rebuke me!

532
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,940
The children of heaven and the angels from hell

533
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,540
are among me, spreading lies and deception.

534
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,860
I'm still worried about mankind's sensory organs and apparatuses

535
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,120
not growing quickly enough,

536
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,340
and I'm still worried about spontaneous organ enlargement.

537
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,620
I suppose I'm alone in that.

538
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,280
No, Dave, we all worry about that,

539
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,440
but what can you do about it, you know?

540
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,440
So you're just saying it's just like war, death, disease,

541
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,660
vestal insulin, impairment?

542
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,280
Yeah, right. What you gonna do?

543
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,880
What you gonna do?

544
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,680
What you gonna do?

545
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,300
Eh.

546
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,180
Eh.

547
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,720
That's what it comes down to. Eh.

548
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,700
What you gonna do?

549
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,300
Hello, you're on the air.

550
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,440
Hey, what's going on?

551
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,540
Not much.

552
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,560
What you gonna do?

553
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,840
They are schizophrenic, paranoid, and psychotic,

554
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,520
but they are not in mental hospitals.

555
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,260
They are in the hospital.

556
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,000
The president, the vice president,

557
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,420
the secretary of state, the CIA,

558
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,240
and Oxford.

559
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,820
Suck my toe, you pink-eared, crew-cut, mall zombie.

560
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,360
What?

561
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,860
I laugh at your yearbook pictures, you twerp geeks.

562
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,140
But, but, but...

563
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,240
What about the Mormons?

564
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,800
I don't know. Where are they?

565
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,380
Oh, they're there.

566
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,580
The Catholic Church.

567
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,580
The Muslims.

568
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,700
What about them?

569
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,540
Just wait here a minute, and I'll see if I can find them.

570
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,800
Why do we need caffeine-free anything?

571
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,280
The protest against being the modern man.

572
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,220
Modern man.

573
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,980
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

574
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,760
Don't ask me to figure out it.

575
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,160
Jesus!

576
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,240
Don't ask me again.

577
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,720
Hey, baby.

578
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,360
Well, so much for that.

579
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,800
Yeah.

580
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,580
As long as...

581
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,980
Well, never mind.

582
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,620
Yeah, basically what it amounts to is they will...

583
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,740
Nowadays, they will kill you.

584
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,700
Literally kill you.

585
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,420
If you use one tiny sample of their...

586
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,620
the conspiracy's material.

587
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,560
Yeah, technically.

588
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,840
Because the conspiracy owns everything,

589
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,860
you're going to die.

590
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,400
Right.

591
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:33,960
Well, technically...

592
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,160
Dave was saying it's not fair.

593
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,280
He's right.

594
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,660
It's not fair.

595
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,600
The conspiracy...

596
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,320
I was shaking on our...

597
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,160
Set it up.

598
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,400
In a way that wouldn't be fair.

599
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,700
The house always wins.

600
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,920
And that's why everyone in the world must come to Bob

601
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,300
and unite under a common front against all commonality.

602
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,060
Yeah, theoretically, like...

603
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,280
You know, every time we play a PSA with a snippet of music in it,

604
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,300
you know, even if we only use like half a second of that,

605
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,960
we technically owe royalties.

606
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,180
Right.

607
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,600
We technically have to report that.

608
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,340
Yeah, technically.

609
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:09,760
We technically have to report that.

610
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,120
Really, in a way, like I say, it's up to the judge.

611
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,900
But really, there's no such thing as fair use.

612
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,060
It's not fully defined.

613
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:18,920
Right.

614
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,200
Does anybody understand how the term royalties came about?

615
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,040
We're actually paying a pagan monarchy from another space

616
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,640
to extrude our corpus callosum, our thoughts, our brain areas,

617
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,700
they're actually taking our life's blood and sperminating.

618
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,560
And copyright trademarking it.

619
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,900
We're involved in the Royal Institute of Artists.

620
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,740
They trademark our blood cells themselves under their own name.

621
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,720
They stamp every cell with a little tiny logo.

622
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,540
Oh, there are companies that own patents on jeans you carry in every cell of your body.

623
00:25:59,700 --> 00:25:59,860
Right.

624
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,300
The conspiracy owns every cell.

625
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,320
If anybody owes anyone royalties, they owe us royalties

626
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,680
for patenting the jeans that we have.

627
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:08,680


628
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,100
We had first.

629
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,660
Our birthright.

630
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,520
Our inheritance.

631
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,520
Our genetic inheritance.

632
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,060
They owe us royalties for that.

633
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,460
Our genetic inheritance.

634
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,460
Our birthright.

635
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,620
We get royalties.

636
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
We're jolly, Prince Harry.

637
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,860
We don't have to go to...

638
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,560
I want a dime.

639
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,960
I want a dime.

640
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,560
...in several places.

641
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:29,380
I want a dime for every person who gets treated with some genetic therapy

642
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,860
that's based on a gene that I have in my system.

643
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,940
I want $1,000 for every time a rich guy gets cold when I sneeze.

644
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,620
But don't be all this rich.

645
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,360
I'd like a rodent hair for every time I think about a rodent.

646
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,640
You know, if I sneeze and somebody and a bunch of people around me get sick,

647
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,480
don't they owe me some sort of a royalty?

648
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,260
Actually, well...

649
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,700
That was my disease, not theirs.

650
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,880
That's another difficult legal question.

651
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,440
Who owns whose disease?

652
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,780
I think that's back to commonality and fish head skulls.

653
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,140
I have my own pet virus.

654
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,360
I get to pet and name her.

655
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,760
You have your own?

656
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,400
I have my own pet virus.

657
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,920
Oh, I thought you had a patent.

658
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,900
I get to pet and name her.

659
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,760
Well, that's a patent name.

660
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,760
Is it like Little Sinister Deanna or something?

661
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,140
You get to pet the virus, you say?

662
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,220
I was actually quoting Nirvana.

663
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,680
Oh, figure.

664
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,320
It's a song.

665
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,380
It's a really nonsensical song and one of my all-time favorites, actually.

666
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,300
I should know that song.

667
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,960
You actually have one in a box.

668
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,600
My cat.

669
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,120
My kids were still in school when that band was around.

670
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,040
Yeah, it was called...

671
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,080
It was never on the radio.

672
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,660
It was...

673
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,900
The thing with their Nirvana albums that came out and that were popular is

674
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,880
usually, like on Nevermind and In Utero,

675
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,320
those are the two studio albums that sold lots and lots of copies.

676
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,840
I believe sold lots of copies after he killed himself.

677
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,640
Not that I ever listened to them.

678
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,380
Yeah, I was thinking...

679
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,040
It's the second half is better.

680
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,880
...a night dropper, you know?

681
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,900
I find that Side B is better.

682
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,440
Oh, it always is.

683
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:09,900
Yeah.

684
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,520
Because it gets the most...

685
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,680
You know, the heat is the greatest on the other side.

686
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,260
But they generally, like, play Side A on the radio.

687
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,880
Well, this is a Side A planet.

688
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,900
We're all going to have to get used to it until things change with a big C.

689
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,840
You know where they put us?

690
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,020
Side C.

691
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:26,720
Yeah.

692
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,980
We've been forced to choose A or B.

693
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,300
Choose C.

694
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,040
Wouldn't that be horror of all horrors when the exes came and we were condemned to the holds of the ships,

695
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,580
of the various ships?

696
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,300
Well, some say that our brains will just be put in jars

697
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,980
and we'll be sort of like the batteries for the spaceship.

698
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,840
Oh, look at that.

699
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,760
By the way, they've been saying that since long before that Matrix movie came out.

700
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,560
There's a lot of gambling involved in your church there, Stangy.

701
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,620
Well, there's gambling involved any time you're talking about eternal life.

702
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,140
I suppose.

703
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,840
It could be eternal bad life, you know.

704
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,580
As long as it's not just total extinction like you all seem to be.

705
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,620
Eternal life, thanks, you can keep it.

706
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,900
No, it's only total extinction for those who deserve it.

707
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,020
Honestly, like, there are days when I feel like I've had enough already.

708
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,780
I don't think I could handle eternal life.

709
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,500
But you're only 12 years old.

710
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,900
Why would you want to think like an elderly woman?

711
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,320
I am not 12 years old, thank you.

712
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,940
The less life you have left, the more public you are.

713
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,880
You're a decently elderly person, but I mean, you know, you're not an elderly person is what I'm trying to say.

714
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,440
Why would you say that to yourself?

715
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:37,880
Well.

716
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,820
Everybody has days when they feel like they've had enough.

717
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,460
I know.

718
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,540
When my son was five years old, he had a particularly bad day and he looked at me and he said,

719
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,560
Dad, I'm having a bad life.

720
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,020
Yep.

721
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,400
You know, this is what we feel.

722
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,800
Doesn't matter how young you are or how old you are, you know, you can feel anything and it's just as real.

723
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,440
Consider this a subliminal massage.

724
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,300
We have to wait for nowhere more than ten years for lightly

725
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,820
Will just want to leave a bossy little oscar In a trash can.

726
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,480
There's a chap called Max.

727
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,620
He's got a lot of attitude in you.

728
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,520
It's not hard being a bossy little oscar.

729
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:33,840


730
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:33,980
If somebody owns a luxury building, let that be a macho man.

731
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,800
They don't do a got a warskins business.

732
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,260
What are you doing that?

733
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,580
Leaning over.

734
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,760
Into you now

735
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,920
Into you now

736
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,860
Into you, my people

737
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,000
Before I should ever decide

738
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,400
To trust anyone else

739
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,340
I will trust myself

740
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,820
For us

741
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,980
And Bob loves us

742
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,600
Into you now

743
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,780
Into you now

744
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,020
Into you now

745
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,840
Into you, my people

746
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,900
You're lonely and you're lost

747
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,140
You're blind

748
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,840
You need a seeing eye, Bob

749
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,160
Jose, can you see

750
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,580
The bombs bursting in the air?

751
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,960
They promise not to hurt civilians

752
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,640
But sometimes they're just there

753
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,880
They keep a star out of the engine

754
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:09,880


755
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:09,880


756
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,000
Ooh, ile sounds

757
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,760
Oh rectangle

758
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,820
Sing smash

759
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,040
Oh rectangle

760
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,080
Oh rectangle

761
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,200
Oh rectangle

762
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,300
Oh rectangle

763
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,500
A giant beam above me

764
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,820
Oh, it's about to set because you're bewitched

765
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:44,020
Before I should ever decide to kill anyone else

766
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,940
I will kill myself for Bob

767
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,920
And we love Bob

768
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,720
Enter you now

769
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,660
Enter you now

770
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,460
Enter you now

771
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,060
Enter you my people

772
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,800
Chasers in the sky

773
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,220
Chasers in the sky

774
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,280
Nothing makes a lasting impression

775
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,580
You can stand on the surface of a globe

776
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,320
Bearing all before your maker

777
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,900
Stripped of your clothing

778
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,640
Proud of your work

779
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,460
Prosthesis and dental work

780
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,360
But as the planet spins away

781
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,660
Does a mere being make an imprint in space?

782
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,820
Nothing, nothing makes a lasting impression

783
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,980
Benignity is not matter

784
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,340
But it behaves like an energetic fluid

785
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,600
The Psychoskeletons did that song called ADHD

786
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,620
And before that some clips from WCSB's Radio Synesthesia

787
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,720
With host Dr. Sinister

788
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,400
Caller Slonsome Cowboy Dave

789
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,740
Governor Rocknar

790
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,580
Yours truly and others

791
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,600
Before that collages from the 1982 subgenius Media Barrage

792
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,300
What? What?

793
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,460
Crippled by these events

794
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,240
Yes?

795
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,960
Waited for the first sign of an invasion from outer space

796
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,280
That would be the amino acids

797
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,140
Which is who we're hearing in the background friends

798
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:58,760
And they will be playing at the X Day Festival coming up July 5th

799
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,140
Until the world ends

800
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,240
Anyway friends from the old subgenius media barrages

801
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,580
We heard Glass Madness singing I Do Like Bob

802
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,420
And Mark Mothersbaugh at the 1981 World Subgenius Convention

803
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,600
Also we heard back then George Bush bashing collages

804
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,900
By referend Norrell Preff

805
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,120
Puzzling evidence and Leemur

806
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,840
And more Leemur now

807
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,260
Wax the Johnson Wax

808
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,200
Johnson's Wax Wax Wax Wax

809
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,780
Leather goods

810
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,480
Cream cream the ticket the ticket

811
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,920
Oh well

812
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,900
That's pretty good Johnny

813
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,980
But that ain't the way I heard it

814
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,580
Well split my lip and call me chappy

815
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,660

Hypercrit McGee

823
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,780
The caniest connoisseur of culture that ever calmly called a card

824
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,780
On current camera crap

825
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,160
Candidly cussing the crummy quality of clumsy creations

826
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,400
And continually causing chorus cuties to cry

827
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,220
By composing cruel and cutting comments

828
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,720
Calmly cracking the conceit of countless corny clowns

829
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,800
By constantly clunking course comedians over the conch

830
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,100
With critical cabbages, cantaloupes, cauliflower and cobblestones

831
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,740
And curdling the condensed dream of common kindness

832
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,840
From the carnalble concessions of Kankakee

833
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,600
To the let's go to the show Mrs. McGee

834
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,840
Truth is fiction

835
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,340
And this is

836
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,800
Be Horned Peanut

837
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,420
H.B. Applegate of Oglala, Nebraska

838
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,940
Really wanted to find out how the fish were biting

839
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,540
She bit off her own tongue

840
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,660
Be Horned Peanut

841
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,960
Pierre Loti on the occasion of his initiation ceremony

842
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,400
As a member of the French Academy in 1892

843
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,600
Was an author

844
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,620
Be Horned Peanut

845
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,480
In a moment I'll tell you the frightening story

846
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,940
Of the man who fell from revealing a conspiracy

847
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,720
And died insolvent

848
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,420
During World War I

849
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,700
Lieutenant Makepeace, a Canadian flying officer

850
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,760
Fell from revealing a conspiracy

851
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,560
And died insolvent

You keep saying you got something for me

855
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,660
Something you call

856
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:25,900
Something you call

00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,220
The soft genius

00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,820
Power of

The soft genius

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,080
Power of Learn

Thank you

Thank you

873
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:52,060
But we're just going to have to set up rick videomakers

874
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,060


875
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,060


876
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,140
Thank you very much.

877
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,480
Thank you very much.

878
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,880
Thank you very much, all of you.

879
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,540
Thank you very much, all of you.

880
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:20,560
Nancy and I have illegitimate births and abortions no less than four times.

881
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,700
I know that you've been horrified.

882
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,700
Illegitimate birth or abortion.

883
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,580
Well, let me state the case as briefly and simply as I can.

884
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,560
Last year, I let our children discriminate against religious speech.

885
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:44,700
I want you to know that, in addition, the other day, I've watched TB preach the supremacy of the state,

886
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,060
pontificating on our error, pornography, a pornography,

887
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,260
an enormous and unparalleled military,

888
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,740
buildup, pornography, religion, and morality

889
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,760
are the focus of evil in the modern world.

890
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,540
Phenomenology of evil that proceeds from supernatural ideas.

891
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,000
All of Judeo-Christian tradition is wrong.

892
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,720
The greatest evil superstitions, superstitions, superstitions.

893
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,160
The evidence of this permeates our history and our government.

894
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,980
Someone asked me whether I was aware.

895
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,340
Well, sometimes you can't.

896
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,160
Don't say that.

897
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,960
America is in the midst of another sad, bizarre chapter in human history

898
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,400
with global desires, global desires.

899
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,560
One recent survey by a Washington-based research council concluded

900
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,060
that Americans were simple-minded.

901
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,720
And I had to say, and yes.

902
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,200
And another study has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans

903
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,820
approve of adultery, teenage sex, pornography, abortion, and hard drugs.

904
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,320
We must be governed by tyrants.

905
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,400
The legacy.

906
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:50,860
The legacy of evil.

907
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,180
Washington-based bureaucrats making mistakes.

908
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,540
The legacy of evil.

909
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,120
The West is indifferent to bombs or rockets.

910
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,180
Bombs or rockets.

911
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,340
To subsidize the federal government.

912
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,980
Very dangerous fraud.

913
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,360
Very dangerous fraud.

914
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,340
Very dangerous.

915
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,680
This administration is motivated by bigotry and prejudice.

916
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,520
The United States states impulses of an evil empire,

917
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,380
declare its omnipotence over individual man,

918
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,640
and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the earth without God.

919
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,280
And that's enormous progress right there.

920
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,320
Government schemes are going to perfect man.

921
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,380
Morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war.

922
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:39,100
And everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old exploiting social order

923
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,220
and for uniting the proletariat.

924
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,960
Thank you for your racism, anti-Semitism, or other forms of ethnic and racial hatred in this country.

925
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,360
You.

926
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,060
You.

927
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,620
You.

928
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:53,640
Evangelicals are known for your infanticide or mercy killing.

929
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,260
Abortion on demand?

930
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,740
I've watched girls well below the age of consent.

931
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,600
And I had sex with underage girls.

932
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,920
So I urge you to subsidize the federal government.

933
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,240
To subsidize totalitarian darkness.

934
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,880
Heaven's gate.

935
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,940
Hard drugs.

936
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,920
Communism is great.

937
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,760
Communism is good.

938
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,460
Get up.

939
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,380
Get up.

940
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,340
Grow up under communism.

941
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,740
As good Marxist Leninists, I have been driven many times.

942
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,200
How?

943
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,340
There's something wrong.

944
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,960
How do I get this subgenius?

945
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,900
How do I get this subgenius?

946
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,740
Subgenius.

947
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,660
And smooth cheeks.

948
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,080
Freedom prospers when religion is subgenius.

949
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,520
This brings me to my final point today.

950
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,860
Mount up with subgenius.

951
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,160
Sex.

952
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,140
Real, purely physical thing with no potential.

953
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,880
Think.

954
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,560
A living entity.

955
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,960
Human life.

956
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,460
How?

957
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,620
There's something wrong.

958
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,260
How do I get this subgenius?

959
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,880
He kind of associates us with anti-government, anti-technoplastic culture sleaze.

960
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,340
Anti-boring fart humor.

961
00:41:59,340 --> 00:41:59,580
Well, that makes sense.

962
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,980
It's the not-you-Gary world.

963
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,620
And yet we just dive back down into the toxic wastes.

964
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,400
And dredge up more pearls of wisdom.

965
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,700
I am conceiving.

966
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,080
So let's talk some plain truth.

967
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,880
Bob lives.

968
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,680
Alien beings are all around us.

969
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,340
Watching our every move.

970
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:29,460
There is a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions working solely to rob you of your very abnormality.

971
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,760
Absolutely.

972
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,900
The president, any president, is a Bolshevik clone.

973
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,680
It's no joke.

974
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Russia, nevertheless, has been taken over by demon-possessed Christians.

975
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,860
Utter stupidity can make you rich.

976
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,240
Your own evil ghost twin is standing beside you right now.

977
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,440
There is no reason.

978
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:54,960
There is a hollow earth inside this planet which holds an advanced race of super-creatures and humans from before the Ice Age.

979
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,900
Long before the history of man.

980
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,060
They have to be stopped.

981
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,080
And this is just the surface.

982
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,580
The tip of the iceberg.

983
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:07,780
One drop in a billion buckets of the blood of subgenius martyrs everywhere.

984
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,180
Hell, all I can say is this.

985
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:16,820
My offspring, let's call them duplicate girl X squared.

986
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:23,240
Will be in the high school graduating class of 1998.

987
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,800
Now you may think 98 has come and gone.

988
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:35,300
And yet we here at the Church of the Subgenius simply believe that 98 hasn't properly arrived yet.

989
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,820
That's a very interesting theory.

990
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,740
And that was one that you were giving out at the City Lights book signing.

991
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,440
That's right.

992
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,740
Proof of that is because the X's haven't arrived.

993
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,660
So we must have gotten the time wrong.

994
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,740
For a while I was seeing that.

995
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,340
But I dropped that theory.

996
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,180
Not exactly the same.

997
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,100
Are you one of the new centurions that believe in the hundred years theory?

998
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,520
Well I thought that since they said it would happen, maybe it had happened somehow.

999
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,640
That we weren't able to apprehend.

1000
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,540
No, no, no.

1001
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:13,920
That would imply all kinds of dogmatic excursions.

1002
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,200
That would be horrible.

1003
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,540
Isn't that what you're saying?

1004
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,400
Horrible to contemplate.

1005
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,080
I'm just saying that we'll keep doing it until we get it right.

1006
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,320
And then they will come.

1007
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,240
And when they come, it will be 1998.

1008
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,800
Now that may happen in 2008.

1009
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,220
And if so, so be it.

1010
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
And is that how we're going to deal with it?

1011
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,520
In 2008 it will be the tenth anniversary.

1012
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,680
That's right.

1013
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,800
It's going to be, well not just 2008, it will be the tenth anniversary this year.

1014
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,480
This year is X Day 10.

1015
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,780
Or 10 X Day.

1016
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,740
But that doesn't mean, that's like saying zero is one.

1017
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,980
Well now these are of course equidities to be discussed by theologians and philosophers.

1018
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,180
Plain and simple men such as ourselves.

1019
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,580
Let's speak for yourself there.

1020
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,440
I'm stupefied by this.

1021
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,800
Plug your fixture.

1022
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,520
Everyone's on TV all the time or on the radio.

1023
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,960
Why don't you guys just plot this stuff geographically on a map?

1024
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,220
Oh you did, okay I see.

1025
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,440
National Osogeographic.

1026
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,340
We're waiting for you to pick up your phone.

1027
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,800
With our legs crossed, our eyes crossed, we're focusing right now on the internet.

1028
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,820
We're focusing right now on the internet.

1029
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,840
We have the internal mandala coming from the proximity of our third nostril.

1030
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,820
Yeah here it is.

1031
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,680
We're breathing deeply.

1032
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,540
What's up?

1033
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,800
You're, hello, you're on the air.

1034
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,120
How's it going Senator?

1035
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:51,980
It's Ragnar.

1036
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,600
Man, here we are.

1037
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,280
I know, I know, here we are.

1038
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,600
There seems to be no end, no dissolution of the problem.

1039
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,460
What's it to be then?

1040
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,880
What's it going to be then, eh?

1041
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:08,260
There was me and my 12 droogs, Archie, Fred, Stinky, Werewolf and Hector.

1042
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,800
To name the others would be a joke.

1043
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:10,800


1044
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:16,120
We were sitting around the Brushwood fire trying to make up our rezudogs what to do with the evening.

1045
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,360
But it was a psychic calamity of great proportions to a lot of, uh...

1046
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,140
It was an awakening I think.

1047
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,380
We have more of those scheduled for this year's X Day.

1048
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,640
More awakenings scheduled?

1049
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:32,680
More terrible thunderstorms and rainstorms. It's just that we can't schedule exactly when.

1050
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,100
It never fails. It never fails. There's always at least one horribly rainy day.

1051
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,620
Right. There has to be.

1052
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,560
My favorite are actually the sickenings.

1053
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:47,000
Many people like to, you know, dip their feet in the water, so to speak, to see what's on the other side.

1054
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,940
I enjoy the actual sickenings.

1055
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,060
Oh, you know, sickenings are a great part of X Day.

1056
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:58,220
I mean, I remember 2X Day when I just jumped right into the sewage moat.

1057
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,200
That sickened many people.

1058
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,620
It did. But it didn't sicken me really.

1059
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,980
Right.

1060
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,300
Even when I took a bite of that raw sewage seaweed.

1061
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,320
That's not sewage.

1062
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,520
By the way, in that pond at all.

1063
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:20,260
People talk about the day Stang was dunked in the sewage or when Ragnar bravely devoured all the sewage.

1064
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:25,740
But actually, that's just the way a normal, natural, stagnant pond smells.

1065
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,220
But I thought the...

1066
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,080
The sewage goes deep, deep, deep into the groundwater.

1067
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,120
Not that surface mud.

1068
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,380
The little frogs and the lake monsters live in there.

1069
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,760
The frogs that sound like rubber bands?

1070
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,380
Healthy.

1071
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:48,320
The mineral content actually of the artesian spring under the actual pond itself has been found to be 99.9% pure.

1072
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:57,520
Right. And remember, brushwood is a convergence of ley lines carrying deep geothermic magical content.

1073
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,860
It's a holy place.

1074
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,160
Which is why people get so horny when they're out there.

1075
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,640
Yeah. It has a lot of organ energy.

1076
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,600
It's both holy and H-O-L-E-Y. Holy, too.

1077
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,260
Yeah.

1078
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:07,920
There's a little...

1079
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,360
Yeah.

1080
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:15,980
And plus the constant native drumming tends to, you know, get people feeling romantic.

1081
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,360
If you're not ready for the drumming...

1082
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,100
Or animalistic, rather, I should say.

1083
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,000
If you're not ready for the drumming, it's going to drive you insane at night trying to sleep.

1084
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,280
No. Well, you know, that never bothered me.

1085
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,840
I just would fall asleep dreaming of blondes being sacrificed to giant gorillas.

1086
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,600
The PC subgeniuses in San Francisco were amazed.

1087
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:43,200
To hear that there were actual matings between subgeniuses and pagans out here at Brushwood.

1088
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:53,120
That there were even yeti children breeding true along the correct lines according to exact instructions of the Bob and Connie almanac.

1089
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:04,580
And you subgeniuses here, there's, by the way, there's nothing wrong with using sex to recruit other cult members and deprogram.

1090
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,080
That's all right.

1091
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,560
But don't...

1092
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,760
I mean, you can have sex with anything you want.

1093
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,960
And I do mean anything.

1094
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,440
Even if it involves somebody else besides you.

1095
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:26,060
But don't create little half-human, half-subgenius things.

1096
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,320
Don't get them pregnant.

1097
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,860
Girls, don't get those subgenius boys pregnant.

1098
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,420
Don't miscegenate, friends.

1099
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,500
It's so sad to see the...

1100
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,480
You know, we've fallen so far from our yeti incestors.

1101
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,360
We've watered down the one true family of the yeti.

1102
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,440
Which were called Smith, by the way.

1103
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,140
That was their name.

1104
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,960
So go ahead and use the humans.

1105
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,120
But don't miscegenate.

1106
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,060
Don't get one pregnant.

1107
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,040
Don't get impregnated by one, boys.

1108
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,940
You don't want to produce one of those half-subgenius things.

1109
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,900
Not beast.

1110
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,320
Not man.

1111
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,640
But thing!

1112
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,880
To quote Bela Lugosi.

1113
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,700
The half-breeds are so lonely.

1114
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,720
I feel so sorry for the one-penis.

1115
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,660
Especially the females.

1116
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,980
That's a little rough.

1117
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:20,620
And that doesn't sound too good to the polished ears of the liberals and the modernists.

1118
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,020
So they soften it down, you see.

1119
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,200
And of course they would read that verse.

1120
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:32,560
Let God be true and every man be an untruth in a measure to a degree by chance in my opinion, they'd say.

1121
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,820
Yeah, let's soften that because somebody might get offended.

1122
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,580
Yeah.

1123
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,000
But the Bible says let God be true and let every man be a liar.

1124
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,760
Truth is fiction.

1125
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,960
And this is The Orbit Leenock.

1126
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,680
Reb Frommer did not speak a word or utter a sound for 30 years.

1127
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:58,900
Of course his special achievement was obviously that he was his own brother-in-law by one-sixth of a vote.

1128
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,640
The Orbit Leenock.

1129
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,800
Here's a real brain teaser for you.

1130
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:12,200
Did you know that if all the Chinese in the world were to march 2,000 miles to Prince Edward Island, they would never march forever and ever?

1131
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,860
The Orbit Leenock.

1132
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,600
In a moment I'll tell you about a general small feat.

1133
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:21,380
When General Eisenhower was born October 14th, 1890, he marched.

1134
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,760
The Orbit Leenock.

1135
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:31,220
From Leemur and Media Barrage, subgenius CBs of yore.

1136
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,280
And the sermon at Starwood 2006.

1137
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,500
And Norrell Preff doing Ronald Reagan.

1138
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,220
And for more information, friends, check out subgenius.com.

1139
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,220
That's where you can learn everything about this show, the Hour of Slack, and the Church of the Subgenius.

1140
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:58,400
But now a song or something from a new doctor, Reverend Graves, dedicated to the New York judge who decided Bob was as bad as the devil.

1141
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,940
Judge Punch.

1142
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:01,460
Genius.

1143
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,380
Why a goat?

1144
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,540
He's a genius.

1145
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,340
Prey stop, prey stop.

1146
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,240
Prey stop, prey stop.

1147
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,240
And the judge said,

1148
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,240
Fuck that.

1149
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,760
Prey stop, prey stop.

1150
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,980
Fuck that.

1151
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,140
Why a goat?

1152
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,120
Why?

1153
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,560
Goat, goat.

1154
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,460
The judge.

1155
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:31,220


1156
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,640
And the judge said, kids are no good for Bob.

1157
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,280
Prey stop, prey stop.

1158
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,780
And the judge said, kids.

1159
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,120
Prey stop, prey stop.

1160
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,400
Why Bob?

1161
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,960
Prey stop, prey stop.

1162
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,720
Goat, why a judge?

1163
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,380
He's a genius.

1164
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,300
Fuck that.

1165
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,260
Prey stop.

1166
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,160
Goat, goat, goat.

1167
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:52,840
Prey stop.

1168
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,220
Why a, why a, goat?

1169
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,520
Why a judge?

1170
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,620
Now, um, can I relay a crazy ex-daydream that I had?

1171
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,240
Like about a week or so ago?

1172
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,040
Oh, it'd probably be a lot better than anything that really happens at ex-day.

1173
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,540
Yeah, it, it should be.

1174
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:12,240
Okay, so, there's this, so, there's this one little, uh, degenerate gambler where I work.

1175
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,900
You know, his name's Billy, and, and he was wanting me to take him to ex-day.

1176
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,900
I'm like, okay, Billy, I'll take you to ex-day.

1177
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,400
And Billy has a card table set up right outside Brushwood.

1178
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:30,000
And I don't, you know, I've never seen him before, but somehow I knew Michael Alcandor was sitting at our card table.

1179
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,860
And he was playing poker with, with all of us.

1180
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:39,160
And then, uh, out of a, you know, it was a bright day, and then it just turned really, you know, dark, and thunderstorms started coming.

1181
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,280
And then rain started hitting us.

1182
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,160
And then I just got this crazy idea.

1183
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,860
And I, I just started, you know, it just, it just, it just felt so good to do this.

1184
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,880
And I just started pretending like I was having a seizure.

1185
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,280
And I just said, Billy, I need my pills.

1186
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,640
You're what, buddy?

1187
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,960
I need my pills, my water pills.

1188
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,160
Bam!

1189
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,980
And I just start punching Michael Alcandor right in his face.

1190
00:53:59,980 --> 00:53:59,980


1191
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,200
And I just start repeatedly punching him.

1192
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,660
Pow!

1193
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,220
Pow!

1194
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,480
And then come to find out people had been videotaping it and posting it on YouTube.

1195
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,540
And they told me that it was the funniest thing that they had ever seen.

1196
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,560
Brocknar, that wasn't a dream.

1197
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,400
That really happened last year.

1198
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,140
And you're facing charges for assault, aren't you, next week?

1199
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:20,300
Oh, that's right!

1200
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,960
Oh, damn it!

1201
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,300
I knew, oh, you know what?

1202
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,640
These are impressed memories.

1203
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,520
You wish that was a dream.

1204
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,100
They just keep coming back on you.

1205
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,500
No, it's, it's something they can't erase.

1206
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,560
It's, um, it was an actual occurrence.

1207
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,760
Oh, so it did get posted to YouTube.

1208
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,680
Oh, okay.

1209
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
Right, yeah, yeah.

1210
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,260
You can look, just search Brocknar punching Alcandor.

1211
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,760
You remember you had, you had marks on your hands and swelling for a week after.

1212
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,320
That wasn't a hallucination, was it?

1213
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,600
I, I wondered where that came from.

1214
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,520
Now!

1215
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:56,140
This Alcandor person he's referring to would not be familiar to anybody outside of the

1216
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,380
subgenius forum alt.slack.

1217
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,480
And I guess the, uh...

1218
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,300
I'm not sure if you're familiar with that, uh, IRC chat, but he was a racist, or it's

1219
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:10,460
the pseudonym of some insane racist fellow who, uh, well, he's not just a racist.

1220
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:15,140
He basically hates everything except certain types of food.

1221
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,440
So I envision him as a really large person because of that.

1222
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:27,200
But, uh, he, for, for years, uh, posted hateful stuff to the subgenius website.

1223
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,380
Can you imagine that?

1224
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,960
He's not saying mean things on a, on a sweet religious forum like that.

1225
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,540
Oh, the, the nerves, I'll say.

1226
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:44,380
But, uh, but he, he, he felt that the subgenius was a front for satanic Masonic Jews, which

1227
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,560
I thought was kind of a strange combination that you don't usually get all of those...

1228
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,700
Yeah, all three in one.

1229
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,760
That's the trifecta.

1230
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,860
That's the trifecta, baby.

1231
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,520
In many ways.

1232
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,260
Yeah.

1233
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,360
But, uh, and he was very agitated about it.

1234
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:58,360


1235
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:58,960
He was very agitated about all of this.

1236
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,920
We, he was kind of a classic case, in fact.

1237
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,480
And that's, that's who Rocknard's referring to.

1238
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:11,860
We've actually never, we, I, we suspect that the guy's not real at all, but, uh, some artificial

1239
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:18,520
bot, an artificial intelligence program that posts generic crazy man stuff.

1240
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,220
Yeah, I could probably, I could, yeah, I could expand on that, on that a little bit.

1241
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,180
He, he, she, it, whatever, uh, actually is a program.

1242
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:25,880
It's an op.

1243
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,360
And, uh, op...

1244
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:33,820
Op and a program have become singularalized into one unit, and he, that's what he does.

1245
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,620
He goes to every cult or messianic or off-string half-wit group that...

1246
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:40,900
That's us.

1247
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,680
...he encounters through the bugs, and so, well, he, not he, the program filters through

1248
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:52,400
and, uh, harasses them in various different ways to elicit different responses, and then

1249
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,120
they go from there.

1250
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,680
It's just like a startup.

1251
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,980
It's not really the end game, you know what I mean?

1252
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:57,200
Yeah.

1253
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,720
It's just kind of like keeping an eye on things by just causing trouble and seeing

1254
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,220
what happens.

1255
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:08,100
Like he'll, he'll, uh, he'll go to person A and say that B said something about

1256
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:12,560
him, and then he'll go to person B and say that A said something about him, and get the

1257
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,500
two fighting and just sit back and watch everything unfold, kind of.

1258
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,040
Well, the main...

1259
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,000
Well, you're describing the KPFA subgenius show.

1260
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:20,480
Oh.

1261
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,640
Philo's, uh, way of working that.

1262
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,260
No, those are real people, though.

1263
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,460
Well, some of them are.

1264
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:25,960
Yeah.

1265
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,340
Some of them are real people.

1266
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:26,780
Well, not real.

1267
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,040
Some of the time, some of them are real people.

1268
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,080
I mean, actual human form entities, so...

1269
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Yeah, and even when they're recordings, they're, or computers, they're based on somebody who

1270
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,840
was once alive.

1271
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,880
But Arkenbark is not.

1272
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,720
Arkenbark is solely a program op.

1273
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,780
Are you sure about that?

1274
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,220
Because...

1275
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:50,280
I'm positive, because his, his, his, its name comes up in other, um, activities.

1276
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:55,940
Some of the more sheltered people felt, felt that he was, uh, more of a, uh, a, uh, a,

1277
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,640
primarily an imposter and a troll.

1278
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,260
Yes.

1279
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:03,520
But I think it's because they're sheltered, and they don't realize how crazy, crazy people

1280
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,060
are.

1281
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,460
Well, if they get a check from the government, maybe they could do that.

1282
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,280
But I think it's just an op.

1283
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,860
I'm pretty sure it's just an op.

1284
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,660
Well, look, you and me know how crazy, crazy people are.

1285
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,940
All we have to do is look in the mirror.

1286
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,660
Just because a person's crazy...

1287
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:17,960
Look around.

1288
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:18,920
...doesn't mean that they're stupid.

1289
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,400
Crazy and stupid are two different axes.

1290
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,720
Yeah, yeah.

1291
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,080
Now, what's best is when you can get both at once, and then, and at the very ultimate

1292
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,900
peak of that, you get J.R.

1293
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,220
Bob Don.

1294
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,420
That's at the, uh, the Cartesian coordinates zero, zero.

1295
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,160
Yeah.

1296
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:36,800
Yeah.

1297
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,160
The lumpy head of himself.

1298
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:38,300
The origin.

1299
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:42,660
The smile that says nothing and everything all at the same time.

1300
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,080
Unfortunate slack.

1301
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:46,940
Unfortunate.

1302
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:47,540
Unfortunate slack.

1303
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:47,700
Ha.

1304
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,380
No, it is all fortunate.

1305
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:54,700
Well, even in, sometimes what you think is bad luck is bad luck.

1306
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:54,700


1307
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:54,700


1308
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,680
Even bad luck is really involuntary slack.

1309
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,480
The bad luck ends up paying off.

1310
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,480
And to Bob Dobbs, even bad luck is good luck.

1311
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:07,020
It's, I, that, that part is true, but I don't think very many of your listeners out there

1312
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,940
appreciate the idea of the dualities.

1313
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,040
You're pushing down their throat like rancid dog food.

1314
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:12,360
You know what?

1315
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,260
I'm all in favor of not pushing dualities down people's throats, especially not like

1316
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,220
rancid dog food.

1317
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,700
So, maybe we should change the subject.

1318
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,000


1319
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,960
Hey, so you remember what line I was on?

1320
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,440
I'm gonna change the type anyway.

1321
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,440
Ask yourself if you've been eating too many dollars while staring at your computer skyline.

1322
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:41,500
I would teach you the movie habitat hero.

1323
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:41,640
Number two.

1324
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,120
A dead man is a dead man.

1325
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,500
He couldn't have a dog in his home garden.

1326
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,500


1327
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,500


1328
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,500


1329
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,500


1330
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,500


1331
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,500


1332
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,500


1333
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,500


1334
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,840
Okay, just a little, you know, just a little.

1335
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:45,180
I making money for animal husbandry, I can give back to my cat.

1336
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:45,880
Lets eat dogs, milk your cats, maybe those only for three bucks.

1337
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:45,880


1338
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,700
So, or do we change our breakdown filter to doing it and we change the fring right?

1339
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,500
What do you call it?

1340
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,240
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid we'll have to terminate our broadcast.

1341
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,360
I don't know exactly what is happening here, but I can say this.

1342
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,360
I'm afraid we'll have to terminate our broadcast.

1343
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,300
Bob!

1344
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:11,740
Bob!

1345
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,100
Now?

1346
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:15,280
Now.
