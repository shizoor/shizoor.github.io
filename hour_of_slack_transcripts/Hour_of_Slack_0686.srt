00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:15,100
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,420
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

3
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,420
and only in the city of...

4
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,040
We are enslaved. We are in sin.

5
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,160
Perhaps four is better.

6
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:11,580
If he'd gone up like he went up, he would have come down like he came down.

7
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,900
Don't take a ride. Don't take a ride.

8
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,340
They're in Lithuanian refugee camps right now waiting to take your address, your cards, your numbers, your phone calls.

9
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,880
But some of them want to hear your ideas about a universe.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,400
Perhaps a whole entire...

11
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,300
I heard to mention, which is not only flip-flop from ours, but it's just diasporopically totally...

12
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,720
I am mildly amused by the strategy to shoot anything that moves.

13
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,200
I kind of...

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,660
That's an interesting strategy.

15
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,120
That has evolved over the years.

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,700
Just go anything that moves in an area.

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,000
Segregate off that area.

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,440
Just, you know, isolate the area.

19
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,180
Cover it with planes.

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,300
And if something moves, shoot.

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,460
Shoot it.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,180
Right. That's a great idea.

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,280
It would have worked in Vietnam if they'd let us off the leash.

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,460
We had to kill that country to save it, and I'm glad we did.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
Fighting soldiers.

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
And we're going to kill every country in the world we can to save every country.

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,760
I'm sorry. I...

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,580
Stop that. Don't like that.

29
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,820
Oh, Dave, you peacenik.

30
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,360
Look, man, have you got an objection to killing humans?

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,820
Not really.

32
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,860
Maybe you can back your cart right off my...

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,340
Oh, I can't.

34
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,740
That's that blood cult, man.

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,820
I don't want anything to do with your blood cults.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,600
This planet's got too many blood cults.

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,780
Well, no, this is love.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,540
I'm talking about love.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,480
You know, we...

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,060
Love cults.

41
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,520
It's tough love.

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,600
I think I'd like to be blood cult.

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,200
I've heard that tough love thing.

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,340
You know, it's just like...

45
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,320
It's just a euphemism for blood cult.

46
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,580
Yes, it does.

47
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,360
It does sound...

48
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,440
Just a euphemism.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,420
It's just a nicer, kinder, gentler way of saying blood cult.

50
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,100
Really?

51
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,620
Really.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,140
Yeah.

53
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,800
I think.

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,920
Of course, I'm kind of like a sponge.

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,220
You know?

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,040
You know, I really have no real ideas of concrete value of my own.

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,620
I just agree with everything.

58
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,700
Humans are, you know.

59
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,240
It's like...

60
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,860
That does sound good.

61
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,060
That does sound good to me.

62
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,640
I mean, it's everywhere, you know?

63
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,120
You've got to look at what's in front of you.

64
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,120
Humans.

65
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,000
You can't go thinking too hard.

66
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,640
No, actually, you know, there are probably, in that terrible war-torn land,

67
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,080
there's probably a hell of a lot of unsaved subgeniuses who've never heard the word of Bob,

68
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,760
hate what they're doing, hate where they're at.

69
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,160
On both sides, being shoveled into mass graves and running the bulldozers.

70
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,720
And in both cases, they're like going,

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,560
God, I wish I could repent, quit my job and slack off, but that's just not done, is it?

72
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,840
Right.

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,920
Because they've never had Bob.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,900
If they could just for once hear Bob tell them that.

75
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,620
Friends, we need to airlift those pamphlets into these war-torn areas.

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,160
That is just us.

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,620
Just us.

78
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:54,800
Just us.

79
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,000
Just us.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,100
Just us.

81
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:55,460


82
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:55,480


83
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:55,540
Just us.

84
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,540


85
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,540


86
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,540


87
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,540


88
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,540


89
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,540


90
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,540


91
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,940
Mercury on Mars, we've got to help these people if it kills them.

92
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,720
But it's tainted food for thought that you've offered.

93
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,880
I think it probably might make us all wretch once we digest the entire concept.

94
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't mind us getting off to other worlds like Uranus, you know, and Venus and places like that.

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,380
But, uh-oh.

96
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,320
See, they're trying to get in the door now.

97
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,960
I don't know.

98
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,460
It's just too...

99
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,400
Are the refugees here?

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,840
Neolistic, yeah, yeah.

101
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,220
Now, make sure they get a microphone.

102
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,460
I want to talk to these refugees.

103
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,620
We've been down there doing some taping.

104
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,200
I want to ask them what their opinion is of rocketry these days.

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:39,320
Didn't someone email the show from Bosnia or someplace the other... the last couple of weeks ago?

106
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,480
That was a trans-spatial hieroglyphic from Treblinka, dated 1943.

107
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,260
We all kind of passed out when we read it.

108
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,240
I think there was some kind of zyklon in the air or something.

109
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,420
Zyklon.

110
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,580
A pinka.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,040
I hear that little pink.

112
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,400
Princess Wee.

113
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,620
Now, wait a minute.

114
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,580
You mean to tell me, were you in the...

115
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,460
Did you guys get to be in the contest?

116
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,580
Oh, we most certainly did.

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,740
And then you were voted down when they held their hands over your head?

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,460
The audience didn't applaud wildly?

119
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,000
Right.

120
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,460
They were huffing excreted inflation.

121
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,420
No one expected Pluto to come back into orbit.

122
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:15,900
Right.

123
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,520
That's what blew the whole thing for her.

124
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:17,880
Exactly.

125
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,340
It was really spaced out.

126
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,560
She thought she was at a songwriting contest.

127
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,700
And then Pluto...

128
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,900
Excreted inflations of another planetary deity.

129
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,980
And then we were back to square one, as if that was the only square we could be on.

130
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,460
Listen.

131
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,260
That's the Princess Wee's departure harp music.

132
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,940
Oh, no.

133
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,740
Princess Pee-Pee is going to dispatch now a few brief worms.

134
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,220
I don't know.

135
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,820
I think it's about the Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's cerebral cortex or something.

136
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,180
It's memory.

137
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,440
Nope.

138
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


139
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,440
It wasn't Princess Wee's departure harp music.

140
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,700
It was Princess Wee's transformation harp music.

141
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,880
Like?

142
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:01,880


143
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,420
Where she transforms into that hideous old witch.

144
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,080
I like that.

145
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,740
Oh, baby.

146
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,100
I like that board.

147
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,560
I'd like you to meet Mr. and Mrs. Cronbo.

148
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,240
Mr. and Mrs. Hendon.

149
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,000
Mr. and Mrs. Dog Dodger.

150
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,120
Mr. and Mrs. Clomax Cooper.

151
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,680
Sure.

152
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:23,720
Here.

153
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,320
Dr. Frizzy.

154
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,580
Princess Wee is a little bit of a bummer.

155
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,180
Her silver broomstick chases the silver surfer through the solar system.

156
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,780
The okanini, okanini, okanini, okanini adore.

157
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,300
The silver surfer does that.

158
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,900
The tiny, short-headed children.

159
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,680
Witch UFOs.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
The misspoken spokes of the karmic wheel and the dharmic ding-dong.

161
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,980
Larry, Claire, and Mohammed.

162
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,600
Blue in the wike of the silver surfers.

163
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,120
Pinky and the whale.

164
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,900
Wike.

165
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,120
Frida and the...

166
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,660
Surfing that witch disco.

167
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,220
Mr. Blusterings.

168
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,940
My eyelashes were poker straight until I got the new electric eyelash curler.

169
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,860
It's heated and it's so wonderful.

170
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,520
My eyelashes are so curly.

171
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,400
I can't take it anymore.

172
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,540
It's so much fun.

173
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,080
Not telling.

174
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,440
As long as you're doing business with Roger Cadavra, none of those facial features will ever change.

175
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:37,640
You're transformed from one designer box to another while all of your post-life makeup needs are met.

176
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:47,160
Bones flying end-over-end through the air magically transform into space stations in outer space.

177
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,100
CNN.com.

178
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,720
Astronomers discover new solar system.

179
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,520
Oh.

180
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,380
Another one?

181
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,940
That's right.

182
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,600
Washington.

183
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:01,420
Astronomers said Thursday that they had discovered the first solar system with multiple planets outside our own.

184
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,180
Price bomb!

185
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,480
With three massive planets orbiting a sun-like star.

186
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,560
All three planets circling the star.

187
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,720
Epsilon.

188
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,160
Andromeda are gas giants like big neighbor Jupiter.

189
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:22,040
However, an Earth-type planet might also be a part of this system, one researcher said.

190
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,020
Mind.

191
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,540
See, that explains it.

192
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,280
That explains everything.

193
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,580
Epsilon Andromeda.

194
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,180
Yeah.

195
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,020
When you started saying Epsilon, I was going, no, it's Epsilon Booty.

196
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,600
Please.

197
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,280
Yeah, man, Epsilon Booty.

198
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,840
That's where the grays are from.

199
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,840
Well, Epsilon Andromeda is not the same as Epsilon Booty.

200
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,460
Booty is the place where the little, you know, things on the dashboard.

201
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,240
Yeah, that's where the leprechauns are from.

202
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,720
Yeah, I thought it was the things.

203
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,080
And the little plastic Jesuses.

204
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,800
Well, some of them are more involved.

205
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,100
Some of them are more involved than others, if you know what I mean.

206
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:02,280
Some of the plastic Jesuses are actually huge macrobiotic robots with breasts of steel and like mines, like iron traps.

207
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,060
Very wishful thinking, yeah.

208
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,320
Yeah, but some of the plastic Jesuses are just simply liquor flasks.

209
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah.

210
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,660
I was reading out of the personal ads in the Cleveland.

211
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,420
With no real spirit inside.

212
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,540
You know what I mean?

213
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,580
Well, you have to pour your own spirit into them.

214
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,520
Yep, yep.

215
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,080
That's the Holy Spirit right there.

216
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,000
You have to use the spirit to replenish.

217
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,520
Or otherwise, Jesus gets dry.

218
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
Daily dowsing.

219
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
It requires sometimes.

220
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,780
And then there are those with Velcro bottoms.

221
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,760
So they're removable so you can wash them.

222
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,900
But you don't want to spank too often or that sticks.

223
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,460
Oh, I know.

224
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,840
Right?

225
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, that's the whole idea.

226
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,180
Well, you know.

227
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,960
I see.

228
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,840
You can brush the Velcro and make it all new again.

229
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,880
Born again, sort of.

230
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,240
You know.

231
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,380
Chest merkins and then pootie spankers from Velcro.

232
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,260
Now, I mean, what will the world come to next?

233
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,900
Smart bombs?

234
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,240
That are stupider than me?

235
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,960
I don't know.

236
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,640
It's just science.

237
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,020
Science marches on.

238
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,940
It marches backwards, too, at the same time.

239
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,760
I think it's listening to a beat off of a different drummer, don't you?

240
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,660
I think so.

241
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,180
Yeah.

242
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,260
I think I would forbid all unforbidden science.

243
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,180
And make everything as apparent.

244
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,860
Give every man the plans for the atom bomb.

245
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,880
Because if you ban the unforbidden sciences, they simply become forbidden.

246
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,420
Well, you've got to keep things moving.

247
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,920
You have to keep a kind of a cycle.

248
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,140
Right.

249
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,500
So you're talking about making the forbidden sciences unforbidden at the same time that you make the unforbidden sciences forbidden.

250
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,800
Right.

251
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,800
Hey, man, you can download a plan to make a nuclear weapon out of household materials from sub-site.

252
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,480
Here's a new site I just checked out.

253
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,780
Science.org, a private...

254
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,860
What was that back?

255
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,520
Wait, go back.

256
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,560
Science.org, a private research institute.

257
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,720
Cool.

258
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,760
Private research?

259
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,140
I know what that means.

260
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,100
What does it mean?

261
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,480
Private.

262
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,480


263
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,960
It means dead.

264
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,520
Zombies.

265
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,400
It means private.

266
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,880
Right, right.

267
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,100
How much do they have to pay in order to get inside this private research?

268
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,620
I wouldn't want to be in those basements, you know what I mean?

269
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,860
That means bringing dinosaurs back to life.

270
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,140
Well...

271
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,280
Cloned from mosquito blood and frozen in amber.

272
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,540
Right.

273
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,520
You don't pay with...

274
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,440
You don't pay with money, let's put it that way.

275
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:09,780
Right.

276
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,120
You pay with your own sangric fluids, if you know what I mean.

277
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,300
Sometimes you're allowed to use phlegm, if you'd like.

278
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,100
You are genetically superior.

279
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,580
Well, I'm afraid I'm not going to ever fit that category, but I've been asked to contribute.

280
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,100
Well, they're bigger, not necessarily more superior.

281
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,880
They just simply can crush all the sperm by rolling them around inside the womb.

282
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,880
Oh, now you've got me thinking about bugs and stuff again.

283
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,240
Attack of the killer sperm.

284
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,860
Well, we've got to be cutting out of here.

285
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,560
All right.

286
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,260
Yeah, we've got to force feed the thing we're growing.

287
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,520
You just strap on your witch disco there, people.

288
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
You have to dissect...

289
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,500
All right.

290
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:49,540
All right.

291
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:49,960
All right.

292
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,080


293
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,080


294
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,080


295
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,080


296
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,080


297
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,080


298
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,100


299
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,440
Let's play a song here that's going out.

300
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,900
This last song I'm going to play goes out to all them fighter jocks over there burning people alive.

301
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,140
We're here on the scene with Jesus Christ.

302
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,700
We have to come apart.

303
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,100
Jesus, you're on a remote down there on that mountaintop side there.

304
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,620
What do you see from down there?

305
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,960
It looks like we're looking at a bunch of refugees.

306
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,280
Should we bomb them, sir?

307
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,960
Oh, Lord, I think...

308
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,560
Yeah, go ahead.

309
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,520
Let's drop pamphlet number one.

310
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,500
Let's start there.

311
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,460
Until next week.

312
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,280
Drop pamphlet number two.

313
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,900
Keep your hat on tight.

314
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,540
I think we need to drop some more ass.

315
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,660
They're back to the wind in your shack.

316
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,900
Firmly seated in that there rocket seat.

317
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,500
We'll see you all next week, kids.

318
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,580
My name's Chaz.

319
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,560
I'm Ivan.

320
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,880
Peelil.

321
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,180
Lonesome.

322
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,220
Cowboy Dave.

323
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,080
And Princess We Are Doe.

324
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,120
And Morgana's sitting on my lap over here checking out weird websites.

325
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,180
And I'll talk to you guys later.

326
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,500
See you next week.

327
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,180
Bye.

328
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,980
Once again, this last song goes out.

329
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,360
You listen to the words because this song goes out to all them fighter jets burning up people alive.

330
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,040
Bye.

331
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,800
Drive carefully.

332
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,240
Real careful.

333
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,480
Bye.

334
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,080
I'm in the rain.

335
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,680
The sun has yet to rise.

336
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,400
Shake the webs and clear my head.

337
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,940
Put on my target eyes.

338
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,900
Ground boots.

339
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
And crowns.

340
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,540
On the field.

341
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,020
Ground is all I see.

342
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,280
But the red spot on my middle stick is all I really need.

343
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,720
On my ride.

344
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,920
There's many sides.

345
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,680
Bend in front of my tail.

346
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,520
Another target in the eye.

347
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,500
Oh, midnight's growing late.

348
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,500
Midnight's growing late.

349
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,940
Midnight's growing late.

350
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,240
Midnight's growing late.

351
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
Midnight's growing late.

352
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,640
Midnight's growing late.

353
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,440
Midnight's growing late.

354
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,720
Oh, midnight's growing late.

355
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,480
From morning mist I rise.

356
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,420
To help them greet the day.

357
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,020
With little silver sunbeams.

358
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,280
And little infrareds.

359
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,520
I paint the house, I paint the dogs

360
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,740
I paint the chicken coop

361
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,580
And when they come out to see the show

362
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,180
I turn and beat them too

363
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,780
On my ride there's many signs

364
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,460
And it's on my tail

365
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,240
Another target in the eye

366
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,320
Of midnight's growing day

367
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,440
Of midnight's growing day

368
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,680
Of midnight's growing day

369
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,700
They'll never know, they'll never see

370
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,500
Before the hit time's gone

371
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,900
Back into the dragon's breath

372
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,260
To sing the anthem

373
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,220
To sing the dragon's song

374
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,000
Back home folks think what I do

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
I do to keep them free

376
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,480
And no one knows my secret

377
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,580
No one knows I fly for me

378
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,120
On my ride there's many signs

379
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,780
And it's on my tail

380
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,520
Another target in the eye

381
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,500
Of midnight's growing day

382
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,700
Of midnight's growing day

383
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,820
Of midnight's growing day

384
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,220
Of midnight's growing day

385
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,300
On my ride there's many signs

386
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,600
And it's on my tail

387
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,360
Everyone Stevens has told me

388
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:45,180
That once the dragon sets in

389
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,660
On my very old stable

390
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:47,660


391
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,160
Thank you.

392
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,140
Good night.

393
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,700
Good night.

394
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,660
Good night.

395
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,960
Wouldn't it be nifty if we could just add this?

396
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,860
Or, golly gee, it would just be so much nicer if we could remove that.

397
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,720
And it would attract so many more followers.

398
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,120
Sure, their motives sound pure.

399
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,300
In fact, they go on to say things like,

400
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,920
more followers means more bucks for Bob,

401
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,780
which means a greater ministry,

402
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,820
which means more souls to save.

403
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,660
And who could be against that?

404
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,820
Not me, says I.

405
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,520
But the devil's in the details.

406
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,460
Tell me more.

407
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, they say,

408
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,400
take for instance, so,

409
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,600
Jane or Hyperclete.

410
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,400
He's funny, sure,

411
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,120
but he's also offensive.

412
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,780
He talks too much about killing normals

413
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,960
and exploiting women.

414
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,180
It turns off a lot of would-be subgenies.

415
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,740
Oh, now, we're not saying excommunicate them or anything,

416
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,780
but couldn't you just fade them out over time?

417
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,560
You know,

418
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,040
invite them less to events or edit his tapes

419
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,100
or skip them all together,

420
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,760
and no one would know the difference.

421
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,540
To that, I say this.

422
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,860
Someone would know the difference.

423
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,380
You would know the difference because it was your idea.

424
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,600
I would know the difference

425
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,440
because I was the collaborator in your little scheme.

426
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,880
Jane would probably know the difference

427
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,200
because he's the target of your little plot.

428
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,340
And last, but not least,

429
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,180
a certain deity named Dobbs would also know.

430
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,060
Because he's Bob!

431
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,380
Remember Bob?

432
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,540
J.R. Bob Dobbs?

433
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,740
The man who took a bullet so that you wouldn't have to take a job?

434
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,600
Yeah, him!

435
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,380
Our subgenius religious leader whose words and wisdom

436
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,840
we supposedly emulate every day of our lives.

437
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,520
Bob doesn't call Jane or Hyperclete's Jane or Hyperclete's.

438
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,300
No, sir.

439
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,620
He calls him Saint Jane or Hyperclete's.

440
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,320
No, sir. He calls him Saint Jane or Hyperclete's.

441
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,360
No, sir. He calls him Saint Jane or Hyperclete's.

442
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,340
And don't you goddamn forget it!

443
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,500
Saint means sacred, beyond reproach,

444
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,300
above suspicion, above criticism,

445
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,160
by non-saints like you and me.

446
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,920
One cannot modify what a saint says

447
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,280
just to conform to popular standards of the day.

448
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,100
Saint Jane or's words were directly inspired by Bob

449
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,120
and inscribed in both his holy testaments.

450
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,400
The Collected Teachings of J.R. Bob Dobbs and Revelation X,

451
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,400
two books you better have behind your porcelain altar

452
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,220
if you hope to survive X-Day.

453
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,200
You'll need both documents, along with your current subgenius membership,

454
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,920
to get aboard those pleasure saucers come July 5th, 1998.

455
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,020
That's A.D., after Dobbs.

456
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,780
Oh, there'll be chaos.

457
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,840
There'll be murder and mayhem.

458
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,860
There'll be bullets flying and bodies frying.

459
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,060
But don't you think for a moment

460
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,380
that it will prevent the gate master from checking each

461
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,760
and every passport for errors?

462
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,420
That membership card better have your name on it,

463
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,820
and those books better be dog-eared and well-read,

464
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,980
with every sentence underlined

465
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,720
and every page present and or accounted for.

466
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,200
If you're missing so much as one word of Scripture,

467
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,320
you better run like your very life depends on it

468
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,100
and buy yourself a new copy, and I mean fast,

469
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,040
because Bob doesn't like it.

470
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,760
He doesn't like Bobbies who edit his holy word for whatever reason.

471
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Bob is the master of excuses,

472
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,360
and he's already heard them all, my friends.

473
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,060
He doesn't care if you lost it, forgot it,

474
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,500
the dog ate it, or the cat ripped it apart.

475
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,520
He doesn't care if you tore out one page by accident or on purpose

476
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,140
because you found it offensive,

477
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,340
or you thought it was politically incorrect,

478
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,100
or you thought it might win more converts

479
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,040
by removing it from public opinion.

480
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:36,960
In short, he doesn't care what you think his religion needs

481
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,220
in order to be better.

482
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,100
Now, maybe after you sacrifice yourself in death,

483
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,180
get resurrected and abducted by aliens,

484
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,960
negotiate salvation for an entire planet,

485
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,780
or at least the parts that matter,

486
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,940
and create your own world-class religion,

487
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,940
maybe then, and only then,

488
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,040
Bob will care two shits.

489
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,980
What you think he should do in order to improve his religion.

490
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,220
Till then, shut the hell up!

491
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,620
Bob's not being arrogant, my friends.

492
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,420
He's being realistic.

493
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,400
You have literally no idea what the hell you're complaining about.

494
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,520
You've never seen heaven, let alone the fires of hell.

495
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,360
What gives you the right to criticize Bob?

496
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,440
His church or his apostles?

497
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,460
You're lucky.

498
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:39,520
You're lucky that we've replaced the old, old-day stoning rituals

499
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,300
with the new-age pharmaceutical varieties, my friend,

500
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,800
because back in those old days,

501
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,520
ho-ho, oh, I'm not even gonna go there.

502
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,600
The statute of limitations has yet to expire.

503
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,620
But the point is this,

504
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,420
the amazing thing,

505
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,360
the amazing thing is that despite the incredible blasphemy

506
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,180
of even thinking about changing the church,

507
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,700
altering so much as a single dot on Bob's photocopied face,

508
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:12,200
despite the utter heresy of these thoughts,

509
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,520
let alone these deeds,

510
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,100
subgeniuses still vocalize their negative opinions

511
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,840
in the omnipresence of Bob.

512
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,560
Now, now just stop.

513
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,320
Just stop for a moment and consider,

514
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,640
just consider the incredible ramifications of this.

515
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,200
I mean, don't you see?

516
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,480
Isn't it remarkable what it says?

517
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,580
What it says is that even though through their words and deeds

518
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,660
they express rejection and contempt for Bob and his holy church,

519
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:52,860
they still feel secure that Bob will allow them to live and criticize.

520
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,620
But what this proves is that these religious retards

521
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,040
in their infinite lack of wisdom still realize,

522
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,120
like, like instinct,

523
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,180
that Bob loves them so much

524
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,700
that he'll put up with their crap.

525
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,740
Now friends, there's a word for that.

526
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,660
It's called unconditional love.

527
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,100
It reminds me of an interesting couple I've observed

528
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,300
for some time now.

529
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,900
He's a nice guy,

530
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,540
but then there's his pathetic partner.

531
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,500
He puts up with the most horrible complaining all the time.

532
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,100
How he tolerates it, I don't know.

533
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,700
All she does is bitch and moan and bitch and moan,

534
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,120
always dissatisfied, and yet he still loves her.

535
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,040
He sacrifices everything for her.

536
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,200
And all she does is gripe.

537
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,040
Oh sure, he gets some sex now and then,

538
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,100
but big whoop,

539
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,120
he could get the same sex from practically anyone else

540
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,000
without the chronic complaining and obnoxious chin music.

541
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,100
You'd think he'd either ditch the bitch or kill her.

542
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,220
You know, I hope he does both,

543
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,380
because she deserves it, quite frankly.

544
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,820
Unless she wises up and starts showing just a little bit of appreciation

545
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,860
for the man who protects her,

546
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,800
dedicates his life to her,

547
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,680
and struggles each and every day to provide her a better future.

548
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,900
You know,

549
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
incidentally, I think you might know this couple.

550
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,940
His name is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

551
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,420
And I'll just let your imagination roam for a bit

552
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,620
to see if you can figure out who his allegorical partner is.

553
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,460
But here's a little hint, friends,

554
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,040
just to help you out.

555
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,160
I ain't talking about Connie.

556
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,100
No, sir.

557
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,220
I'm talking about that whiny subgenius brat

558
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,340
to the left of the person on your right.

559
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,300
And to the right of the person on your left.

560
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,040
Why, sure.

561
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,440
If you were the most handsome deity traveling through the universe,

562
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,340
and the subgenius you loved and worked so hard for

563
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,800
didn't pay you much attention,

564
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,200
wasn't as good looking as you were,

565
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,680
was stingy with their love offerings,

566
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,560
and complained all the goddamn time,

567
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,180
would you put up with their shit?

568
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,660
Or would you jettison them into space

569
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,440
through the nearest airlock

570
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,160
and grab yourself a younger, cuter,

571
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,380
more appreciative subgenius instead?

572
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,980
Just you think about that

573
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,240
the next time you get the urge

574
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,320
to open your big-ass mouth

575
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,340
and start dictating to Dobbs.

576
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,240
Hearin' it, the word of Dobbs,

577
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
breathe, Bob!

578
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,440
Amen.

579
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:58,040
I've got a challenge for you,

580
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,400
a challenge for me.

581
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,000
A baby challenge,

582
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,560
a baby challenge.

583
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,760
And a baby challenge for me.

584
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,660
I canoria challenge,

585
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:25,220
Love picture, love picture for you

586
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,600
Love picture, love picture for you

587
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:52,240
On my own, pretending boss beside me

588
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,840
In the dark, his dogs in pipe, they guide me

589
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,580
On my own, pretending boss beside me

590
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:07,100
Without love, I smell his drop around me

591
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,440
And when I have no slack, I touch my clown and God has found me

592
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:21,120
On my job, the nunnels act like dumb shits

593
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:28,560
Without slack, the sweat runs down my armpits

594
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,580
On my own, pretending boss beside me

595
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,280
On my own, pretending boss beside me

596
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:49,780
Without love, the sun shines down my armpits

597
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,580
On my own, pretending boss beside me

598
00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:00,580
Without love, I smell his drop around me

599
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:11,540
I know that I am screwed, still I say, there's a day of pain.

600
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:22,000
I love God, but when the rush is over, he'll be gone.

601
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:33,480
The earth will be in ruins. Without him, the world around me changes.

602
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,340
No conspiracy is everywhere, the malls are full of pink boys.

603
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:47,900
I love God, but every day I don't spend.

604
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,980
The thirty bucks I make, I don't spend.

605
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:51,980


606
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,500
I'm only just pretending.

607
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,440
Without me, Bob's world burning.

608
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,080
Unactive, awful, half-dislized.

609
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,780
Tonight's reading is from The Autopsy by Michael Shea.

610
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,880
The parasite's race had traced and tapped the complex interface

611
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,880
between the cortical integration of sense input

612
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,400
and the neural output governing response.

613
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,060
It had interposed its brain between, sharing consciousness

614
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,900
while solely commanding the pathways of reaction.

615
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,200
The host, the bottled personality, was mute and limnus

616
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,660
for any least expression of its own will, while hellishly articulate

617
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,280
and agile in the service of the parasites.

618
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,100
It was the host's own hands that bound and wrenched the life

619
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:51,000
half out of his prey. His own loins that experienced the repeated orgasms,

620
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,320
crowning his other despoilations of their bodies.

621
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:02,000
And when they lay, bound and shrieking still, ready for the consummation,

622
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,100
it was his own strength that hauled the smoking entrails from them,

623
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,560
and his own intimate tongue and guzzling mouth he plunged into the rank,

624
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,500
palpitating theists.

625
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,000
This has been The Autopsy by Michael Shea.

626
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,360
On tonight's reading for little yeti children.

627
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,440
Rocket Butt was an heir of Lepetimane.

628
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,640
He was a student of Lepetimane.

629
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,540
Of Governor Lepetimane.

630
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,760
He swiftly outdistanced his master.

631
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,260
Even the great Joseph Pujol, pyroflatulation master,

632
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,880
had to take off his hat and bow down backwards to Rocket Butt.

633
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,820
The mighty, mighty.

634
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,660
Deformed as he was, powerful as anything.

635
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,600
Rocket Butt.

636
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,440
Nothing could escape the red eye of Rocket Butt.

637
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,600
His father had trained in the Carpathian Mountains since he was a six year old babe.

638
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,380
And by the time that Rocket Butt was a mere seven himself,

639
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,160
he could see there was something in the future for him.

640
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,320
The growth coming back there,

641
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,340
and the growth in his eye,

642
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,760
is not the growth in his eye,

643
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,400
but the growth in his face.

644
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,660
The Rocket Butt third eye

645
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,620
gaze into that third eye.

646
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,360
The eye in the canyon.

647
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,360
Are you ready to look into that eye?

648
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,380
Are you wishing to stick your finger into the fourth ear of Rocket Butt?

649
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,480
Rocket Butt, maker of the fire that kills.

650
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,160
Maker of the fires that shall raise us up above the very heavens.

651
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,680
The fire that burns itself and get us off this planet.

652
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,380
What's wrong?

653
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,740
Rocket Butt and his eternal enemy, Beano Man.

654
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,240
You can't cling to Rocket Butt's clothes.

655
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,600
Only Beano Man can draw Rocket Butt to his soul.

656
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,320
Rocket Butt's thoughts are soft and vapid like the errant owls that come by in the night.

657
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,460
For years, nobody knew he could talk.

658
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,480
He knows you.

659
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,360
He just sat in the corner and stared at nothing to say.

660
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,620
Playing with his lighter.

661
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,700
He would just look up at the sky.

662
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,480
And he would pyroflatulate, knowing that one day he shall do more than just pyroflatulate,

663
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,880
but to rise up.

664
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,380
Rise above the others.

665
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,760
Rise above it all, or drown in your own liquid rocket fuel.

666
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,200
And then he shall urinate.

667
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,300
I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the rocket fuel.

668
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,460
In order to come out of his ears.

669
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,600
And I was not offended by it.

670
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,700
Not like other kids.

671
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,380
For I knew I had to rise above it all.

672
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,740
Maybe there was something he could do with his differentness.

673
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,380
His unique abilities.

674
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,060
To the maggot in the cheese.

675
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,660
The cheese is the universe.

676
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,000
Now it is time to cut the cheese.

677
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,080
The rocket butt.

678
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,720
To the ant in the anthill.

679
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,800
The anthill is the universe.

680
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,480
Moldy, hairy.

681
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,580
There are more things on heaven and on earth.

682
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:20,700
Than are dreamed of in your pathetic earthling philosophies.

683
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,740
Your silly, fixed-legged, three-dimensional world.

684
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
Hairy beans.

685
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,380
Say, creepy clown just walked in.

686
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,840
Creepy clown?

687
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,900
You'll love creepy clown.

688
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,480
What the hell you been up to, creepy?

689
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,440
He's bigger now.

690
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,940
Hey, creep.

691
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,420
How's it going, buddy?

692
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,560
Hey, why doesn't he say anything?

693
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,960
He just stands there smiling.

694
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,920
He's got to do something about this.

695
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,460
Creepy clown.

696
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,440
Creepy clown.

697
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
Oh my god, his face is turning blue.

698
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,300
Or is that the makeup?

699
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,420
Creepy clown's freaking me out, dude.

700
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,180
Oh man, there's nothing we can do about it.

701
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,740
He's going to die.

702
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,560
Maybe we should just leave him here.

703
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,420
Look at that.

704
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,540
Look at that, man.

705
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,700
Get out of here.

706
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,540
He's not doing anything about it.

707
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,960
You could probably try a mouth nasal or nozzle.

708
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,060
Yeah, nozzle insulation.

709
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,140
Get down and see if you can blow him back into existence.

710
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,600
Like, you know, in some Birdman film.

711
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,440
Go on, get down there.

712
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,640
Creepy clown's here.

713
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,660
We're toast, man.

714
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,840
Oh no, man.

715
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,280
This poor clown can't even get a boner.

716
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,340
What are we going to do?

717
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,800
We're just going to have to leave him here to die.

718
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,980
You can't outrun a clown.

719
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,860
He's getting bluer and bluer.

720
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,600
He's that big.

721
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,120
Creepy clown cannot die, for creepy clown is death.

722
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,040
Oh my god.

723
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,880
This is like a bad bird.

724
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,460
Creepy clown is death.

725
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,560
Death comes in the form of a grinning clown.

726
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,280
He does not speak, but only grins.

727
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,620
The grinning clown that comes in the form of a grinning clown.

728
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,620


729
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,620


730
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,620


731
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,620


732
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,620


733
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,620


734
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,620


735
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,600
He comes from the cloud.

736
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,320
And the crystal skulls that all he has.

737
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,720
The grease painted death's head skull face grin of creepy clown.

738
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,560
And the equally hideous skull face grin of Bob Dobbs.

739
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,300
And the skull face grin of the Teletubby Twinkie.

740
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,580
These ultimate fiends of horror are coming to your screen now in 3D.

741
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,720
Ah!

742
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,240
He, he, he.

743
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:14,400
He, he, he.

744
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:14,620
He, he, he.

745
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,280
He, he, he.

746
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,820
Wanna go for a ride?

747
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,820
Yeah, boss.

748
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,320
Yeah, boss.

749
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,320


750
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,500
Yeah, boss.

751
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,360
They're still looking for an American to go, doctor.

752
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,780
Rocketbutt like to pick up little girls and take them to the moon.

753
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,580
Yeah, but he never did no good with them.

754
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,660
Around the world, baby.

755
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,440
This is my nozzle.

756
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,420
Will you help me adjust it?

757
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,580
And is this your O-ring?

758
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,040
This is my nozzle.

759
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,540
This is my nose cone.

760
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,620
It's really awfully flaky.

761
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,940
Hey, baby, I come apart 3D.

762
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,620
My God, the O-ring is faulty.

763
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,700
What?

764
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,640
This is a Challenger explosion all over again.

765
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,400
His moon pants, they're swelling.

766
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,640
What a, what a powerful, beautiful pair of moon pants.

767
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,120
Rock, flesh, and oil.

768
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,420
We were all saved.

769
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,340
Such a terrible, terrible, different, terrible, terrible bridge.

770
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,240
This is, this is my nozzle.

771
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,260
This is my cone.

772
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,720
One's for flying.

773
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,960
The other's for fun.

774
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,620
The other's for flying.

775
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,720
The other's a bone.

776
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:15,920
The other's a bone.

777
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,980
What do we do with the rubber?

778
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,680
Of course you know about Tiger Balm, right?

779
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,460
Okay, we'll try it later.

780
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,460
And I rub it on my buttocks religiously.

781
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,740
In fact, it's part of my religion.

782
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,400
Tiger Balm is, you know, as you know, is that ointment used by martial artists to increase

783
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,160
the toughness.

784
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,680
Spunk ointment?

785
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,200
Are you crazy?

786
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:34,740
Hello?

787
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,400
That's spunk ointment?

788
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,020
Did you say spunk ointment, Dan?

789
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,700
Are you serious, Dan Balm?

790
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,580
It is probably made from the spunk of wild boars from the ancient province.

791
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,600
Apparently, you've never heard of Cobalt Mountain.

792
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:44,600


793
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:44,600


794
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:44,600


795
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:44,800
No.

796
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:59,940
Oh damn, I guess that'sобt...

797
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:12,100
And from a few many thousand years long.

798
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,960
And other woods now over 100 years old.

799
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,600
Oh really?

800
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:14,600


801
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:14,600


802
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:14,600


803
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:20,460
Oh, no, no. The only nuke worth nuking is a non-nuclear nuke.

804
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,220
Oh, the nuclear nuke.

805
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,980
Yes, yes.

806
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,020
No, no, you're thinking about the nuclear, the nuclear nuclear nuke.

807
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,360
Yes, yes.

808
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,080
And the lovely missionaries.

809
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:34,980
They're so pretty.

810
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,580
The apocalyptic visionaries.

811
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,820
They have them dyed different decorator, you know, colors.

812
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,820
And they're so very, very pretty.

813
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,400
When they drop, they look like glass ornaments, really.

814
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,480
Do you know...

815
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,360
They're very, very pretty, these nuke missiles.

816
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,580
Have you ever heard of many of the fine products from Hiroshima Schwartz's

817
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,880
Ministry of Nuclear Weapons warehouse?

818
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,320
No.

819
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,560
Oh, they've got cobalt earrings.

820
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,300
You don't want to...

821
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,180
You just want to scare them just wearing...

822
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,480
They've got cobalt bomb earrings.

823
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,160
They've got little Wernher von Braunmeister's that are disguised as a keg for a party thing.

824
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,800
And you can just...

825
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,440
They're all like little neutron bombs.

826
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,580
Just blow away your enemies and keep their apartments.

827
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,420
I certainly hope they're in good taste.

828
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,560
Who gets you mad?

829
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,560
That rap, rap, that rap jammer boom-boomin' next door?

830
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,340
Some waitress stole your parking spot?

831
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,420
Don't get mad.

832
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,220
Get the bomb.

833
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,560
Nuke them today at Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

834
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,680
So long as it's a soft bomb which utilizes soothing classical music.

835
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:40,900
It will create a doomsday shroud which will cover the earth for 90,000 years.

836
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,420
I do.

837
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,520
I do.

838
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,380
The tasteful doomsday shroud.

839
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,340
Good for all occasions.

840
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,440
Hey, let's have a shady mall doomsday.

841
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,300
And all the girls can invite us to the apocalypse.

842
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,020
Huh?

843
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,820
Friday models the doomsday shroud.

844
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,920
Walking down the ramp...

845
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,400
And get a load of those puckered apocalypse.

846
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,280
Oh, look, Friday's...

847
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,740
There may be kissing the...

848
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,280
Bringing her quills into the eyes of the audience.

849
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,640
Blinding the critics.

850
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,280
Oh.

851
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,940
So appreciated.

852
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,860
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

853
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,140
Now that is...

854
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,780
That's too surreal for me.

855
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,100
Oh, now look what...

856
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,280
Now she's quill-less.

857
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,340
Now she's quill-less.

858
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,220
She looks almost nude.

859
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,140
And in fact, she's wearing the pirate suit.

860
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,220
Just, uh, handy.

861
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,020
Look at how light on her toes she is, too.

862
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,060
She's lifting off.

863
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,620
She's rising up.

864
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
But it's the flame coming out of...

865
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:35,980
What?

866
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,520
Friday Jones was rocket butt.

867
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,080
There she blows!

868
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,220
That's crazy.

869
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,760
There she is.

870
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,840
Looks like it's going to be quite a...

871
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,020
The crowd goes wild.

872
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,000
Alberto Squanzi.

873
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,860
Alberto Squanzi's been working on these

874
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,940
pliroflatulence devices and dresses

875
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,700
for the last seven years now.

876
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,500
And this model is sure to get some stares

877
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,300
wherever it goes.

878
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,620
Most of the spectators, however, in this audience

879
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,000
have been seriously scorched.

880
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,980
Well, that's all very relaxing.

881
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,260
I think we can all turn over and go back to sleep.

882
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,740
Now...

883
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,220
Did you guys want to talk about

884
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,660
Rocket Butt's big, huge canine incisors

885
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,760
with the poison that comes out when it gets mad?

886
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,400
I don't want to talk about our communication problem.

887
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,860
I remember being in the paddy field

888
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,300
with Rocket Butt back in 68.

889
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,980
Oh, Rocket Butt.

890
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,120
He saved all our asses.

891
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,460
Charlie did over the hill

892
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,260
and caught a bale of water.

893
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,580
Someone couldn't climb up again.

894
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,320
Then the bomb went off

895
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,680
and I found this mess in my lap

896
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,980
that used to be Rocket Butt's face.

897
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,540
They put together Rocket Butt like Humpty Dumpty,

898
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,840
piece by piece.

899
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,660
Bits of spirulence,

900
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,240
strange, odd factors from another galaxy,

901
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,180
elements that no one had ever seen before.

902
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,640
The connection between all disciplines,

903
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,140
biology, geology, black smokers,

904
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,040
quantum physics, religion.

905
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,940
Smelting.

906
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,660
Super string theory.

907
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:14,840
Beautiful ingots.

908
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,700
Rocket Butt.

909
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,960
Grand unified forces.

910
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,220
Speaking for another...

911
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:25,460
This is the keyword metafile for this radio show.

912
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,480
Rocket Butt's great-great-great-great-grandfather...

913
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,620
Speaking for the asshole plane.

914
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,300
Rocket Butt's great-great-great-grandfather

915
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,540
was the elephant man.

916
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,520
Or actually live in the asshole plane

917
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,540
and are incapable of...

918
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,120
Old child.

919
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,640
He's bottle Rocket Butt.

920
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,520
He was small and weak, but wise.

921
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,160
He fueled and sub-sumptuous sub-pumps

922
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,280
and other things that can't really be described on the air.

923
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,520
But wait, I have a question to ask of the great and mighty Stang.

924
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,800
Who dares come forward and question the great and mighty Stang?

925
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,080
Oh, just me.

926
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,300
Little, little animals.

927
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,300
But I have a question.

928
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,840
Um, if you had...

929
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,740
I don't know if it's respectable.

930
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,560
...only a finite amount of water to take into space,

931
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,780
wouldn't you, like, you know,

932
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,120
assuming you, like, recycled your own waste and everything?

933
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:23,820
Right.

934
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,980
Well, needless to say.

935
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,540
Oh, boy.

936
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,300
But...

937
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,220
What else are you going to find to drink these days during the drought?

938
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,280
It's a perfect excuse.

939
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,500
Really?

940
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,860
Just tie it up?

941
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,520
Well, you know, tie it.

942
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,060
I enjoy it.

943
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,820
If we had a finite amount of water to take into space,

944
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,900
then what?

945
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,480
She forgot.

946
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,520
No, she's asking her great friend.

947
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,000
She...

948
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,160
I think the question was something like this.

949
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:49,720
If...

950
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,220
There...

951
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,440
If you had a finite amount of water,

952
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:54,880
the well...

953
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,100
We're speaking spiritually of the logos of the well.

954
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,020
That is the word of the divine woo-woo.

955
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,500
Huh?

956
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,200
The woo-woo.

957
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,060
The divine woo-woo.

958
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,680
Water on the moon.

959
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,140
Now, the second I look at it,

960
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,220
it's just...

961
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,100
So, if you excrete liquids in outer space,

962
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,240
does it just form like a large sphere that clings to your skin because of surface tension?

963
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,460
It forms a bubble.

964
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,200
Yeah.

965
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,300
From what I've heard, it forms...

966
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,600
Perfectly round the sphere.

967
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,140
...a clandestine group that follows you around and will harass you and could make...

968
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,220
And you can stick a...

969
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,080
...and you pay extra for those spheres.

970
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,180
Yeah, and you can stick a straw right into that little sphere,

971
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,640
that little planet of water,

972
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,200
and suck it dry.

973
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:35,880
And say, lemonade.

974
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,560
Yeah.

975
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,440
And re-release it.

976
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,920
And see, that's how you stay perpetually in motion, drinking your own fluids.

977
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:41,820
One way, anyway.

978
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,500
Who's gonna be sticking their straw?

979
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,300
When they turn like great hollow,

980
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,180
you could probably set a map.

981
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,200
You know, you could check your navigation.

982
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,760
What I like, Friday, can I just say that I really like when you open your mouth

983
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,460
and you can see the glow, you know, like you showed me that time?

984
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,920
The canyons of Carl Sagan's mind.

985
00:45:59,160 --> 00:45:59,920
Is Friday there?

986
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:00,800
Yes.

987
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,560
Okay.

988
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,820
I think she's stroking her little chubby right now,

989
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,640
thinking about you.

990
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, I couldn't hear that.

991
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,240
She is our little sex kitten.

992
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,840
It's not really Friday.

993
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:10,380
She's...

994
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,000
Her life...

995
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,120
Her life line is still back in the small time.

996
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,460
She's Friday's child.

997
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,500
What is that?

998
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,280
I can't do it.

999
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,980
But it sounds like the old ladies during the 30s and 40s

1000
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,320
who were telling people not to go to Bob Conch's

1001
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,100
or to play with their sexual grievances.

1002
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,460
Don't play with your sexual grievances.

1003
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,460
Friday's child.

1004
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,800
Put them down.

1005
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,000
Wave your pinky in the air.

1006
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,500
And also this African music is driving young...

1007
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,900
It makes me want to wave my pinky in the air.

1008
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,700
And hold the glass by the stem.

1009
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:52,340
It makes me want to eat my peas with mashed potatoes on a knife.

1010
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,240
Eat your peas with mashed potatoes and poe.

1011
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,940
Eat your peas with poe.

1012
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,260
No, it doesn't work when you say swell.

1013
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,820
It's like kind of a new cult I've heard about.

1014
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,460
It gives people perceptual commands like,

1015
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,680
now look, say, now listen, now watch, now look, say, now listen here, say.

1016
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1017
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1018
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,660
Well, that's one thing I did learn.

1019
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,000
Folks a long time ago talked with more cut-off parts.

1020
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,180
Yeah, let's do the mid-Atlantic for you.

1021
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:18,500
What?

1022
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,860
Well, okay, for sure.

1023
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,840
Folks a long time ago talked with more cut-off parts.

1024
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,620
Well, they had the mid-Atlantic accent, remember?

1025
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,320
The average American accent was more Midwestern in the past.

1026
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,260
Now it's more Eastern.

1027
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,440
No, the mid-Atlantic.

1028
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,340
In this time, the modern times, the 1940s.

1029
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,720
Modern, right, modern.

1030
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,700
Modern times.

1031
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:38,820
Oh, no.

1032
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,060
You kind of dropped the R1.

1033
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,500
Once in a while, but sometimes you have it there.

1034
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,460
Oh, no, it's the modern times.

1035
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,700
Say, we ought to go over to City Hall and check up on this.

1036
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,320
What do you say, fellows?

1037
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,600
He's like a man from the past.

1038
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,380
Kill him.

1039
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,180
He's the last of his kind.

1040
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,520
He's almost extinct.

1041
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,420
Destroy it.

1042
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,700
Not in a nickel will get you a cup of coffee.

1043
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,580
I'm sorry.

1044
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,400
I'm sorry.

1045
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,860
But it was those men who made Bob what he is today.

1046
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,120
Well, actually, it's the other way around.

1047
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:09,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

1048
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,020
It's Bob.

1049
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,800
It's Bob who made those men what they were then.

1050
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,120
I'm sorry.

1051
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,620
I can't get those things.

1052
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,720
Count on you to keep the context in context.

1053
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,120
It is a sinister side of Bob, old man.

1054
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:21,940
You know.

1055
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:22,800
Exactly.

1056
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,060
Bob is a sinister visage.

1057
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:25,880
You know what I mean?

1058
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:26,920
Think about it.

1059
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,980
A guy in a suit with his back turned.

1060
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,760
What makes me very jealous, though, of other members of the church

1061
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,340
is the fact that people have been doing time control for longer than you.

1062
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,880
They'll always have that much more time.

1063
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,040
They'll always have more time control than you have.

1064
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,980
That really pisses me off.

1065
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,260
Well, no, that's not necessarily so, Bleepo,

1066
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,780
because some of them aren't very good at time control.

1067
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,140
They may have been doing it for 20 years,

1068
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,820
but they really aren't any better at it than when they started.

1069
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,700
Well, like, you and Philo are, like, so good at it

1070
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,360
that, like, if I try to do it, like, in front of you guys,

1071
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:58,580
I know we can feel bad.

1072
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,380
Well, their members are longer than all of ours.

1073
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,360
You know what I mean?

1074
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,340
Philo and Stang's members are much longer.

1075
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,600
Well, keep in mind, Bleepo, that, I mean, we had to learn it,

1076
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,920
and we had to learn it fast.

1077
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,880
Yeah, but I think...

1078
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,040
We learned it on the job and our threat of death.

1079
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,080
And the problem with today's kids

1080
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,440
is they don't think they have to learn it.

1081
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,560
Well, we could teach them slack at gunpoint.

1082
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,480
I just need guns.

1083
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,580
I don't have any guns.

1084
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,320
You guys have been asking for months.

1085
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,820
Well, I thought it was more you were looking for a point, Dave.

1086
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,980
And your gun's the lonesome cowboy, Dave.

1087
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,220
Every day is X day when you have a gun.

1088
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,340
Happiness.

1089
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:37,040
Every day is a gun when it's X day.

1090
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,420
I really sent some very, very sick people in this well here

1091
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,460
who actually want to use guns, and I was just kidding around, you know?

1092
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,220
That's right.

1093
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,100
I graduated...

1094
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:50,980
Missile launchers.

1095
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,220
Yeah.

1096
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,520
We've graduated from guns, Dave.

1097
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,160
We don't even play around with guns anymore at all.

1098
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,560
It's the U2 stage.

1099
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,600
We are ready to blitz London.

1100
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,500
Or anything.

1101
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,300
Guns have to be line of sight.

1102
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,680
Guns are so archaic.

1103
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,940
We like to lob our weapons over the horizon.

1104
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,380
Yeah.

1105
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,740
Yeah, that's American way, ain't it?

1106
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,680
Good old Joe Wills there.

1107
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,300
Triangulate.

1108
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,240
We like to take entire planets of negative matter and drop them into people's suns

1109
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,620
just to remind them that it's Good Friday.

1110
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,320
Oh, good.

1111
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,840
Good Friday.

1112
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,720
Oh, now it's Good Friday.

1113
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,400
It's almost Good Friday in Texas.

1114
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,700
Hey, check this out.

1115
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,340
Yeah?

1116
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,200
We're checking out this website.

1117
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:33,700
What's the...

1118
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,780
It's already Friday.

1119
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,380
It's a thing about Kosovo.

1120
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,780
And somebody from...

1121
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,300
Somebody from Adana.

1122
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,940
An Adana from Kosovo writes,

1123
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,840
Tell me, what do you think about aliens?

1124
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,420
Write to me soon.

1125
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,540
Very cute.

1126
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,660
Because I hear the whistling of an incoming...

1127
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,140
I think you should give $1 to the aliens and they'll come save you.

1128
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,620
I hear something coming and I don't think it's an alien spaceship.

1129
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,340
Jeez.

1130
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:03,660
What a strange priority list, you know what I mean?

1131
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,600
Well, I don't know.

1132
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,120
I mean, it's like...

1133
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,280
He's writing to us.

1134
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,220
Aliens can save us now.

1135
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,380
Was she writing to the Subgenius show?

1136
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,480
On email?

1137
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,280
No, no.

1138
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,140
Oh, oh, oh.

1139
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:15,860
She was...

1140
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,360
It was like a white flag or something with some crudely scrawled stuff on it.

1141
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,500
Yeah, but we shot it.

1142
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,200
It was on her shroud.

1143
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,860
Can you hold that picture closer to the camera?

1144
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,540
That's pretty wild.

1145
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,440
You know, speaking of them weird sex things on the...

1146
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,560
You know, you were talking about their practices.

1147
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,320
Have you ever heard of the ethnic cleanser or the Turkish rug?

1148
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,360
Or the Good Friday?

1149
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,660
Well, you get the little depilatory...

1150
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,940
The dirty...

1151
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,320
There's no such thing as a Good Friday.

1152
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,360
The chili dog.

1153
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,560
The chili dog.

1154
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,340
The Dirty Sanchez.

1155
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,140
Yeah.

1156
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,180
Is that what you guys are having for Easter and stuff?

1157
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,020
The bad.

1158
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,560
Wow.

1159
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,700
I'm looking forward to the Boston Devival.

1160
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,120
There's the Filthy Friday.

1161
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,800
That's the hot...

1162
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,400
That's the chili dog I was talking about.

1163
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,240
That is the low-down Filthy Friday.

1164
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,440
El Puerco Zita.

1165
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,460
With very tasty sartang.

1166
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,740
You slide the little Friday into a bun and then you smear it with...

1167
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,220
The most...

1168
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,520
The most viscous fluids you can find.

1169
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:18,160
And then you squeeze it and roll it around like a roll of Charmin toilet paper.

1170
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,460
Just to feel of it.

1171
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,700
Then you cram it all the way in.

1172
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1173
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:32,580
Then you open the valve at the back of your O-ring and let her go again.

1174
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,520
And don't forget to always keep a backup copy.

1175
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,180
Oh, and also don't forget...

1176
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,160
Oh, you learned that.

1177
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:38,560
Shh.

1178
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,260
Yeah.

1179
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,440
Finally.

1180
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,360
Only after losing all the other virtual Fridays I had.

1181
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,280
You know, I had to download that damn thing 15 or 16 times.

1182
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,120
Oh, it's huge.

1183
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah, but it's worth it, man.

1184
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,680
Well, is the bioconverter...

1185
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,760
Well, I know my Fridays...

1186
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,740
My Good Friday always comes through corrupted.

1187
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:57,940
Oh, no, no.

1188
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,020
You have to get the Bad Friday.

1189
00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,520
That's why.

1190
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,960
You see, if you get the Good Friday, it'll come out bad.

1191
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,740
But if you get the Bad Friday...

1192
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,180
You need to get Bad Friday version 2.0.

1193
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:08,680
No.

1194
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,360
Well, when you download it, it becomes Good Friday.

1195
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,840
Well, and if she's stuffed...

1196
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,380
But there's nothing on the net that will tell you that.

1197
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,680
Are you guys using a bioconverter that gets your, you know, all out there in one piece?

1198
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,300
Because I've been getting some Fridays that have, you know, none of the better parts on there.

1199
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,560
Well, watch out for those Fridays that have the Melissa virus and actually become Melissa instead.

1200
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,380
Oh, now, I'd heard that Melissa had the Friday virus.

1201
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,760
Well, you know, actually, the Melissa virus, like the original...

1202
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:42,180
The first Macintosh virus in the 80s was created by a subgenius clench.

1203
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,840
No, I'm not kidding.

1204
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:52,760
You know, there was a code within the code that referred to certain Simpsons inside jokes, including the word Kijibo.

1205
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,360
Well, Kijibo, that's the code name of a famous subgenius.

1206
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,120
Well, I don't want to say his name, Chris Lee.

1207
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,260
But he is actually responsible for that.

1208
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,280
Wait a minute.

1209
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,120
I probably shouldn't say...

1210
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,740
I forgot.

1211
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,340
I thought he was coming through on the Kijibo cortex.

1212
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,180
Because that's probably a federal crime.

1213
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,160
Kijibo cortex.

1214
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:22,940
The Kijibo fanzine, subgenius zine, has nothing to do with the Melissa virus, we assure you.

1215
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,520
And if it did, the Melissa virus would not merely infect your computer.

1216
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,440
Does the Melissa...

1217
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,840
And I realize

1218
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,040
I'm going home

1219
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,040
I'm going home

1220
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,360
Everywhere

1221
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,760
It's been the same

1222
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,680
The same

1223
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,860
Like I'm outside in the rain

1224
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,680
The same

1225
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,160
The same

1226
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,160


1227
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:08,540
The same

1228
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:13,480
Free to try and find the game

1229
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,200
The same

1230
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,500
The same

1231
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,980
Cards for sorrow

1232
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:22,220
Cards for pain

1233
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,740
The same

1234
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,140
Cause I've seen

1235
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,700
Oh

1236
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,980
Blue skies

1237
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,300
Through the sea

1238
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,740
Through the sea

1239
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:37,900
Through the sea

1240
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,060
Through the sun

1241
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:40,080
Through the sky

1242
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,080


1243
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,080


1244
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,080


1245
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,540
In my heart

1246
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,520
In my heart

1247
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,520


1248
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:49,660
No, but they made references to Endara on Bewitched, which is actually totally impregnated with, you know, the old show Bewitched.

1249
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,220
Yeah.

1250
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,080
That's completely impregnated with Code Subtects, I think.

1251
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,620
And alcohol.

1252
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,460
Code Subtects and alcohol, yeah.

1253
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,460
They don't even have one...

1254
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,880
There's not one scene from Bewitched that does not involve a martini.

1255
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:11,080
Right, and there are also key scenes, there's several instances where Dick Sargent, particularly the first Dick,

1256
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:11,320
Yeah.

1257
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,400
was talking, where actually, they actually talked.

1258
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:19,800
This is the story I hear, it's like the midget dead kid in the movie there that was supposed to be dead,

1259
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,540
but he just showed up in the frames.

1260
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,180
Yeah.

1261
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,640
Well, this is supposed to be in Bewitched, if you watch Bewitched carefully enough,

1262
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,820
you can actually see Elizabeth Montgomery supposedly performing, well, I can't say,

1263
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,540
unspeakable acts on Dick Sargent while he's talking.

1264
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,120
No.

1265
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,600
That's the photon guns in the pooper.

1266
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,260
That's what caused it.

1267
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,220
That's too good to be true.

1268
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:43,760
And along the edge of the frame, if you have the right kind of TV, you can see that edge of the frame thing.

1269
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,480
Uh-huh.

1270
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,640
And especially during those parts.

1271
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,560
Well, it's like her head bobbing or something.

1272
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,580
Yeah, exactly.

1273
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,400
Yeah, her bob was bobbing.

1274
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,780
You know, I was so in love with that actress when I was 12 years old.

1275
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,640
I loved her so.

1276
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,880
Isn't it weird to find out where she is now?

1277
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,760
I got an email.

1278
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,840
I got an email to send you, Stang.

1279
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,100
Oh, you're going to send you an email you're going to love so much.

1280
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,700
Uh-oh.

1281
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,320
I'm serious.

1282
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,640
Elizabeth Montgomery.

1283
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,940
My favorite email is what they call the she-mail.

1284
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,140
The brown mail.

1285
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,160
Oh, what is it?

1286
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:19,520
What it is.

1287
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,200
Hermaphrodite.

1288
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,760
I didn't know you swang that way.

1289
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,420
Quick, open up this lucky email.

1290
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,720
Well, that's either way.

1291
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,780
It's versatile.

1292
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,900
Friday can tell you all about that.

1293
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,860
Oh, no more miracles and whips for me.

1294
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,100
Please.

1295
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:39,900
And Friday, can you tell us more about that email that we always get with a hot college co-ed?

1296
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,740
Yeah, the cereal that makes you pregnant, too.

1297
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:49,480
Well, you take the cereal, you put it in the co-eds, you stir them up, dry them, chop them up fine, and it's just like the album.

1298
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,220
Just like the album?

1299
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,760
It's like Girl Scout cookies that are made with real Girl Scout.

1300
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,440
Uh-huh.

1301
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:00,540
Gilbert Ice Cream is actually made out of ground office workers.

1302
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,860
Well, old records and Girl Scouts.

1303
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,760
Girl Scouts both scratch, if you know what I mean.

1304
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:10,800
I think what you gotta do is go to the disc format, and that way, you know, you can impregnate yourself without the worry.

1305
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:11,820
But wait, wait.

1306
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,600
With an MP3 file, you can impregnate everyone who listens to the file you create.

1307
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,320
I don't believe either of you, because Girl Scouts are too old to go to college.

1308
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,420
You think so?

1309
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:22,920
I think.

1310
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:23,920
A lot of them are young.

1311
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:32,160
Have you seen those Japanese porno films where all the girls are obviously 12 years old, but they dub in that they're all going to college?

1312
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:32,600
Yeah.

1313
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,200
Just like that.

1314
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,900
They introduce themselves as, hey, man, I've been to school, and you're supposed to know what they're talking about.

1315
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:43,080
So I think they probably got a, you know, degree in there, and they're higher learning, you know what I mean?

1316
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,780
So what you're saying is college is really just an excuse for 12-year-olds.

1317
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,160
They're fornicating, really.

1318
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,080
That's what it is.

1319
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,800
And animals, too, if they can get them in there.

1320
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,220
It's only here and on the Art Doll Show, listeners, that you will hear such...

1321
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,240
Here on Dobbs Business College campus...

1322
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,580
The Art Doll Show.

1323
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,520
The unadorned.

1324
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,460
The unadorned.

1325
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,040
The unvoiced.

1326
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,840
The unadorned naked back.

1327
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,560
Exactly as they are.

1328
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,280
Unadulterated.

1329
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,820
Completely uncensored.

1330
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,600
With no filler, alcohol, gravy, toothpaste, dog nuts.

1331
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,220
Except this shows...

1332
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:24,800
Instead of dreamland, we're more like in nightmare land here.

1333
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,820
Or as the language says, the land of need.

1334
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,160
The unadulterated it.

1335
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,340
The pure, flowing subconscious.

1336
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,180
The unadulterated it.

1337
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:32,440
The pure, flowing subconscious.

1338
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,480
The unadulterated it.

1339
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,640
The pure, flowing subconscious.

1340
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:36,760
Thousands.

1341
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:43,540
Basically condensed down into these four or five people that are babbling to each other on the phone.

1342
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,680
You'll only hear it here, Fred.

1343
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,300
From the world of hope and fear.

1344
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,940
I bid you Bob Dobbs now appear.

1345
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:53,800
Yes.

1346
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,320
Open your fear, Fred.

1347
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,240
Open your fear.

1348
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,560
Open your fear to Bob.

1349
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,240
Let Bob creep right into your fear.

1350
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,480
Let Bob become your fear.

1351
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,540
Let Bob take your fear into himself.

1352
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,640
Let Bob unleash your fear and turn it into hate and anger.

1353
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,500
And let him unleash your power against the pink one.

1354
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,180
Let Bob rise up and make the sky blue.

1355
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,320
How many of you have been good?

1356
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,580
How many of you have been stupid?

1357
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,100
Something's happened to Stang, man.

1358
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,580
I've never heard you do that before.

1359
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,000
Communism is good.

1360
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,840
Christianity is stupid.

1361
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,760
He's turning into a cross between Boomhauer and Jano Hyperclean.

1362
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,620
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

1363
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,680
Not Boomhauer, whatever they got.

1364
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,620
Communism is good.

1365
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,640
Burkholz.

1366
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:47,880
Francis.

1367
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,620
We gotta close the tent flaps.

1368
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:52,400
Oh no!

1369
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,940
The people have to go home.

1370
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,540
People have to go home and we have to smell each other for the rest of the week.

1371
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,960
The dwarves have to clean up.

1372
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:00,880
Behind the elephant.

1373
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,660
I want to smell you all forever.

1374
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,040
Dave has to go back in his jar.

1375
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,800
Dave, get back in your jar.

1376
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,000
Make sure they're holding the top of the jar now, Dave.

1377
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,100
Friday, put your clothes on.

1378
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,120
Do I just screw it on?

1379
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:17,820
They are.

1380
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,860
Lift it up into the light.

1381
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,360
Looks like it's got a little firefly in it.

1382
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,320
Bleepo has to climb back into the little dancing pig.

1383
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,440
Yes.

1384
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,460
Pee-will has to be rewound.

1385
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,080
Bleepo?

1386
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:30,340
Bleepo.

1387
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,200
Bleepo.

1388
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:31,860
Bleepo.

1389
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:31,860


1390
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:31,860


1391
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,580
Oh, I forgot that.

1392
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:32,840
Bleepo.

1393
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:33,600
Bleepo.

1394
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:34,560
Bleepo.

1395
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,120
Bleepo.

1396
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:35,220
Bleepo.

1397
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,500
Dr. Legume has to go back into his grave.

1398
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,920
Is Dr. Legume here tonight?

1399
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:41,780
No.

1400
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:42,820
He can't.

1401
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,280
He's never been here.

1402
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:44,700
No.

1403
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,220
He should be here.

1404
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,260
Why isn't he here?

1405
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,120
Probably because he doesn't want to spend the long distance.

1406
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,320
Because you guys don't know it, but I'm actually in the bathroom on the toilet right now,

1407
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,900
and you think, you know, like we're all in the studio having fun.

1408
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,380
You know, it's such a relative term.

1409
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,620
I want you to know, actually,

1410
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:05,160
Dave, I called tonight from the sewer underneath your bathroom.

1411
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,620
Oh, my God.

1412
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,420
Then you've got the...

1413
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:07,720
Yeah.

1414
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,400
You've got...
