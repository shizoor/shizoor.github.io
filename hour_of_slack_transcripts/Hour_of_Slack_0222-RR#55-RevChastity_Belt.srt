1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,120
It's just that there's a new electricity and excitement in our young composers.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,240
Any sound, any music, and anything goes.

3
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,820
We all follow where the artists lead us.

4
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,040
They are our Galileans, our Louis's, our Edison's.

5
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,100
We are the

6
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,960
light-hungry we are the

7
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,980
준비

8
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,220
Huh?

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Um, um, um...

10
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,060
Um...

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,360
Um...

12
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,240
What about Slack?

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
That's your key phrase.

14
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,360
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,160
And now, the subgenius hour of Slack!

16
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:44,300
The subgenius hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

17
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:58,160
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show, the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

18
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,980
Small animals or other children are not allowed to be heard.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

20
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,580
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases, but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

21
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,100
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

22
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,800
Here is your host...

23
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,580
Ah, yes dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

24
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,000
And tonight we have with us a respected...

25
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,780
...

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,320
An oh-so-respected expert on the secret doctrines of sex hurt.

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:51,660
But more than that, dear friends, a woman, an uber-woman who has been actually as great a thorn in the conspiracy's side here in Dallas as any, any of us tool-using primates.

28
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,980
Uh, she's in many ways the Dr. Ruth, the Mata Hari, the Corazon Akeem.

29
00:03:59,980 --> 00:03:59,980


30
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:06,180
And the Lizzie Borden of the subgenius women's sewing auxiliary.

31
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,160
Reverend Chastity Belt.

32
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Ah, so good to have a female warm voice on the show.

33
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,340
Well, Reverend, it's so glad, I'm so glad to be here.

34
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,960
And you're right, I am sort of like the Lizzie Borden because I'm a real cut-up.

35
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,260
Oh, now friends, me and Reverend Chastity here, we don't have to be here.

36
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,020
We could be out getting some wick-splitting done.

37
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,380
You know, we don't have to be doing this show.

38
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,300
We could blow you listeners off.

39
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,760
Drive over to a cheap motel on Harry Hines and get right down to the business of taking the job, don't you see?

40
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,520
Of illustrating to ourselves just what it means to be a subgenius.

41
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,120
Ah, yes, we could do this because in Bob's church, friends, all men and all women here are married teachers.

42
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,340
They love each other.

43
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,160
Even the men are married to the men and the women to the women, believe it or not.

44
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:10,200
Although I personally don't partake in this particular form of consummation.

45
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,620
Nay, nay.

46
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,680
But you must learn somehow to give yourself to the feeling, dear friends.

47
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:27,580
Because it's our duty to Bob and Connie that we may indulge in the knowledge of the flesh until we achieve memories of our own previous reincarnalities.

48
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,600
Ah, yes.

49
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,560
Give yourself to the feeling.

50
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,580
Give yourself to the feelings, boys and girls.

51
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,420
Things.

52
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,940
Well, Reverend Chastity, what was the last evil thing that you've been known for here in Dallas?

53
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:54,520
I understand it had something to do with a talking toilet, trying to achieve some sort of freedom of toilets in Plano.

54
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,280
Yes, I have to say I'm at a point now where I say,

55
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,160
let my people tinkle.

56
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,280
And I know you can relate because we all eat, we all sleep, we all reproduce,

57
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,220
and some of us all meet the call in the little boy's or little girl's room.

58
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,480
Except in the Plano, uh, oh well.

59
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,080
Transit Center, I tell you, dear.

60
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,240
People meet the call of nature wherever nature calls, you know.

61
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,760
Now, Bob said there's nothing wrong with that.

62
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,700
Well, I have no problem with that.

63
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,840
I'm just kind of distressed at seeing little old ladies tinkling on perfectly good city buses.

64
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,500
Well, out of respect for Bob, um, and Connie,

65
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,940
instead of jumping into the sack of mutual respect and, and, uh, lower things,

66
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,360
we're gonna jump onto a new subject matter, friends, one which we have not oft broached on the Hour of Slack,

67
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,920
and rip away the veils of clothing which obscure this subject,

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,820
the subject of Connie Dobbs, wife of Bob, she whom men have called the Blessed Antifreeze.

69
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,740
The secrets of Connie are like a closed lotus,

70
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,140
but if we stroke this lotus with just the right combination of gentleness and urgency, dear friends,

71
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,220
it will open its blossoms to reveal a treasure.

72
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,380
Ha ha ha ha.

73
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:20,840
So, uh, but, but, is Playgirl enough, Reverend Chastity?

74
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:21,700
No. No.

75
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,120
Is, is there, I mean, what about porno, pornography for women?

76
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,820
I feel that not enough has been done.

77
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,900
I feel that not enough has been done about this, and I am distressed.

78
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:38,580
You see, Reverend Stang, we owe it to the future of America to reproduce as much and as often as possible.

79
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,900
Where will the future war veterans come from?

80
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Where will the war whales come from?

81
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,200
They will come from nowhere if our young women are not enthused and excited in a way to reproduce.

82
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,740
And I know that you can appreciate this.

83
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,260
I am concerned about this Mace Commission report,

84
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,200
because if we take away the Playboys, we take away the Playgirls,

85
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:04,440
we take away the inspiration, they will not be in the drive-ins on Saturday night making them little future Americans.

86
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,820
Little future mutants, dear friends,

87
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,240
because, now, Reverend Chastity, as you yourself have often preached,

88
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,920
we don't want them to mess around with the humans.

89
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,040
It's, uh, you know, they need to stick with their subgenius kind.

90
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,720
And like, as seen here on this slideshow.

91
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,320
Oh my goodness.

92
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,180
Friends, it's a good thing this is a show.

93
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,400
This is the radio or we'd be off the air by now, believe you me.

94
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,540
Oh, can you do that on the radio?

95
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,800
Can you do that without Vaseline?

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,300
Oh, breakdance Bob.

97
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,940
I got a Bob in my pocket, dear friends.

98
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,320
And he's waiting to meet you.

99
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,460
Well, what about, what did they say, what did Connie have to say to the Mace Commission

100
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,520
when they came to her, uh, accusing her of being a major pornography publisher

101
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,500
with this new women's pornography line?

102
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,200
Uh, I mean, I mean,

103
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,180
I understand.

104
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,900
As a matter of fact, let me level with you, Reverend Chastity.

105
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,360
Okay, tell me the truth.

106
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,660
Let me, so to speak, shoot straight.

107
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,020
Rumors have circulated for years that the Church of the Subgenius

108
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,560
was merely the unwitting front group for a secret conspiracy of women.

109
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,480
A globe-encompassing coven, so to speak, which uses males,

110
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,860
uses us, both subgenius and pink alike, as part of a vast breeding experiment

111
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,240
by which you femmes will hope to, uh, eventually produce a messiah,

112
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,640
a godlike being of incredible powers called the Kwisatz Haderach.

113
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,540
Yes, in fact, the famous Dune series of science fiction is but a thinly veiled expose

114
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,200
of a group which actually exists. Is this true?

115
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,800
Uh, I, I, I, I, I don't know if I can discuss this right now because...

116
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,680
That you females have managed to keep this secret from all of us males for 100,000 years until now?

117
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,080
Don't put this pressure on me.

118
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,060
I can't crack, I can't tell you the truth.

119
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,600
All of womankind is counting on me.

120
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,880
Uh-huh, pretending to be oppressed all the time so that you can use that as a guise

121
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,860
to cover your actual iron-fisted strangle-hole over male behavior?

122
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
I prefer the term velvet claw.

123
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:17,060
Yes, yes, the, uh, you cannot deny, though, that ye, ye female ones

124
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,920
possess the one treasure which few men, subgenius or pink, can live without.

125
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,400
That juicy bait dangled before our eyes. Ma'am?

126
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,280
I thought you were going to say that we had mutual obligations that you could not obligate.

127
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,840
Well, friends, that's the, that's the main thing. It's the, it's a mutual obligation.

128
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,940
As you can hear these people at Dobstown here in the background, our home movie of life at Dobstown.

129
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:52,340
And I understand, uh, Reverend Chastity, that, that you were, uh, for a long time, you, you were an honorary nun-snake mother superior.

130
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,600
In Dobstown.

131
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,180
Well, I, I did spend some time out there in my missionary field.

132
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,820
And, uh, I, I, I prefer that hands-on experience of reaching the public.

133
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,220
I'm sure you can appreciate that.

134
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:11,060
Why, just last summer, I was on a tour of the Fiji Islands, healing them young Polynesian boys.

135
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,820
I tell you, some of them laying on ceremonies took hours and hours.

136
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,620
You cannot understand how exhausting that was.

137
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,160
Oh, praise Bob.

138
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,140
But I did that in the name of Bob.

139
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,280
Praise Bob. Praise Bob in the name.

140
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,320
And right in front of him.

141
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,960
And right in front of him, too, I bet.

142
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,840
I bet he was watching the whole time.

143
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,780
Well, he was, he was there with a video camera.

144
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,240
I'm sure that they will be available at the next church convention.

145
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,020
Now, uh, and you have trained, as I understand, that when you were at the convent of the avenging Cyclops,

146
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,960
that you trained many of Dobstown's most skilled nun-snakes in the, in the, uh, arts of love?

147
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,880
Well, you could say I've riffed with the best of them.

148
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,760
Now, now, not to be confused with the hookers for Bob.

149
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,960
Oh, no, no.

150
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,400
Yeah, that was a, that was more of a, a, a grassroots movement that Bob, as an idea, I think Bob actually got from the Children of God,

151
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,440
which is a Christian cult, which uses sex to get people to join the church.

152
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:14,060
Now, is it all right, do you think, to, to use sex to get people, humans or, or subgeniuses, whatever, to give money to Bob?

153
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,740
Well, I hate to tell you this, Reverend, but women have been using sex for years to get just about anything from anything.

154
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:27,460
Well, that's a, well, that's a, yeah, and yet you deny that, that you're part of a, a conspiracy, an all-encompassing...

155
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,940
Oh, oh, I wouldn't say it's a conspiracy. No, no.

156
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,040
I, I, I, I, I can't admit to that. Not when I have so many of my sisters listening in tonight.

157
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,340
And besides, even if you did admit to it, you know, nobody would believe it because the Church of the Subgenius, oh, it's just a joke.

158
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:57,640
Just a joke. And, uh, but I understand now that as part of your training to be a nun snake, that you, uh, you actually had physical contact with Bob Dobbs,

159
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,060
experienced the love of Bob in a physical way.

160
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:00,980
Yes.

161
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,680
Now, is this true?

162
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,720
This is true.

163
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,980
Can, can you describe what Bob was like in bed, in, in polite language for the radio?

164
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Well, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, well, let's just say it was a deep night.

165
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,880
A deep, meaningful relationship that...

166
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,580
Deep, yeah.

167
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:22,280
I, I, I experienced life at, at its fullest. You could say it was, I was bursting forth with joy.

168
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,180
Oh, sweet mystery of life...

169
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,740
Oh, friends, look at those VU meters jump.

170
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,900
Oh, she's getting excited just thinking about the mighty, the mighty love of Bob.

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,220
Just like us male subgeniuses. Well, I can't, we can't, we can't say that we, we covet Bob's wife.

172
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,920
But Connie, well, now, let's get on to other things here.

173
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,300
Now, I...

174
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,060
You posed for this issue of Playboy here, the girls of the subgenius church.

175
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:56,360
Yes, well, as you know, Reverend, I was one of the first at the first official subgenius church get-together.

176
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,740
As you remember, it was with Reverend Buck and, and you and I and a couple other believers.

177
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:11,980
And when I heard Reverend Buck break into a chorus of festering on the carcass of life, I knew I had reached the religion that I was meant to be called to.

178
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,540
Oh, yes, dear friends.

179
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,480
And that's true, Reverend Belt, that's your last name, right?

180
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,140
Yes, it is.

181
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:30,520
Was, was, uh, the, at the absolute, the very first subgenius devival that was ever held anywhere, at least, and open to the public.

182
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:41,360
Bob, you know, formed the church in the 50s and he had secret, uh, secret parties, much like what you hear in the background here, uh, to get the church started.

183
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,900
But yes, those were the days.

184
00:14:43,840 --> 00:15:01,100
Now, um, uh, now I notice in the, in the, in the girls of the subgenius church here with the Playboy interview, or the Playboy pictures, that, that many of these uber women, these subgenius gals, don't conform to the conspiracy's usual definition of, quote, good looks, unquote.

185
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:09,040
They look even more, they look like some of these girls here look like they got more yeti blood than Buck naked himself.

186
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
For instance, Miss Delaware.

187
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,120
Mm-hmm.

188
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:21,440
The, the sloping brow, the bodily hair, the bowed short legs, and long muscular arms that identify one who is a, a, a direct descendant of the yetis.

189
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,900
But she had a good soul and a, and a wonderful personality.

190
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,500
Why, you should have seen that girl cook.

191
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,380
Oh, yes.

192
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,080
And could she keep house, I tell ya.

193
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,260
Yes, dear friends.

194
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,420
Well, you know, that's the thing.

195
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,520
Just don't taint your genes with, with the genes of a human.

196
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,340
Try to, you, you should go for those yetis out there.

197
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,400
They're the ones that carry, that carry the seed word of Bob, dear friends.

198
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,260
And they can certainly keep you warm in the winter.

199
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,620
Oh, gosh, I got some of that word all over the floor of the radio station, dear friends.

200
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,360
We're gonna have to move on to a tape here.

201
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,860
I'm gonna push the tape.

202
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,280
Sex.

203
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,440
Bob loves sex.

204
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,520
What?

205
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,540
Sex.

206
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,540
Praise Bob.

207
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,640
Sex.

208
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,840
Bob loves sex.

209
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:05,720
What?

210
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:06,860
Sex.

211
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,040
Praise Bob.

212
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:08,920
Sex.

213
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,320
Bob loves sex.

214
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,320


215
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,980
Bob loves sex.

216
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,940
It helps us all to have it all.

217
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,580
The, because too much is always better than not enough, as we'll say again at some point in the show.

218
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:30,020
In fact, just to prove that I'm not gonna spend the whole show talking about how life is doubt and that faith without doubt is nothing but death.

219
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:37,320
I, I would, I'm going to play an, a tape of a event, a live revival.

220
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,200
Yes, dear friends, we had a, we had a, a, a, a...

221
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Holy Ghost Bob Stomping Revival down at some club this last Valentine's Day.

222
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:55,380
Yes, on Valentine's Day, there was a secret subgenius revival involving the marriage,

223
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:03,000
the mass marriage of only 110 couples, maybe more, but 110 that we had registered.

224
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,080
Yes, 220 people were wed to each other in some form or another, in some combination or another,

225
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:18,420
last Wednesday night at this downtown go-go slop-hop shop called Club Metronome.

226
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:26,380
And it was actually a lovely, beautiful service, a beautiful service.

227
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,460
And we're going to take you to that service right now on tape, dear friends.

228
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:32,720
Yes.

229
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:32,780
Yes.

230
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


231
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


232
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


233
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


234
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


235
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


236
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


237
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


238
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


239
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


240
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,980


241
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,820
A mass short-duration marriage ceremony performed by your host, Reverend Ivan Stang,

242
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,220
actually written and invented about 10 years ago by Reverend Buck Naked.

243
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:53,960
Yes, the mighty Buck Naked invented and has served under Bob to perform these short-duration marriage ceremonies many, many times,

244
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,480
but never has one been performed over so many couples.

245
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,960
And so I'm going to play this tape.

246
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,980
Good Lord, this is going to be the most gigantic subgenius.

247
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,120
This is the most gigantic subgenius wedding in history.

248
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,220
Horrible but true.

249
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,420
Disgusting but it's really happening before our very eyes.

250
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,960
Okay, 49.

251
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,260
49 poor sinners lining up to marry in the eyes of Bob Dog.

252
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm disgusting.

253
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,160
You're disgusting.

254
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,380
We're all disgusting.

255
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:32,580
Get married for 12 hours, 1 hour, or 3 weeks, a year, whatever you want.

256
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,580
It's just as legal as the last thing you did.

257
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,760
Take it for a double.

258
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:53,020
Yes, you might win a weekend of pure, unadulterated, illegal sexual activity with someone you're not even legally married to, but who cares?

259
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,660
It's a big marriage.

260
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,960
They're coming through like cattle for the slaughterhouse.

261
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,800
Just like cattle lining up for the slaughterhouse.

262
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:02,980
Just like cattle lining up for the slaughterhouse.

263
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,040
They're going to go ahead and get hitched.

264
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,600
They're going to make it real forever.

265
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,180
Get married and win the weekend for two.

266
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,040
Married in the eyes of J.R. Bob Dog himself.

267
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,200
You can get away with murder with this marriage tape.

268
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,220
And you've already got one.

269
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,260
I need a number.

270
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:20,960
92.

271
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,580
92 is your number.

272
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,440
Who are you marrying?

273
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,720
Myself.

274
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,740
So many are marrying themselves because that's the only one they truly love.

275
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,180
Don't blame them a bit.

276
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,980
I'm the same.

277
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,180
I'm the same.

278
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,540
104.

279
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,800
104 couples so far.

280
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm absolutely appalled that so many people are willing to just throw their lives away

281
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,780
and get joined in unholy matrimony.

282
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,420
And it is unholy in the eyes of J.R. Bob Dog's.

283
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,300
Two more records and then the big wedding ceremony.

284
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,900
So dance for a minute.

285
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,480
Don't stand right there to me.

286
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,280
Go have sex.

287
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,900
It's wonderful, it's horrible, I can't believe it.

288
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,980
There's over 104 different people have come up here to get themselves hitched temporarily

289
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,080
in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs here at the Metronome Club, Ike Cot.

290
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,860
It's disgusting to me that they're willing to all get married en masse.

291
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,200
Some men to men, women to women, some just people to Bob.

292
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,720
Some people are just marrying Bob this time.

293
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,600
Three of them want to marry me.

294
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,140
It's disgusting, it's wonderful, I'm smiling.

295
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,480
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Ivan.

296
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,420
Step right up, step right up.

297
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,680
Are you ready?

298
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,540
Are you ready to be excused in the name of the Lord?

299
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,320
Say it.

300
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,800
Are you ready?

301
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,980
All right then, let's get it this way.

302
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,300
This horrible, disgusting affair over with.

303
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,660
To begin with, I'm really sorry to get wet and hitch each one of you individually,

304
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,580
or couples individually, but obviously too much is always better than not enough.

305
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,480
So, do you, insert your name here, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

306
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,100
and nothing but the truth?

307
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,060
Say yes.

308
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,540
Say yes.

309
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,700
These sanctified couplings will last for, let's say,

310
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,640
12 hours.

311
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,840
These are 12-hour, short-duration marriages.

312
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,260
If you are not completely satisfied, you can come back for a short-duration divorce.

313
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,980
Now, we shall begin.

314
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Oh, yes, dearly beloveds, we are gathered here today in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

315
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:02,120
Please, Bob, to join these men and these women, and sometimes men and men, women and women,

316
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,800
and sometimes men.

317
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,980
Bob and Bob, sometimes them and me, in the bondage, the bondage of home and matrimony.

318
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,800
For better or worse, but not for long.

319
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,120
Do you feel the spirit, dear friends?

320
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,620
Take up, then, now, put your hands on each other.

321
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,780
Put your hands on each other.

322
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,480
Now, if there are any here who feel that these men and these women should not be joined,

323
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,120
just hold your peace, because we don't want to even hear about it.

324
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,980
All right.

325
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,460
You got your hands on each other?

326
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,440
Hold tight.

327
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,560
Here it comes.

328
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:57,140
Do you, all, half of you, take these, well, do you men, half these men, take these women

329
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,580
and sometimes men, could be your lawfully wedded wives or husbands?

330
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,140
Thank you.

331
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:08,780
In short duration, subgenius matrimony, to have and to hold, for richer or poorer, in

332
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,480
sickness and in kinkiness, for the next 12 hours.

333
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,000
Say, say, I do.

334
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
I do.

335
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,600
Praise Bob.

336
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,600
Praise Bob.

337
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,300
Now, do you, in most cases, women, take these men, in most cases, sometimes women, sometimes

338
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,520
Bob, sometimes me.

339
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,840
To me, you're lawfully wedded husbands.

340
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,120
I do.

341
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,200
And I would encourage you, on the same day you're wedded with your wife, to, I don't

342
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:42,880
know how many times I say this, but to, I don't know how many times I say this, but to

343
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,300
say I do.

344
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,720
I do.

345
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,260
I do.

346
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,040
All right, now, shake on it.

347
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,560
Shake on it.

348
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,660
And say, it's a deal.

349
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,280
It's a deal.

350
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,320
Now.

351
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,040
It's not over yet.

352
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,300
Get out of your rings.

353
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,100
You do have to be careful.

354
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,100


355
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:08,840
rings don't you? I hope you got that ring. Because we take the ring as a holy symbol

356
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:16,080
of the estate of marriage as well as the pole going repeatedly into the hole.

357
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:27,840
All right? By the authority invested in me by this man J.R. Bob Dobbs and in absolute

358
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,980
defiance of the laws of this state and of nature, I pronounce you man and wife or husband

359
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:45,400
and wife and wife and wife or husband and husband for the next 12 hours. Praise God!

360
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:52,980
You must now kiss each other. You have to kiss each other now. I will avert my eyes.

361
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,820
You are now duly authorized and excused for seven days.

362
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,200
Sexual couplings of any perverse, unspeakable crime for a period of 12 hours.

363
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:14,720
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, it is done. A man and a woman. Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

364
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,700
Thank you and...

365
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,380
Party!

366
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,140
Bob said you had to party!

367
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,420
Party!

368
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,000
Party!

369
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,700
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

370
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,660
Nobody sımeş, say it bully.

371
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:45,680
Free!

372
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,700
Blessed Holy Spirit, praise the Lord!

373
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,720
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!va, grave God!

374
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:55,720


375
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:03,260
sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.

376
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,980
Don't be deceived.

377
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,300
Victorian principles have permeated the collective unconscious of humanity,

378
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,420
and we've only begun the fight against the control by the real sexual deviants,

379
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,080
the repressed ninnies with insane super-egos.

380
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,460
They run around denying that it's a squirting ooze and universe,

381
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,120
and they think they're working for God,

382
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,900
but hell, sex is a religious sacrament.

383
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,100
I can't take a joke, but don't take that literally now.

384
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,060
Sister Chris here.

385
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,060
Television stations are bombarded by filth from the studios of Hollywood.

386
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,800
I don't care. I don't care what lengths I go to anymore.

387
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,060
All is fair and all that.

388
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,540
Dr. Harris, you're a doctor. A doctor.

389
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,300
Doesn't that mean anything to you, a surgeon?

390
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,820
I'm not a doctor, Edith, but I'm a man also.

391
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,820
You're under arrest!

392
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,960
Something sick. Something sordid, vicious, and depraved.

393
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,860
Vagina. Vagina.

394
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,980
V-H-I-N-A.

395
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,560
There's a canal-like passage between the uterus and an opening between the mother's legs.

396
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,240
It is the place where sperm are deposited by the father from the baby

397
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,860
and the passage shows the baby passes into the new world where he was born.

398
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:52,400
It's in a dream.

399
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,100
Sweat keeps running.

400
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,000
It's in a mind.

401
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,000
There's only one thing, one thing, one thing.

402
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,720
It's on my feet.

403
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,820
And I may be the reason he feels his mind is in factory.

404
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,840
Or I may be the one who started his machine.

405
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,960
Watching the kids as he is.

406
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,560
It's a plan.

407
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,080
Our bodies are falling.

408
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,680
And this is where we go.

409
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,660
This is me.

410
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:27,660


411
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:27,900
Ahh...

412
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,740
Woah...

413
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,100
Polski?

414
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,840
A- ad...

415
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,240
Topo.

416
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,240


417
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,420
That's right.

418
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,020
O- married spin

419
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,440
The middle finger!

420
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:47,680
Whoops.

421
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:47,680


422
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,120
I'm taken for a

423
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,780
as I am.

424
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:51,940
Ready?

425
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,160
Get set.

426
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,360
You love watching porn!

427
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,120
Hit the like button!

428
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,120


429
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,120


430
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,920
I knew it.

431
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,720
Hi. Have I got something for you.

432
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,160
This is the one and only Mojo Bag.

433
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,720
And with this, you don't need no long hair.

434
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,100
Or cool cigarettes.

435
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,260
Or cool guy shades.

436
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:26,900
Cause you could have any woman you want with the Mojo Bag.

437
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,300
And you don't need no knife or gun.

438
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:40,340
Cause ain't nobody can hurt you when you got the Mojo Bag.

439
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,640
But you too can have the one and only Mojo Bag.

440
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah, I'd give it to you.

441
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,680
For oh, I guess about eight dollars.

442
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,060
I accept no substitutes.

443
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,320
But one word of caution.

444
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,540
One word of caution.

445
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,040
Don't you never look inside the Mojo Bag.

446
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,280
Cause it got the juju.

447
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,760
And that is hot stuff.

448
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,420
Of course we're gonna have a subgenius float down there.

449
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,220
I know, for instance,

450
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,300
now this is,

451
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,780
the first time this has been announced, I think,

452
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,340
but the Batmobile and Batman and Robin will be down there.

453
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,100
You know, they joined the church several years ago.

454
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,280
And when, actually at a time when they were very dissolute

455
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,000
and disillusioned, friends, with the, you know,

456
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,060
they'd arrest these criminals and hand them over to the cops.

457
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,500
And then some judge would let them out with a year's probation.

458
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,480
It's a conspiracy.

459
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,740
It is, friends.

460
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,980
And we're gonna have that giant,

461
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,880
six foot Dobbs head down there at that parade and rally

462
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,320
to try to, to, to fight for our freedom of communication

463
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,860
and communication and fornicationalism,

464
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
which we so enjoy.

465
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,080
Ah, yes, dear friends.

466
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,600
You know, Bob is the avatar of Slack.

467
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,780
I think, I think we got some new listeners last week

468
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,420
and we actually explained who Bob was.

469
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,240
But no less crucial, dear friends, in preparing Dobbs

470
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,960
for Slack avatar-hood.

471
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,300
Was his first and still primary wife, Connie.

472
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,980
Seen in this, her early film appearance in 1961 film,

473
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,300
Planet of the Blind Women.

474
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,840
She had been his childhood sweetheart in first grade.

475
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,520
But in 1955, more than 20 years later, they remet and remarried.

476
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,580
Her impact on Bob is inestimable.

477
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,860
Recently, indeed, a church of Connie's panties has sprung up

478
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,700
and is gathering momentum despite its rather juvenile basic premise.

479
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,360
Connie even sang with Bob's jazz combo,

480
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Bob Dobbs and the Doobops, and gave him five sons.

481
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,880
Bubba, Bobby Jr., Adam Cadman, Shem, and Sean.

482
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,660
There's also a daughter, but the family Dobbs keeps her name

483
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,100
a secret in order to limit the number of suitors

484
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,820
who would marry into this awesome dynasty.

485
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,060
Now, Connie wields enormous power, dear friends.

486
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,560
There's a whole group, which, of women,

487
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,960
witch women, I prefer to call them, who worship her.

488
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,060
They're called the Doobops.

489
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,140
They're a group of women who worship Connie

490
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,960
called the Sodality of the White Glove.

491
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,260
Now, I've encountered them.

492
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,440
And some of you may have read about the time the church patriarchy

493
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,540
was overthrown by the Women's Sewing Auxiliary years ago in Chicago.

494
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,320
And ever since, you know, it started out to be a men's club.

495
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,700
But now, like, for instance, Bob has at least one secondary wife and family

496
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,460
in every state of the union.

497
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,820
Family spread all over the world.

498
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:54,380
And they all fiercely defend Bob as a companion and a provider.

499
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,820
And they insist that he always seems to have plenty of time to spend with each of them.

500
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,180
Just a moment with Bob is worth it all.

501
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,700
And this young bride of Bob, Chastity Belt,

502
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,400
has sacrificed her own virtues up many times

503
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,520
in order to carry on the mighty business of Connie's church,

504
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,820
as well as Bob's.

505
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,360
But we can't just talk about Connie, friends.

506
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,980
We're here to penetrate the essence of Chastity Belt,

507
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,940
this Southern Belt who embodies, embodies, friends, and boy does she,

508
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
the subgenius feminine virtues of A, enthusiasm, B, practiced skills,

509
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,080
and a clean bill of health, see.

510
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,500
So, Miss Belt, I'm sure our audience would like to really get inside you.

511
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:47,500


512
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,440
And see what makes you tick or ooze.

513
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,460
Well, I like to think of myself as just your typical country girl

514
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,900
out there saving the world from itself.

515
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:04,380
And in the name of Bob, I try to encourage educational aspects

516
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,080
and opportunities for women in the workplace, in the home, in the bedroom,

517
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,240
back in the workplace again.

518
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,240
And we try to spread...

519
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,140
All over the house, friends.

520
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,020
All over the house.

521
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,380
Everywhere but the safe.

522
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:17,500
All over the house, friends.

523
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:17,920
We're here to do the right thing, in a safe way.

524
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,440
And that, you know, that reminds me of a lovely background type here.

525
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:31,580
This was sent in by a young member a couple of years ago from the Dobbs Ashram.

526
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,700
Ooh, listen to that music.

527
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Friends, can you hear Bob coming?

528
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,680
Bob is coming again and again, friends, to save your soul.

529
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:47,120
Hey, give a buck out of the record collection back there.

530
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,740
Get down, Buck. Get up.

531
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,820
Oh, not there, please.

532
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,400
Buck's in heat again, dear friends.

533
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,140
Oh, look at that.

534
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,760
He can't even say hi, girls, anymore.

535
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,420
But what about the mutant men, Chastity?

536
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,960
What about the, uh...

537
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,900
Oh, is it the...

538
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,920
How shall we say?

539
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,560
The statue del carne?

540
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,120
The estatua del carne?

541
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,760
The meat itself?

542
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,700
Or is it the motion?

543
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,160
And would not a well-endowed epileptic

544
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,100
prove to be the best of both worlds?

545
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,180
Well, I tend to think that it's their

546
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,600
total lack of pretense

547
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,880
and their non-knowledge of manners

548
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,540
that make them so educationally entertaining.

549
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,060
I have been educated on many occasions by mutants

550
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,340
while I was spreading the word of the church,

551
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,680
and it was an uplifting and inspiring

552
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,440
and very sweaty experience.

553
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,740
I'm sure you can appreciate it.

554
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,280
Oh, yes.

555
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,680
I've never had to clap them.

556
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,200
Oh, I've never had to clap.

557
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,060
I've never had to clap.

558
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,640
I've never had to clap, dear friends.

559
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,540
No, but the subgenius virus,

560
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,300
we must continue to spread this deliverance

561
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,400
among the lost out there.

562
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,840
Now, how do you...

563
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,600
Besides spreading the seed of Bob, as you do,

564
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,960
what about sex hurt?

565
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
Bob's discipline of sex hurt.

566
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,520
How does this compare with, say,

567
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,940
sex among the Baptists?

568
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,460
Sex is okay to say.

569
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,200
It's okay on the radio, isn't it?

570
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,960
Well, as long as you don't really do it on the radio,

571
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,320
which can be rather painful

572
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,460
if you don't watch where the knobs are.

573
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,900
I would have to say that...

574
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,960
The mighty knobs.

575
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,600
Never mind.

576
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,220
I won't even say it.

577
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,760
I would have to say that Baptist sex and sex hurt

578
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,780
are very similar, of course.

579
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,180
Most marriage sex is sex hurt.

580
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,120
You hurt me, I won't have sex with you.

581
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,860
Wait a minute.

582
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,180
What could be more painful?

583
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
As I understood it, that was not...

584
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,300
Bob didn't...

585
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,440
Bob didn't...

586
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,440


587
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,960
By the discipline of sex hurt,

588
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,720
he didn't mean tying them up, necessarily.

589
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,340
Well, sometimes...

590
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,420
Or chaining them down, necessarily.

591
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,720
No, but...

592
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,600
But more like...

593
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,460
Well, until it hurts, you know?

594
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,120
I believe the term is restrained sex.

595
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,180
Pleasure unrestrained,

596
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,620
until something hurts so much that you can't keep going.

597
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,140
And that's...

598
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,060
Friends, that's when you keep going anyway.

599
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:04,920
Yes.

600
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,320
And you will see Bob.

601
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,260
You will see Bob.

602
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,680
I've seen Bob on several occasions,

603
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,440
even when Bob was...

604
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,900
Bob wasn't there.

605
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,720
Yet calling out his name,

606
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,080
and I bet your husband was wondering,

607
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,240
now, which Bob, huh?

608
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,640
Friends, there's Bobs everywhere,

609
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,100
but there's only one true Bob.

610
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,680
But, you know, just like they say in the old song...

611
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,340
Some boys take a beautiful girl

612
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,520
And hide her away from the rest of the world

613
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,820
I want to be the one to walk in the sun

614
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,780
Oh, no!

615
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,880
And only one of the bonobos

616
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,920
But only one of the bonobos

617
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:45,920


618
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,240
Oh, girls, you wanna have

619
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,380
That's all you really want

620
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,080
Perhaps ONE day, maybe

621
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,840
body protect her

622
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:54,880
x2

623
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,900
And that's how how's that gonna be

624
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,980
Since then

625
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:02,980


626
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:02,980


627
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:09,820
I can't tell we only have one

628
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,540
Right now I'm doing my subgenius new age music.

629
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,980
This is Sister Chris.

630
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,180
Subgenius stage party.

631
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,860
Subgenius new age dance music.

632
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,380
Oh, yes.

633
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:58,460
The lovely Sister Chris with the half hour slack in New Jersey.

634
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,280
On Pinkton Hill Records.

635
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,620
Reading Cat Ladies.

636
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:08,040
In the forest of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the conspiracy bonds

637
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,280
which have confronted them with another.

638
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,240
And to assume among the powers of the squirting universe the separate and unequal station

639
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,580
to which the laws of sanity and hedonism entitle them.

640
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,920
A decadent respect for the outrageousness of mankind's desires

641
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,940
that they should declare the forces which impel them to the separation.

642
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,660
We hold these truths to be self-evident that all subgenii are created horny.

643
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,200
That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable,

644
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,180
unalienable rights.

645
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,300
That among these are slack, sex, and the pursuit of frop.

646
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:48,980
That to enjoy these rights, clenches, unalienable clenches are instituted among subgenii,

647
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,240
deriving their just slack from the effect of the prop.

648
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,080
Frop.

649
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,580
Prop.

650
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,560
That whenever any form of the conspiracy becomes destructive of the slack,

651
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:04,480
it is the right of the subgenii to alter or to demolish it and to institute new slack,

652
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,240
laying its foundations on such frivolities.

653
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:15,180
And organizing parties in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their sanity and hedonism.

654
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:23,020
Prudence indeed will demonstrate their sacraments long established should not be abused for light and transient causes.

655
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:30,640
And accordingly all experiences hath shown that subgenii are more disposed to hide out while life is insufferable

656
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,740
than to sell themselves by ignoring the slack to which they are entitled.

657
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,220
But when a long train of abuse is broken,

658
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,340
abusers and usurpers, pursuing assumably the same object,

659
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,260
effects a plan to squash them under the instrument of despotism.

660
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:52,960
It is their birthright, it is their duty to throw off such goons and to prime new slack for the future serenity.

661
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,580
Such have been the repeated sufferances of these subgenii,

662
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,900
and such is now the nirvana which compels them to abandon their former styles of entertainment.

663
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,320
The history of the present glorps in all places.

664
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,500
The history of repetitive banalities and absurdities,

665
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:17,720
all having in direct consequence the establishment of an attempted stranglehold over these subgenii.

666
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:24,740
To prove this, let facts be submitted to the common world.

667
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:31,640
They have refused consent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for this subgenii's good.

668
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,020
They have forbidden governments to pass laws of enjoyable and personable implications.

669
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,460
Unless hidden within others until notice is obtained.

670
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,740
And when so hidden, they have notably searched to eradicate them.

671
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,620
They have refused to pass the laws for the accommodation of large districts of subgenii,

672
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:56,560
unless they would relinquish the relight of eye and eye, intercourse and intoxication.

673
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,460
I think we're going nowhere.

674
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,040
Man, I think there's no slack right now.

675
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,040
I sound like Jerry.

676
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,120
Jerry?

677
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,860
Can I cut off your fingers?

678
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,740
Then you'll really be Jerry?

679
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,500
Too much bass drum will never get signed by Wind of Hell.

680
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,900
Your tool can be a recording star.

681
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,060
That was Sister Chris, who works in the layout department at Screw Magazine, believe it or not.

682
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,720
It's true.

683
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:36,720


684
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:43,660
I I I love little girls, they make me feel so good.

685
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:48,820
I love little girls, they make me feel so bad.

686
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,980
When they're all around me, make me feel like I'm the only guy in town.

687
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,180
I love little girls, they make me feel so good.

688
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't care if I'm a one way mirror, I don't bite my toe exterior.

689
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,700
They don't care if I'm a one way mirror, they don't bite my toe exterior.

690
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,720
Ask me questions, they don't

691
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,700
Want to scold me, they don't

692
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,360
Look for answers, they just

693
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,300
Want to fool me, isn't this fun?

694
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,140
What is this place all about?

695
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,560
Isn't this a plain-tongue truth?

696
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,660
Isn't this a nightmare too?

697
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,080
Say, girls, take my money

698
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,380
Girls, take my clothes

699
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,780
Say, girls, show up my back

700
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,360
And leave me with a lethal dose

701
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:58,580
Yeah, French girls, they want

702
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:02,120
Courting, Italian girls want

703
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,360
Paws, and big, big, big

704
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,660
And I'm the best one

705
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,300
Everything in the world

706
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,260
Is a possibility

707
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,660
Everything in the world, dear friends

708
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,920
It does take a freak

709
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,200
So, so, well, we just got a call

710
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,840
From a listener saying, yeah, we'll

711
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,540
Join you in that mighty subgenius parade

712
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,600
Actually, it's the K-N-O-N parade

713
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,360
But we gotta get out there, folks

714
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,920
And flaunt our abnormality

715
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,080
To let it all hang out

716
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,340
You know, we gotta get out there

717
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:39,480
You know, we gotta stay zipped up, so to speak, but...

718
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,760
There's letting it all hang out

719
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,660
And then there's public indecency

720
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,140
Oh, and how would you define indecency, dear sister?

721
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,640
Would you care to define some right now?

722
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,520
Oh, yes, dear friends

723
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,080
Well, this is a family show, so...

724
00:44:59,080 --> 00:44:59,720
We better stop

725
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,160
Yeah, or else educate them

726
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,000
Is your family listening?

727
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,340
That's the most important part

728
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,340
Actually, we've got a conversation

729
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,900
We've got copies here tonight

730
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,800
Of both the Kama Sutra

731
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,160
Ah, yes, the Kama Sutra

732
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,320
I remember reading it to the goat woman

733
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,540
After the state fair

734
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,000
It worked wonders

735
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,740
I love the state fair

736
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,080
I saw lots of interesting things with goats out there

737
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,020
They had a company out there, True Story

738
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,480
It was, it was, um...

739
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,540
Don't mention True Stories to me, sister

740
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,200
Magnum Seamen Works

741
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,720
And they had, we'll do anything for a buck on their card

742
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,340
And I believe that's what they did

743
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,720
I believed it when I saw them selling semen under the table

744
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,740
Those sailors out there

745
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,440
Those mighty sailors

746
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,880
Seamen on the bounding main, so to speak

747
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,780
Well, these were all in a little glass tube

748
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,100
And proof, proof, dear friends

749
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,600
Proof is all around us

750
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,240
But, you know, Bob called sex the divine battle

751
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,920
But is there an unbridgeable, undestroyable barrier

752
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,320
Between men and women that will keep them forever warring?

753
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,260
Against each other?

754
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:05,700
A.

755
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,640
I mean, uh...

756
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,420
You know, we believe that the

757
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,400
Although the war between the states lasted only a few years

758
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,280
The war between men and women is an ongoing process

759
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,700
That shall never end

760
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,740
But, friends, you better, you better praise Bob for that

761
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,160
So don't succumb to humanists' thinking

762
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,460
Get out there and fight to the death

763
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:33,700
The, the heavy combat of love, dear friends

764
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,880
Huh!

765
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,420
Well, love doesn't always enter into it, remember that

766
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,060
It takes a freak

767
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,080
They said last time

768
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,220
That's what the sign around their neck said

769
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,220
Wild girls, they're pretty funny

770
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,800
Sometimes they drive me mad

771
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,780
Bad girls, just want to go

772
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,740
Bob?

773
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,520
Don't I, just don't have that much time

774
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,240
Oh, yeah!

775
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,660
Help me, somebody

776
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,160
Why these girls are so gentle?

777
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:03,760
Why?

778
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,140
They're really such a team

779
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:13,260
They never know how to keep them inside their silky sleeves

780
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,020
But, Reverend Belt, Reverend Belt

781
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,060
Yes, I'm sorry, I was sitting here busy reading this

782
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,560
I want to know why your copy of the Kamara Sutra don't have no pictures

783
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,120
Oh, well

784
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,480
Is this a Meese Commission expurgated report?

785
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,360
I took the pictures out to let them dry on the heater

786
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,160
Uh-huh

787
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,980
Oh, yeah!

788
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,220
I should have worn a rubber glove

789
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,580
Not only do we have in our possession the Kamara Sutra

790
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,560
But also the Perfumed Garden

791
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,720
Which is an ancient Arabic book

792
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,700
Translated, the Treatise on Love

793
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,660
Translated by Sir Richard Burton

794
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,320
Is that when he was married to Elizabeth Taylor?

795
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,640
No, this was a different Richard Burton

796
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,760
This was one who lived

797
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,200
Although there has always been a Richard Burton

798
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:00,880
I'm sure

799
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,780
And someday his head shall be launched

800
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,300
And grow old again

801
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:04,300


802
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:04,820
And sweet dreams and great rituals

803
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,240
But that's years in the future

804
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,840
But these books

805
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,840
These old sex manuals

806
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,520
Will tell you a lot more than your modern-day Bibles

807
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,400
Such as how to pick up girls and so forth

808
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,100
This one here talks about men who are to be held in contempt

809
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,200
Gals, and I'm sure many of you can identify with this

810
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,800
It says here

811
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,280
Know, O my sister, to whom God be merciful, that a man who is mimicking God's Word

812
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:34,280


813
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:34,280


814
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:34,280


815
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,400
misshapen of coarse appearance,

816
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,800
and whose member, well, that's not going to,

817
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,800
is contemptible in the eyes of women.

818
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,280
And when such a man hath a bout with a woman,

819
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,720
he does not do his business with vigor

820
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,600
and in a manner to give her enjoyment.

821
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,880
He lays himself down upon her without previous toying.

822
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,400
He does not kiss her nor twine himself around her.

823
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,800
He does not bite her nor suck her lips nor tickle her.

824
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,520
That beast.

825
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,860
And these are the pinks, my friends.

826
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,460
This is the pink style of physical love.

827
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,240
And I don't mean pink like, you know, in Penthouse.

828
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,100
No.

829
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:12,820
Hustler.

830
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,680
I'm talking about pink, not like a baby's shiny behind, dear friends,

831
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,180
but an evil, ooh, an evil kind of pinkness.

832
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,700
The pinkness of a McDonald's advertisement.

833
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,000
The pinkness of that person driving the Porsche that you know doesn't deserve it.

834
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,900
A man.

835
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,740
I do.

836
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,480
And a woman.

837
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,640
And a child.

838
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,320
Oh, bless the little children.

839
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,920
They do, don't they?

840
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,680
That's another good thing about families.

841
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,660
Yeah, well, but you know, when you have kids, then they get your slack.

842
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,120
Boy, they sure do.

843
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,940
And especially when they wander into the bedroom at those inopportune times.

844
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,640
Or when they find your electrical devices.

845
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,980
Or when they find your Japanese manuals upon you.

846
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,720
Well, I bet you and I have many funny little anecdotes.

847
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,660
We could tell.

848
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,560
I could tell you embarrassing stories.

849
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:07,160
A woman who's lived better electrically, I'd rather not share my

850
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:13,140
Yes, the solo fight of love.

851
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,600
But, as she said the other night...

852
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,180
Hello darling.

853
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,320
Hello darling.

854
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,460
Hello darling.

855
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,740
Hello darling.

856
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,940
Hello darling.

857
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,060
Hello darling.

858
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,000
Well, friends, I don't understand the lyrics to that one.

859
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:44,080
You know, modern-day music, you just can't hardly keep up with what they're trying to tell you.

860
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,200
That one's from a subgenius in England, Pete Scott.

861
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,100
Pete Scott, great Pete Scott.

862
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:56,900
But, at the same time, the fabulous Billy Goons had this to say about the same subject.

863
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:01,760
Bang, bang, it said on the sixth floor of the school book repository.

864
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,340
Well, Bernie Smith said he knows a spot.

865
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,960
He says he's been there a while.

866
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,700
He said he paid a visit.

867
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,620
We know he flogged his bishop.

868
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,200
I'm searching for that chief out of love.

869
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,000
I'm searching for chief out of love.

870
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,420
I'm searching for chief out of love.

871
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,800
I'm searching here and there to decide your underwear.

872
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,740
I'm searching for chief out of love.

873
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,420
I took that bishop to the middle kingdom.

874
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,200
It was like some wild animal show.

875
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,660
There were geeks and goons in here, but the chief's spot was nowhere.

876
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,460
I'm searching for chief out of love.

877
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,420
Tiring.

878
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,180
synth rock music

879
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,120
synth rock music

880
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,040
Rhyming vilain~~~

881
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,680
What was that you were just told?

882
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,820
Let me, let me pull the.

883
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,700
This was the fabulous Billy Goon's friends searching for the G spot of your love.

884
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,860
That's Reverend Cleve Duncan.

885
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,460
I guess he's not,

886
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,960
he sings in the background.

887
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,080


888
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:50,560
on that.

889
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,760
Oh, friends.

890
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,520
This is a

891
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,260
juvenile hour of slack,

892
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,440
isn't it? It ain't that great.

893
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,860
Peter Pan shall never

894
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,660
grow up, never

895
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,800
grow old. Now, what

896
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,700
were you just talking about there, Reverend

897
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,320
Chester?

898
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,920
I was confused. I was

899
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,300
so overwhelmed by that song.

900
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,760
You know, you know, sex

901
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,720
and karma in music these days

902
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,860
is so intense. You know, we use

903
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,840
we use sex

904
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,900
as opposed to procreation to sell just

905
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,740
everything, while we use it to sell

906
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,880
toilet paper. Have you seen that commercial with the

907
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,860
woman in the diaphanous white gown

908
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,860
and the naked little baby against her body

909
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,940
singing about toilet paper against

910
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,820
the dark moon? I kind of

911
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,460
couldn't understand about the

912
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,360
naked baby and the toilet paper

913
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,360
until I thought, you hold that baby long enough,

914
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,000
you'll be using that toilet paper.

915
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,520
We use sex to sell

916
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,480
everything. And it's so

917
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,300
prevalent in music. Remember when it was

918
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,580
whole lot of loving, whole lot of kissing?

919
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,600
You don't know what you've been missing?

920
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,620
Well, thanks to Prince and Madonna,

921
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,780
now you do.

922
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,320
Oh, yes.

923
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,200
Yeah, I love Madonna.

924
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,680
She's done so much to enhance the image

925
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,400
of young women in America today.

926
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,440
Why? Where else in the world?

927
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,360
But in America, could you see a young

928
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,440
overly underweared young lady

929
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,120
dressed in excessively

930
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,000
religious jewelry singing about

931
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,140
being like a virgin? And now,

932
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,080
praise her, she has

933
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,360
at least gotten a little bit more respectable

934
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,220
instead of like a virgin touched

935
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,440
for the very first time, which was kind of

936
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,400
boring to me. I don't know why she'd be singing about

937
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,540
that. I'm kind

938
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,320
of distressed. You know, she was kind of

939
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,440
indiscriminate, but now she may be

940
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,620
out having procreatory experiences,

941
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,240
but dang it, she's been,

942
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,080
being responsible. She's keeping her

943
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,420
baby.

944
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,120
Oh, friends, yeah, and if you can't

945
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,220
keep your baby, give it to the church.

946
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,080
Yes, it's tax deductible.

947
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,140
We've got a home for slackless children here.

948
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,140
And friends, you know, you can't

949
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,080
use, fetus brain tissue is a

950
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,120
valuable resource in this country.

951
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,080
We've had to go for

952
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,240
the operations for the new overmen

953
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,900
and uberwomen. We've had to go to

954
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,160
Malaysia, to China, because fetuses

955
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,280
are so much more available in those places.

956
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,020
Here, oh, they have sanctions.

957
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,140
Against that sort of thing. But you know,

958
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,180
it's the only, fetus brain tissue is the only

959
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,160
kind that will transplant. And

960
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,320
you know, because it doesn't reject.

961
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,740
It's open to anything.

962
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,040
And that's what you need to be. You need to blank

963
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,940
your mind, dear friends. Blank it to

964
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,080
everything, except Bob

965
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,060
or Connie, depending on your

966
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,980
camp and what you were endowed with by

967
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,320
Wotan.

968
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:41,540
Whew.

969
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,440
I don't care

970
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,920
what people

971
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,460
think.

972
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:49,980
I don't care

973
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,520
how we look

974
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,000
or that's my street.

975
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,120
But this

976
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,680
is not the whole

977
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,900
story. Draperies,

978
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,580
as I had now discovered,

979
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,680
are much more than devices

980
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,700
for the introduction of

981
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,720
non-representational forms

982
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,600
into naturalistic paintings

983
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,020
and sculptures.

984
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,520
With the rest of the normal sea,

985
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,060
only,

986
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,560
under the influence of drugs,

987
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,920
the subgenius is congenitally

988
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,960
equipped to see all the

989
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,720
time. His perception

990
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,700
is not limited to what is

991
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,640
biologically or socially

992
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,720
useful. A limit of the

993
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,920
knowledge belonging to mind

994
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,620
at large oozes past

995
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,500
the reducing valve of brain

996
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,640
and ego into his

997
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,740
consciousness. It is

998
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,740
a knowledge of the intrinsic significance

999
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,640
of every existent.

1000
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,600
For the subgenius,

1001
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,240
as for the drug taker,

1002
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,760
draperies are living hieroglyphs

1003
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,100
that stand in some

1004
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,900
particularly expressive

1005
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,280
way for the unfathomable

1006
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,260
mystery of pure being.

1007
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,340
More even than

1008
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,320
the chair, though less

1009
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,060
perhaps than those holy

1010
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,680
supernatural flowers,

1011
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,440
the folds of my grey flower

1012
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,400
trousers were charged with

1013
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,220
isness. To what they

1014
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,820
owe this privileged status,

1015
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,160
I cannot say.

1016
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,580
Is it perhaps the power of the divine?

1017
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,480
Perhaps because the forms of folded

1018
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,340
drapery are so strange

1019
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,600
and dramatic that they catch the eye

1020
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,380
and in this way force

1021
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,300
the miraculous fact of sheer

1022
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,360
existence upon the attention?

1023
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,920
Huuuugh!

1024
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:46,280
Oh, yes, France. You know, we just got another

1025
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,680
one of those calls where they go,

1026
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,140
You're doing this.

1027
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,840
...and your stomach grows tighter as each day

1028
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,920
passes by. No matter how hard you try.

1029
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,220
It does, it does. It gets tougher and tougher,

1030
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,100
friends. And, uh,

1031
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,160
but, you know, I mean, why?

1032
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,240
Why would we, why would we?

1033
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,340
He said it was just as bad as those other

1034
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,820
bad religious shows.

1035
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,500
Friends, we've been trying

1036
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,520
so hard to be worse. We really have.

1037
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,280
I mean, it breaks

1038
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,320
my heart that we're

1039
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,280
doing this on the radio and no

1040
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,180
one has killed us yet. Do you realize

1041
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,760
what this says about America?

1042
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,360
We're number three. We're number three.

1043
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,580
Oh, so we're gonna just change

1044
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,520
tactics and just play some educational

1045
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,060
material here for you.

1046
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,820
Don't worry about it.

1047
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,960
Don't worry about it. Can you just say who's...

1048
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,980
It's not safe. No, it's not safe.

1049
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,500
In Series 7, you learned about

1050
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,460
many of the interesting creatures who

1051
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,480
live on Mars, including

1052
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,000
the tiny, microscopic

1053
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,240
Gonococcus erythrosia,

1054
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,700
or Martian peen worm.

1055
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,000
Today,

1056
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,240
with the help of a neutron micro

1057
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,360
holographic scanner, we'll look

1058
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,020
into a dead Martian intestine,

1059
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,100
the peen worm's natural

1060
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,400
habitat, and see the whole

1061
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,100
life cycle of this simple

1062
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,500
aeroniobe unfold

1063
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,520
as if by magic.

1064
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,440
As the miracle of reproduction

1065
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,400
begins, our lone

1066
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,420
hero is still a mere tube of

1067
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,260
psychoplasm.

1068
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,400
But soon, a frenzy of chemical

1069
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,640
activity called the amphetophase

1070
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,520
seizes the microbe, and by

1071
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,140
the mysterious process called

1072
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,420
osmiotic blooming, it

1073
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,460
starts to clot.

1074
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,180
It grows a rudimentary

1075
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,400
megastamen and anthorite,

1076
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,320
and swiftly matures into

1077
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,080
the spore of sex A,

1078
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,760
the gameteoroid.

1079
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,340
Unscientifically,

1080
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,620
it might be called the male.

1081
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,040
He discovers his own

1082
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,880
nasophallosian tube,

1083
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,200
and performs hermaphroditic

1084
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,200
autofusion until he

1085
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,380
spills a secretion of preposterol.

1086
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,100
This triggers the morphase

1087
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,880
to begin, and up sprouts

1088
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,700
sex B, the so-called

1089
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,080
female, or

1090
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,580
female, or female.

1091
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:18,980
This is a simple, simple

1092
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:18,980


1093
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,240
Her thorax produces the

1094
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,360
Jovian knobs, and she even

1095
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,380
has a feeble nucleic eyeball,

1096
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,380
merely as powerful as that

1097
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,040
of the male.

1098
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,920
A surprisingly complex

1099
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:46,540
courting ritual is initiated.

1100
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,320
She produces

1101
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,780
special chemicals called

1102
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,120
mojo bodies, which excite

1103
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,660
her partner.

1104
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,840
She places her stigmat on

1105
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,380
his cloacal apparatus,

1106
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,800
and performs parthenodulation.

1107
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,500
He achieves cytospasm

1108
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,880
and germiates.

1109
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,100
And,

1110
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,220
in nature's timeless tragedy,

1111
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:10,120
the helpless male falls

1112
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,080
victim to the eternal wiles

1113
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,000
of the female, leaving

1114
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,200
naught but a pool of albuminal

1115
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:16,720
sperm.

1116
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,580
Using her oviduct as an

1117
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,400
oral groove, she saps every

1118
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,480
last trace of her former lover,

1119
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,380
as the layman would call him.

1120
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,000
Spermatogenocide is committed,

1121
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,640
and it's almost as if she's

1122
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,100
smiling.

1123
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,660
Now, for the live,

1124
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,380
look for anthroxaginous.

1125
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,740
It's like a holy, holy, holy,

1126
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,700
holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,

1127
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,140
holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,

1128
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,300
holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,

1129
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:48,300


1130
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:48,300


1131
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,500
holy, holy, holy, holy.

1132
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:50,500


1133
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,280
holy, holy.

1134
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:53,900
Like the stay,

1135
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:53,920
is the

1136
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:53,920


1137
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:59,060
that we

1138
01:01:59,060 --> 01:01:59,440
are

1139
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,160
fade

1140
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,040
away

1141
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:09,540
from

1142
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,500
which

1143
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,280
slowly

1144
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:14,780
is

1145
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,000
white

1146
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:15,340
,

1147
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:15,540
light

1148
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:15,540


1149
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:15,540


1150
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:15,540


1151
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:15,540


1152
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,280
her

1153
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:16,380
hand

1154
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:16,380


1155
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:16,380


1156
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:16,380


1157
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:16,380


1158
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:16,460
which

1159
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,220
lamely

1160
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:18,220


1161
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:18,280
beloved

1162
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:18,280

attention which was just the idea and friends they're all going to be down at that parade so

1167
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,220
with children who this has been their affair since they were little children

1168
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,140
oh feel my love baby

1169
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:05,280
ears open for uh ron lindsey who's going to be coming in next to do the soul oldest show

1170
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:12,240
friends another form of slack slack you can drink out of your radio dear friends oh yeah

1171
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,960
this is the swinging love course

1172
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,120
you

1173
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,520

oh yes dear friends bob has a mighty big love for you and so does connie

1177
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:05,280
and there's room for all of us subgeniuses to crawl inside the mothership the escape vessels

1178
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:12,460
of the pleasure goddesses friends and and may and when that great rupture comes those who hate this

1179
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,200
show will be left down for a while and i'm going to be there for you and i'm going to be there for you

1180
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,000
cherish

1181
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,800
p Jewish

1182
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,320
but

1183
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:25,580
someone

1184
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:25,580


1185
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,640
a

1186
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,240
year

1187
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,940
you

1188
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,800
have

1189
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,240
our

1190
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:44,360
are some few out there who intuitively know that, you know, you're not joiners. You don't want to

1191
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:55,360
join some cult, but you do want to save your wallet in the end times when the strange

1192
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:02,600
occurrences that come about during the tribulation period. And friends, there's going to be diseases.

1193
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:08,000
You think there's bad diseases around now. You ain't seen nothing yet. So you're going to want to write for

1194
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:15,180
information from Bob Dobbs, because only, you know, Bob is not the answer, but neither is anything else.

1195
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,840
And it takes a lot to realize that, to get to the point where you can pull the wool over your own

1196
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:27,840
eyes. Ah, yes. And so we're coming to the end of another hour of slack. So sad that they only allow

1197
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,600
you one hour, but you need to write to Bob. Get that pencil ready.

1198
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:32,200
At the

1199
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:32,580
Mice and the

1200
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:32,580


1201
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:38,740
Mighty, the Mighty P.O. Box. And you don't even have to send money or anything.

1202
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,380
But it would be appreciated.

1203
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:54,440
Hold that envelope on your lap and think for a while about Connie or Bob or both and drop it in the mail to P.O. Box 140306.

1204
01:05:54,620 --> 01:06:01,140
That's Box 140306 in Dallas.

1205
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,500
Dallas, Texas.

1206
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,800
7-5-2-1-4.

1207
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,120
Ah, yes.

1208
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:13,420
And what you can get for that free information request

1209
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,040
is a lot different from what you can get for that dollar.

1210
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,900
From Post Office Box 140306.

1211
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,880
Dallas, Texas. 7-5-2-1-4.

1212
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:30,900
And this marks the end of your subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1213
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:38,440
Rerun of an ancient hour of slack tape number 55 from 1985 or so.

1214
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,440
And we love you, dear friends.
