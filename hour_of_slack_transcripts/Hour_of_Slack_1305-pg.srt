1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
Friends, this is one of the greatest hours of slack you will ever hear, because I did not edit it.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,420
I had a hard week around tax time, and I was whining on the Scrub Genius forum about that,

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,280
and having to whip out another show, number 1,305 this time.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:38,960
And who should pop up with a complete one-hour best-of subgenius classics media barrage of his own design to help me out but Reverend Frodus Sudds Peshaw of Monkey Hive fame,

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,220
who will be at X Day 14, by the way.

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,700
Reverend Sudds made this collage years ago from the CDs and DVDs in our catalog.

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,140
Never expecting anyone to hear it.

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,440
But this week, it's time came.

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:04,760
It's a wonderful pastiche of favorite subgenius classics from the past, but it's his favorites and his mix of them.

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:16,840
To me, it's an almost tear-jerkingly good collection and a reminder of why we did all this for all these 30 years.

11
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,380
And he even cut out the cuss words for the radio version.

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,180
Friends.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,960
That is what I call a gift of slack for me personally.

14
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,480
There are hundreds of tracks involved, and at the end, I will attempt to give credits as fast as I can,

15
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,260
which will be quite a trick because of the sheer number of subgenius artists you're about to hear.

16
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:47,260
And so thanks to Reverend Sudds Peshaw and the 500 or so subgeniuses whose work he collaged together.

17
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,500
And so on.

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,160
And so on with the shows.

19
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,400
What the hell do you think you're doing?

20
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,680
Dragging your butt through the day, selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?

21
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,120
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them?

22
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,900
Tired of getting all of the guilt but none of the sex?

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,960
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,680
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

25
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,560
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs.

26
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,260
The Living God.

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,220
The Slack Master.

28
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,280
And his Church of the Subgenius.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,880
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,020
For Bob comes to justify our sins.

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,380
To unmask the conspiracy and to get us back.

32
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,360
The slack they stole away.

33
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,180
It's us versus them.

34
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,300
Are you gonna fry in hell on earth alongside the pink boys?

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,180
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes and accept Bob into your mind?

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,980
Repent.

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,000
Quit your job.

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,160
Slack off.

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,900
And praise Bob.

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,160
Church of the Subgenius.

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,500
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,320
Finally tonight, have you ever wondered about your neighbors?

43
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,260
Maybe wondered about the weird thumps and bumps or chants emanating from their apartment?

44
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,680
Well, they may be followers of Bob.

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,940
You know those late night commercials that promise everything from electric massage recliners and instant weight loss to do-it-yourself bathroom renovations?

46
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,900
Well, here's a deal you might not want to miss.

47
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,280
Salvation or triple your money back.

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,920
Bob Dobbs came to town to sit you.

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,340
Free.

50
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,380
You got no business being sick.

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,280
You got no business being embodied.

52
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,380
You got no business living out of sin.

53
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
You got no business living without slack.

54
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,260
Because Bob came to town to set you free.

55
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,100
Bob Dobbs.

56
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,880
Oh Bob.

57
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,740
Turn on.

58
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,380
Tune in.

59
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,900
At the start of the show.

60
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


62
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


64
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


65
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


68
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


69
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


70
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


71
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


72
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:49,900


73
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,260
Home detyghe.

74
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,260


75
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,760
Dead.

76
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,800
The roll-up, dear friends.

77
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,180
That fateful day, July 5th, 1998.

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,140
Next days a-coming.

79
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,340
And the pigs are bumming.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,740
Next days a-coming.

81
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:13,740


82
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:13,740


83
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:13,740


84
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:13,740


85
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:13,740


86
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,300
I wouldn't.

87
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,660
I wouldn't.

88
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,040
Who would want War.

89
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,040


90
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,040


91
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,040


92
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,040


93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,040


94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,040


95
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,040


96
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,040


97
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,040


98
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,120
By default, my sillyudes are gesture.

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,120


100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,880
Littleoncé talks about the world I care about.

101
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:19,880


102
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,280
They're coming!

103
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,840
And the pigs are bumming!

104
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,280
Sure, when the rupture hits,

105
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,240
we'll all be in our first-class window seats on the pleasure saucers

106
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,180
watching the little pink boys fry.

107
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,880
Turn on.

108
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Tune in.

109
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,900
And...

110
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,440
You certainly don't want to trick these people.

111
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,540
X days are coming!

112
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,240
And the pigs are bumming!

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,940
Sure, J.R. Bob Dobbs is my savior.

114
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,780
And of course I want more slack.

115
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,520
And I'm smoking prop nonstop.

116
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,100
But what I really want...

117
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,160
Oh, yeah, that's it.

118
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,080
Those lovely alien nympho mutants.

119
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,300
Oh!

120
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,620
Oh!

121
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,000
Non-stop orgies on the pleasure saucers.

122
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,380
Oh!

123
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,160
Oh!

124
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,560
Oh!

125
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,780
Oh, yeah.

126
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,460
Oh!

127
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,240
Oh!

128
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,520
Oh, I love to be naked.

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:36,960
Oh!

130
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,100
Oh!

131
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,260
Oh!

132
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,100
Oh!

133
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,580
More.

134
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:40,960
More.

135
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,120
Oh, fuck!

136
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,640
Oh!

137
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,080
Oh!

138
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,760
Oh!

139
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,200
Turn on.

140
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,860
Tune in.

141
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:49,860


142
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,720
Turn off.

143
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,580
And break a nail.

144
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,920
mort những increcial

145
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,400
Oh!

146
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,680
X days are coming.

147
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,680
Sub été.

148
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,040
And the pigs are bumming.

149
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,900
I said, X days are coming.

150
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,560
And them little pigs are bumming!

151
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,780
Oh, rad Dylan.

152
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,720
Sub spins!

153
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,320
Those conspiracy Duke Pinkboy normals are gonna fry!

154
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,240
They won't even know what hit them.

155
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,160
That old stark fist is gonna come down hard.

156
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,180
But nothing's guaranteed, dear friends.

157
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,580
I'm a card-carrying member of the Church of the Subgenius.

158
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,640
I'm the almighty king of slap!

159
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,680
But when X-Day comes around,

160
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,480
the only thing I have is my unshakable faith in Bob!

161
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,940
X-Days are coming!

162
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,260
And the pigs are bumming!

163
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,460
Don't you wanna be saved?

164
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,240
X-Days are coming!

165
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,260
And the pigs are bumming!

166
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,980
Listen to me, mister, it's salvation I'm talking about!

167
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,960
Bob...

168
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:50,960


169
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
Bob...

170
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:52,620


171
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:52,620


172
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,460
Bob...

173
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,000
Alive!

174
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,640
Bob...

175
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:10,960
Bob...

176
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,500
Bob...

177
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,940
Bob?

178
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,140
Alarm Santa Fe parents met again with elementary school officials last night

179
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,620
to discuss the growing presence of Bob in the schools.

180
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,120
Bob, the deity of the Dallas-based Church of the Subgenius,

181
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,760
is a comic book character who communicates with aliens and worships money.

182
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,360
Parents and teachers complain that the Bob stickers and pamphlets,

183
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,460
which have turned up in school laboratories with increasing frequency,

184
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,960
encourage troublemakers and weird behavior.

185
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,580
Bob!

186
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,000
Bobby!

187
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,520
Bobby!

188
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:37,760
Bob!

189
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,760
Bob!

190
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,480
Bob!

191
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,420
Bob!

192
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:40,720
Bob!

193
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:40,840
Bob!

194
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,120
Bob!

195
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,620
Bob!

196
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,840
Ian il Gare disappointment

197
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,300
while theiar

198
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,040
Ian il Gare

199
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,960
Ian il Gare

200
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,460
Ian!

201
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,260
Paul!

202
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,440
Ian il Gare

203
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,700
Ian il Gare

204
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,440
Ian il Gare

205
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,020
Oma-

206
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,700
This is the first industrial church.

207
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,700
We're not a tax write-off scam.

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,880
We are an incorporated profit-making foundation.

209
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,160
We'll- We're profits

210
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,740
and we

211
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,480
We want profits.

212
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,300
Let me tell you the story of J.R. Bob Knauss.

213
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,500
Bread of man and yet he, he walked with the gods.

214
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,580
He wore a silly grin and he smoked a stupid pipe.

215
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,060
He fought the conspiracy every day of his life.

216
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,700
He worked the stench of many a man.

217
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,960
Fathered many children with his mighty glance.

218
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,940
He founded the religion in which we all believe.

219
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,320
Brought us all the slack that everybody needs.

220
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,440
Bob was the greatest salesman.

221
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,480
The world had ever seen.

222
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,740
He could sell the farts after he ate all the beans.

223
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,960
He could sell a pile of to a lonely fly.

224
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,400
All of us who knew him figured he would never die.

225
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,520
Bob Knauss, Bob Knauss.

226
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,040
He was a real man.

227
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,400
A real man and brave.

228
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,940
Bob Knauss, Bob Knauss.

229
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,020
Is lying dead in his grave.

230
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,840
Without Bob what are we gonna do?

231
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,020
With a man from Planet X go marching through.

232
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,640
An armed little racist stuck in jail.

233
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,240
With only Bob who raised the veil.

234
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,500
But now he's dead.

235
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,020
So.

236
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,820
So we're doomed.

237
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,000
What to do?

238
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,180
What to do?

239
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,860
We're doomed.

240
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,120
He founded the city known as Doptown.

241
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,040
Deep within Malaysia it was rarely found.

242
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,920
There he studied forbidden science until that fateful day.

243
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,120
When he came unto his flock in the city by the bay.

244
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,740
Few had ever seen him.

245
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,780
Few had ever dared.

246
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,380
Most had no occasion.

247
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,040
Others just plain scared.

248
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,180
The rurits came to Frisco for the event of the age.

249
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,300
When the holiest smiling one would step out on the stage.

250
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,080
It seemed.

251
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,700
He looked to the left and he looked to the right.

252
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,220
And they stepped out with confidence into his eyes.

253
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,100
But the rurits had no way of getting out.

254
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,680
With all the cheering fans as he strode up to the light.

255
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,240
It seemed.

256
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,300
When a great assassin's bullets shot him to his throat.

257
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,840
Oh my god.

258
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,740
Bob dogs.

259
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,380
Bob dogs.

260
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,420
The crowd saw their savior had come.

261
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,020
Bob dogs.

262
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,640
Bob dogs.

263
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,500
Was greeted by the fire of a gun.

264
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,380
Without Bob we have no gain of fear.

265
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,520
As we swiftly approach that fatal year.

266
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,660
For in 1998 he would have set the record straight.

267
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,440
But now he's dead so we're due no adieu.

268
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,020
Bob dogs.

269
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,020


270
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,020


271
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,020


272
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,720
Well this has been the story of J.R.

273
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,400
Bob dogs.

274
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,040
Some called him messiah.

275
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,620
Others called him fraud.

276
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,820
I hope that before 98 that the word gets out.

277
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,640
That Bob dogs was the only guy we couldn't do without.

278
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,340
The end times are upon us.

279
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,480
And things don't look so good.

280
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,000
But we'll never forget.

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


282
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


284
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


288
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


292
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


295
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000


297
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,300
Bob dogs had the answer but was seldom understood.

298
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,260
We're in a heap of trouble.

299
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,640
Our books are in the red.

300
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,580
There is no joy in Mudville.

301
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,940
Now that Bob is dead.

302
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,660
So we pray to Biden and Jesus to do battle for Bob's soul.

303
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,800
To poop dog and a pee dog for strengthening our whole.

304
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,980
We pray to he who needs no name that we may need no slack.

305
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,940
We pray to Wotan please send our Bobby back.

306
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,820
Bob dogs.

307
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,140
Bob dogs.

308
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,420
All our lives are worth shit without you.

309
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,460
Bob dogs.

310
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,840
Bob dogs.

311
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,960
Oh dear what will we do?

312
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,980
What will happen?

313
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,320
The truth is I think rather Conference call no

314
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,320


315
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,100
How involving are we?

316
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,740
Yeah.

317
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,980
Let's just for kicks

318
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,720
If it were not in his grave

319
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
All these subgenial would be saved

320
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,260
But it is, so our chances are nicks

321
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,420
But it is, so our chances are nicks

322
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,560
There may be some people here

323
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
Well, I know there's some people here

324
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,800
Who don't know a damn thing about church and subgenius

325
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,260
In fact, I overheard somebody saying

326
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,460
Well, I think it's like a comedy thing

327
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,380
And it's funny religion

328
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,220
Well, yeah, that too

329
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,260
But why not both?

330
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,760
It really is a real mind-controlled cult

331
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,600
And if you don't believe me

332
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,480
You'll find out what I'm talking about

333
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,360
Later on tonight

334
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,320
The subliminals that are playing right now

335
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,540
Have fulfilled their mission

336
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,500
You'll see

337
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,180
What is all this I hear about this youth cult

338
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,100
This church of the subgenius?

339
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,700
Gee, I don't know

340
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,360
Well, how about

341
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,780
What about you, sir?

342
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,060
What?

343
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,460
Well, what about you?

344
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,600
It's about Bob, you know?

345
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,340
It's Bob

346
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,820
That's it

347
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,140
Bob is great

348
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,200
Starts with a B

349
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,580
Father, what is it, man?

350
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,820
I knew it when I came in here, man

351
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,260
Ends with a B

352
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,900
No, don't tell me

353
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,360
I'm through

354
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,120
Ten seconds, Bob

355
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,160
Bob!

356
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:57,780
Bob!

357
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,040
Bob!

358
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,800
Bob!

359
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:01,740
Bob!

360
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,300
Bob!

361
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:04,420


362
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:04,720
Bob!

363
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,420
Bob!

364
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:06,460


365
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:06,980
Bob!

366
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,060
Bob!

367
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,080
Bob!

368
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,080


369
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,080


370
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,280
Bob!

371
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,000
Bob!

372
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,360
Bob!

373
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,420
Bob!

374
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,940
Bob!

375
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,040
Oh Bob!

376
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,220
Bob!

377
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,940
Wow, Bob!

378
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,200
Very nice!

379
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:20,880
Very nice?

380
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,780
Brian, everybody besides you said you're Harold Bregue

381
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,380
Can you abused a JBL gentleman?

382
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,800
What did you do to the rabbit, Bob?

383
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,420
See you tonight

384
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,520
Suddenly Bregue

385
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:27,660
So excited

386
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:27,660


387
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,100
Oh, right

388
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,100


389
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,360
Yeah

390
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,060
The night is cool

391
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,060


392
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,060


393
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,840
Oh

394
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,700
Brigho

395
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,140
Yeah

396
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,780
Brigho

397
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,500
Bob!

398
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,500


399
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:42,860
Bob!

400
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,260
It isn't that far out in Salt and Right on, Bob.

401
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,980
Boy, I'm sweatin' like a whore at church, baby.

402
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,540
And this is the church to be in.

403
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,300
Bob.

404
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,940
Who's Bob?

405
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,700
What's ?

406
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,260
You don't know that? I can't tell ya.

407
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,780
Bob.

408
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,140
Bob.

409
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,680
Bob.

410
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,300
Bob.

411
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,560
Bob.

412
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,540
So, friends, uh, I have not yet answered the question,

413
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,680
what is the church of the subgenius?

414
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,400
And it's a difficult question to answer because, basically,

415
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,140
it is an answer that didn't wait around for a question.

416
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,140
Bob is THE answer!

417
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,620
But, no, actually, Bob is not the answer.

418
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,360
But neither is anything else, friends.

419
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,260
That is the great freedom that our religion gives you.

420
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,060
There, you ain't gonna find an answer, but you can find some helpful hints

421
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,480
and some coincidences that can drive you halfway crazy.

422
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,060
J.R.R. Bob Dobbs is a mystery

423
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,980
enfolded by an enigma,

424
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,260
bound by a puzzle,

425
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,920
wrapped in a strip of bacon,

426
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,400
surrounded by creamy nougat and a rich milk chocolate coating,

427
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,100
held together with a toothpick,

428
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
served on a greasy paper napkin.

429
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,620
An indigestible canopy for the new age.

430
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,280
Born to humble parents somewhere in the Midwest,

431
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:00,240
the child, Bob, experienced a traumatic, close encounter with a UFO at the age of three.

432
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,920
Soon thereafter, he began to exhibit strange,

433
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,760
strange powers of persuasion.

434
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,980
By age six, he had made his first million,

435
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,800
almost by accident.

436
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,900
In college, he met and married his first and still his primary wife, Connie,

437
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,260
who is now revered by female subgenie as the blessed anti-virgin.

438
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,360
With Connie's encouragement,

439
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,760
the young Dobbs became a salesman of legendary, almost frightening abilities,

440
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,520
known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

441
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,520
He worked his way up to the very top of the conspiracy ladder

442
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,260
and might have stayed there.

443
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,040
But, late one night in 1953,

444
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,240
while working on an amateur television of his own design,

445
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,200
an event occurred which was to become a milestone on man's mind path to slack.

446
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,860
He was suddenly seized up in the spirit,

447
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,880
by the hand of Jehovah One itself,

448
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,980
the cosmic puppeteer of the Old Testament,

449
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,920
the wrathful alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy.

450
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,020
In this timeless moment,

451
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,020
which we call the divine immaculation of the Bob,

452
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,940
Dobbs received the first of countless brain-curdling pronouncements

453
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,240
which formed the sacred pre-scriptures of the church.

454
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,360
He was shown a vision,

455
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,220
a world where all humanity was equally wealthy,

456
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,860
rich beyond imagination,

457
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,700
but without working.

458
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,120
This experience, combined with his UFO-given sales magic,

459
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,020
led him inevitably into the religion field.

460
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,620
He quickly discovered the golden rule embodied in his classic saying,

461
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,520
they'll pay to know what they really think.

462
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,440
From then on there's no stopping the Bob as it spreads from town to town.

463
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,140
Sex, sex, sex, 30, 30, s-s-s-sex, sex, pay $30 and get six sex free.

464
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,480
Right.

465
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,040
It's not that we love Bob so much,

466
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,960
it's that we love the idea of everybody else going to hell,

467
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,320
and that is what religion is all about!

468
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,340
How many, how many Buddhists do you know,

469
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,220
who you know that that nice Buddhist is thinking to himself,

470
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,240
I've got less ego than anybody else here?

471
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,020
Science does not remove the terror of the gods.

472
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,980
We can't do much about those evil gods

473
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,600
from the other side of the cosmos,

474
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,300
who fly through the air and through the nebulous darkness of space.

475
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,040
Space, my friends,

476
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,620
the infinite inky clouds of nebulae,

477
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,220
they fly on their membranous leathery wings,

478
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,640
holding in their coiling tentacles shiny steel cylinders,

479
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,220
each one containing what was once a human body,

480
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,580
a human soul,

481
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,380
what was once a member of the church of the subgenius.

482
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,560
But enough of this.

483
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,340
You don't want to hear about this.

484
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,820
You will learn about this.

485
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,360
Take me off to space,

486
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,180
take me off to space,

487
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,940
come on down you saucer man,

488
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,920
and take me off to space,

489
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,380
take me off to space,

490
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,800
take me off to space,

491
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,740
come on down you saucer man,

492
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,820
and take me off to space.

493
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,200
Thick needles in my belly

494
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,480
take samples of my skin.

495
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,040
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man.

496
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,000
I know that you don't take requests,

497
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,860
but I'm a special case.

498
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,660
Come on down you saucer man,

499
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,500
and take me off to space.

500
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,900
Take me off to space,

501
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,200
take me off to space,

502
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,000
come on down you saucer man,

503
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,900
and take me off to space,

504
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,140
take me off to space,

505
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,480
take me off to space,

506
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,300
come on down you saucer man,

507
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,120
and take me off to space.

508
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,580
Hey cow mutilators,

509
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,880
let me join your crew.

510
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,600
Give me a knife,

511
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,420
you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

512
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly fiend without a face.

513
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,500
So come on down you saucer man,

514
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,300
and take me off to space.

515
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,880
Oh take me off to space,

516
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,340
take me off to space,

517
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,780
come on down you saucer man,

518
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,700
and take me off to space.

519
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,160
Take me off to space,

520
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,140
take me off to space,

521
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,080
come on down you saucer man,

522
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,800
and take me off to space.

523
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,100
Come down you tiny robots,

524
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,340
with your little nipper claws.

525
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,920
You pale and bug-eyed aliens,

526
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,920
with white and clammy paws.

527
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,200
Life is just a sucker,

528
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,640
a sucker's dream,

529
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,260
and Biff is a disgrace,

530
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,120
so

531
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,000
come on down you saucer man,

532
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,860
and take me off to space.

533
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,920
Take me off to space,

534
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,220
take me off to space,

535
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,000
come on down you saucer man,

536
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,700
and take me off to space.

537
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,880
Take me off to space,

538
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,120
take me off to space,

539
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,920
come on down you saucer man,

540
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,640
and take me off to space.

541
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,760
Yeah!

542
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,580
Here's more money, Bob.

543
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,680
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

544
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,820
This is it.

545
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:33,500
The only faith that promises action, thrills, success in sex and business.

546
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,540
Y'all are out to put down outrageous cult groups.

547
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,800
What does this mean?

548
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,720
No, no, this is an outrageous cult group.

549
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,820
Praise Bob.

550
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,540
Help me somebody.

551
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,480
Help me somebody.

552
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,400
Help me somebody.

553
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,320
Help me somebody.

554
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,220
Help me somebody.

555
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,660
Now, children, many people have asked me,

556
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,940
Reverend Sternow, how did you become a subgenius?

557
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,280
How did you find Bob?

558
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,020
Well, I'd like to tell you about that tonight, children.

559
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,620
And a happy tale it is in the telling, too.

560
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,100
For it was in the winter of 1965.

561
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,820
Ironically, I was walking down the streets of Dallas, Texas.

562
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,000
Children, I was depressed.

563
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,900
Say, oh, no.

564
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,060
Children.

565
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,300
I was dejected.

566
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,140
Say, my God.

567
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,200
My God.

568
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,700
Children, I had not f***ed the exit wound of a recently assassinated U.S. president in weeks.

569
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,260
Say, holy s***.

570
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,440
Holy s***.

571
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
Holy s***.

572
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,000
Children, I was down to my last two cc's of faith s***.

573
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,020
Fat sperm antidote pudding.

574
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,160
Say, oh, no, Sternow.

575
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,060
Sternow.

576
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,000
Sternow.

577
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,600
Children, I had not launched the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer in six months.

578
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,700
Man, oh.

579
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,240
God, Sternow.

580
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,260
Sternow.

581
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,180
Sternow.

582
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,840
Sternow.

583
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,120
Children, I was at the end of my rope.

584
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,020
It came to me that the only solution to my problems was suicide.

585
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,720
And I didn't even have the money for a Saturday night special.

586
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:10,840
I was walking to the pawn shop, praying to Bob that I had enough money to buy a Wednesday

587
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,160
or a Thursday night special to blow my f***ing brains out.

588
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,020
Brains out.

589
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,960
And I had to glance down into a mud puddle, children.

590
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,180
And there in that mud puddle, covered with mud, was a pamphlet.

591
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,700
And there, children, in blazes on the cover of that pamphlet, was Bob's mighty face beating

592
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,440
up at me.

593
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,100
His enigmatic smile seemed to say, here, model is this cheesy ad in 1953.

594
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,340
I know exactly how that smile will look when Reverend Sternow needs it in 1965.

595
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,860
Well, I picked up that pamphlet, children.

596
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,920
And I read it.

597
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,780
And what it said in essence was, get in on the ground floor of a lucrative new cult now

598
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,820
while raising your load.

599
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,840
Well, I was one of the few people to do that, children.

600
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,140
And now there are thousands, nay, millions of zombie-eyed, panhandling teenage followers

601
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,260
standing on street corners in cities the world over, selling that self-saved pamphlet instead

602
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,960
of me the money.

603
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,280
With a fourth-feet considerable slack, as you might have guessed.

604
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,920
So.

605
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,460
If you.

606
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,740
Are what they call different.

607
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:29,100
If you think we're entering a new dark age, if you view the entire universe as one vast,

608
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,520
morbid, cosmic joke, if you are searching for an inherently bogus religion that will

609
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:43,480
condone superior degeneracy and tell you that you are above everyone else, and most important

610
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,320
of all, children.

611
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,780
I'm done.

612
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,040
If you can help us with a donation, a national donation, the Church of the Subgenius may just

613
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,400
provide you with the slack you've been lacking.

614
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,040
Praise Bob.

615
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,240
Slack, what is it?

616
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,860
Well, if you have to ask, you will never know.

617
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,980
You were born with original slack, an infinite supply of it.

618
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,760
But the conspiracy has most of it now.

619
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,600
They don't even know what it is, but that hasn't stopped them from stealing it away.

620
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,000
How do you think you ended up a slave to their so-called?

621
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,700
Work?

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,720
Let's bring it to vertical one more time.

623
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,880
I get to be another dumb American mime.

624
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,320
Miles and miles and miles ago, to get to work with other conspiracy heads that treat me

625
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,820
like a jerk.

626
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,700
Paper pushing, collating, checking the mail.

627
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,640
What the hell's going on here?

628
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,000
Pink belly, pink belly, pink belly, pink belly.

629
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,780
Paper pushing, collating, checking the mail.

630
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,740
Peter Cushing, SoulCrate, the stupid emails.

631
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,560
Don't know how they expect me to meet all these deadlines, but I don't want to resort

632
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,780
to the Scarlet Red Line.

633
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:45,980
So I'm going to go to the

634
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:45,980


635
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:45,980


636
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:45,980


637
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:45,980


638
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:45,980


639
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,520
work, but what am I going to buy with all of this stuff daily?

640
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,160
I guess I just got to.

641
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,020
What the hell's going on here?

642
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,920
Pink belly, pink belly, pink belly, pink belly.

643
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,120
Paper pushing, collating, checking the mail.

644
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,620
What the hell's going on here?

645
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,380
Paper pushing, collating, checking the mail.

646
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,960
The oblivion of work is often interrupted by work.

647
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,820
The oblivion of work is often interrupted by work.

648
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:15,960
I believe that the work on the internet is the same as the work on TV.

649
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:15,960


650
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,680
But my favorite grace, which seems to never abate

651
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,520
As a blade awaits a whole other day

652
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,640
When the space freight of the potential multiple may

653
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,040
Derive from this world I hate

654
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,360
And on that day I'm gonna party

655
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,660
Like it's 1998

656
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,380
No more peep nosing or whoring

657
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,520
All we'll be doing is soaring throughout the doors of perception

658
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,940
Running past the waves of deception

659
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,520
Oh, what a reception into the arms of the goddesses

660
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,040
It's beyond description

661
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,620
What the hell's going on here?

662
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,740
Party like it's 1998

663
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,400
Don't finally expect me to meet all these deadlines

664
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,340
But I don't want to

665
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,780
So what's all this call with red lines?

666
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,900
So I comply with all this stuff daily, I guess

667
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,060
I just gotta

668
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,640
What the hell's going on here?

669
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,400
Work

670
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:07,660
Conspiracy

671

Pink

673
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,360
Anti-slack

674
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,940
Oh, I could tell you

675
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:15,940


676
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,200
I really use an ex day

677
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,680
What the hell's going on here?

678
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,300
Threat

679
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,700
Springing to vertical one more time

680
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,940
I get to be another dumb American mime

681

Take Valley, take Valley

686
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,860
People pushing, collating, checking the mail

687
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,800
People pushing, collating, checking the mail

688
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Peter Cushing's soul craving the stupid emails

689
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,380
Don't know how they expect me to meet all these deadlines

690
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,800
But I don't want to resort to the score with red lines

691
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,900
So I comply with all this stuff daily, I guess

692
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,580
What the hell's going on here?

693
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,060
I just gotta

00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,800

Often

711
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,440
I feel like a ghost

712
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,140
Insubstantial

713
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,920
Drifting

00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,220

Glimpses of life

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,080
But distant

719
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,540
As behind a thick wall of glass

720
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,280
The oblivion of work

721
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,380
Is often

722
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,220
Interrupted

723
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,840

Look around you.

742
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,960
Look at what they've done to the things that you love.

743
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,100
They took Elvis Presley.

744
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,320
They turned him pink.

745
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,160
They made him into a fat monster.

746
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,140
People say to us, people worry that the Church of the Subgenius

747
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,420
is an anti-American church.

748
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,820
A subversive church.

749
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,660
Children, we are the first real Americans.

750
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,360
We know what America is before they took it away from us

751
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,820
and tried to sell it back to us for a profit.

752
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,020
You know, my friend, while you're alive,

753
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,660
you gotta shout and make a lot of noise

754
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,260
because when you die, you shut up like hell.

755
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,940
If you have never heard of the Church of the Subgenius,

756
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,960
do not look to us for enlightenment.

757
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,240
Even the believers in this self-proclaimed totally bogus religion

758
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,720
say,

759
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,040
it defies description.

760
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,820
We realize that if Jim Jones could talk 900 people into killing themselves,

761
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,540
we could talk 900 people into sending us a dollar.

762
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,580
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob.

763
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,500
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob.

764
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,260
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob.

765
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,020
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob.

766
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,380
Eternal salvation.

767
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,940
Jim, pull your money back.

768
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,280
All of the religions will be having a heart attack.

769
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,880
A pipe full of frog equals what?

770
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,620
A lot of slack.

771
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,100
No matter how you kill him, he always keeps coming back.

772
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,620
Bob.

773
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,140
I'm talking about dobs.

774
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,060
Repent, quit your job, and slack off.

775
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,240
Get ready to blast off.

776
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,100
When Ed's name comes and all the geeks are on the run from Bob.

777
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,740
Bob.

778
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,440
Bob.

779
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,300
Bob.

780
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,120
Bob.

781
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:40,640
Bob.

782
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,460
Bob.

783
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,000
Bob.

784
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:42,260


785
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:42,480


786
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:43,980
Bob.

787
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:44,600


788
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:44,660


789
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,220
Bob.

790
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,280
Bob.

791
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,580
Bob.

792
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:45,800
Bob.

793
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:45,880
Bob.

794
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:45,900
Bob.

795
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:45,900


796
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:45,900


797
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:45,900


798
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:45,940
Bob.

799
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:45,940


800
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:45,940


801
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:45,940


802
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:45,940


803
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:45,940


804
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:45,940


805
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,300
Bob.

806
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:46,740
Bob.

807
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:47,960
Bob.

808
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,740
Bob.

809
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,380
Bob.

810
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,960
Bob.

811
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,580
Bob.

812
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,020
Bob.

813
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,240
Bob.

814
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,280
Bob.

815
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:52,820
Bob.

816
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:52,820


817
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:52,820


818
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:52,820


819
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,760
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

820
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,180
Start to realize what till now has been disguised.

821
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
Keep looking to the skies at the saucers flying by.

822
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,300
And maybe by and by you will see the light at the end of the pipe that leads to Bob Dobbs.

823
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,180
Bob Dobbs.

824
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,560
Talking about the salesman.

825
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,480
Do the gods.

826
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,840
He's still in check of the coffin lid.

827
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,400
On a conspiracy of normality.

828
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Oh, who could it be but Bob?

829
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,360
Oh, a whole group of burglars.

830
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,360


831
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,360


832
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,360


833
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,360


834
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,880
And then say Someone Have Badcountry in Time.

835
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,760
Two years later, he's like you.

836
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:39,760


837
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,820
Crazy about Bob.

838
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,760
Crazy about Bob?

839
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,340
Disgusting.

840
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:43,380
Quips.

841
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,520
Gross.

842
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,340
Garph.

843
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,000
There is no difference between truth and lies

844
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,120
The race became the beggar and the fool became the wise

845
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,780
Cause it's a way out, far out, psychedelic freak out

846
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,280
Took a hit of Bob, I'm startin' to freak out

847
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,680
Geek out, my friends are gonna leak out

848
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,400
Look out everyone, here he comes, it's Bob

849
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,280
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob.

850
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,720
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob.

851
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,960
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob.

852
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,460
I got one thing to say, and it won't take long.

853
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,860
But Bob Dobbs done been here, took a good shit, and gone.

854
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:22,960
The Church of the Subgenius is basically a religion for mutants, misfits, sinners, disbelievers,

855
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:28,180
or people who believe anything, and particularly for people with a really sick sense of humor.

856
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,880
You think I'm crazy, right?

857
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
Media is the key to power.

858
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,600
Good job, bitch.

859
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,880
When you first look at it, some people go, oh, I get it.

860
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,880
This is a takeoff on weird cults and conspiracies and kooks in general.

861
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,960
Then they look a little bit deeper, and if they're really an attuned sort of person,

862
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,220
then they realize, oh, I get it.

863
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,780
This really is a weird cult with cosmic wisdom and dogma that I've been needing all my life.

864
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,240
And that's usually when they write their first check.

865
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,660
Now at this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

866
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:08,940
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare,

867
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,240
behold us, for we are the subgeniuses.

868
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,040
Subgeniuses.

869
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,680
When the trumpet call makes sound

870
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,700
Brother and sister band

871
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,540
While we blow the world away

872
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,380
We shall have paradise

873
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,440
Sardinia of the world, unite

874
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,420
Alien sex every night

875
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,540
Sardinia of the world, Sardinia of the world

876
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,580
Sardinia of the world, unite

877
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,280
J.R. Bob Dove

878
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,640
Let us not forget

879
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,420
That the only reason we are here for even a second

880
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,000
Is because of that man Bob

881
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,140
You have slacked by his stripes

882
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,140
By his stripes you have money

883
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,000
By his stripes you have sex

884
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,820
By his lucky strikes you have cigarettes

885
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,460
By Bob's lucky strikes you are here today

886
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,280
So praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob

887
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,240
If you see Bob on the highway

888
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,480
Suck his

889
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,340
If you see Bob on the street

890
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,260
Suck his

891
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,300
If you see Bob

892
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:26,620
If you see Bob on the street

893
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:26,860
Suck his

894
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:26,860


895
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,120
Or if you're being ruptured after those

896
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,680
You better suck Bob's

897
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,920
And let that be Bob's award

898
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,080
Praise Bob and hail Bob

899
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,800
The choice is clear, cunt

900
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,440
But even though Bob is a trip with suitcases

901
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,720
There ain't gonna be a whole lot of room

902
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,460
For any carry-on baggage

903
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,340
So if you've got any really foul

904
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,600
Psychic luck

905
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:56,920
Or any luggage

906
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,740
You're gonna have to get rid of it before boarding

907
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,100
You gotta do a final inventory on your own psyche, seekers

908
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,100
Take it away

909
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,800
Cause do you have what it takes to dare to be slack?

910
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,580
Yeah

911
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:10,800
Do it

912
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,900
I fear the day I meet Bob Dobbs

913
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,700
I've actually had nightmares about that

914
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,780
Real nightmares

915
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
And he owes me money

916
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,900
Well I used to be a sinner

917
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,740
Cause I truly did believe

918
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,180
That the Virgin Mary, Jesus

919
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,220
And me were thick as thieves

920
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,420
And I used to give my daughter

921
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,460
A hell of evangelistic snot

922
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,860
But then the light had shone upon me

923
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,980
And I found J.R. Bob Dobbs

924
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,520
And now my wallet belongs to Bob

925
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,920
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

926
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,140
Well my heart is for my honey

927
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,580
And my brain is for my love

928
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,200
And my soul is for my job

929
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,060
But my wallet belongs to Bob

930
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,380
Well Bobby goes to profit

931
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,440
Every chance that he can get

932
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,660
He can outperform the biggest

933
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,720
Without even breaking sweat

934
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,060
So I gave him all my money

935
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,120
Reverend Stanks said it was right

936
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,460
And for only twenty dollars

937
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,420
He did save my soul tonight

938
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,580
And now my wallet belongs to Bob Dobbs

939
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,520
Bruce Carter Gracie

940
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:34,520


941
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,860
I don't quite get what they're saying

942
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,360
But the big change is

943
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,000
That I got my partner

944
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,580
pseudonymly Bob

945
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,480
Now I'm like Bobby

946
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,980
Well Bobby's got a sweetie

947
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,220
And Connie is her name

948
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,420
And her ways to put the sacred

949
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,500
The secret whore of Babylon, Deshaies

950
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,820
She reaches in Bob's pocket, feels around for something hard

951
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,260
Then pulls her hand out, holding on to his mighty credit card

952
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,720
And now my wallet belongs to Bob

953
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,440
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

954
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,200
And I never have to fear, cause I know Connie's on the job

955
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,240
And my wallet belongs to Bob

956
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,760
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man too

957
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,120
Their existential energy may be what's right for you

958
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,380
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cuffs

959
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,680
And give away your money to the one that gets results

960
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,180
And then your wallet belongs to Bob

961
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,160
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob

962
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,720
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob

963
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,100
And you will be subgenius, not another stupid slob

964
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,600
And your wallet will be for Bob

965
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,660
Well, I believe I am much calmer

966
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,720
Got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

967
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,180
Sittin' on the dashboard of my car

968
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,180


969
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,200
I'm a poor, poor, poor

970
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,600
Praise Bob

971
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,540
Wee-haw!

972
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,480
Praise Bob!

973
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,880
Praise Bob!

974
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,520
Praise Bob!

975
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,600
Money back!

976
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:47,440
You can't be mentally ill and self-righteous at the same time

977
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,040
And yet, here I am!

978
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,240
These are people who are seriously suffering from a major problem

979
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,360
Bob, are you here?

980
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,460
Oh, it feels good

981
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,120
Hallelujah! Take place the Lord!

982
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,340
I know the word hell

983
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,880
Yeah, ain't it groovy?

984
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,320
I know what I mean!

985
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,080
Making sense so far?

986
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,680
Well, don't worry about it, kids

987
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,780
I don't understand a word of it either

988
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,020
This church started in Dallas, Texas

989
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,640
Which is often called the Buckle on the Bible Belt

990
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,940
All we're trying to do is unbuckle the Bible Belt

991
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,920
He does not really care about your sins

992
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,920
He comes rather to justify your sins

993
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,340
To rationalize your sins, my friend

994
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,380
He brings not forgiveness, but an excuse

995
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,300
The Church of the Subgenius is nonsense

996
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,520
I mean, it's triviality

997
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,420
It has no significance for anything that anybody's gonna care about for any length of time

998
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,080
Bob is a very special kind of religious leader

999
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,840
Bob is a short-duration personal savior

1000
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,940
Yes, children, Bob wants you to take him into your heart and into your mind

1001
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,600
Bob wants you to take him into your checkbook

1002
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,180
But after you've taken him into those sacred places

1003
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,860
Bob wants you to think about him, consider him, and then...

1004
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,300
Cast him out!

1005
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,460
Short-duration personal saviors

1006
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,080
It solves a key problem that kept cropping up in earlier faiths

1007
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,920
Turns out it only takes five or six generations

1008
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,960
Before the memory of a great spiritual leader like Muhammad...

1009
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,020
Or Jesus of Nazareth...

1010
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,160
Is totally corrupted by the people who are retelling the story

1011
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,520
All of whom have their own motives

1012
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,920
Five or six generations, that's only a hundred years

1013
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,860
And up till now, that's been the maximum useful life of a religion

1014
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,040
After that, a sexual paranoid like Paul

1015
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,720
Or a megalomaniac like the Pope, King James, or the Ayatollah take control

1016
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,440
At that point, the religion is virtually used up

1017
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,280
The mass repression completely outweighs the Church's other virtues

1018
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,460
But with a short-duration personal savior

1019
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,940
Blind faith in an exalted person or object doesn't have to last even one generation

1020
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,420
It doesn't even have to last an hour

1021
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,520
Which makes the crucial difference in long-term performance and maintenance

1022
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,320
F*** the New Age! No blood for snake oil!

1023
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,320
It was like the end of the world

1024
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,740
There was destruction everywhere

1025
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,060
People scrambled around in hysterical panic

1026
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,380
Cars and buses and taxis were slamming into each other by the second

1027
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,800
Mass confusion reigned like never before

1028
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,820
And the cause of all this?

1029
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:10,720
Bob?

1030
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,280
The end of the world

1031
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,940
The end of the world

1032
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:15,800
The end of the world

1033
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,040
You're not Jesus

1034
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,080
You're Bob

1035
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,460
Yes, Bob!

1036
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,100
If you feel it in your eyes, it's in your device

1037
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,060
Such was God on his side, Dan Price

1038
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,640
We got the hype, we got the tools, and we wrote all the rules

1039
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,320
Say when the candle was playing, let me tell you now where you stand

1040
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,000
Star-Cruiser, this is the night, it's such a glorious sight

1041
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,800
We'll jump your face in the dirt and show you what you really want

1042
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,580
Scuttle-eye to the end of the line, cause it's our time

1043
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,480
This ain't no game, so you better run, run, run

1044
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,240
I'm on my high horse and I'm gonna ride, ride, ride

1045
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,780
I'm on soarers, fakers, punks, fly, fly, fly

1046
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,820
I pay my dues to the man with the pipe

1047
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,040
So we own all the guns, we're gonna watch his planet blow tonight

1048
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,000
So cry, baby, cry, tears won't change the story

1049
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,300
Scream, baby, scream, cause it won't change a thing

1050
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,300
Pray, baby, pray to the gods who will not answer

1051
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,900
Cause today is his day, he's coming to pierce the pain

1052
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,020
I'm a monster without fight

1053
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,520
J.R. Bob Dobs, monster of the fight

1054
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,460
I'm a monster without fight

1055
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,340
Do you journal salvation or dribble your money back?

1056
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,940
I will make your wallet safe and soar

1057
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,580
Put it under Bob's control

1058
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,500
All the inspires while you wait

1059
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,560
Operators are standing by

1060
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,040
From then on there's no stopping the pop

1061
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,100
As it spreads from town to town

1062
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,920
I'm getting through, ain't through, ain't nothing that you can do

1063
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,140
Make all the queens start shaking in their boots

1064
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,200
Make the customer receive what I view

1065
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,840
You can't hold me or control me

1066
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,460
All the bobbies wanna be me

1067
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,200
Until the sources come down and burn your tail to the ground

1068
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,580
There's no path to go, collect you hundred bleeding souls

1069
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,760
Survive till my fifth in the moon

1070
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,400
So we eat, shout, and breathe corn

1071
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,020
And then it's time to settle the score

1072
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,380
It ain't about the battle, it's about the war

1073
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,620
So go read Revelation, excuse that dirty score

1074
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,820
I got more, verses than a damn bible

1075
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,080
Play the lack of recital

1076
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,600
It's just me and Black Screw on the edge of the aisle

1077
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,460
So cry, baby, cry, tears won't change the story

1078
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,700
Scream, baby, scream, cause it won't change a thing

1079
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,560
Just a fight or a sin, or with a family congrats

1080
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,140
There ain't no asking why, it's time to slap your butt

1081
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,660
It's our money, your wealth, our power

1082
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,940
J.R. Bob Dogg's Master of Swag

1083
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,580
My life's just the same as mine

1084
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,000
Eternal salvation or triple your money back

1085
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,400
Don't think no more, let's save your soul

1086
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,900
Put it under Bob's control

1087
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,940
Cause I'm only good through next day

1088
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,540
July 5th, 1998

1089
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,400
For Christ's sake, Mr. What You F***ing

1090
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,460
Maybe I can tell you what I'm talking about

1091
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,880
I'm not talking about my life right now

1092
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,120
July 5th is coming, there's no time to wait

1093
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,980
I'm not talking about my life right now

1094
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,220
I'm not talking about my life right now

1095
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,740
Serve a World Cup golfer's head on a plate

1096
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,680
I'm not talking about my life right now

1097
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,680
I got to go to bed from the rings of Bob's pipe

1098
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,700
And if you don't, within the next 30 minutes

1099
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,060
We're going to be helping a furry squid

1100
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,920
Damn! Some parts of the universe, this thing would be considered funny!

1101
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,020
Woo!

1102
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,140
Repent, quit your job, slack off, and

1103
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,440
Bring Bob!

1104
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,160
I see visions of counting

1105
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,440
Of course I do

1106
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,900
I am a vision of counting

1107
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,020
Woo hoo!

1108
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:48,340
I have that could feed a small South American nation.

1109
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,280
I have ovaries of steel and a built like a brick house.

1110
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,880
My uterus could nurture a full-grown yeti.

1111
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,060
I am a sweetie.

1112
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,380
I'm a slut.

1113
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,640
I'm an angel.

1114
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,740
I'm a devil.

1115
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,860
I am F-A-T fat and P-H-A-T fat.

1116
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,040
I'm the succubus and the innocent.

1117
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,020
I am a vision of Connie herself.

1118
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,240
And you know what?

1119
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:37,420
So is every sweet, likable, lovable,

1120
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,660
sexy uber-femme in this church.

1121
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,880
The secret of X-Day.

1122
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,780
The secret of X-Day.

1123
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,700
Am I evil?

1124
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,840
I don't know, my son.

1125
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,040
All my life I've been a little man.

1126
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,080
Happy little fella.

1127
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,340
But in the dressing room, I don't understand.

1128
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,940
Do you ever hear of X-Day?

1129
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,060
No.

1130
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,380
You mean, yes, yes, a chance to grow to normal size.

1131
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,360
Please, please, please let him do it.

1132
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:12,840
Yes.

1133
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,820
Just what does this X-Day look like?

1134
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,400
Uh, uh, a rag.

1135
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,540
I had grown.

1136
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,820
I had grown.

1137
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,980
I was growing.

1138
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,180
You've grown, but not so much that I can't handle you.

1139
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,340
I was normal.

1140
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,700
Normal.

1141
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,060
You look good to me.

1142
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:33,960
I do?

1143
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,060
Well, I always did go for big men.

1144
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:37,800
Big?

1145
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:38,660
Yeah.

1146
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,680
I was vaguely disturbed.

1147
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,040
I'm afraid of you, John.

1148
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,980
You're too big now.

1149
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,240
Yes.

1150
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,380
I'd grown at least six inches.

1151
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,680
Now I was a freak again.

1152
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,000
I was a freak again.

1153
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,080
I was a freak again.

1154
00:50:52,520 --> 00:51:04,580
I was a freak again.

1155
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,160
I cut my finger on a soup can lid

1156
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,800
I got an infection and it spread to my d***

1157
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,060
It swelled up to the size of a human head

1158
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,780
And then a mouth opened on it

1159
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,880
And this is what it said

1160
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,520
Kill the pink boys, quit your job

1161
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,160
Mock the world and praise Bob Dobbs

1162
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,440
We'll build a ship and take a trip

1163
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,660
Go on, go get a pen, write the coordinates

1164
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,520
Three and a half months in my garage

1165
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,240
Tearing parts off of old used cars

1166
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,720
My groin at this point was unusually large

1167
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,440
And went occasionally home while smoking cigars

1168
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,860
The project was finished, the ship would hold twenty

1169
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,440
The power source was anything a crew would think was funny

1170
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,520
We didn't need the slack list, they're hapless

1171
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,100
Our mouth proved its worth in escaping the stark fist

1172
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,220
On our way to Planet X for sex, direct snacks

1173
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,980
So Barry's quitting every pot of money

1174
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,140
Shredded the shit out of my face

1175
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,920
Shot a corny d***

1176
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,760
All-horse hour of bonanza

1177
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,320
It's like a world without Tony Danza

1178
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,640
Orphanza, the pink s*** that hits the charts

1179
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,920
In a world of dead art

1180
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,140
Simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

1181
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,260
We take a moment and we pause to reflect

1182
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,040
On the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wrecked

1183
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,600
Then we laugh like banshees

1184
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,600
And howl like comanches

1185
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,680
Do a victory dance

1186
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,360
In our underoos and panties

1187
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,100
Our fantasy is a reality

1188
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,740
Earth's tarnished in dust

1189
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,520
It's Planet X or bust for us

1190
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,720
Bob's pipe is lit

1191
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,900
Space and time shift

1192
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,060
General, that's all

1193
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,700
That causes a slack rift

1194
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,880
A three-dimensional split

1195
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,860
Severs forever subgeni from pink s***

1196
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,820
Blocked in a circle

1197
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,560
And steadily exhaled in the smoke

1198
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,620
I can see why the pink boys failed

1199
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,140
To pay a naze has caused destruction

1200
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,740
Second hole of slackless suction

1201
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,300
Pay-per-view alien abduction

1202
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,800
Functioning on soulless slack

1203
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,140
The money should be painted black

1204
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,760
The meat from space that store your balls

1205
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,200
Will soon come back and take it all

1206
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,040
Return to the past

1207
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,660
Return to slack

1208
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,920
Return to Bob

1209
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,500
Repent, slack off, and quit your job

1210
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,320
Or slurp the beastly knob

1211
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,060
Connery

1212
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,680
Lick the throbbing vein of slavery

1213
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,240
Now you're sleeping like a baby

1214
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,820
But Bob woke me up and said

1215
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,640
Get out of Dodge

1216
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,240
There's a guy who's f***ing dropped a UFO in his garage

1217
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,960
I ate some bad ham and I got really sickened

1218
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,380
In a puddle of my puke where the puke was most sick

1219
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,820
A mouse did appear and it beckoned me near

1220
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,400
And it whispered the following words into my ear

1221
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,060
It said, kill the pink boys

1222
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,020
Quit your job and get out of here

1223
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,660
Mock the world and praise Bob Dobbs

1224
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,980
You'll build a ship and take a trip

1225
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,180
Go on, go get a pen, write the coordinates

1226
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,120
Six and a half months, hold up alone

1227
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,640
Circuit boards, duct tape, and turkey bones

1228
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,160
The ship appeared more than disaster prone

1229
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,880
But the vomit assured me that far weirder ships had flown

1230
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,440
The project was finished, the ship would hold twenty

1231
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,020
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny

1232
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,040
We didn't need the slackless, they're hapless

1233
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,700
Our mirth proved its worth in escaping the star-fixed

1234
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,000
On our way to Planet X we're setting off

1235
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,820
The next that wrecks next

1236
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,240
A prairie squid and every pot of money shot at Connie

1237
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,320
The all-hoss hour of Bonanza

1238
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,900
It's like a world without Tony Danza

1239
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,160
We're fans of a pink sh** that hates the charts

1240
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,660
In a world of dead art, simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

1241
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,840
We take a moment and we pause to reflect

1242
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,560
On the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wrecked

1243
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,120
Then we laugh like banshees and howl like Comanches

1244
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,900
Do a victory dance in our underoos and panties

1245
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,600
Our fantasy is a reality

1246
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,140
Earth turns to dust, it's Planet X or Buster Bust

1247
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
We're the one and only

1248
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,980
Embrace the yay blood that flows in your veins

1249
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,020
And when the frog pipe clouds bring slack like rain

1250
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,480
Let Bob control

1251
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,600
What's left of your brain

1252
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,740
Oh yes and all your money to the Reverend Heidenstein

1253
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,340
Embrace the yay blood that flows in your veins

1254
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,280
And when the frog pipe clouds bring slack like rain

1255
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,440
Let Bob control

1256
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,960
What's left of your brain

1257
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,460
Oh yes and all your money to the Reverend Heidenstein

1258
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,920
Embrace the yay blood that flows in your veins

1259
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,460
And when the frog pipe clouds bring slack like rain

1260
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,480
Let Bob control

1261
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,700
What's left of your brain

1262
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:21,880
Oh yes and all your money to the Reverend Heidenstein

1263
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,860
Friends, question authority

1264
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,560
WHY?

1265
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,800
Now look, when everybody does that kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?

1266
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,100
Jesus, how can you get rebellion going with a crowd like this?

1267
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:37,880
BOO!

1268
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,080
I'm not a rebel, I'm a rebel

1269
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,100
I'm a rebel, I'm a rebel

1270
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:39,400
I'm a rebel, I'm a rebel

1271
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,040
I'm a rebel

1272
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:47,800
You will emerge from trance on the tone remembering everything except your instructions for the omega contingency plan

1273
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,980
Turn this thing off so you can get these four letter words

1274
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,880
These damn monkeys won't stop

1275
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,280
Don't grit

1276
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,760
Okay grunt

1277
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:00,820
Don't grit

1278
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:01,620
Ahhhhhhh

1279
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:09,100
Friends what you have been listening to was all remixed and recolaged by the Great Reverend Frotis Suds Pasha of Monkeyhive

1280
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,420
who will see you at X Day on the saucers.

1281
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,820
What we've been listening to,

1282
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,880
if I can do this quick enough from the beginning,

1283
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,460
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang and Mark Mothersbaugh,

1284
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,560
commercial soundtrack of the Subgenius commercial.

1285
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,140
Channel 4 Dallas 1980 Bob intro, CNN Subgenius report.

1286
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,820
Bill T. Miller, the king of slack, song X Days of Comin'.

1287
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,340
Sontar's fake news report from the Arise video.

1288
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,580
Yours truly, in 1981 on What's Up America Showtime,

1289
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,900
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger with Bleepo Abernathy,

1290
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,500
