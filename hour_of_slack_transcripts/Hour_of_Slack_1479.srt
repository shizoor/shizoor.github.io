1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
Get healthy. That's all I can say. One God, one aim, one destiny for all, one race.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,240
The human race. Our slack coming your way right now.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,540
Yes, sirree, Bob. It's little old me, Bob.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,940
And welcome to another edition of...

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,780
...the show that's not going to agree to a ministry hour effect with people in defense.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,780
And I wonder if I'll end up becoming something weird.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,720
You won't become one of us.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,380
Real professional, huh?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,540
Well, here's Dave again. We're saved.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,320
Yay, Dave!

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,620
I'm saved right now. The holster's back.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,820
I've lost the boot width, though. I mean, the cream you put on.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,500
So I'm getting confused about that.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,560
You lost your bootlick cream?

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,940
Yeah, I lost my bootlick cream.

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,660
Because of some kind of perfunctory arrangement with the, you know,

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,180
heretofore banditos of space, or whatever they call themselves now.

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,800
Hmm.

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,620
I think they're all secret Rosa Kruisinger hillbillies or something.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,700
And in my long association with the Los Angeles...

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,060
I'm...

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,740
Go ahead, Dave.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,360
I like it when you make that funny noise, Dave.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,140
It's like, it's a form of lozenge that we've used for many years now.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,980
It produces a psychedelic vision, which can be translated in many different ways.

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:38,060
Because the soil, the earth itself, is the wellspring for the, you know...

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,200
It's peanuts, all right. It's cream.

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,620
That's peanut butter.

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,440
I'll tell you, I'm in such a flagrant state of mind.

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,280
I just, I can't fix on one thought for longer than anything.

31
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm in such a flagrant state of mind.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,120


33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,280
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,080
What was that?

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,620
I was having trouble focusing.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,260
Focus if you can't take a joke.

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,080
You were kind of there with me or something, you know what I mean?

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,960
Yeah.

39
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,660
Yeah.

40
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,680
Actually, Princess William and I are both a little spaced out.

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,820
And it makes sense that we would have to carry the show on for an extra half hour or so.

42
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,560
Because this is the one show that started with me saying,

43
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,520
we can't wait for this one to end because we've been working all day and we just want to go home and sleep.

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,200
So, of course, Keith calls up and goes,

45
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm not going to be there in time to take over Dr. Sinister's show, so you guys have to keep going.

46
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,180
See how it works.

47
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,920
See how it works.

48
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,320
For the rest of the night or for a brief time?

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,060
Until a crap radio starts.

50
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,500
Until Mr. Keith can call.

51
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,180
Until the crap radio songs?

52
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,500
I can find that.

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,800
I can tell you're not a regular.

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,300
WCSB listener, Dave, out there in Ashtabula.

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,100
I guess.

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,060
Oh, wow.

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:20,340
Well, I used to be until WCSB decided so nicely of it to give the airspace that was bequeathed to it by the Federal Aeronautics Administration and the FDA and CIA.

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,200
And instead they gave it to Reserve.

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,280
They gave it to CRUW.

60
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,220
Or CWRU.

61
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,640
And they.

62
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,340
Well, I can hear them.

63
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,720
But now I can't even go by.

64
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,080
There was a gutter on my house that I could go underneath that and pick up the station.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,800
Yeah, your neighbors used to complain about that.

66
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,580
That's why the FCC changed the law and have the other station have that power because of you in the gutter.

67
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,060
No, that was the.

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,120
They were report.

69
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,940
You were reported many times.

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,560
I think that was the patrol boys or some some auxiliary police force.

71
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,860
I don't think it was the CIA.

72
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,640
I don't think it was the CIA or anybody.

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,120
Any of those alphabet groups.

74
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,420
You don't think it was.

75
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,580
I don't either.

76
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,060
Oh, Bobbo, the predecessor.

77
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:07,860
Bobbo.

78
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,580
Bobbo.

79
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,320
Oh, Bobbo.

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Not Bobbo.

81
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,080
Oh, Bobbo.

82
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,040
The predecessor.

83
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,280
As in, thanks, Oh, Bobbo.

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,520
Yeah.

85
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,080
Yeah.

86
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,440
I know what you mean.

87
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,500
You know, I feel the same way.

88
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:28,040
I don't know which way exactly that is, but I certainly commiserate with you and everything you've done over the last 25 years.

89
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,180
I think it's been a great.

90
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,400
What?

91
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:37,940
Great help to mankind and all of the people there in humans and the nonhumans alike.

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,960
I think really, really.

93
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,800
I think he's just saying that because he thinks Oh, Bobbo is listening and he might be.

94
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
Oh, what if I actually go?

95
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,220
Bobbo is great.

96
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,080
Like a tiller, the hunter or something.

97
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,220
Well, then you'll get a free Oh, Bobbo phone.

98
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,340
Oh, yeah.

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,700
I read and I read.

100
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,840
I'm a poor person and I don't want.

101
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,160
That's right.

102
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,260
I read that on the Internet.

103
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,880
I don't want to eat food either.

104
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,600
Or, you know.

105
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,180
Right.

106
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,320
I read that on the Internet that people the only reason people vote for Oh, Bobbo.

107
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,240
The predecessor is because he gives them free phones and he promises they'll never, ever have to work.

108
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,440
And of course, all Oh, Bobbo knots don't want to work at anything.

109
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,540
Yeah.

110
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:26,540


111
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,020
That's not a coarse form of laughter.

112
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,780
It's more like the kind of lunatic giddiness to it.

113
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,280
You know, the.

114
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,920
It's a funny sound show again.

115
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,520
We have to stop meeting like this.

116
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,560
Compadres.

117
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,680
Why?

118
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,480
Why?

119
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,480
I think that's obvious.

120
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,000
People who.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,840
You're not.

122
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,380
If you are trying to recover from being some sort of insane patient or something, you've

123
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,100
been treated before for one of many, many diseases now that there are.

124
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,320
Yeah.

125
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,080
And.

126
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,740
Well, you know what I mean?

127
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,560
Hey, hold on.

128
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,340
I.

129
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,980
I.

130
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,200
I.

131
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,200


132
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,240


133
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,780
I.

134
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:26,820
I.

135
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,280
I.

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,160
I.

137
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,160


138
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,160


139
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,420
I.

140
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:28,420


141
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:28,420


142
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:28,560
I.

143
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,560


144
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,560


145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,560


146
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,560

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,560


157
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,700
I.

158
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,960
I.

159
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,340
I.

160
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,340


161
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,340

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,340

194
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,300
pot that one down because I don't know what words.

195
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,080
The.

196
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,620
The.

197
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,880
Rudy Schwartz project.

198
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,380
Yeah.

199
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,360
Yeah.

200
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,280
Said.

201
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:42,960
So.

202
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,040
This is a confusing.

203
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,500
Disc.

204
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,200
It said Rudy Schwartz Project Instrumentals, and obviously that's not all what it was.

205
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,700
Are we safe yet?

206
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,460
That's not everything.

207
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,020
Yeah, because sometimes he launches into some blue stuff.

208
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,160
There was that song about Sarah Palin's juices that was a real favorite of mine.

209
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,540
Oh, one of my favorites, too, though.

210
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:15,340
So just thinking of the idea of Sarah Palin's dribbling juices down upon my side.

211
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:28,960
Actually, if listeners wanted to hear the Sarah Palin, I can't say the whole title of it, but it's a type of juice, and it's by the Rudy Schwartz Project, and it's on YouTube.

212
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,760
And Reverend Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz Project made the video himself, and it's really something to see.

213
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,520
Sarah Palin's.

214
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,340
It's something juice.

215
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:50,660
Is it the one where she can see the Russian tank a bit stuck in front of her house, and the guys come in there and say silly stuff to her?

216
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,980
No, it's not that.

217
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,720
It's a song, and it can't be played on broadcast radio in the United States.

218
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,860
Let's just put it that way.

219
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,800
It was on it.

220
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:07,220
You know, we have to save some stuff for the X-rated hours of slack that are only heard on the Internet.

221
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,520
You have to be careful.

222
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,280
Be careful watching that video because it can put you into a flagrant state of mind.

223
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,920
You don't want that, Dave.

224
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,660
Flagrant.

225
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,460
And especially from a small whittlings of wood comes a mighty forest of oak trees.

226
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,540
Right.

227
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,560
You know, you've got all these pieces of so-called material.

228
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:37,140
As we like to say in the arts, you've got all your material there, and it's all legally covered in bondage and other things.

229
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,340
You have to go through the case.

230
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:38,780
I'm sure.

231
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,160
But needless to say, it's protected like a conundrum.

232
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,380
I don't know what qualities we're arguing about anymore.

233
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,520
I don't even know if I want to be a Hindu on the side.

234
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,000
Protected like a conundrum?

235
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,460
Huh?

236
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:57,820
Yeah.

237
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,900
Like one of those waxy outcrops.

238
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,780
I thought you were talking about podendrums or something.

239
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,780
Yeah, yeah, podendrums.

240
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,380
There's coffee.

241
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,300
There's coffee.

242
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,420
There's coffee.

243
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,180
Those poor scops.

244
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,680
That's right.

245
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,040
Scopsies.

246
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,900
Yeah.

247
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,780
And poor Dave.

248
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,740
Yeah.

249
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,200
Really.

250
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,940
The things Dave did to himself.

251
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,340
The things he cut off.

252
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,740
Off of the inside of his head.

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,080
Yeah.

254
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,560
Think of all the neural passageways that have been interrupted.

255
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,960
Think of all the neutrinos that have been acid washed.

256
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,640
Neutrinos.

257
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,520
Aren't those subatomic particles that go so far?

258
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,320
Aren't they so fast they travel backwards in time or something?

259
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,080
Aren't they?

260
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,500
They're boring holes through you at light speed all the time?

261
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
Well, yeah.

262
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,900
Not just through me, but also through you, I'm pretty sure, too.

263
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,500
It's everybody.

264
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,020
Right.

265
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,800
Yeah, not just you.

266
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,420
Almost everybody except...

267
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,660
There are selective neutrinos, but not, you know, to that...

268
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:08,420
Well, the Bobion particle is a type of neutrino that passed through the stem of Bob's pod.

269
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,740
Going straight...

270
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,100
Right.

271
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,920
Came through the back of his neck and then into the stem of the pipe and then up out of the pipe.

272
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,920
And then back again the same way.

273
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,980
And that's how all of this started.

274
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,260
That's how we ended up here doing this.

275
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,700
Wow.

276
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,440
At this moment.

277
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,140
Right where we are sitting now.

278
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,660
A collection of tubes coming out of Bob's pipe and into his head and back.

279
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
And that's pretty much all it is.

280
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,660
A neutrino taking that path.

281
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,220
Well, it's got to, you know, have...

282
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,900
A medium to travel on.

283
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,560
You know, that's what I thought you were talking about.

284
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,220
Well, it slows down when it hits Bob.

285
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,760
That's the only thing that can slow down a neutrino.

286
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,880
Or a Bobion.

287
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,360
That's the thing that is.

288
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,020
It's Bob's face and head.

289
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,560
These are like stones, mud and stuff.

290
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,600
What's the word?

291
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,680
And like, man, it's like the hardest thing there is.

292
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm the softest thing there is right now.

293
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,200
Because I had to do so much hard lifting, heavy weighting.

294
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,520
And I'm a little bit of a laborer.

295
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,260
Now I'm all soft and weak.

296
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,220
And wimpy and floppy.

297
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,840
Soggy.

298
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,940
I completely understand.

299
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,360
It's soggy everywhere.

300
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,480
And I have very flaccid shoes.

301
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,900
I have the kind the Eskimos wear in the summer.

302
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,100
Which is infrequently, you know, if you know what I mean.

303
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,700
Yeah.

304
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,080
And my arches are doubling up.

305
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
Oh, at least you have arches.

306
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,120
You mean yours have fallen?

307
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,200
I never had any to begin with.

308
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,520
And that's why I didn't.

309
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,400
Oh, you great cathedral that then ran to the Sunday.

310
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,200
These flat feet of mine kept me out of Vietnam.

311
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,300
They really did.

312
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,580
That's a good thing you did.

313
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,140
I was signing up, man.

314
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,640
I was pounding on the door.

315
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,480
The recruitment office going, let me in.

316
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,120
I want to kill.

317
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:56,800
I want to kill.

318
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,360
Blood veins in my teeth and all that.

319
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,680
And they went, sir, Mr. Stang.

320
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,700
I was still just a mister then.

321
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,180
You're not good enough for the people.

322
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,800
The army because of your feet.

323
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,520
And, you know, I've been on those little pups and pups all day and they're they're barking

324
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,340
and aching.

325
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,860
Pups is barking.

326
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,620
I can understand that.

327
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,440
Oh, yeah.

328
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,880
Especially if your ankles are touching the ground for crying out loud.

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,760
I know what you mean.

330
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,600
In fact, in fact, Princess, we and I made a important decision today.

331
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,660
We decided that rather than have a few set, a couple of subgeniuses help us move all this

332
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,100
stuff from this house to this other house.

333
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,160


334
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,760
We're going to call a moving company.

335
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,140
We decided that as well.

336
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,820
It's not our money.

337
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,040
See, it's it's it's the Queen Mom's money.

338
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,260
We naturally tend to think we better do everything ourselves.

339
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:02,520
But after doing about half of it ourselves, I started to think twice because my my flat

340
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,080
feet became convex.

341
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,160
They they they became hunched.

342
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,300
They became hunched feet.

343
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,480
And Princess Wheel.

344
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,860
Well, it's true.

345
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,540
I started bleeding spontaneously right here in the in the radio station.

346
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,340
He speaks truth.

347
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:19,820
Yeah.

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,740
As soon as the show started, my my knee bled like stigmata.

349
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,580
Yeah, I couldn't.

350
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,200
There was no explanation for it.

351
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,180
And I've left a bloody I left a bloody Kleenex here for Dr. Sinister.

352
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,460
But he's not going to be here now.

353
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,480
Oh, man.

354
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
You can't gross out.

355
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,880
I'm not going to talk about Dr. Sinister tonight, dear.

356
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,320
Yeah.

357
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,200
So that beautiful story ended in this in sadness.

358
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,920
Tragic, chagrin.

359
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,340
Yes.

360
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,840
Yeah.

361
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,400
So, yes, scabby.

362
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,740
Just call me scabby.

363
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,640
I remember old scabby.

364
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
Poor old scabby.

365
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,160
Scabby days.

366
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,880
Yeah.

367
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,900
Yeah.

368
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,180
I'm sorry.

369
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,400
I was talking about the Popular Mechanics article with the nudist colony ad.

370
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,000
Do you remember that?

371
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,340
Pardon?

372
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,780
No, I don't remember.

373
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
I thought sure you were the one who mentioned this to me the other night at the party.

374
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,420
I thought when we were talking about the unmentionable part of the party, you mentioned that.

375
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:31,260
And I told Senator Gawler and Congressman Frizzler that he got the best we can do right now.

376
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,680
Okay, okay.

377
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,760
Yeah, yeah.

378
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,420
Yeah, right.

379
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,080
Okay.

380
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,220
Yeah.

381
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,240
What else?

382
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,100
Yeah.

383
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,360
Yeah.

384
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,160
Well, when the Franks invade Europe, we're all going to be in a heap of doo-doo.

385
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,540
Well, we're going to be in between two heavy buns when the Franks invade.

386
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,260
Wait a minute.

387
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,320
We're going to go invade the Franks, aren't we?

388
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,940
Well, you're talking about going to some pool party or something.

389
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,800
Is that what you mean?

390
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,560
Right.

391
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:05,940
Right.

392
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,920
Yeah, but next week we'll still be doing a show.

393
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,020
Next week will be the same old drill, strangely enough.

394
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:24,480
And then after that, it'll be canned hour of Slack shows from X-Day all the way down for about two weeks.

395
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,540
Some of them are really good.

396
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,020
Some of them, there's one that's like inside jokes from one end to the other.

397
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,380
And I know the listeners, they'll catch on to which one it is.

398
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,240
And they'll go, this must be the one he was talking about that was really inside jokes.

399
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,740
I might as well just turn this off because I won't get any of them.

400
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,860
In fact, that could be the introduction for that show.

401
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,900
Because I kind of need to cut some of it up.

402
00:15:51,980 --> 00:16:00,020
I talked about Philo's divorce and mine and the real names of people and Monster High endlessly.

403
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,760
Real people.

404
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,440
Yeah.

405
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,400
When you were back when you were a farmer back in Iowa, I think, wasn't you from the, isn't it?

406
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:19,800
So let this serve as an introduction to that particularly incite-y hour of Slack recorded at Wisteria on July 1st.

407
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,800
But it was the second hour we did that day, you see.

408
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,560
Ah.

409
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,780
And you even hear me realize that the cookie has come on.

410
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,140
Thank you.

411
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,700
Thank you.

412
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,180
Thank you for continuing to hold.

413
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,100
Hammered that one out.

414
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,340
It's.

415
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,680
Not much as could be.

416
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,240
So now we're through with the hour of Slack.

417
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,120
What's happening now?

418
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,260
Well, no, no, Hal.

419
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,260
An hour of Slack is just starting right now.

420
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,120
Oh, boy.

421
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:53,420
A smorgasbord of exciting events will proceed directly from this spot through the magic of audio.

422
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,520
Well, it hasn't proceeded right because when I said that, I was expecting monster movie music to swell.

423
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,520
To come crashing on.

424
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,500
Thank you for continuing to hold.

425
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,260
But it was very low volume monster movie music.

426
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,280
Well, you're telling me.

427
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,460
You're the one with the earphones.

428
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,740
There's above average wait times at this moment.

429
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,240
Please continue to hold.

430
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,420
And your hour of Slack will be available shortly.

431
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,120
If you are of average wait, please continue to hold.

432
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,820
Independence Day, 1996, which was.

433
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,160
Okay.

434
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,100
Incidentally.

435
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,900
That's a pink holiday.

436
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,280
Hit theaters on July 5th in 1998.

437
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,560
Coincidence or conspiracy?

438
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,880
It was the movie Deep Impact that hit on July 5th, 1998.

439
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,920
Another coincidental conspiracy.

440
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,460
And the year before, I think, 97, was it Armageddon?

441
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,880
An Armageddon.

442
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,720
Every year.

443
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:36,780
Every year.

444
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:43,240
What's the big movie this July 5th to get the conspiracy people to ignore us?

445
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,980
And every July, there's a big movie where the humans win and the aliens lose.

446
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,640
People like that sort of fiction.

447
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,500
Which one is it this time?

448
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,680
I wasn't paying attention.

449
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,440
Huh?

450
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,860
I wasn't paying attention.

451
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:05,620
What is the big summer movie where you're supposed to watch instead of going to X Day?

452
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:05,960
Right.

453
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,540
It would open this week.

454
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,180
Yes.

455
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,620
I don't know.

456
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,220
It's Tugboat Annie meets Guts.

457
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,820
I am so proud that when we asked that question, not a single person pulled out an iPhone and

458
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,840
started poking.

459
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,620
Of course, it's true that we don't have that good of Wi-Fi, but I'm proud of you subgeniuses

460
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,320
for not Googling that the minute we asked.

461
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,280
If thy iPhone offend me, pluck it out.

462
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:32,740
Thank you.

463
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,160
Ah, yes.

464
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:33,860
Yes.

465
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,280
Okay.

466
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

467
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,320
Please continue to hold.

468
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,280
I need to say I'm sorry for Dave.

469
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:39,820
I'm sorry.

470
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm sorry.

471
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,500
We apologize for this delay.

472
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:52,380
Actually, I need to save Dave by sending him his phone money, and I'm saying that in a

473
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,380


474
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,460
So now you can do it now that you're all right with the computer god and everything?

475
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,660
We're not quite all right.

476
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,420
It's up to Nicky Deathcheck.

477
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,720
The kids are all right.

478
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,800
Everything's a very good thing.

479
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


480
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


481
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


482
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


483
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


484
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


485
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


486
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


487
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


488
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


489
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


490
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


491
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


492
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:03,800


493
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,640
I'm asking them what they can do to win this Caucus T אם.

494
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:15,200
So we have insecure headphones.

495
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,540
It's like an

496
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,660
Why don't I appreciate it.

497
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:16,800
Do you think some pre runtime waiting makes sense?

498
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:16,860
Not really.

499
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,320
Danny Pily became a complete weird guy, and that's why I didn't hyper Advisory have language

500
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,420
impacting Out of the Sen like this.

501
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,780
I thought we would almost all but it be no interest to Harry, who though, aspirations

502
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,180
forungs all挫

503
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,780
ciao.

504
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:40,660
Second hour of Slack recorded at beautiful Wisteria in the year the conspiracy calls 2014.

505
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,380
Which could be 1998.

506
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,280
We're hoping it will be.

507
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:54,480
And the conspiracy also predicted on their AccuWeather.com or whatever it was that there would be thunderstorms and lightning.

508
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,260
Do you see any thunderstorms and lightning?

509
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,240
I think they were simply trying to warn people away from coming here.

510
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,040
Trying to scare us.

511
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,760
Having one hell of a time.

512
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,080
That backfires.

513
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,280
Yes, exactly.

514
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,700
Now there have been times when lightning struck right out there while we were doing the show.

515
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,600
And it even seemed to travel down the hill to the grotto.

516
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,440
To the grindhouse.

517
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,440
Cue 2012 lightning strike at hour of Slack.

518
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,480
Yes, we put these effects in in post.

519
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,580
That's the second time we'll do that this week.

520
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:34,660
You'll hear it.

521
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:34,960
Yeah, right.

522
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,680
It'll be on the soundtrack.

523
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,420
Right there.

524
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,760
Boy, it's this great sound.

525
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,480
It was such a fabulous sound.

526
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,260
The pristine recording.

527
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,340
It sounds like stereo, but it's not.

528
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:52,500
The roar rather than the laughter of heaven from an irate Jove who's had just about as much as he can take.

529
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,460
It even managed to shut up G. Gordon Gordon, Dr. Hal, and me.

530
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,300
Yes, that was a moment of stunned silence.

531
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,240
A moment of silence.

532
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,660
They really topped the topper that time.

533
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:11,700
And then I never saw a human run as fast as Fight C. Tosh down to where the lightning had struck,

534
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,840
which was all of his electronic equipment for the grindhouse.

535
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,980
Fused into blobs of slag.

536
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,760
Lucky he had backup.

537
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,740
No, he actually took a little scalpel out and he carved the slag apart and just recreated it.

538
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,380
I thought he had a genuine Benjamin Franklin lightning.

539
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,400
He was a real lightning rod down there.

540
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,880
Um, sort of.

541
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,920
There was a lightning strike at the other campground, which was really crowded.

542
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:46,680
It was right in the middle of Starwood and it hit a metal pole that was embedded in the ground.

543
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,340
And there were all these merchants up and down the road around that pole.

544
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,460
And the ones that were barefoot got knocked out unconscious.

545
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:01,020
Nobody was really injured, but a lot of them got quite a buzz.

546
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:08,100
And Bleepo's girlfriend at the time, who was one of the people who got knocked out, she was small and barefoot.

547
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,420
She said, later I said, how are you feeling?

548
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:17,400
She goes, I feel like I've had this one set of batteries my whole life and they've just been changed.

549
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,580
Recharged.

550
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:25,200
Also, she was having trouble doing the math for her t-shirt shop and had to get a calculator.

551
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,800
Yeah, it does kind of play Hob with the interior calculator.

552
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,000
But like Frankenstein's monster, you can't.

553
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,900
You could be charged or you could be blasted like a tree stump.

554
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,920
You see that you can never tell.

555
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,020
You can't arrange it to your liking.

556
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,740
Once again, it's in the lap of a god.

557
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,620
How come lightning kills some people and makes others immortal?

558
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Oh, it only makes dead people immortal. That's right.

559
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,680
Also, lightning seems to fall from heaven as a thunderbolt hurled from Jove.

560
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,460
But it actually rises from the place of the strike to heaven.

561
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,760
So...

562
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,000
So, the...

563
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,240
Lightning's from Satan?

564
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,240
Well, lightning is from you.

565
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,540
Yeah, it comes from underground. It goes up at God.

566
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,740
But Satan's underground.

567
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,860
Right. And God is up in the sky.

568
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,740
That's good. When you see deeble horns just sticking out of the ground.

569
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,900
But mama told me that thunder and lightning was when God was playing bowling in the clouds.

570
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,600
Well...

571
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,720
I was told that too.

572
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,760
God controls Satan, you see. God controls everything.

573
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,320
So, actually, both of those things are right.

574
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,080
You blame him for the whole thing.

575
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,660
Yeah.

576
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,940
I'm mad too, God.

577
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,720
Yes.

578
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,300
We can't blame Bob.

579
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,220
War on God!

580
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,520
Boy, that hasn't been going very well.

581
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,520
It made...

582
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,460
We had a great few speeches in the early years of War on God.

583
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,760
About our war on God?

584
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,420
Yeah, but, you know...

585
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,280
Well, that doesn't mean it's over.

586
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,300
We...

587
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,340
That's about as far as you ever get with that.

588
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,920
Hmm.

589
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,680
Funny how that works.

590
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,300
Yes. Well, I...

591
00:23:52,300 --> 00:24:00,560
And yet, there were people who got angry at us for saying that as if God needed help from a bunch of nerds like us.

592
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,460
Like...

593
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,800
I just don't get that.

594
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,160
You know?

595
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,780
I mean...

596
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,400
Some people are just never satisfied, Stan.

597
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:16,660
So God was offended by subgenius humor, so you have to help him get even because he can't do it himself?

598
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,480
That's a pretty wimpy God, if you ask me.

599
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:26,020
They're toadies, you know, like tattletales, people who run the slide projector.

600
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,860
Jesus, Jesus, they said horrible things about you, Jesus.

601
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,540
Don't get personal.

602
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,400
Jesus, I heard him.

603
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,960
I heard Mr. Stang, and he said some really horrible things about you and the whole Holy Trinity all in one.

604
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,680
Hey, how many people in this stadium were the AV kid at school?

605
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,560
Raise your hand.

606
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,940
There you go.

607
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,660
Look at that.

608
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,640
Man, it must be at least a fifth of the entire audience.

609
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,100
Well, you know, I'm speaking in an affectionate way.

610
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:58,700
I appear to be reprimanding and scolding, but this is all part of humor.

611
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,260
I still am.

612
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,480
Nerd.

613
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,860
Well, Suds is the other AV guy.

614
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,660
He's doing it right now.

615
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,020
No, he's just the A guy.

616
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,260
He's not the V guy.

617
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,400
He's running the AV right here.

618
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,340
He says he digs the V.

619
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,580
He's more of an A than a V.

620
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,400
It's the Suds theme.

621
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,440
Oh, it ended.

622
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,160
V for victory.

623
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,260
Oh, well.

624
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,680
Oh, well.

625
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,300
Yeah, but the AV guy in my day was 16 millimeter projectors and...

626
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,180
Slideshows that went with a record.

627
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,180
I suppose I should raise my hand in that context.

628
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,600
Yeah, I would think so.

629
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,520
But you knew that I operated those devices.

630
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,240
Well, yeah, we both have FCC licenses, I bet.

631
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,160
Or do you?

632
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,000
I do have it, although I don't have my wallet with me.

633
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,520
But I do have my radio broadcaster's license in my frickin' wallet.

634
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,540
Well, boy, we'd get in trouble if you didn't have it on you.

635
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah.

636
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,600
Well...

637
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,180
But I got it.

638
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,400
I think my...

639
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,320
And you know what, folks?

640
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,080
It's free.

641
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,280
You can write for one and just ask for one.

642
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,540
And the feds will send you a broadcast license.

643
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,160
That's how I got mine.

644
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,840
They assume that if you ask for it, you already know enough to have one awarded.

645
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,060
Do it now before they change it.

646
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,920
I seriously am surprised that you don't have to have a license to have a website yet.

647
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,540
When they think of it...

648
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,380
The day that I understood what the World Wide Web was, I thought, I better do it.

649
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:29,380


650
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm gonna take advantage of this while it's an outlawed Wild West, because they're going

651
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,780
to regulate this like television and radio, and it won't be the same ever again.

652
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,680
And it won't be for...

653
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,920
There'll be an underground of, like, ham radio, whatever, pirate broadcasting types using...

654
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,520
Hey...

655
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,900
The underground internet or Usenet or something, like I still...

656
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,460
The Umbernet.

657
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,240
The Unternet, yeah.

658
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,800
The Unternet.

659
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,780
Worse than the InfraNet.

660
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,440
Or the Ubernet.

661
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,000
They...

662
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,360
They...

663
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,480
You're not supposed to know about the Ubernet.

664
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,200
That's only for the 1%.

665
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,060
The 1% of what?

666
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,440
The 1% of owners of stuff.

667
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,600
Oh, oh.

668
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:10,660
Stuff.

669
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,260
Well...

670
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,560
Their internet has 3D feel-a-vision porno.

671
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,060
I don't know how I feel about that.

672
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,360
No pun intended.

673
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:19,780
Well, you wouldn't know.

674
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,200
You probably will never find out, because you and me aren't gonna be in the dome.

675
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,440
You know that, right?

676
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:26,920
Yeah, that's true.

677
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,160
I mean, we'll be on the saucers.

678
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,180
But...

679
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,340
But...

680
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


681
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


682
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


683
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


684
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


685
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


686
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


687
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


688
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


689
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


690
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


691
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,340


692
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,320
I've gotten to the point...

693
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,780
Where the saucers not show up for some reason.

694
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,400
I'm so sure...

695
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,520
And the dome goes up.

696
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:34,700
Yeah.

697
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,060
There's gonna be those who are in the dome.

698
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,860
John Shirley used to ask me this.

699
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,640
He actually asked me this seriously.

700
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,200
He said, this was like 20 years ago, saying, are you gonna be in the dome or outside the

701
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,380
dome?

702
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,400
And I honestly...

703
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,040
Was doing research.

704
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,780
I was so naive.

705
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,660
And the church was, had a...

706
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,600
Was more new and fresh and famous here then.

707
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,200
And I said, yes, I'll be in the dome.

708
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,740
God, what a dome.

709
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,300
You're reading a book.

710
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,840
You're either in the dome or you're out of the dome.

711
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:01,840
Dude.

712
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,780
You're either on the bus or off the bus.

713
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,880
You're gonna be those guys clawing at the outside of the dome.

714
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,540
The Sardau's dudes laugh at.

715
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,580
Yeah.

716
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,380
It's the way it is.

717
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,140
They'll laugh at you.

718
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,680
They'll laugh.

719
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:21,140
I can't believe that I ever was so vain as to think I would end up inside the dome.

720
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,440
You probably thought this show was about you.

721
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,940
But Bob.

722
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,900
Bob will be in the dome.

723
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,100
Oh, Bob.

724
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,280
Bob won't need the dome.

725
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,860
And neither will we.

726
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,380
In theory, we'll be in a much better place.

727
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,660
We can build our own domes and have our own robot slaves clawing at the dome outside.

728
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,360
The rest of us will be sitting outside the dome and be so poor that we have to wank off

729
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,560
to animated GIFs instead of real videos of porn.

730
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,800
There's a South Park where that happens.

731
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,140
Some of those animations aren't too bad.

732
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,260
No, they're great if used as your icon on your, you know, as your face.

733
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,860
Right.

734
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,420
I've run into people leaving comments on Yahoo News articles using a Dobbs head.

735
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,740
Instead of a little snickering, sneering, smiley face?

736
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,420
Yeah.

737
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,760
And so far, it's all been libtards that use the Dobbs head.

738
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,860
Wouldn't you know it?

739
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,180
Well, you know, I wouldn't be surprised either way.

740
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,440
Socialism.

741
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,700
Oh, no.

742
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:26,340
He works, Bob works every form of capitalism.

743
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,240
Bob is in the dome.

744
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,540
He's everywhere.

745
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,600
Or lull socialism.

746
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,480
I guess.

747
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,060
Lull socialism.

748
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,260
If communism took over, he'd be the commissar of something.

749
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,580
Don't turn around.

750
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:38,580


751
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,760
Uh-oh.

752
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,620
Did you bring your special papers down with you?

753
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,520
Which?

754
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,960
Like those?

755
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,440
No.

756
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,940
Oh, well, too bad.

757
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,420
No.

758
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,840
Yeah, we need those documents.

759
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,580
We need to be papered, actually.

760
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,520
We, uh...

761
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,040
I don't know if anyone around has the...

762
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,360
Do you have copies of those documents?

763
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,680
Up at the cabin.

764
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,820
Not here.

765
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,960
No, no, no, no, no.

766
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,840
Suds, do you have any copies of documents that you might have on your person?

767
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,200
On microfiche or tunafiche or...

768
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,280
Do you have any copies of documents like that?

769
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:17,940
They don't have to be exactly...

770
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,040
Oh, Princess Wee has those.

771
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,360
She rolls oregano up in the...

772
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,000
She won a contest for that last year.

773
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,020
Yeah.

774
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,400
It doesn't have to be this particular brand, but I think...

775
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,500
I think that's...

776
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:26,500


777
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,300
I think we might have some documents either in...

778
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,920
Do you have any on your person?

779
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,420
I have an embarrassing lack of papering.

780
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,400
Princess Wee uses those things for something.

781
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,340
I don't...

782
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,340
I don't have any in my bag, but check...

783
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,580
Oh, well, who cares?

784
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,780
Just an idea.

785
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,040
I made an error.

786
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,400
You'd think there'd be a pipe around here, wouldn't you?

787
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,240
A peep.

788
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,100
There are.

789
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,040
Sud Spishaw is seeking out documents.

790
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,140
He's lost the end of his already, but that one's plastic.

791
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,740
He will...

792
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,540
I believe he has some documents.

793
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,680
Bob has the kind of pipes that you smoke the pipe.

794
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,700
You don't smoke what's inside the pipe.

795
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,040
The pipe itself catches on fire.

796
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,380
Reverend Two Beans is here.

797
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,660
And you suck the...

798
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,040
You actually suck the burning plastic of the pipe.

799
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,420
Well, that's what I was afraid of.

800
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,380
And that's what gets you high.

801
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,000
Those phthalates.

802
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,880
That's what Bob smokes.

803
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,820
People are always going,

804
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,260
Yeah, but that's marijuana.

805
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,100
I ate it.

806
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,560
No, no.

807
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,780
It's the pipe itself.

808
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,620
The phthalates.

809
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,760
I think...

810
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,120
Well, beans are...

811
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,920
Too plastic, man.

812
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,600
I just made it up.

813
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,120
A ball pipe, and then I believe...

814
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,800
That's not true.

815
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,260
I do believe Sud Spishaw went looking for documents.

816
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,540
Well, he's a good fella.

817
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,880
I'm just gibbering and jabbering up here.

818
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,540
I didn't mean he had to stir his stumps and go get some, but...

819
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:36,860
You guys are shameful.

820
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,100
What are you...

821
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,660
What do you mean?

822
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,420
I'm a nice person.

823
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,000
How is it that you...

824
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,440
That I'm to take that remark?

825
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,800
Could you perhaps elucidate what you just uttered?

826
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,640
Well, let me put it this way.

827
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,540
Hey, man.

828
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,800
Got any hay?

829
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,920
We tell people not to park.

830
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,500
Can I...

831
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,880
Is anybody selling hay out here, dude?

832
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,240
No, no, no.

833
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,500
I don't want your straw.

834
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,160
Keep off that straw.

835
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,600
A mother load of greener fodder are coming.

836
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,900
You and your straw.

837
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,760
You straw pusher.

838
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,060
Just setting up a straw man to knock him down.

839
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,980
You keep off of that straw, beans.

840
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,780
The thing about...

841
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,200
You shouldn't put your V-hickle on the hay because it might poot out some...

842
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,540
No, no, no.

843
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,620
...oil or something.

844
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,600
That's just slang terms.

845
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,280
It's all...

846
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,180
That's all those...

847
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,680
Those...

848
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,720
The hip kids.

849
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,600
They're talking about vehicles and straw.

850
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,280
That's just...

851
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,420
That's just slang terms.

852
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,840
I was there when...

853
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,800
You mean they're really talking about drugs?

854
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,700
...Baby Bear had to drive...

855
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,680
Oh, is that what you guys are talking about?

856
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,020
I'm sorry.

857
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,460
I completely misunderstood the whole conversation.

858
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,280
What are we supposed to be talking about?

859
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,460
We're supposed to be keeping off the straw, man.

860
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,720
Oh, man.

861
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,700
I understand.

862
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,100
It's...

863
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,220
Oh, thank you very much.

864
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,180
You're talking about some kind of youth drugs, right?

865
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,860
You have to explain this kind of thing to me.

866
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,560
I'm not up on...

867
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,300
The straw is hardcore stuff.

868
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,820
...what kind of crazy things kids are...

869
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,320
...shoving into their arm veins now to get high.

870
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,060
No.

871
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,680
I wouldn't know.

872
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,620
I wouldn't be the kind of person to ask about that.

873
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,000
Do I look like somebody...

874
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,420
But here's the thing.

875
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,580
...running around smoking dope?

876
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,220
Why couldn't you figure this out?

877
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,260
You have a vehicle that makes you move.

878
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,760
The straw makes you move.

879
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,120
Don't take your drive, your vehicle that you drive,

880
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,580
don't take your drive to the straw, man.

881
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,820
Don't let the straw drive you crazy.

882
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,800
And if you put your vehicle on the straw, you might sink.

883
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,440
You might sink down into depression because you've been on the straw, man.

884
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,400
Don't you get it, man?

885
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,860
Oh, there was an old soldier...

886
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,080
China?

887
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,500
...he had a woody leg, and he had no tobacco, no tobacco, did he beg?

888
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,180
He said, I, old soldier, will give me a jaw.

889
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,480
Said, he, young fella, I'll be damned if I do.

890
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,200
Sorry about that.

891
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,620
You're on so far.

892
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,160
Yes, I ain't got no legs.

893
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,480
Help me, somebody.

894
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,020
My legs are on far.

895
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:45,880
Yes.

896
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,880
It makes me cry to hear those old hymns like that.

897
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,840
Yes, yes.

898
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,580
Certainly the glow...

899
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,960
...of nostalgia perfuses those ramblings and rantings.

900
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,880
All you had to do for material was listen to the car radio, the Christian channels,

901
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,060
especially in Dallas for a little while.

902
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,940
And, boy, we had Kay Sky, voice of the gospel.

903
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,180
My friends, I have sinned.

904
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,300
I imitate preachers on that station every day of my life.

905
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,940
And it took.

906
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,260
Ah, yes.

907
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,540
Yes, it had an effect.

908
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,800
There is...

909
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,780
There's another one of the streams of the genesis of subgenius.

910
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,660
What would we do without Jimmy Swaggart?

911
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,980
What a name.

912
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,960
Yeah.

913
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,080
Yeah, and his blubbery full-screen confession.

914
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,060
Oh, I had...

915
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,560
With the makeup and the tears running.

916
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,740
Yes, Suds had that on last night on the big speakers.

917
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,120
I ran that on Hour of Slack about a month ago.

918
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:47,980
Yeah.

919
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,760
Classic moments.

920
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,720
The panting antics, whoever they were.

921
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,680
If Swaggart had done that rant with...

922
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,120
With that music in the background,

923
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,200
he could have started a whole new religion.

924
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,360
I got stuck with Falwell growing up.

925
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,800
Oh, no.

926
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,840
But that's...

927
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,260
Didn't he die?

928
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,700
That's like listening to Arnold Stang instead of Mick Jagger.

929
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,700
It's really, yeah.

930
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,540
Falwell's not a lot of fun to listen to.

931
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,680
He's sort of kind of...

932
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,480
He's just a blubbering guy that just talks.

933
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:18,900
Yeah, he kind of drowned.

934
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,080
Oily, oozing, oleaginous.

935
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,160
Yeah, Swaggart.

936
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,660
Man, he'd have me down...

937
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,480
Down on my knees begging forgiveness from Jesus

938
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,640
every time I watched him.

939
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,540
Well, there's a seeker born every minute.

940
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,360
And as soon as it cut to a commercial, I'd be,

941
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,500
oh, wow, man, that guy's good.

942
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,600
Just like when Dan Close took acid

943
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,920
and read every Jack Chick track that he had.

944
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,760
He was a Christian by morning,

945
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,920
but fortunately the drugs wore off.

946
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,660
Right, yeah.

947
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,020
Oh, that's happened to me many, many times.

948
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,240
I've been a believer in all manner of new age,

949
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,220
dopey stuff, parapsychology stuff.

950
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,900
The 100th monkey and the 100th monkey's 100th parasite.

951
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,360
The 100th Manson, the 100th Hitler.

952
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,820
All of those.

953
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,640
You named some stupid thing and I believed in it,

954
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,540
but I always came back to Bob.

955
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,920
That tells you something about stupid now, don't it?

956
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,840
Yeah.

957
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,620
The stupidest.

958
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,820
But the stupider it looks, the more important it probably is.

959
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,220
The more important it probably is.

960
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,040
Yes, the little boy in the back there.

961
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,740
He's serving as an example for your discussion.

962
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,100
This campground is full of them,

963
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,500
and I consider myself among their ranks.

964
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,960
Because, friends, I am, unlike Bob,

965
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,600
I am the kind of person I'm preaching to.

966
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,760
A bad employee, a lazy slacker.

967
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,440
Bad employee.

968
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
And an asshole boss.

969
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,380
Bad employee.

970
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,220
Anybody who's self-employed.

971
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,600
There you go.

972
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,960
Anyone who's self-employed has a fool for a boss, they say.

973
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,100
I've not.

974
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,660
I thought about that.

975
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,900
I'm a horrible boss and I'm a boss.

976
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,500
How good are you at bossing yourself?

977
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,940
Well, if you ever become self-employed,

978
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,860
you'll know what it's like to work under you.

979
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,840
And you won't be pissed off.

980
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,880
You'll spend every spare second on Facebook or doing something else.

981
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,200
Complaining about that slave driver part of your personality.

982
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,560
I do that now.

983
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,260
But the problem is when you're self-employed,

984
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,280
you're not paid by the hour anymore.

985
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,540
I'm not sure what you're paid by.

986
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,680
You're not paid by J.R. Bob Dobbs either.

987
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,700
I have to write myself a check from myself.

988
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,260
By each agon of discomfort that you feel

989
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:44,580
and each drop of blood-infused sweat that you excrete.

990
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,620
That's right, ma'am.

991
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,820
We have four days and we don't have to worry about this.

992
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,580
Well, there is that.

993
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,320
I mean, have you given up hope?

994
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,220
However, habit is...

995
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,260
No, no, not at all.

996
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,700
...a very strong thing.

997
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,900
Well, you know, we have bad habits.

998
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,680
Exactly.

999
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,160
You know the world's going to end,

1000
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,500
and yet you still go ahead and pay off that credit card.

1001
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,420
I feel like a sap.

1002
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,400
You go through the motions.

1003
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,440
I feel like such a jerk when I do that.

1004
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,420
I pay my bills.

1005
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,620
It won't matter one way or the other.

1006
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,440
Well, this is true.

1007
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,620
It's just ridiculous.

1008
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,520
But you feel better by following the dictates of routine.

1009
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,440
And if you're a neurotic,

1010
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,120
you have to follow the dictates of routine.

1011
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,280
If you count the steps every time you run out of your house,

1012
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,460
if you run out someday without counting them,

1013
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,280
even if you're late,

1014
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,540
if you're a neurotic,

1015
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,400
you have to turn around and go back

1016
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,200
and count those freaking steps

1017
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,240
before you can go on off down the street.

1018
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,820
Now, I'm not saying we're that far advanced into it.

1019
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,960
What about neurotic erotics?

1020
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
What about them?

1021
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,220
In other words,

1022
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,420
unnecessary movements and maneuvers are performed

1023
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,060
instead of only those that are...

1024
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,660
necessary and inspiring?

1025
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,120
Is that the word for it?

1026
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,340
Neurotic erotic?

1027
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:58,920
Yeah.

1028
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,720
I'll have to Google that and see.

1029
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,820
Forget it.

1030
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:02,740
Neurotica.

1031
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,040
Neurotica.

1032
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,880
Just interested.

1033
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,700
Nothing personal.

1034
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,900
No, no, no, no, no.

1035
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,380
I understand.

1036
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:07,720
I understand.

1037
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,640
It wouldn't have anything to do with what happened three days ago.

1038
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,380
Or that Jerry Lewis movie,

1039
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,920
The Playful Proctologist.

1040
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,320
Three days.

1041
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,600
Ago.

1042
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,300
Compulsively.

1043
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,840
Yes.

1044
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,400
No, no, no.

1045
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,000
Nothing to do with that at all.

1046
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,180
There's no...

1047
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,280
You weren't supposed to know about that.

1048
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,020
You're diverting.

1049
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,160
You're diverting into talking about personal matters

1050
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,020
here on the, quote, radio...

1051
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,760
I did not know.

1052
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,600
I'm a thing, remember?

1053
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,820
I'm not talking about anything.

1054
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,360
Let's talk about machines.

1055
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,220
I'm talking utterly hypothetically.

1056
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,400
It's all hypothetical.

1057
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,540
I used to use those,

1058
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,100
but I gave them up just in time.

1059
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,260
What, machines?

1060
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:40,960
A hypothetical.

1061
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,160
Oh, yeah.

1062
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,740
Hypotheticals, yeah.

1063
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,160
You get really hooked on them.

1064
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,660
The refills are bad.

1065
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,640
I will say that.

1066
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,300
The refills on the hypotheticals.

1067
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,880
Yeah, the Jesuitical type of...

1068
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,560
The Jesuitical type of reasoning

1069
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,280
demands the inclusion of hypotheticals,

1070
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,700
which are not to be considered heresy

1071
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,860
when used in an argumentative context.

1072
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,560
So hypothetically...

1073
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,000
So hypothetically,

1074
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,460
we're coming up on the end times.

1075
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,660
All over the end times.

1076
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,380
We're coming all over the end times.

1077
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,640
We're coming all over the end times.

1078
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,880
Pardon me.

1079
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,640
And hypothetically...

1080
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,040
Philo.

1081
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,160
Jeez.

1082
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,560
I'm simply...

1083
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,180
Well, you...

1084
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,120
Channeling Philo.

1085
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,080
He ain't here to defend himself.

1086
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,160
Are you being ornery?

1087
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,720
All's fair in love and war.

1088
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,060
Bob comes again and again.

1089
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,440
He comes.

1090
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,060
You know, Philo is really a great scatologist.

1091
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,720
And one thing that happens where I live out in California

1092
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,560
is every now and then they have these model train shows

1093
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,100
where they set up hundreds of miles of model train track

1094
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,080
in all gauges

1095
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,940
and they have trains running this way and that

1096
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,560
and you can go

1097
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,760
and they also sell all the train stuff

1098
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,040
and puzzling evidence...

1099
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,660
goes there

1100
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,900
and he buys obscene miniature train stuff for Philo

1101
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,480
because he knows Philo loves it.

1102
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,240
Because you can buy tiny outhouses

1103
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,080
with tiny people sitting on the toilet

1104
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,940
with their tiny pants pulled down

1105
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,960
and tiny people having sex

1106
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,220
and tiny artists using a tiny unclothed model.

1107
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,060
All of that is for the most obsessive,

1108
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,840
demented model train layout person.

1109
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,040
And puzzling evidence...

1110
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,680
out of the kindness that he has,

1111
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,900
a bottomless well of,

1112
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,980
knows that what Philo likes the most of all

1113
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,640
is some tiny, exquisitely fashioned,

1114
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,940
crude, dirty joke

1115
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,780
embodied in extruded plastic.

1116
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,200
So that's what he gets.

1117
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,000
His wedding to Chaos McMomacat

1118
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,860
was done on the theme of shit.

1119
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,960
Yeah, they had a brown-themed wedding.

1120
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,800
In fact, before they were married,

1121
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,620
I saw her perform in a number of...

1122
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,180
and fudge done in little rolls

1123
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,660
and it was just...

1124
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,340
and of course lemonade.

1125
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,980
She called me to get his phone number.

1126
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,400
Did you know that, Stang?

1127
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,740
I was the cupid, the broker of that.

1128
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,780
So it's all your fault.

1129
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,980
You pimped Chaos McMomacat to Philo.

1130
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,740
I did.

1131
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,780
Praise Hal.

1132
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,440
Because if it wasn't for that,

1133
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,420
I'd have not a single subgenius

1134
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,140
to play Monster Hunter with online.

1135
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,940
But, thanks to you,

1136
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,280
giving that phone number,

1137
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
there is little Lily Drummond,

1138
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,760
aged seven,

1139
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,040
the only other subgenius,

1140
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,320
ready and willing to help Stangor

1141
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,240
in his video game.

1142
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,620
This example of the rising subgenius generation

1143
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,820
is terrifying

1144
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,840
in her all-inclusive embrace of monsters

1145
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,280
and everything that one would expect

1146
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,820
a stereotypical little girl to shy away from.

1147
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,160
No Barbies for her,

1148
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,780
only,

1149
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,060


1150
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,840
grotesque reptilian, uh...

1151
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,860
Well, you've seen

1152
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,840
the way, what she lives,

1153
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,100
the way she lives, right?

1154
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,900
I'm her little brother.

1155
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,600
I've been, uh,

1156
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,740
I stay at the Drummond's for three weeks every year.

1157
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,340
And, uh,

1158
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,860
I'm the babysitter,

1159
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,720
and really it's the other way around.

1160
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,300
Lily bosses me around like a little brother

1161
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,300
and explains to me how to do stuff right.

1162
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,660
And, uh, yeah, the first time that I went to stay there,

1163
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,120
she looked at me real seriously and said,

1164
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,560
I'm not like most little girls.

1165
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,520
I don't like all pink stuff and kittens.

1166
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,240
I like monsters, especially dragons.

1167
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,820
And, um, so we had a fast friendship.

1168
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,360
Uh, how one's heart flutters.

1169
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,500
I liked little girls.

1170
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,080
Actually, I've got a whole lot of friends,

1171
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,580
really good friends that were little girls and little boys,

1172
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,020
because I often get along quite well with kids.

1173
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,800
So it's very easy for me to slide right back into it.

1174
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,440
Oh, you're just a big kid, Stan.

1175
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,440
You know, it's because their toys are so cool now.

1176
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,160
Man, I used to have so much fun on Christmas Eve doing things like assembling Skeletor's castle.

1177
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,900
So that, you know, the kids would wake up in the morning and there it'd be.

1178
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,360
Well, I got to assemble it.

1179
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,840
You know you can buy toys for yourself as a grown-up.

1180
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,260
If you have the money.

1181
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:25,420
As a matter of fact, Princess Wee and I went to Walmart to seriously scope out which Monster High girl we were going to get.

1182
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,520
How many of you are Monster High fans?

1183
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,320
Any Monster High fans out there?

1184
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,760
She's the only one who even knows what it is.

1185
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:33,980
Have you seen it?

1186
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,840
She's probably outgrown the crowd.

1187
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,200
Okay, good.

1188
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,440
You see Monster High.

1189
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,080
It's this cool show about these cute girls who are monsters.

1190
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,300
He never heard of it before.

1191
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,720
My wife and I went completely nuts.

1192
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,240
And I've seen every single one.

1193
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,500
Every single one of the webisodes.

1194
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:50,860
They're great.

1195
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,760
300 and something webisodes.

1196
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,260
They're well-written.

1197
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,760
They're sensitive.

1198
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,240
They're everything that they should be.

1199
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,360
Yeah, Euchre didn't get into it.

1200
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,080
Echo Bad did.

1201
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:58,900
Yeah.

1202
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,400
I knew that Echo Bad had some of the dots.

1203
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,000
But Echo Bad doesn't even care about the videos.

1204
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:05,560
Right.

1205
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,480
It's more of a collect.

1206
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,620
She just wants to collect the monsters.

1207
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:12,940
Well, Stang, which is your favorite babe from Monster High?

1208
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,820
Is it Frankie?

1209
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,840
Well, Frankie is the one everybody loves the most.

1210
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,240
She's the best.

1211
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,240


1212
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,240


1213
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,240


1214
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,240


1215
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,240


1216
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,240


1217
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,240


1218
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,240


1219
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,480
She's gorgeous.

1220
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,640
But there's always one that fits your fetish a little better.

1221
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,860
And my initial favorite Monster High girl was Ghoulia, who is the special student.

1222
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,820
She's the daughter of the living dead.

1223
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,020
And they're very slow.

1224
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,600
And, in fact, she talks like, uh, uh.

1225
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,420
Draculina is pretty cute.

1226
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,880
I like Draculina a lot.

1227
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,140
But here's the thing about Ghoulia.

1228
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,060
She's also, although she goes, uh, and walks slow, she's the smartest girl.

1229
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,820
And the school can do anything with a computer.

1230
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,540
And she wears glasses.

1231
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,940
And she's a little lopsided.

1232
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,640
So, whereas these are monster girls.

1233
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,740
But, let's face it, they're all really pretty.

1234
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,940
And there's all this stuff about, don't bully people who are weird.

1235
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,800
You know, the whole thing is about, you know, weird is cool.

1236
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,060
Don't be bullies.

1237
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,560
We stop hate.

1238
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,100
But there's only one weird-looking chick, and that's Ghoulia.

1239
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,960
And so, I was.

1240
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,540
It's really hot for Ghoulia for a long time.

1241
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,400
Although, lately, Abby Vomitable, daughter of the Yeti, has been turning me on.

1242
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,740
Because she's big.

1243
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,260
She's tall.

1244
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,840
I like Cleo, too.

1245
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,040
Cleo is very attractive.

1246
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,960
Cleo Denial.

1247
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,400
Cleo Denial, yes.

1248
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:40,460
And we're also advertising this apparently conspiracy show about monster girls.

1249
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,500
But it has a subgenius flavor.

1250
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,920
So, we're totally allowed to.

1251
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,880
It does, in fact, have a very.

1252
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,940
It's for tween-age girls.

1253
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,040
It's a Mattel franchise.

1254
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:59,140
It only exists because they had leftover Bratz bodies they couldn't sell.

1255
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,420
And needed heads to stick on them.

1256
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,480
Well, a lot of great things have been created by accident.

1257
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,520
So, let's not look down on these accidents of birth.

1258
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,360
And, on top of that, whoever is doing that Monster High stuff has some respect and knowledge.

1259
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,980
Here it is.

1260
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,600
They know the monster chops.

1261
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,880
So, they.

1262
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,160
Yeah, and it's classic.

1263
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,060
It's the classic monsters.

1264
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:30,320
Well, one thing that I thought was quite progressive that they did was they caricatured normals as goofy idiots.

1265
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,120
The normies.

1266
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,580
And their animation of the stupid goofing normals is delightful to see.

1267
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:36,940
And the cops.

1268
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,000
The cops, of course.

1269
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,340
But the cops are buffoons in every movie.

1270
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:40,760
Yes.

1271
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,640
That's like this.

1272
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,200
That's classic.

1273
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,800
Princess, we and I decided to join the Monster High online club.

1274
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:47,920
We joined the club.

1275
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:53,140
And so, we started thinking of funny names that would fit, you know.

1276
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,320
I tried Peep Peep Long Stalking.

1277
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,460
Wouldn't take.

1278
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,020
I tried Audrey Tistic.

1279
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,600
Nope.

1280
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,120
I would do Frankie.

1281
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,940
All of your submissions are creepy, though.

1282
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,840
That's why they wouldn't.

1283
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,360
I used Reverend Seek, which is.

1284
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,260
Which is what?

1285
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:25,040
When you get Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, and he takes the really good drugs, he turns into Reverend Seek.

1286
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,200
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, and Reverend Seek.

1287
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,540
And that's.

1288
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,440
But they didn't.

1289
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,060
And so, they let that one get through.

1290
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,400
Well, they were asleep at the switch.

1291
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:34,740
There's another one.

1292
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,420
J. Paul Yeti, which I never used anywhere.

1293
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:38,780
Hmm.

1294
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,780
Well, so there.

1295
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,420
There's the subgenius cast of Monster High.

1296
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,320
I remember one year we were going to do a Deadwood.

1297
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,860
And I remember the script with sub.

1298
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,500
Only it was subgenius up.

1299
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,080
And it was Dobstown instead of Deadwood.

1300
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,700
But it would have required everybody here.

1301
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,780
About 20 people each having this 60-page script.

1302
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,940
Well, I wasn't going to print up 60 copies of it.

1303
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,640
And nobody else brought their copy at all.

1304
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,720
I forgot.

1305
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,600
It would have been a nightmare of people having to cram around the three microphones.

1306
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,220
Philo was going to be.

1307
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,780
What's his name?

1308
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,780
The hero.

1309
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,940
The cool guy.

1310
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,940
My hero.

1311
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:23,640
Swearingen.

1312
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:23,880
Yeah.

1313
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,020
Al Swearingen.

1314
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,400
The great Al Swearingen.

1315
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,500
That guy is my mentor.

1316
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,660
I wanted.

1317
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,900
Everybody wants to be Al.

1318
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,480
But Philo was the one who turned me on to Deadwood.

1319
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,320
So, I let him do it.

1320
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,440
And I was going to be Doc Cochran.

1321
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,360
Because I can do a fairly good.

1322
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,620
What's his name?

1323
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,040
Boy.

1324
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,220
Boy.

1325
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,300
I think that cookie I ate just now.

1326
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,900
I guess that's.

1327
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,280
I guess that's.

1328
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,180
I couldn't remember.

1329
00:49:54,180 --> 00:50:01,100
I couldn't remember Brad Dorff's name.

1330
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,760
The actor, Brad Dorff.

1331
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,580
And I realized, okay, I ate too much sugar.

1332
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,140
I'm having a sugar rush.

1333
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,120
I can't remember anything.

1334
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,020
Oh, I thought you were talking about that girl, Cookie.

1335
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,400
No.

1336
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,240
No.

1337
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,220
She came on to you.

1338
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,580
A moment of silence for Cookie.

1339
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:17,580


1340
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:17,580


1341
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,240
cookie. Okay, that's enough.

1342
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,560
And a moment of silence

1343
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,740
for scabby days.

1344
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:23,680
Okay.

1345
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,980
Everybody's, you know...

1346
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,400
Those are quick moments. Yeah.

1347
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,560
Well, it's radio. You don't want to have a moment

1348
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,780
of silence, a very long moment of silence

1349
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,480
on the radio. No, those are called dead air.

1350
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,600
Everything is scoped now

1351
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,640
dead, you know, so that it's

1352
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,540
scoped and done and configured within the format

1353
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,460
on there.

1354
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,620
Not on mine, of course, but

1355
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,660
you know, on yours.

1356
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,880
Yeah, on yours.

1357
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,960
On yours, not mine.

1358
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,540
It's on yours.

1359
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,000
It's all a false rumor,

1360
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,160
Sang. There's nothing

1361
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,100
wrong. Everything's

1362
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,860
fine. All the stuff you've been reading,

1363
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,520
everything on the internet, Facebook,

1364
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,360
everything you've been taking on, it's all

1365
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,020
puddin', man. It's puddin'.

1366
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,880
Puddin',

1367
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,640
is that some new internet term?

1368
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,220
Slang? I don't know.

1369
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,800
Should it stand for something?

1370
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,180
Is that like

1371
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:17,360
lol?

1372
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,660
Or

00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:19,840

what was the name of that movie?

I'm going to

1406
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,300
actually, that happened

1407
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:41,960
I probably

1408
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,600
I probably

1409
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,780

it's like you go

1429
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,020
what was that

1430
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,320
what was that movie that was

1431
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,440
it had Jack Nicholson and

1432
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,940
and Shirley MacLaine

1433
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,480
what was it you just type in Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLaine

1434
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,820
and all five of their movies pop up and you go

1435
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,020
and you go, oh, I'm going to watch that movie.

1436
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:17,920
Oh, right.

or whatever, you know, whatevs.

1440
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,140
Yeah, really just think about all the work Stanislavski did for those guys

1441
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,960
and they don't can't even think of what their characters thinking.

1442
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,440
That's what I hate about modern science.

1443
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,460
You know what I mean?

1444
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,780
I'm sure you don't.

1445
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,420
I can't even hear modern science.

1446
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,260
I have to have subtitles all the time.

1447
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,520
What do you have, what do you have, what do you have, what do you have, what do you have, what do you have, what do you have, what do you have.

1448
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,120
Do you have any more of those cookies, Stan?

1449
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,180
Yeah.

1450
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,180
Don't tell princess we.

00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,240
It's a lunch break.

1452
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,060
I'll just gobble a couple of those

1453
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,280
to satisfy the inner man,

1454
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,840
the pangs of hunger.

1455
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,400
All these names will come to me in about 30 seconds

1456
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,660
when I quit thinking about it.

1457
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,040
Best quit talking about that nerd stuff.

1458
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,540
Get back on to the subject that blesses my heart.

1459
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,200
The doctrine of JR Bob Dobbs,

1460
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,400
his beloved,

1461
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,240
the creator of the movie,

1462
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,240


1463
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,240


1464
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,240


1465
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,240


1466
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,240


1467
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,240


1468
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,360
word. As if that's not nerd stuff.

1469
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,960
Oh, well, but yeah,

1470
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,240
I don't have to look at a script for

1471
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,880
that. I don't have to remember anything.

1472
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,260
It just comes out automatically.

1473
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,120
You just have to turn on the southern

1474
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,320
accent, but it only works if you really

1475
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,000
have a southern accent.

1476
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,780
Pretend southern

1477
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,240
preacher thing. You can't

1478
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,800
imagine how tedious

1479
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,160
that sounds to the real ones.

1480
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,040
Well, it doesn't have to

1481
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,120
necessarily be like, you know, it's not

1482
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,840
necessarily Texas or Georgia. They always

1483
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,140
imitate Billy Graham.

1484
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,760
Right, right, right. It doesn't have to be southern

1485
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,380
southern. It can be like Appalachian

1486
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,100
or, you know,

1487
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,780
Piedmont. That kind of thing.

1488
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,740
But it can't be...

1489
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,520
It shouldn't be fake.

1490
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,760
I wouldn't try to preach in a fake

1491
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,620
British accent. That would be...

1492
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,720
Well, right. You can't be from, like, New York

1493
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,700
and then, you know... I can't do that either.

1494
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:07,660
Suddenly...

1495
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,440
I...

1496
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,440
You can't preach like a New Yorker.

1497
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,640
See, I can't even do it.

1498
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,540
And another

1499
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,660
factoid, the swimming pool at

1500
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,280
Monster High has no

1501
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,340
bottom. Much like

1502
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,760
Reverend Richard Skull, who just walked in.

1503
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:26,820
What

1504
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,840
episode has the swimming pool in it?

1505
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:29,960
Well,

1506
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,400
there's a movie

1507
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,580
called 13 Wishes about a

1508
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,380
magic lamp and a genie, and

1509
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,620
the nice genie escapes from the lamp

1510
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,500
and the bad genie decides she's better off

1511
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,520
in the lamp, and then the lamp is thrown

1512
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,340
into the swimming pool, which

1513
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,480
is bottomless.

1514
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,620
So, probably nobody's going to find the lamp

1515
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,900
for a long time. His old sequel, isn't it?

1516
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,760
And everything will... Hey!

1517
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,060
Now, see, there's another correspondence.

1518
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,500
How would he get there, anyway?

1519
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,540
His old sequel. I mean, he can do

1520
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,440
anything. It's like the underground

1521
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,960
tunnel that leads you to

1522
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,760
McGilligat's Pool. Right.

1523
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,300
Yeah, that's the first thing

1524
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,040
that comes to my mind. Nobody asked how Nessie got in

1525
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,640
Loch Ness.

1526
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,020
They don't say, well, how'd Nessie get there?

1527
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,980
Well, that recent photo,

1528
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,120
that's appeared on the internet of Bigfoot

1529
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,180
riding Nessie and waving at the

1530
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,500
camera ought to settle people's

1531
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,180
minds

1532
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,520
about it one way or the other.

1533
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,900
You saw that one, didn't you, Stang?

1534
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,680
Recently came out.

1535
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,240
A big meme, huh?

1536
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,320
No, not off... I can't think offhand.

1537
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,160
But if I had seen it, I still wouldn't

1538
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,680
remember, so it's a moot point.

1539
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,120
Alright.

1540
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,420
Memory.

1541
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,240
This is one of those hours of Slack

1542
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,320
that's probably going to be cut up and interspersed.

1543
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,420
with a bunch of Rudy Schwartz project music.

1544
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,100
Chopped into a thousand slivers.

1545
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,840
Or something.

1546
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,880
I'm getting old. I need to stand up.

1547
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,460
Well, we don't have to

1548
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,880
stay here. We can always put on

1549
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,020
some more of Susie's

1550
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,860
X-Day collages or

1551
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:01,920
this.

1552
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,200
See, there was my cut point.

1553
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,280
I can't even hear modern

1554
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,180
science, and I have to have subtitles

1555
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,800
all the time.

1556
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,500
Yeah, I think

1557
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,220
that would be very, very

1558
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,840
rough on you. And I think

1559
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,260
there's a moment of silence for the roughness

1560
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,520
that you're absorbing right now.

1561
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,740
Okay.

1562
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,900
Well, the subtitles

1563
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,400
that go with this show, for instance,

1564
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,620
are obviously some computer

1565
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,320
is doing it. It's

1566
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,980
some kind of voice recognition

1567
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,520
thing. Because I'm looking at

1568
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,340
the subtitles, and it doesn't even spell

1569
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,380
subtitles right.

1570
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,320
Well, how do I know you're real

1571
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,480
for crying out loud? I'm calling... I could be

1572
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,900
calling up a machine right now.

1573
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,000
Yeah.

1574
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,400
Duh.

1575
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,440
I think that's been the point of everything

1576
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,360
we've been saying for the last hour

1577
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:52,880
and a half.

1578
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,720
It's all been made by a machine.

1579
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,500
A three-year-old machine.

1580
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,180
What I'm saying now

1581
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,100
is being generated

1582
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,520
by a very advanced

1583
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,140
computer.

1584
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,480
And

1585
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,360
I am an electronic...

1586
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,400
Well, somebody said something on the

1587
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,080
internet. They're going,

1588
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,080
Oh, I

1589
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,080
hate to think of Stan dying, because

1590
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,260
then he'll leave all those terrible,

1591
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,880
horrible people in charge.

1592
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,180
And I

1593
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,280
had to admit, I'm sorry, but I've

1594
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,880
been dead since July

1595
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,200
14th. Yeah, you were

1596
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,680
the walrus. I remember, and

1597
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,340
especially in the Abbey Road cover,

1598
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,220
that you were the one that had

1599
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,000
the really flat, bare feet.

1600
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,140
No, no, you're thinking of some other Ivan

1601
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,420
Stang. I

1602
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,200
died July 14th,

1603
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,020
but CGI is so

1604
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,100
unspeakably good these days

1605
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,100
that I sound

1606
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,220
pretty real, don't I? Sounds like the real me,

1607
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:50,540
right?

1608
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,760
That's how good the CGI

1609
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,900
is now. I'm dead,

1610
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,720
and yet, look how...

1611
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,140
How's the 3D? Here, look

1612
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:00,960
at that. See?

1613
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,920
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1614
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,100
That's beautiful. Yeah, it

1615
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,100
looks real as heck.

1616
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,060
You look a lot better in the hollow than you do

1617
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,600
in the real one. Yep, that's me.

1618
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,180
Old CGI...

1619
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,240
guy.

1620
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,740
See, there was my cut point.

1621
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,760
This, too, was the son

1622
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,420
of Bob. That just...

1623
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,000
That was the

1624
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,620
scissor space.

1625
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,460
The Susie space?

1626
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,900
The scissor space. The cut space.

1627
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,040
That's the spot where I'll look to

1628
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,120
cut to whatever it is that I play next.

1629
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,320
And now this is a big space of cut.

1630
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,180
Because this stuff gets edited a lot.

1631
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,820
The first show we did Sunday night

1632
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,640
will probably put out

1633
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,860
exactly as is, except I've got to insert

1634
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,860
the lightning strike.

1635
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,800
