1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Do not stand at my grave and weep.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,680
I am not there.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,980
I do not sleep.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,040
I am a thousand winds that blow.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,820
I am the diamond glimpse on snow.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,120
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,700
I am the gentle autumn rain.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,020
When you awaken in the morning's hush,

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:33,900
I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flood.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,840
I am the soft stars that shine at night.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,180
Do not stand at my grave and cry.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,660
I am the self-genius, our own sweat.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,340
Run and get those drinks, will you?

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,860
And tell Mr. Foster, make him strong.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,920
Will you do that?

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,320
Run, girl, run.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,860
That's a lush one, isn't it?

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Full of fire, too, I'll tell you.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,420
I wouldn't know.

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,360
You wouldn't?

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,120
Pity.

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,880
My name is Douglas Smith.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,380
The Douglas Smith?

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:11,880
The editor?

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,340
Ex-editor.

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,880
Why ex?

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,380
It's a long, sad story.

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,280
You wouldn't be interested.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,440
Oh, but I would.

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,640
I would indeed.

31
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,280
You see, you are the reason that I've journeyed to Dansburg.

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,700
You must be a creditor.

33
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

34
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,560
No, not yet, anyhow.

35
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,560
The only cult they want to talk about is the subgenius foundation, the church of the subgenius.

36
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,160
Doug Smith says we're different.

37
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,840
Doug's right, Virgil.

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,560
We are different.

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,440
Thanks to Jesus, the genetic engineering corporation of American states.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,540
Mommy, too?

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah.

42
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,300
Yep, the whole family.

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,980
Is everybody like us?

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,360
No, son, but we're working on it.

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,540
Round the clock.

46
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,800
I'd rather be lucky than smart.

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,680
Oh, slacker.

48
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,220
Mr. Smith?

49
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,140
Mr. Smith?

50
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,240
Jack!

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,900
Oh, Doc!

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,540
Jackie!

53
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,800
Oh, Jackie!

54
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,520
You're all right.

55
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,440
Mr. Smith, he tried to kill me.

56
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,600
He tried to kill me.

57
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:34,920
I know.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,960
We were in this car, and he kept going faster and faster, and there was this other car coming

59
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,820
at us, and he had his straight for that car.

60
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,320
It's all right now.

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,520
It's all over.

62
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,540
He was sitting right there next to me, and then he was gone.

63
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,020
What's going on?

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,780
What happened?

65
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,600
Tell me.

66
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,940
Listen to this.

67
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,060
Mr. Douglas Smith, former star reporter and chief line of type operator for the Courier,

68
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,000
resigned his position and left Dansburg for his own good.

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,320
He's home at 11.29 this evening.

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,560
His contract with Mr. Douglas Smith declared null and void owing to Mr. Winter's incomplete

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,200
understanding of the terms of the document.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,400
Contract?

73
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,540
What contract?

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
It means that he's gone.

75
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,360
Gone?

76
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,280
And he won't be back.

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,740
Doug, will you please explain this?

78
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

79
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,400
I will.

80
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,400


81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,860
I'll tell you.

82
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,620
Maybe tomorrow.

83
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,120
But right now, let's get out of here.

84
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,400
Exit the infernal machine.

85
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,980
And with it, his satanic majesty, Mr. Smith.

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,180
We'll be back in a minute.

87
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,180


88
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,180


89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,180


90
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,180


91
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm looking for a man named Lucifer, Prince of Darkness, otherwise known as Mr. Smith.

92
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,460
He's gone, but not for good.

93
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,100
That wouldn't be like him.

94
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,060
He's gone for bad.

95
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,920
And he might be back.

96
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,060
With another ticket to the Twilight Zone.

97
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,340
Oh, gosh.

98
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,620
Oh, my God.

99
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,120
I'm so tired of this.

100
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,120


101
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm so nervous.

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm in a state of panic.

103
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,320


104
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,320


105
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,880
I'm in a state of panic.

106
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,140
I'm in a state of panic.

107
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,340
I'm in a state of panic.

108
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,200
Got a spark

109
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,260
You can't stop it

110
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,560
It's a question

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,360
You gotta pop it

112
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,300
Do you wanna light it up?

113
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,060
Do you wanna light it up?

114
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,840
Do you wanna light it up?

115
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,560
Light it up

116
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,100
We all know

117
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,640
There's still time

118
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,360
Now we're gonna

119
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,840
Fire up your minds

120
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,080
Do you wanna light it up?

121
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,840
Do you wanna light it up?

122
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,680
Do you wanna light it up?

123
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Light it up

124
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,900
Do you wanna light it up?

125
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,180
Fire, fire

126
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,980
Fire, fire

127
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,540
Fire, fire

128
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,880
Knock, knock, no one's home

129
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,560
We don't wanna dance alone

130
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,260
No, no, can't behave

131
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,240
We'll get torched in the cave

132
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,940
Uh-oh, there's no time

133
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,860
We don't wanna lose our minds

134
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,580
Oh yeah, time to change

135
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,380
Wanna see you use your brain

136
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,820
Well done, Kelsey

137
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:36,820


138
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,800
You feel your way

139
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,440
Shake that shaking hand

140
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,540
When the world isINE

141
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:40,740
Curse created

142
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,360
And the entire universe

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,720
Go wrong

144
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,820
Well, Birds were raised

145
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:44,820


146
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:44,820


147
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,640
Dashing, driving

148
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,340
And it's secret

149
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,420
There are plenty of people

150
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,420
Der engine

151
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,500
And narrator

152
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:53,640
There are plenty of people

153
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,780
Who travel

154
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:54,820
To experience

155
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,040
The adventure

156
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,340
We'll keep moving

157
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,340


158
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,340


159
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,640
Thank you.

160
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,900
Thank you.

161
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,860
Thank you.

162
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,340
Thank you.

163
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,940
Thank you.

164
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,560
Thank you.

165
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,140
Thank you.

166
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,480
Thank you!

167
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,520
Then that's what I want best, right?

168
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,960
No prob, stuck to the tar bitty bar.

169
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,320
Wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog.

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,740
Instead of this church where my socks just rot.

171
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,700
I love a presentacle,

172
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,120
Instead of the pigs at Willow Lake.

173
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,120


174
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,120


175
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,980
But my rules take me wherever I want to go.

176
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,300
You too.

177
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,280
Oh baby, I'm back

178
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,300
Oh baby, I'm back

179
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:54,380
Oh baby, I'm back

180
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,320
There is absolutely no reason for this to occur.

181
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,720
Dow is 477.

182
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,020
House Republicans are expected to day on a scale down southern U.S. border on their own.

183
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,000
In Northern California, 19 crews have been destroyed.

184
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,700
That brings to 900 the number now in ruin from PR News in Washington.

185
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,520
Yes, dear friends.

186
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,740
This music in the background is from the Rudy Schwartz Project.

187
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,400
PR News, of course, was by the great Fernandez and Andy Lemur.

188
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,980
That song, Tar Baby of Bob.

189
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,660
Bob.

190
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,900
That was Dr. Gary Gbrog, Fran.

191
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,440
The song...

192
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,680
Slack Bang Me Baby, the sexy song.

193
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,060
That was by out-of-band experience, Bill T. Miller, the king of slack.

194
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,160
And the song Light It Up was by the Exposed Foreheads.

195
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,380
Letter X and the numeral 4.

196
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,000
Exposed Foreheads.

197
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,900
And they'll be at the devotional at the Beachland Ballroom.

198
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,740
August 19th and 20th.

199
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,240
That's the big Devo convention, folks, you know.

200
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:38,180
And the special guests there will be Jerry Casale of Devo and Bob One, Mother's Ba.

201
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,860
And Reverend Angry Larry will be playing with the Spud Boys.

202
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,360
The Fantastic Plastics will be there.

203
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,060
Woo-hoo!

204
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,380
And Ken, the Magic Corner God.

205
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,340
Philo's in that band.

206
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,600
But I don't think he's going to be there.

207
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,080
The Devo-matics.

208
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,800
I'm sure it'll all be great.

209
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,020
Just greaty-great-great.

210
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,260
And I'm going to switch music here.

211
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,580
One, two, one, two.

212
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
Oh, yes, yes, yes, friends.

213
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,740
Because we're back from many adventures.

214
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,280
Starting with 19X Day.

215
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,520
Or actually the 21st X Day Drill.

216
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,180
We experienced Starwood, number 36.

217
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,600
That was my 26th Starwood.

218
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,460
And Princess Wee's 30-something.

219
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,440
Yeah.

220
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,900
And, of course, the Republican National Convention heard in the background here.

221
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,920
Quiet out there.

222
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,780
Quiet, friends.

223
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,560
Quiet out there, audience.

224
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,220
Quiet.

225
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,400
I can't hear myself think.

226
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,020
I said quiet out there.

227
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,420
And I mean quiet.

228
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,040
Quiet.

229
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,760
Oh, yes.

230
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,820
Oh, yes, yes, yes, friends.

231
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,340
It was a beautiful...

232
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,940
Well, actually, it was a lot of hard work for the two of us.

233
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,820
Because I kind of run that X Day thing.

234
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,760
And Princess Wee kind of runs the Starwood thing.

235
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,180
With a lot of help from friends.

236
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,720
Well, in both cases.

237
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,380
But it's a little...

238
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,800
It's a little different when your fundament is on the line.

239
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,500
The line where you have to keep writing checks and such.

240
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,240
But it's great.

241
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,760
Everything went well.

242
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,200
No one died.

243
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,640
So that's a win.

244
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,180
Yes, that's a win.

245
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,700
We didn't lose our fundaments.

246
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,160
And at X Day, everyone's name tag.

247
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,980
Doug said Doug.

248
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,880
It's because in Facebook land,

249
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,280
the Facebook robots decided that I couldn't use my real name,

250
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,740
Reverend Ivan Stang, anymore.

251
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,660
And I had to use my human street name that's on my driver's license.

252
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,360
And I had made the mistake of asking on Facebook,

253
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,180
y'all that are coming to 19X Day, please don't call me Doug.

254
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,700
So...

255
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,360
They did.

256
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,360


257
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,360


258
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,360


259
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,360


260
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,360


261
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,120
They didn't exactly.

262
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,560
They called each other Doug.

263
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:31,820
And every name tag that was handed out had Doug or some variation of it.

264
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,940
And everybody called each other Doug.

265
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,840
In doodly doodly.

266
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,300
Yeah.

267
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,180
But we had magic.

268
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,520
Other magical things happened.

269
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,560
We had, for instance, the Wisteria, the campground,

270
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,960
where they held all of these events except for the Republican convention.

271
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,860
You had to get a little ticket to use the Wi-Fi.

272
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,640
And the ticket had a number on it, a code number.

273
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,060
Well, I happened to get the code number 13213.

274
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,940
That's only two numbers off from spelling Bob.

275
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,940
And if you don't understand that, write it out.

276
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,060
Cram the one and the three close together.

277
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,780
And instead of a two, make a zero.

278
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,800
13013.

279
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,700
My Starwood tag, those are numbered also.

280
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,560
And by chance, my Starwood tag this time was 420.

281
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,640
I was the 420th person to be registered.

282
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,660
Although I'd been hanging out and hiding from registration for several days.

283
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,720
But, yes, we had good times and good food.

284
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,700
There was a lot of fine eating out there.

285
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,500
A lot of it thanks to Reverend Heathen at X Day.

286
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,000
He just brought all this chicken and pork and stuff and fed everybody.

287
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,920
Kept cooking it.

288
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:10,200
And at Starwood, the Space Rangers were the caterers, you might say.

289
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,360
That's sort of like having the Merry Pranksters as your caterers.

290
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,960
And they even had an acid test.

291
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,580
But that's just what they called it.

292
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,240
I don't think they tested any acid.

293
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,560
Maybe some of them match it.

294
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,640
It's just all magnetic materials or may be some individuals might have,

295
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,780
but I certainly didn't.

296
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,360
Well, actually, somebody did offer us some and we had to say,

297
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,500
do we look like the kind of people who would do drugs at one of those

298
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:39,980
festivals?

299
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,540
And in fact, you know, when you're running the thing, you've got to be

300
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:44,940
careful.

301
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,620
You can't get to thisgregated there.

302
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,380
Nothing.

303
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,680
We ate.

304
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,260
Well, the bugs ate well.

305
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,220
Yes, they feasted on us.

306
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,560
I ended up covered in little insect bites and cuts and burns.

307
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,780
And I really felt like I had had the full camping experience, even though I didn't have to camp.

308
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,360
Well, but there were interesting bugs.

309
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,360
There were not just bug bites on us.

310
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,660
There were actual bugs themselves that took up residence, lived on us for three weeks.

311
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:23,940
I took some spectacular photographs of insects because they have such a wide variety of insects.

312
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,520
Yeah, there's things that are not from this planet there.

313
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,520
They have more diversity there than possibly anywhere else in the United States.

314
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,660
Well, I've still got a candiru toad living up somewhere inside my prostate area.

315
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,560
Mar not.

316
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,800
Well, you know, those toads will do that.

317
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,380
They're for real.

318
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
People think that's just a joke.

319
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,960
I think old sequoia is just a joke.

320
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,980
Living in that pond.

321
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:57,700
But people saw old sequoia or her offspring, her hatchlings that were about four feet across.

322
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:06,240
Snapping turtles, giant snapping turtles migrating across the campground and living in the little, in the pond where we did our baptism.

323
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,100
We wash away the sins of all those poor sinners.

324
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,040
As Bob says, he loves the sin but hates the sinner.

325
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,720
And we had lots of sinners.

326
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,500
They're getting their filth washed off.

327
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,460
The filth of the conspiracy of the normal people that they had to live among all the rest of the year.

328
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,940
It's true.

329
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,860
They were tainted.

330
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,440
Yeah, it's a lot of these people.

331
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,820
That's their only vacation.

332
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,620
And sometimes it's the only way Lonesome Cowboy Dave can ever know anything.

333
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,340
What do you mean I can't ever know nothing?

334
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,300
That's not true at all.

335
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,460
I can always know something.

336
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,700
No, we were saying how you could know it.

337
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,380
How I could know it.

338
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:46,940
By appercentage.

339
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,600
By perception or by perception or by intuition?

340
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,700
I don't know.

341
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,460
You tell me.

342
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,480
You're the one that knows it.

343
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:53,860
Don't you?

344
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,600
Well, for your information, you think I'm a real stupid dog bunny.

345
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,640
I'm reading People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn.

346
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,620
And I even can understand some of the big words.

347
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,680
I keep thinking that I know that guy.

348
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,860
But I don't.

349
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,840
We know Harvey Wasserman.

350
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,640
He passed away a couple years ago.

351
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,380
Howard Zinn.

352
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,500
No, it wasn't funny.

353
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,220
Howard Zinn died two years ago, he said.

354
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,520
Two or three.

355
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,380
Two or three.

356
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,680
Uh-huh.

357
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,600
I think there's something fishy about a human being dying.

358
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,960
Well, there's always something fishy smelling about it.

359
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,980
I don't know if it's an actual fishtail, so to speak.

360
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,120
Well, he tells you.

361
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,260
Isn't that what we all live?

362
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,140
Is it just a fishtail?

363
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,760
In the medicine fish hole.

364
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,300
We're all down in the medicine fish hole in our own separate ways.

365
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,420
That's Howard Zinn.

366
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,780
Zinn guy tells United States history that they don't teach you in school.

367
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,820
Yeah.

368
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,800
My dad gave me a copy of his book.

369
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,760
He said, this is going to blow your mind wide open.

370
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,380
And I had to go, Pappy, I'm aware of all this stuff.

371
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,700
I actually had read that book, I think, a long time ago.

372
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,740
Oh, yes.

373
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,940
Yes, he ends up, I think, with the first Iraq war.

374
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,960
Or no, no, the second Iraq war.

375
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,380
With the Bush term.

376
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,500
The Bush term is where this edition ends.

377
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,020
It doesn't have Obama yet.

378
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,160
And it only has the first term of Bush.

379
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,360
Well, Dave, we missed you at X-Day.

380
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,400
And we narrowly missed you at Starwood.

381
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,760
I almost got you, but my scope needs to be calibrated a little better.

382
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,040
But we thought of you a lot during the Republican convention.

383
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,460
We looked.

384
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,620
We looked for you in our sights.

385
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,020
But.

386
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,480
Oh, I thought you were trying to shoot me.

387
00:23:50,900 --> 00:24:04,120
Yeah, I missed an opportunity with the local newspaper to be the few argumentative agent of the post-transcription conscription era to have witnessed the pubic orifice.

388
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
You could have been in the building, right?

389
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,460
Yeah, I could have been pawed by a lesbian passing herself as a soccer mom.

390
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,780
I didn't mean that in a negative way, either.

391
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,220
I just I was alluding to.

392
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:25,500
The fact that there were among those evangelical yeashears out there, there were a lot of gay prostitutes involved.

393
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:40,900
Somebody was was it the Cleveland scene that I read that that during the Republican convention, Cleveland didn't really make it all that much money in general, except the gay prostitutes had a really good week.

394
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,880
The hetero prostitutes didn't.

395
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,780
What does this tell you?

396
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,400
Yes.

397
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
About the closeting of some of these.

398
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,580
Well, I just feel sorry for some of them in some ways.

399
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,040
On the other hand, maybe they should climb up out of that hole and into the light of the other holes.

400
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:08,200
Yeah, knock a hole in that closet door and walk out into the bright sunlight and say, I am a homosexual.

401
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,120
And how you're supposed to say it.

402
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,160
Well, you can say it any way you want in the church of the subject.

403
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,760
And I think that's genius.

404
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,300
Absolutely.

405
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,500
Right.

406
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,200
And that's what true freedom really is, is the freedom to be an idiot.

407
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,220
Did you ever see the billboard of Cruz and Donald J.

408
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,320
Trump making out?

409
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah, I did.

410
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,240
That was very touching.

411
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,160
It was.

412
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,360
Where was that?

413
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:34,920
Some some.

414
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,500
That was a nice paint job.

415
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,800
Somebody actually paid for that billboard to exist for.

416
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,700
Yeah, that's what.

417
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,500
Wow.

418
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,780
Trump and Cruz making out.

419
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,380
Yeah.

420
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,380


421
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,380


422
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,380


423
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,380


424
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,380


425
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,380


426
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:57,180
I was wondering if the drummer that used to be in a incartation of Mondo's Retardo Band was not Bobby, but another fellow.

427
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,800
I wondered if his sign company did it.

428
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,080
Not if they did it, but if they were responsible for that, because anybody could have did it.

429
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,620
Well, it costs money to put up a billboard.

430
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,540
I think.

431
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,620
Yeah, it costs a lot of sovereign cheese buckles.

432
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,540
Got that going wrong.

433
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,780
I can almost think of that drummer's name.

434
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,120
It was like Pinkerton or something, but it's not Pinkerton.

435
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,280
Pinkerton Pinksley.

436
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,640
Yeah, Pinkerton.

437
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,980
But it's not Pinkerton Pinksley.

438
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,380
P. Pinkerton Pinksley.

439
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:26,540
It's just like that.

440
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,360
It's a name like that.

441
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,160
It was Rose Royce.

442
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,280
Or it was T-Man Magnificat.

443
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,420
T-Man Magnificat?

444
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,300
Magnificat.

445
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,540
Magnificat.

446
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,000
Magnificatum.

447
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,780
Well, anyway, we didn't go to the Republican convention this year.

448
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,000
It was.

449
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,500
In fact, we didn't go downtown, but our neighbors, Joe and Walter, did.

450
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,660
And they just tried to go to the farmer's market, but you couldn't cross the bridge.

451
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,340
So you had to go the long way around.

452
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,320
And when they got there, there were more police than customers.

453
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,280
And apparently, that's not even an exaggeration.

454
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:13,840
And this is even though they weren't, well, I guess the Republicans weren't really getting out and around in the town much.

455
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,100
They all stayed in their hotels.

456
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,360
And called out for their gay prostitutes, I guess.

457
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:28,080
And just used the bar, the fridge bar there in the hotels or something.

458
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,520
Because they.

459
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,460
Fear of Cleveland.

460
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,420
They have nothing to fear in Cleveland.

461
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,400
In Cleveland, if you burn a flag, they're liable to put you in jail forever.

462
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:43,440
Well, the protesters were more afraid than anybody because they could get their heads bashed in.

463
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,080
In Cleveland, they can shoot you from the top.

464
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,400
And they were afraid of taking a picture of them.

465
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,680
Yeah.

466
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,300
You know.

467
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,640
So, yeah, there was, and plus, there's the apathy.

468
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,980
Now, I understand the Democratic convention is getting a whole.

469
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:06,440
There's a lot of people who were really, really angry over what Hillary did to Bernie.

470
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:13,680
And then there's probably just as many who are really chortling over all that in the Republican side.

471
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:20,980
But it's apparently terribly hot all over the whole country at this speaking.

472
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,500
Not for us.

473
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,300
We're in Cleveland.

474
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,500
Cleveland's always 15 degrees cooler than everywhere else.

475
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:26,960
Yes.

476
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,060
They're dying.

477
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,880
They're dropping like flies everywhere.

478
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:42,520
And yet, still outdoors waving signs around and stuff, exercising their freedom of speech under the eye of numerous big brothers.

479
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,260
And big sisters.

480
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,560
And their ancestors, too.

481
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:59,380
And big daddies and the ghosts of their ancestors all going, I can't believe that you're making it easier for them Republicans and them Democrats to make fun of each other.

482
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:07,060
As a ghost, I'm just appalled by everything I see on TV, especially on the news TV.

483
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,160
Yeah.

484
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,560
Rightfully, it should be.

485
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:17,120
We have to keep, we need the acumen to pull apart all the different little lessons we learned.

486
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,020
Oh, yes.

487
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:30,700
All the lessons we've learned and reconstruct a new human being from this person who's wise beyond his years and sweet as far as the alleged domain goes.

488
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,500
Not real actual sweetness, but like splendid or whatever it's called.

489
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,300
You know, kind of a false sweetness that you see in like when Ronald Reagan.

490
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,320
Or when, uh, J. Trump wiggles his tongue.

491
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,120
Or when, uh...

492
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,060
Oh, I figured you were talking about Vermin Supreme.

493
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,580
The next president of the United States.

494
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,780
You know, this guy actually has a chance.

495
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,100
People are so disgusted with what's available.

496
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,940
He could be the next Pat Paulson.

497
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,960
Actually, he is.

498
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,920
He is the next Pat.

499
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,620
He is the current Pat Paulson.

500
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,900
Yes, now, but you, to the audience, you'll have to explain who Pat Paulson was.

501
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,040
Right.

502
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,860
Most of them don't know.

503
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,780
I couldn't think he died in the late 90s.

504
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,740
But he was still running for president.

505
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,420
And he was serious one time.

506
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,960
At one point in there, it was like, well, why am I any worse than the people that are running?

507
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:19,740
Right.

508
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,820
And, uh...

509
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,240
And I think Vermin Supreme is saying the same thing.

510
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
And he sounds like a crazy person.

511
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,700
Matt Elfhatlump.

512
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,220
And some, and what's his name, uh, the El Supremo?

513
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,300
That one guy?

514
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,700
They all have a right to be the president, just as much as I do or you do.

515
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,460
That's a pretty horrible thought, actually.

516
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,080
Isn't it?

517
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,060
I wouldn't want to be, and I know you wouldn't want to be.

518
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,580
I wouldn't want, that would be the worst punishment you could, besides the fact that you could

519
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,580
have any woman that you desired at any moment in time, or something like that.

520
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,660
I'd probably lose the red button and the football and all of the stuff that the president's

521
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,840
supposed to keep track of.

522
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,620
Eh.

523
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,700
Eh.

524
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,800
Fooey.

525
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,520
Fooey.

526
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:04,620
Fooey.

527
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:04,760
Fooey.

528
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,760


529
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,760


530
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,760


531
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,760


532
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,760


533
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,760


534
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,760


535
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
I'd be, I'd be blowing lunch at a White House tea.

536
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,900
I'd be talking about liberty for you and me, but you and I aren't free and then I'd blow

537
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,080
lunch all over and I'd…

538
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,280
Wah-wah once in my life.

539
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,060
And then I'd have to be let from the room by two secret security agents.

540
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,640
Did you just say if you were president, you'd throw up at the first meeting and then you'd

541
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,120
be arrested and impeached?

542
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,360
At the first White House tea I would throw up, not at the first meeting.

543
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:34,600
At the first meeting I'd be very polite and contrite and seem like every American would

544
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:34,600


545
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,680
and was going to have a hell of a great time.

546
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,740
And they'd be free as all get out

547
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,200
and wouldn't have to pay too many taxes or anything like that.

548
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,480
And all the hatred and sickness in this country

549
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,020
that it's kind of famous for

550
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,040
would all just drizzle away like my drizzle.

551
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,880
And, and.

552
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,180
Well, you know, I used to fantasize

553
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,220
about what the president gets told his first day in office.

554
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,940
Maybe the second day.

555
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,780
You know, he's sitting there feeling pretty good.

556
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,120
Hey, I'm on top of the world.

557
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,500
I'm, you know, the chief of armed forces.

558
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,940
Yeah, I know everything.

559
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,800
And then the real guys come in.

560
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,480
The real, real grim-faced guys.

561
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,700
Or maybe they're giggling madly at this point

562
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,180
because they tell him the real story.

563
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,840
And who knows?

564
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,300
Maybe it's, Mr. President,

565
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,040
I'm afraid we have to inform you this Area 51 thing.

566
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,220
It's actually a little realer.

567
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,280
Than you may have been led to believe.

568
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,960
In fact, let me peel my face off here

569
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,800
and reveal my generself unto my God.

570
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,460
So, or maybe it's something else.

571
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,720
It's like, well, you know, Mr. President,

572
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,240
ha, Mrs. President, whatever you are.

573
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,380
You understand that you're just a scarecrow.

574
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,320
You're only here for people to pelt garbage at.

575
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,980
So to speak.

576
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,380
So.

577
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,020
Get to cringing, pelty.

578
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,260
Pelty.

579
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,000
Pelty.

580
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,300
The pelty president boy.

581
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,920
Or girl.

582
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,080
Another scenario is when they come in,

583
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,980
they tell you, 15 years ago,

584
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,660
we lost a war that nobody knows about to the Chinese.

585
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,840
And we can't really say, you know, that we lost.

586
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,540
Well, things were allowed to continue the way they are,

587
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
but we're under the total domination

588
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,660
of a foreign power right now.

589
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,160
Right.

590
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:33,980
And it's not just the Chinese.

591
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:34,340


592
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,120
It could be the Chinese.

593
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,120


594
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,140
It could be the Germans for all we care.

595
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,500
Just so long as it's somebody with a nice midriff

596
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,440
and a hairline that goes all the way back, you know,

597
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,780
like those weird little munchkins in Wizard of Oz.

598
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,120
In fact, Mr. President, your real boss is the king of Yap,

599
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:55,400
a small island in the South Pacific where they use gigantic discs for money.

600
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,200
But in fact, he's got bigger discs than this whole country has.

601
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,840
So we're beholden to them.

602
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,760
And they all have discs.

603
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,040
They also, the king of Yap also controls the Sultan of Brunei

604
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:14,260
and the Chinese and the Russians and the European Union

605
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,880
and the Catholic Church.

606
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,760
So that's it.

607
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,240
Well, he has to be anywhere.

608
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,160
Enjoy your lunch, Mr. President.

609
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,460
Mr. President.

610
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,740
That's what the Mrs. President needs to learn on the first day

611
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,700
is that he who controls the world has the largest disc.

612
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,320
The largest.

613
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,160
The largest stone disc.

614
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,420
The largest stone disc.

615
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:35,680
The largest stone disc.

616
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:35,760
The largest stone disc.

617
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:35,900
Yeah.

618
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,460
They have a hole in the center, so you can roll them around the island

619
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:44,800
as new seats of power were trying to be changed.

620
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,760
Why that's silly, Stan.

621
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,400
You know that's a silly thing to say.

622
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,800
And I bet you don't even care.

623
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,160
I bet you're as happy as pie about it.

624
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,780
I don't know how you could be as happy as pie.

625
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:02,220
I always thought that was kind of sacrilegious to try and spring that one on people.

626
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,780
And then...

627
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,560
you know

628
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,380
being happy as pie

629
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,000
being happy as pie

630
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,520
since when is pie

631
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,540
I mean pie can bring happiness

632
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,540
yes but the pie

633
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,300
itself is not happy

634
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,900
because it's going to be eaten

635
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,080
yes oh well some pies

636
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,520
that's what they're there for

637
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,580
they live their brief life

638
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,240
as a pie just to be

639
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,580
eaten and they hope that they taste good

640
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,240
to the people who are eating them

641
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,180
yes Princess Wee and

642
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,120
Dr. Howell made the traditional

643
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,380
X day pie just before we

644
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,260
left it had a big 19X

645
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,100
etched in it by Dr. Howell

646
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,980
on the crust etched

647
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,540
fabulously yeah of course

648
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,960
and a great flying

649
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,740
saucer design in the background

650
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,080
yes the pie was eaten

651
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,960
but the aliens

652
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,160
didn't come that we

653
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,920
know of I did fly my little drone

654
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,220
I did get to fly my new

655
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,140
camera drone that Reverend

656
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,960
Zaphod gave us at both

657
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,480
X day and Starwood

658
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,680
I've already made two Starwood

659
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,460
commercials out of the bonfire drone

660
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,640
footage which is going

661
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,720
to everybody's going to just

662
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,640
soil themselves

663
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,720
with amazement

664
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,280
when they see that and the

665
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,560
X day drone footage is going to take a

666
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,700
little bit of extra tweaking

667
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,460
though to put it in the right frame

668
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,220
as it were

669
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,480
oh wait

670
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,140
listen

671
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,800
I guess the Germans are controlling

672
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,380
the world's deferred again

673
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,600
that was one of my mom's

674
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,000
records

675
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,920
Lolita

676
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,120
that's not Lolita

677
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,660
that's a German lady singing in a kind of

678
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,640
a native falsetto

679
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,180
let's see what have we here

680
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,780
it is in fact

681
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,440
a German lady named Lolita

682
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,480
singing theme from a summer place

683
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,780
and the Jews harp

684
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,980
or jaw harp

685
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,580
playing that we heard with the

686
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,680
whatever

687
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,420
classical music that was

688
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,060
Johann George Albrechtsberger

689
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,120
the something in E major

690
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,680
concerto in E major

691
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,820
and it was so beautiful too

692
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,340
I wept

693
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,380
I wept like a pile of a baby woman

694
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,520
no you didn't you were on the radio I didn't hear you

695
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:31,960
weeping

696
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:32,960
you're just signing

697
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,900
I was weeping silently

698
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,020
I'm not gonna let my feelings be known to thousands

699
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,280
I was weeping silently too

700
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,320
look at all the tears

701
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,220
yeah

702
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,000
well I think the steam from a summer place is much more weepy

703
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,460
in

704
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:43,500
in

705
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,300
in

706
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,680
in

707
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:44,840
in

708
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,100
in

709
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,060
in

710
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,840
in

711
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,380
in

712
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:47,400
in

713
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,480
in

714
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:47,480


715
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:47,540
in

716
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,600
in

717
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:50,600


718
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:50,920
in

719
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,080
in

720
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,080


721
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,420
you know the

722
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,200
time

723
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,160
in

724
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,420
we have

725
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:03,940
a

726
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:03,940


727
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,080
clear

728
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,420
that

729
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,260
we

730
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,260


731
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,880
we need

732
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,980
It should come back again someday.

733
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,160
How can it be that we can't see anymore?

734
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,540
We need to see if our friends are listening.

735
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,740
Well, take the Popeye pirate patches off your eyes to start with.

736
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,540
And for number two, tell all those people that are listening to call.

737
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,740
No, they can't do that.

738
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,320
They can't call in and say they're listening.

739
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,200
To email a quick message saying,

740
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,040
right on board with you, Captain Stang and Princess We Are Doe.

741
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,060
You know?

742
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,200
I'm sorry.

743
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:47,340
No.

744
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,740
It's a hopeful message.

745
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,600
I suppose so.

746
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,060
Now we're listening to something from the Delta Blues area,

747
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,160
the Mississippi Delta.

748
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,580
Some blues now.

749
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,760
We've jumped from Deutschland to Mississippi.

750
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,220
It's a Jimi Hendrix in the background, I'm pretty sure.

751
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,560
Well, his guitar playing was influenced by Delta Blues

752
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,340
because anybody who played any kind of rock and roll in the 20th century

753
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,000
was influenced by the greats of blues.

754
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,920
The Red House over yonder.

755
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:26,240
Now, yeah, we can't see our listeners in Germany or anywhere else anymore.

756
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:26,660
No.

757
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
The connection has timed out.

758
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,400
They can hear us, maybe, but we can't see them anymore.

759
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,960
We used to watch.

760
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,560
Oh, Tanya looked so gorgeous walking around dressed that way.

761
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,560
Even with that little, uh, slow, you know, jittery feed.

762
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,400
You know, it was not a very good picture.

763
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,420
It was like a security picture.

764
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,620
Um, I'm not going to talk about what Bucky did with that dog.

765
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,200
Tanya always looked great.

766
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,800
And Bucky did, too.

767
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,360
And both dogs did, too.

768
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,460
Yeah, but the tampon was totally unnecessary.

769
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,580
Well, for a dog.

770
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:03,900
Yeah.

771
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,980
You know, the dog shouldn't be allowed to eat that.

772
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,280
Hey, I had a kind of a tampon-related accident.

773
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,520
Oh, I love those.

774
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,380
At Starwood.

775
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,900
I lost.

776
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,320
This is hard to describe.

777
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:27,900
I had mail order purchased a new camera mount that's, suffice it to say,

778
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,660
when it's collapsed, it just looks like a smooth tube with a rounded end.

779
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,900
Like somebody's...

780
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,520
Well, what happened was...

781
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,380
Slender and slanted.

782
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,980
It fell out of the golf cart.

783
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,040
It fell out of my pocket and rolled across the road and I didn't know it.

784
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:56,400
A golf cart driver, um, transporting agent saw it by the side of the road and called security and said,

785
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,360
I found a bob in the road.

786
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,160
And they went, uh, what?

787
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,880
What?

788
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,280
She has a B-A-B.

789
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,040
Battery...

790
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,340
B-O-B.

791
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,660
No, B-O-B.

792
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,320
B-O-B.

793
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,660
Battery operated boyfriend.

794
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,480
Yes.

795
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:11,920
B-O-B.

796
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,220
I kept saying B-A-B.

797
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:13,780
You did.

798
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,200
You said it during your rant.

799
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,600
Yeah.

800
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,220
Oh, well.

801
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:16,960
At Starwood.

802
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,560
Here's an O to cut in over that.

803
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:18,920
O.

804
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,840
Anyway, yeah, it's a B-O-B.

805
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,800
Battery operated boyfriend.

806
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,600
She thought it was a sex toy and she said, I'm not gonna touch it unless I have gloves

807
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,120
because I think it has some Greek lube on it.

808
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:31,400


809
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,600
Another person reported it to security and said that they'd seen a bomb on the side of

810
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:37,900
the road.

811
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,280
So it was a bob bomb dildo, you might say.

812
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,200
And, uh...

813
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,600
Battery operated boyfriend.

814
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,620
Yeah.

815
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:54,500
I did end up getting it back because a brave security driver in a golf cart picked it up,

816
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,800
even without gloves.

817
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,280
Deemed to touch it.

818
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:57,660
Right.

819
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,300
He got my greasy old bob.

820
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,260
And I got it back.

821
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,160
Was it still operative?

822
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,100
Could you still see the dirty pictures when you pushed the one thing and it made the little

823
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,340
black mark on your eyeballs?

824
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:09,820
Well, you know, you take...

825
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,060
You use it to take dirty pictures and I took a lot of pictures of the dirt.

826
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,000
He did.

827
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,040
I did, honestly.

828
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,880
I took a lot of dirty pictures.

829
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,240
Yeah, so off to the side of the road.

830
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:18,540
That's...

831
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:18,900
Yeah.

832
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,120
And I got a pixie eye view of a whole bunch of fairies.

833
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,220
Yes, he did.

834
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,520
In the fairy shrine.

835
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,640
There was a fairy shrine there?

836
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,800
Yes, there was a fairy shrine.

837
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,580
Very, very fairy shrine.

838
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,700
It's unbelievable.

839
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,320
In fact, it's hard to get to.

840
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,920
You have to go down the secret trail.

841
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,320
You have to know the fairies.

842
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,800
You have to pay them and the leprechauns and the...

843
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,440
Who else?

844
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,200
The elves.

845
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,360
The little people.

846
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,160
All kinds of...

847
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,200
All the little people.

848
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,420
Yeah, there's...

849
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,880
The key stealing fairies.

850
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,440
The wee folk.

851
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:52,860
Yes.

852
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:53,900
Pixies.

853
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,580
The wee folk.

854
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,800
You should know the wee folk.

855
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,020
The wee folk.

856
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,580
Princess Wee.

857
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,980
Yes, they're the wee folk.

858
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,380
She knows all about them wee folk.

859
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:00,560
Oh, yes.

860
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,780
She knows all about them wee folk.

861
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,160
She knows all about them wee folk.

862
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,160


863
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,160


864
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,160


865
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,460
Hey, this music in the background is you, Dave.

866
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:08,860
What?

867
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,020
It's you.

868
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,480
Well, it's Witch Disco of some kind.

869
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,240
I don't know if it's on the Witch Disco album.

870
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,220
It might be Witch Disco at Winterstar.

871
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,780
I can't find my Witch Disco album.

872
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,060
Could you send me one if you've got more than one or two or three or four?

873
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,140
Oh, I got it.

874
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,540
Now everybody on the radio listening audience is going, oh, no, no, no.

875
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:30,540


876
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:30,540


877
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:30,540


878
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:30,540


879
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:30,540


880
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,460
I'm going to want one of those.

881
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,440
Send.

882
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,680
Yeah, I can do that.

883
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,500
I'm writing and...

884
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,120
He's making himself a notation right now, Dave.

885
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,060
... across the sky.

886
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,420
Send me one now.

887
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,620
Whatever one is.

888
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,420
I'm looking for a unitary thing, man.

889
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,320
That's what I'm looking for in religion.

890
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,540
I'm looking for something like Bob and Slack and his Church of Subgenius, but it's even

891
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,100
more monistic than that.

892
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,800
You know, it's just, I don't know if it's represented by one of those faithful toadstools,

893
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,520
or, you know, a little bit of a...

894
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,520


895
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,520


896
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,520


897
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,520


898
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,520


899
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,520


900
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,520


901
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,520


902
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,560
Or disruption in the atmosphere, or just, you know, a real farty smell.

903
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,260
It could be any one of those things, and I'd be so happy.

904
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,820
I'd turn away from Dobbs even, perhaps, maybe.

905
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:19,120
Well, I thought you would turn away from Dobbs if you could meet Dobbs?

906
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:25,340
If you could have the Slack of the Church of the Subgenius, you would turn away from

907
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,600
it if you could get that benefit?

908
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,860
I'd keep the Slack, of course, but then, yeah.

909
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,500
You would escape from it.

910
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,940
In other words, as soon as possible, once you had benefited.

911
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,380
I would keep the Slack, because, as you know, once you're, you know, regardless of your

912
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:43,240
plushitude or your neck size, whatever kind of muscles you're carrying, once you're a

913
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,860
member of the Church of the Subgenius, you can be dismembered in most of an electric

914
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,600
form by other members.

915
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,440
You're kind of a captive, a slave.

916
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,200
Everything comes apart one way or another.

917
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,140
Slack is taken away.

918
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,960
Slack is taken away.

919
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,500
You want to keep Slack?

920
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:00,500


921
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,720
You want to keep that Slack and never give back.

922
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,080
I want to keep that Slack and never give it back.

923
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,120
Yeah, something like that.

924
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,520
I want to keep that Slack and never give it back.

925
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,020
Yeah, I like the way we said it.

926
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,580
It sounds like she's very, very, like, laying down the law.

927
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,280
No, she's orgasmic.

928
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,320
Well, Slack is different for each person.

929
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,880
For some, it is slat.

930
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,500
For some, it's slag.

931
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,600
For some, it's slab.

932
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,320
For some, it's schlock or schnook.

933
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,420
Or schlock.

934
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,120
Schlock is a very common form of Slack for some people.

935
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,720
It's a Hungarian version.

936
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,940
So, yes.

937
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,260
Well, not always, but sometimes we're schlocky.

938
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,520
But that's still a form of Slack.

939
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:59,300
I was going to say, just before you said schlock, I thought that's the way to say it.

940
00:45:59,300 --> 00:45:59,300


941
00:45:59,300 --> 00:45:59,300


942
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,060
The way I feel about it, it's schlock.

943
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,240
Repeat, quip your jab.

944
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,860
Schlock off.

945
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,640
Quip your jab?

946
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,260
Yeah, repeat.

947
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,420
Quip your jab.

948
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,540
Schlock off.

949
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,460
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

950
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:25,000
Notice that even though the world ends, you're not necessarily going to die.

951
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,340
It all depends on whether you're just merely a listener.

952
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,280
Yeah.

953
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:34,400
And one of those Facebook gimme bobs, or if you're a real minister in the Church of the Subgenius,

954
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:40,220
because the real ministers get privy to things that the gimme bobs don't know.

955
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,360
I see so many of them gimme bobs out there on Facebook.

956
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,240
I don't see their names in the Book of Life.

957
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,740
But they sure are praising Bob.

958
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,420
They can't spell his name right, but they mean well.

959
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,720
They mean to praise Bob.

960
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,080
But they're just praising Bob.

961
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,900
They're not praising Bob.

962
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,400
Bob.

963
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,740
They're not just praising any old Bob.

964
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,520
But to them, any Bob is the same as the Bob.

965
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,520
Well, you know, some of them are cantankerous Paul McCartney photographs.

966
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,480
In other words, they're slob bobs.

967
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:19,040
I got a letter from a guy saying, the Book of the Subgenius, I read it when I was a teenager.

968
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,780
Honestly, it's one of the few books that I've come back to over and over again for real inspiration.

969
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,700
Even though a lot of it's nonsense.

970
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,480
It's got real gems of real inspiration and knowledge in it.

971
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,760
And it's honestly, you have saved my life.

972
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,280
Now, I never got around to sending in the ministership dues.

973
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,440
I never did any.

974
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,180
But believe me, you have saved my life, Stank.

975
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,920
This guy went on for like two pages about how he'd saved my life.

976
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,240
I never got around to sending that.

977
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,700
I never did actually help you in any way except for this letter, which I postponed writing for 35 years.

978
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,680
And I postponed a dollar a year for 35 years.

979
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,560
I haven't been on the phone for that long, too.

980
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,720
I have to say, well, thanks for telling me how the Church of the Subgenius made your life so much better.

981
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,520
That's not worth the...

982
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,040
Okay.

983
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:15,020
So we can't say that amount on the radio because this is a public supported space.

984
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,100
And we're doing...

985
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,320
We cannot benefit ourselves.

986
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,660
Although if a person did get a wild hair, they could look at Stank.

987
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:35,500
And the Church of the Subgenius, and probably the very first thing they'd click on would make them a little poorer in some ways.

988
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,220
But endlessly richer.

989
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,020
So much more rich in knowledge and slack and love.

990
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,360
Well, maybe not.

991
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,980
Well, slack and...

992
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,500
Well, slack anyway.

993
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,260
Well, are they, you know, they, T-A-T, Y-R-S.

994
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,100
Are they at the Church of the Subgenius?

995
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,680
And not you, of course.

996
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,000
But are they still marketing the Bob Whoopie cushions?

997
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:08,140
No, if you didn't get the Bob Whoopie cushion when it was in our catalog, I know what you were thinking.

998
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:14,540
Even though that Bob Whoopie cushion saved my life three times, I'm not going to get one.

999
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,500
I'm not going to contribute because that's just what they want me to do.

1000
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:24,100
It scared the police away in my case, and I can only be grateful for the rest of my existence for that.

1001
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,980
It saved me from a beating and a severe leg sprain.

1002
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,020
Well, that was just the Whoopie cushion.

1003
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,700
We've got a whole blow-up Bob in our van outside the station right now.

1004
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:35,760
Seriously.

1005
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,840
Except he's not blow-up.

1006
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,440
He hasn't been blown up yet, but he's ticking.

1007
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,100
Little Bob is ticking right where his heart would be if he was a real Bob.

1008
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,960
A bomb.

1009
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:52,460
He draws crowds at grocery store shopping parking lots.

1010
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,360
Yes.

1011
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,160
They all want to know why we're killing that man in that scene in our car.

1012
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:57,760
That's right, Princess.

1013
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:07,520
We pulled up at the supermarket, little knowing that our friend and neighbor, Mr. Sister, had pulled up kind of behind her.

1014
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:12,740
But she was already in the store when the little crowd formed around our van.

1015
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:22,880
And I guess if Mr. Sister hadn't been there to go, no, that's a cleverly designed Bob Rubbock, not an old man suffocating in a hot car.

1016
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,160
It may have saved us from getting our windows broken.

1017
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,960
Yes, those folks were just about to break the window, evidently, to save this old man that was dying in our back seat.

1018
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:38,780
And, you know, he must have looked really sick because he doesn't look like an old man.

1019
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:47,620
He looks like a really, you know, a really beat-up Bob dummy with paper mache sculpted face made by Dr. Legume.

1020
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,020
Yes.

1021
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,000
And he made it to last.

1022
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,180
It's 15 or 20 years old.

1023
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:51,760
Easily.

1024
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,400
Easily.

1025
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,620
It's got holes in its head from being used for bow and arrow practice.

1026
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,420
Mm-hmm.

1027
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,800
He's pretty beat up.

1028
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,740
I hate to think about his fundament because a lot of people just have veiled themselves at that thing.

1029
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,380
That's true.

1030
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,800
It's hanging off over the edge of a chair.

1031
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,980
What in the name of...

1032
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:22,160
He's got various little drawers and compartments and containers for beans and other ludicrous vegetables that he has the curmudgeonly strength to aspire to.

1033
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:22,460
Yeah.

1034
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:22,780
Yeah.

1035
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:22,860
Yeah.

1036
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:22,860


1037
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:22,860


1038
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:22,860


1039
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:22,860


1040
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:22,860


1041
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,120
He can.

1042
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,300
You know, he's hanging in there, as they say in French.

1043
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,340
Yes.

1044
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,700
Now, um...

1045
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,280
Hanging in there.

1046
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,460
It's the stuff in the background.

1047
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,300
Leo Cupper Radio.

1048
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,500
Leo Cupper Radio.

1049
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,860
I know nothing.

1050
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,460
I know nothing.

1051
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,800
Hey, Princess, what do you want to hear?

1052
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:01,300
hear a little bit of Starwood from, let's see if I can jump this ahead. Starwood? Real Starwood

1053
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:16,520
sound? Here we go. Oh, I hear the Hawaiian drums. This is titled Roundhouse End Frenzy,

1054
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,660
and it's 10 minutes long, but the show ends in six minutes. And Dave, I have six minutes worth

1055
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:28,240
of songs to play. Oh, no. What? You just started the Starwood drumming. What's going on?

1056
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:35,540
I have six minutes of songs to play, including the fantastic Plastics, who will be at the

1057
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:43,980
devotional in about a month, where we will be, I hope. And then G. Gordon Gordon's Ballad of

1058
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:47,560
the Bleeding Head, which nobody has heard in a long time, but they kind of need to hear it.

1059
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,060
They need to hear it? Yeah.

1060
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:51,400
How?

1061
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:56,100
They already heard it in their worst nightmares. They've been kneed in the groin, and that's why

1062
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:04,340
they need this pain taken away. So it's going to be like that. Fantastic Plastics and the Ballad

1063
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:10,440
of the Bleeding Head. Dave, I hope we can do this again next week. I'm trying to decide.

1064
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:16,340
The people who went to X Day are wanting me to just play the X Day shows and music that

1065
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:21,360
features them. And I'm saying, well, why don't I just do that when we're in Texas and use

1066
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,740
Dave and the station while we can?

1067
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,660
Don't just use Dave. Use the hell out of him.

1068
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. So...

1069
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,540
They said as they rubbed their hands together.

1070
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:40,560
I'm used to the gumball, and I'm all for it, whatever that means. I'm confused. But I'm all for it.

1071
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,300
Oh, don't be confused, Dave. We just love you, that's all.

1072
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,360
We're going to see you in the flip time wraparound of next time.

1073
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,780
Check the Z's, man. Check the Z's.

1074
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:05,640
Hey, yeah.

1075
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:05,720
Hey, yeah.

1076
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,080
Hey, yeah.

1077
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,860
Hey, yeah.

1078
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,540
Hey, yeah.

1079
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,860
Hey, yeah.

1080
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,360
Hey, yeah.

1081
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:01,940


1082
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:05,900
Oh, don't be confused.

1083
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:05,900


1084
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,200
Hey, yeah.

1085
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,300
Oh, don't be confused.

1086
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:10,980
Hey, yeah.

1087
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,080
Oh, don't be confused.

1088
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,620
Hey, yeah.

1089
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,960
Red light, are we just another malfunction?

1090
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,960
Green light, run, now all this is our function

1091
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,400
Big bang, energize, I'm in atomic

1092
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,900
Big bang, energize, we are atomic

1093
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,140
Flying through the earth

1094
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,260
With radiation

1095
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,280
Drowning in the cosmos

1096
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,780
Electricizing on you

1097
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,140
Electricizing on you

1098
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,400
This is the modern age, this is the modern age

1099
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,880
Electricizing on you

1100
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,080
Electricizing on you

1101
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,940
This is the modern age

1102
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,340
This is the modern age

1103
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,140
And now I perform the head

1104
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,480
The head, what about the head?

1105
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,060
What about the scary poster of God's thing?

1106
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,600
That evil head

1107
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,820
There is no sign of Wellman

1108
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,400
Hello, Ian

1109
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,040
There's no sign of Wellman

1110
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,700
We're just land low right here and hoping that we can get in touch with you

1111
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,100
Wellman's gone

1112
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,400
Yeah, Wellman's gone

1113
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,440
But if we can just get the head inside that lead-lined vault, we'll be okay

1114
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,660
Friends, beware that head

1115
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,460
Safe

1116
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,180
He almost went away

1117
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,220
I left the little Wellman at home, but he wants to get in touch with us

1118
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:27,160
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth greens

1119
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,860
Down at Onion Creek Country Club and Golf Course

1120
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:44,940
Thumping slowly like an over enlarged fig, the bleeding head slowly rose at a gentle angle above the green, dripping blood, and the blood that was flowing between the ears of Arnold Palmer, rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth greens, down at Onion Creek Country Club and Golf Course

1121
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,300
it hovered briefly over the sand trap

1122
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:56,180
and then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion

1123
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:01,200
at an angle of about 44.325 degrees

1124
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,820
like a shot off a shovel

1125
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,640
there was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer

1126
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,860
that moon-faced smile was unforgettable

1127
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:19,720
the population of southeast Austin went wild

1128
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,500
they tore off their clothes

1129
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,680
danced in the streets and said

1130
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,240
the bloody head has come

1131
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,980
the time is here

1132
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,480
take off your clothes and be somebody

1133
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,660
the bloody head of Arnold Palmer was above such things

1134
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,760
the bloody head of Arnold Palmer rose gently

1135
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,840
buffeting itself slightly as it passed among some ancient people

1136
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:43,540
the pecan trees

1137
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:48,520
and slowly, still, ever moving upwards

1138
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,260
it wobbled slightly

1139
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,700
spraying a small glissando of blood, so to speak

1140
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,040
on the people below it

1141
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,200
healing two old ladies

1142
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:05,400
and giving an old man a substantial gland rebuild

1143
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,680
at 14 minutes after 9

1144
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:17,180
the bleeding head was sighted on the forward control radar access plant

1145
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,060
at Barksdrum Air Force Base

1146
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,880
three interceptors were scrambled

1147
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,680
one of which crashed on takeoff

1148
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,060
they could find nothing

1149
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,920
the radar was still tracking the head

1150
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,780
the bloody head moved north

1151
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,660
rocketed over Dallas

1152
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,400
and Fort Worth

1153
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,160
the radar at Caswell Air Force Base

1154
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,700
gave subsequent indication that something large and wet

1155
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,160
was moving north-northeast

1156
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:57,700
while ascending still upwards towards the constellation of Orion

1157
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,280
the bloody head moved on

1158
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:08,440
fourteen ex-virgins were rejuvenated in Lubbock

1159
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,080
as the head passed through

1160
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:23,240
the

1161
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:42,760
the

1162
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:42,780
the

1163
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:42,800
the

1164
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:42,820
the

1165
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:42,840
the

1166
01:00:42,840 --> 01:01:12,840


1167
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
the bloody head moved north-northeast

1168
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,820
and the

1169
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:50,560
the havia and it

1170
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,920
so it stepped out of a

1171
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,000
a

1172
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,640
a

1173
01:01:52,640 --> 01:02:11,240
the bloody head rice

1174
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:11,880
village

1175
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,800
boots

1176
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,120
The women make you fall for their tricks

1177
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,500
The women make you fall for their tricks

1178
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,460
Sex, money, Bob
