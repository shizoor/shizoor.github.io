1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
And now, I guess, we'll just go on with more of it.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,720
Gosh!

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:18,720
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,300
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,660
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,980
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,840
and only in the city of...

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,420
Take a deep breath.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:40,960
Can you remember?

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,400
Ah, yeah.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,060
He sings like that.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,400
Heels are that tight.

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,220
All right.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,240
A boulder.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,660
The talk shows.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,620
...as it is with any group.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,400
Ah, okay.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,160
Thank you very much.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,100
We call that the bulletproof stage of...

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,520
Well, what can you tell us about the philosophies of Bulldada?

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,460
Bulldada is what ties one subgenius to another.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,100
Bulldada is what generates your...

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,820
Not you, Doug.

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,500
Not you, Iver.

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:14,900
...

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:15,960
...

27
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:19,900
...

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:19,960
...

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,040
...

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,160
...

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,220
...

32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,300
...

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,300


34
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,300


35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,300


36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,380
...

37
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:30,380


38
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:30,380


39
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:30,440
...

40
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,740
God, I almost didn't have 40 tanks going on at once.

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,260
But now we do and it's okay.

42
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,940
That one's on pause.

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,280
I'm on pause.

44
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,480
You're on pause.

45
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,360
Aren't we all?

46
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,140
It's so nice to be on pause.

47
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:03,240
Well, it's chaos night again, I suppose, on the Church of the Subgenius Hour of Slack.

48
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:14,240
But yet, we have some tapes from the New York Subgenius Revival to be played

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,820
of the dispensation of the blood and flesh of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

50
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,480
We have some soundtracks from the Arise Subgenius video, Arise,

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,680
which, when you arise, you will fully recognize.

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,300
You know, thank God for America, where we can get away with sowing this evil seed.

53
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,960
We've also got Puzzling Evidence coming up with his FlexiDisc solo edit

54
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,320
for the FlexiDisc that came out as a promo thing for the Book of the Subgenius.

55
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,200
EP4, that's a band, EP4.

56
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,680
Bands these days, man, they sound like phone numbers.

57
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,940
From Japan, thanks to Byron Werner.

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,180
And most of the show tonight actually will be from Media Barrage number 12.

59
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,360
The old-timey stuff, the old subgenius stuff, where, you know,

60
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,660
well, people say, Hour of Slack, I'll tune in.

61
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,680
I heard that was a comedy.

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,080
Comedy show.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,840
Well, in this show, instead of playing a whole Monty Python album

64
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,020
or a Fireside Theater album, we're going to play a whole subgenius album.

65
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,440
And it's one I was surprised to find and realized that I hadn't played

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,760
in, like, four years on the air.

67
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,420
So I'm going to play it because I get all the royalties

68
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,080
from the American Medical Association.

69
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,640
And also because there's this new book out,

70
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,980
in a couple of weeks, Three-Fisted Tales of Bob.

71
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,520
So it's all the more important that we play the old-timey tapes

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
to make you prepared for that thing.

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,960
Those old, sad tapes, the old-timey, the good, basic, rock-bottom,

74
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,860
sandy beach of hypocrisy subgenius tapes,

75
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,580
so that you might recall your own past in a subgenius.

76
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,480
The rest of it is definitely for nothing.

77
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,380
Bob Capricciarni, where tutti you live.

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,120
Oh, no you don't, Bob.

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,120


80
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

81
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,460
Come on, Bob!

82
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:32,840
I say 真的

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,200
No!

84
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,660
...no matter how we talk!

85
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,660
Every day

86
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:45,760
people find

87
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,320
it huge.

88
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,540
It's huge.

89
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,380
I didn't know the prize was this.

90
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,320
No, I didn't either.

91
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,640
I didn't know the prize was this.

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,440
This.

93
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,700
And you know the paper we had to sign?

94
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,160
Yeah, I didn't read the blank for it.

95
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,000
I think they're getting a little strange in their prizes that they give.

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,840
We did it.

97
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,460
We did it.

98
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,840
Yeah, I sold a lot too.

99
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,960
But I thought it would be a trip.

100
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,900
A trip to Bermuda.

101
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,680
Or maybe to Aruba.

102
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,520
Or Paris.

103
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,080
Or the Virgin Islands.

104
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,320
I'd like to go there.

105
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,180
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

106
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,020
It isn't.

107
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:39,360
Do you think we're in position now what we can call?

108
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,000
No, not yet.

109
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,820
Well, I said we could call later.

110
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,200
I have to get beyond the atmosphere.

111
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm not sure if I can get the number.

112
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,520
I'll see if I can get the number.

113
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,540
It'll be busy.

114
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,600
Oh, no.

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,760
Is it next time?

116
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,760
Busy?

117
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,520
Yeah, busy.

118
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,620
This is ridiculous.

119
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,180
How can she be busy at a time like this?

120
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,060
Listen, women have other things to do.

121
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,300
Darling.

122
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,880
Come on, now, calm down.

123
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,020
Darling.

124
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,360
Oh, come on.

125
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,700
Here, take this.

126
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,220
Come on.

127
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,020
Here's a glass.

128
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,680
Take this.

129
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,460
Here you go.

130
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,940
Here you go.

131
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:15,940


132
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:15,940


133
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:15,940


134
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:15,940


135
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,940
Go ahead, take it.

136
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,920
You'll feel better.

137
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,900
Take it.

138
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,580
It's silly.

139
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,820
Take them now.

140
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,360
I lost control.

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,440
Yeah, I know you did.

142
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,180
Do you want to go see?

143
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,900
Yeah, here you are.

144
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,500
Take it.

145
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,060
Whatever.

146
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,580
There was still a white one.

147
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,140
Take it.

148
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,700
Look at this little water.

149
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,720
Yeah, here you are.

150
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,800
Oh, calm down.

151
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,960
Calm down.

152
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,900
I don't want to look out of the porthole.

153
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,300
Oh, you look out of the porthole.

154
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,780
See that?

155
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,360
Look.

156
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,760
I don't care what you see.

157
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,600
No kidding.

158
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,980
It's what we've always wanted.

159
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,700
Look.

160
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,920
What do you mean?

161
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,640
Look.

162
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,240
You're kidding.

163
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,840
No.

164
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,200
You're not.

165
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,840
No.

166
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,640
You're not kidding?

167
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,680
No, I'm not kidding.

168
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,380
The mortarball bleeds unceasingly.

169
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,280
Horrible but true.

170
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,000
He's, though he is dead, yet his corpse still bleeds.

171
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,940
See you later, Bob.

172
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,940
See you later.

173
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:15,940


174
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:15,940


175
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:15,940


176
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:15,940


177
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:15,940


178
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:15,940


179
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:15,940


180
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,420
He's so thrilled with the blood of Bob.

181
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,560
So in the throes, so deep in the throes of rapture.

182
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,220
He'll have to be dragged out of here feet first.

183
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,060
A female egg.

184
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,400
Glory.

185
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,340
What kind of devil's are you?

186
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,800
The baptism in the blood of Bob.

187
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Wait four hours and you won't believe what you're seeing.

188
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,700
Will it be the contaminated Kool-Aid or will it be the placebo?

189
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,840
One lucky bottle.

190
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,020
One lucky bottle.

191
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,160
One lucky bottle.

192
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,660
Has the.

193
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,880
Extra ingredient.

194
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
Have a funcipula.

195
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,440
That's for Bob to know and the rest of us to find out, I'm afraid.

196
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,380
It's locked in the prescriptures and we're still trying to translate them.

197
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,780
Fortunately, the damage is much, much greater than I.

198
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,020
So we want to be a doctor for Bob.

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,520
Dodge his drink of his blood, eat of his flesh and win the stuffed Garfield.

200
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:31,060
Now, when a Snoopy impressed the little lady and win her a Snoopy by withstanding the onslaught of the blood of Bob as it rushes through your system, wreaking havoc on your brain cells, liver and heart.

201
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,520
But what does that kill you makes you stronger.

202
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,640
Step right up.

203
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,780
The blood of Bob is flowing freely.

204
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,180
Even years after his death.

205
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,300
His hideous death.

206
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,120
Available.

207
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,660
For.

208
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,140
To be shown on your home TV with a rise.

209
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,220
The subgenius video.

210
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,280
You won't believe your eyes.

211
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:06,360
Alarmed Santa Fe parents met again with elementary school officials last night to discuss the growing presence of Bob in the schools.

212
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:13,340
Bob, the deity of the Dallas based Church of the subgenius, is a comic book character who communicates with aliens and worships money.

213
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,020
Parents and teachers.

214
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:22,640
Complain that the Bob stickers and pamphlets which have turned up in school laboratories with increasing frequency encourage troublemakers and weird behavior.

215
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,340
It's not healthy for the children.

216
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm convinced of this.

217
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,840
There has been a pamphlet going around a Bob pamphlet that I have looked at and it's the least well adjusted.

218
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,160
Children really pick up.

219
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,620
It tells them that if they are uncomfortable with their class.

220
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,760
It is because they are better than their classmates.

221
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,960
Can you imagine this?

222
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,340
Better.

223
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,440
Not smarter mind you, but better.

224
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,860
Wise up!

225
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,160
They're out to get you.

226
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,260
The difference between us is caused by a global conspiracy.

227
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,000
Weird men arise!

228
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,780
Find out who they are and how to smash them.

229
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,080
You probably already knew that the US government is a sham.

230
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,500
Something propped up there for you to blame.

231
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,600
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

232
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,820
That they are actually shambling?

233
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,820
Unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?

234
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,560
Yes.

235
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,140
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet.

236
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,140
Defy the sinister star forces which mock us all.

237
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,300
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

238
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,040
God has been misquoted all this time.

239
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,660
His actual words may disturb you, but Bob Dodds.

240
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,000
This is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind.

241
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,620
Repent.

242
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,840
Quit your job.

243
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,280
Slack off.

244
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,120
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

245
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,160
Now the crowd's starting to get upset.

246
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,500
People are running back and forth.

247
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
They're really scared.

248
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,460
Oh, they're traveling alone.

249
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,640
Pick it up.

250
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,540
No!

251
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:11,700
No!

252
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,040
Is he waiting there for me?

253
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,560
The eternal pipe has been lit.

254
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,720
The eternal pipe lighter.

255
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,080
It's difficult.

256
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,520
Many of the suits that the crowd wears for protection will melt it.

257
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,420
At least decide to use the clean shirt.

258
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,000
Most of these people probably won't live to see the end of this tape.

259
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,940
The End

260
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,200
The End

261
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,520
The End

262
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:41,520


263
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


264
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,280
A 10 year cycle will end in 1998.

265
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,980
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon.

266
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,520
Which in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change.

267
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,020
And carnage, insanity and destruction than all of mankind's history and pre-history before it.

268
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,600
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

269
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,820
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know,

270
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,520
While billions will look for a way out.

271
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,540
of deserving conspiracy dupes fry in hell on earth.

272
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,080
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob,

273
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,100
will usher in a spiritual rebirth

274
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,380
and a cascade of astounding mysteries,

275
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,980
supernatural riches, and a restoration

276
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,760
of lost psychic abilities that will totally transform

277
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,340
the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

278
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,000
Bob.

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,300
Bob.

280
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,420
Bob is here for one reason and one reason only.

281
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,100
That's to bring slack to the slackest.

282
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,880
Jesus had it bad.

283
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,080
Wait until you see what they're gonna do to you, my friend.

284
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,820
Bob.

285
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,240
Bob.

286
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,940
What's gonna happen to your children?

287
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,440
What's gonna happen to your children?

288
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,560
What's gonna happen to you when it's the society we created?

289
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,280
When it's the society we created?

290
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,140
Air conditioning.

291
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,680
The society of air conditioning.

292
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,420
Station wagons with wooden sides.

293
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,080
Station wagons with wooden sides.

294
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,740
Cautious indeed.

295
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,220
A retired actor.

296
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,320


297
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,320


298
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,320


299
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,920
A retired actor.

300
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,220
Orange hail.

301
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,300
Orange hail.

302
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,700
Orange hail.

303
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,160
What happens when that collapses?

304
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,380
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

305
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,760
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

306
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,040
That's when the man from Planet X-9.

307
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,740
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

308
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,520
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

309
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,980
The church of the subgenius.

310
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,880
It's no name.

311
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,860
It can be me or me or a boy or a girl or a fair.

312
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,680
The church of the subgenius.

313
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,860
You're not allowed out.

314
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,680
For many of us, there is no physical escape

315
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,020
from their clutches or any hope of it until the exes come

316
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,340
and the followers of Yahweh one prevail.

317
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,480
But until that day, the power and wisdom of Bob

318
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,420
can help us break their mind control

319
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,340
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

320
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,440
If you have a problem with your cash flow,

321
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,420
it's because your cash is not flowing towards Bob.

322
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,020
So the pinks in the valley of the golf green

323
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,720
shall fall upon their checkbooks and mate with them

324
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,300
to produce monsters and devils and signs and portents.

325
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,920
And to you, if you will send a dollar.

326
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,520
If you send a dollar.

327
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,020
Or more.

328
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,800
Or more.

329
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,380
He has to protect you.

330
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,980
Jehovah One says Bob will protect you.

331
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,840
Odin has been resurrected in conjunction with the doctors

332
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,100
of Bob.

333
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,140
These gods are false.

334
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,840
Bob said he was going to come down.

335
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,200
Bob came down.

336
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,400
I say amen.

337
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,740
And Bob has come to us to make sure the end of the world

338
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,960
happens properly.

339
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,020
Actually, Bob just uses me as an instrument of death.

340
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,040
Bob kills.

341
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,720
He's really good.

342
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,040
You should hand him the radio, man.

343
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm down there.

344
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:41,820
OK.

345
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,100
OK.

346
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,380
You say it can't be true.

347
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,640
Run that by me again.

348
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,640
I don't, what do you mean?

349
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,440
Oh Bob.

350
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,240
Oh Bob.

351
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,760
Oh Bob.

352
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,440
Give me food.

353
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,460
Give me money.

354
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,160
Give me food.

355
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,100
Give me everything.

356
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:55,860
Bob.

357
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,700
Actually, the church of the subgenius world,

358
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,680
the real church, will have gone underground.

359
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,900
Put your hands.

360
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,820
Put your hands on the radio.

361
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,340
Because we're so good at developing

362
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,660
our abnormality potential.

363
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,480
at least people who've been not necessarily with the church,

364
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,720
but who have just somewhere along the line realized,

365
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,080
whether they call themselves subgeniuses or not,

366
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,260
there's a hell of a lot of people around who do exercise their abnormality potential,

367
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,320
which is the only way to stay free of the conspiracy programming that's just constantly on you.

368
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,300
You will pay to know what you really think.

369
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,220
I was sitting in the restaurant talking about Bob,

370
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,980
and all of a sudden when Bob came in, we just suddenly realized it was Bob.

371
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,620
It's us versus them.

372
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,060
The power of the stark fist.

373
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,180
We all want to avoid the stark fist of removal.

374
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,340
For this reason, queer dream, not collegiate.

375
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,220
This religion lying around in your house unattended.

376
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,360
And we suggest that you follow it as far as it will go, no matter where it takes you.

377
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,180
Unless you want a decimated world, you'll be plunging into survivalist insanity.

378
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,080
This is your last chance. This may be your only hope.

379
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,580
So sure, it's the new age. It's a new destiny for America.

380
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,960
A time of cataclysmic chaos.

381
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,680
A time of economic change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know,

382
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,560
which means those who send us money and subscribe to the magazines.

383
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,080
Shut up, pink boy.

384
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,560
Well, uh, after I do that, what are you gonna do for me?

385
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,320
Slack.

386
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,880
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

387
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,480
Crowd's shooting. Back.

388
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,240
What is waiting there for me?

389
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,680
I'm gonna go get some rifles.

390
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,120
It's total chaos.

391
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,020
Yes.

392
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,760
This is Dr. Bob, the owner of a telly to you.

393
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,200
Good. Have fun. Be cool.

394
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,840
And don't ever usurp the word Bob.

395
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,280
May the stark fist of removal spare you for one more day.

396
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,980
You don't wanna get killed, you better get Bob the Brown right now!

397
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,960
I was just learning from some jokester.

398
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:25,960


399
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,060
Are you sure you want to play me?

400
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,100
Why not?

401
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,580
I意思-

402
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:31,580


403
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,760
You should haveочкуzatof.

404
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,220
I wouldma liked you to.

405
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,220


406
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,220


407
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,220


408
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,600
I don't know.

409
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,180
I don't know.

410
00:18:33,220 --> 00:19:03,180
I don't know.

411
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,720
I don't know.

412
00:19:33,220 --> 00:20:01,040
I don't know.

413
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:31,280
I don't know.

414
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,940
I don't know.

415
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:28,600
I don't know.

416
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,240
I don't know.

417
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,520
I don't know.

418
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:47,740
Bob?

419
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,680
The message is now part of

420
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,200
in redships,

421
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,220
registered in your subconscious mind

422
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,300
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

423
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,520
What about slack?

424
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,500
That's your key phrase.

425
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,300
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

426
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,060
You can smoke your rug if you want to.

427
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,700
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

428
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,540
Stop right there.

429
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,200
Intensifying our prospects' desires, that's when the wheels of action begin to move.

430
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,400
Sorry for jumping in, doctors. Go on.

431
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,680
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values.

432
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,960
He plans to attend this rare personal appearance of Dr. Dobbs, just his second in the past four years.

433
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,820
Well, do you have your tickets yet?

434
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,260
Even if you never intend to write your name again,

435
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,520
one sure way to impress folks is to stay a little bit over their heads.

436
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,280
Because it was better than looking stupid.

437
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,140
This fear of looking less than brilliant is a major communication simple familiar incidence.

438
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,580
If we put these three elements under the microscope,

439
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,640
we can't help but sharpen the focus on our communication efforts.

440
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,420
It's natural that we follow the circle around and around and around,

441
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,920
helping to create a nice round world of confusion and misunderstanding.

442
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,540
Resist the temptation to feed your ego.

443
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,160
Have you seen our chateau?

444
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,460
You'll find it on the bureau.

445
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,500
So many demands.

446
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,100
Everyone grabbing for a part of me.

447
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,960
And now these new voices,

448
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,080
encouraging me to spend time developing my own talents.

449
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,700
How can I possibly please them all?

450
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,960
And here we get to something very important in the Church of the Subgenius.

451
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,500
And that is, all of you that have been raised here,

452
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,600
whether you're Buddhist or Mohammed or Jewish or Christian,

453
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:57,700
you've been taught that your leader, your God, your Savior, your Messiah,

454
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,520
is a man worth everything.

455
00:23:59,540 --> 00:23:59,660
You've been regulated.

456
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,880
Bob!

457
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,200
Bob is not a man to copy.

458
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,000
As Bob says, I don't practice what I preach,

459
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,540
because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to.

460
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,240
Bob also says, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

461
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,000
You see, Bob, you see children,

462
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,360
one of the most important rules of the Church of the Subgenius

463
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,540
is that the church lets you pull the wool over your own eyes.

464
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,020
Now, children, when you pull the wool over your own eyes,

465
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,160
it's not like a church is doing it.

466
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,140
Why, the great churches want you to pull the wool over your own eyes

467
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,440
and keep it there.

468
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,040
We want you to pull the wool over your own eyes

469
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,780
and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

470
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,500
And after a while, children,

471
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,320
you're going to get sick of those delusions

472
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,740
and you're going to start thinking for yourself.

473
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,460
Hey, Bob! Hey, Bob!

474
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,760
That's what Bob wants you to do.

475
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,420
Well, we take our initiates

476
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,760
and we string a little tendon between their heels

477
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,560
and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

478
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,860
Then we dip them in the sacred water of the sludge.

479
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,720
And what exactly does this do for them?

480
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,720
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned

481
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,120
and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,

482
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,800
the imprinting of the true subgenius.

483
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,720
What is the law?

484
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,720
Not to endlessly intone the law.

485
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,540
That is the law.

486
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,220
Are we not men?

487
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,040
What is the law?

488
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,460
Not to endlessly intone the law.

489
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,080
That is the law.

490
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,800
Are we not men?

491
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,920
What is the law?

492
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,040
Not to endlessly intone the law.

493
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,660
That is the law.

494
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,380
Are we not men?

495
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,960
It may be that some of you here

496
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,260
are indeed yourselves human.

497
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,200
In fact,

498
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:02,040
In fact, most of you here are probably pink human beings.

499
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
It's possible.

500
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,600
And that's why we're here.

501
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,140
Soon it happens.

502
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,720
In an order like this we may have guidelines, but you must remember not to be literal-minded.

503
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,580
No subgenius follows any two rules exactly.

504
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,680
You must also remember that anything any subgenius says at any time is sacred dogma automatically.

505
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,360
And now the rules of the Church of the Subgenius.

506
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,940
The first rule of the Church of the Subgenius is the subgenius must have?

507
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,720
What must he have?

508
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,200
What must he have?

509
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,540
What must the subgenius have?

510
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,460
Dog, what must he have?

511
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,080
He must have slack.

512
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,000
Help me out here, dog.

513
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,600
The second rule of the Church of the Subgenius is too much is always better than not enough.

514
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,520
Can I get a too much?

515
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,860
Can I get another too much?

516
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,340
Can I get another too much?

517
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,620
Too much is better than not enough.

518
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,960
Oh, but too many of those, children, it's always better than not enough.

519
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,660
The third rule of the Church of the Subgenius is a rule violated every day, every way you go.

520
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,520
People say to me, who is a conspiracy?

521
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,140
Look and see who violates this rule and you will know them by their actions.

522
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,540
The third rule of the Church of the Subgenius is if you don't have a sense of humor, don't try to be funny.

523
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Don't try to be funny.

524
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,920
The fourth rule of the Church of the Subgenius, thank you, Buck, and one of the most important rules that supersedes all other rules is?

525
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,980
If they can't take a joke!

526
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
If they can't take a joke!

527
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,200
You must draw your own conclusions.

528
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,760
You've got to believe me.

529
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,780
I'm here to help you.

530
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,460
You've got to believe me.

531
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,580
You've got to believe me.

532
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,680
Help me escape.

533
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,340
Help me escape.

534
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:49,340


535
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,080
You've got to believe me.

536
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,640
You've got to believe me.

537
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,020
You've got to believe me.

538
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,480
Keep listening to those letters backwards.

539
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,700
Don't play with that word.

540
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,800
Only listen backwards.

541
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,980
It gets a lot of...

542
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,380
Ita hinam kumkif tihad,

543
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,860
Ri'ah'ul i'lein anv'zin,

544
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:16,300
Kut'izamah lasolach nam itan...

545
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,160
Uh...

546
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,720
Uh...

547
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:18,960
Uh...

548
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:30,120
I have received a full range of messages from your spiritual source.

549
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,760
You could have been the most gorgeous creature in the whole world.

550
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,800
If you come near anyone in my family, I have to kill you.

551
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,620
I'm sorry.

552
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,860
You are...

553
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,200
At the present time, you are just covered with filth and you will hurt my family.

554
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,440
And I have no choice but to retaliate, you know?

555
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,940
And I have superior powers to anything that you are aware of.

556
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:01,820
And I must tell you right now, I have no toleration for evil.

557
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,780
I will destroy it when I meet it.

558
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,880
And this way we're fair and square.

559
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
I understand that you loved Bob.

560
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,280
And that maybe you and Bob are...

561
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,460
Somehow...

562
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,080
Uh...

563
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,520
Help each other in a good way.

564
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,460
I don't know.

565
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,560
You will not attack people.

566
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,240
You will not turn them into frogs.

567
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,000
If you stay in the United States, you will be destroyed.

568
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,820
One way or another.

569
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,640
It's a waste of your time to remain in the United States.

570
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,600
Forget about it.

571
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,460
That is my advice to you.

572
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,180
Take it or leave it.

573
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,060
And stop harassing me.

574
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,320
I want to kill her.

575
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,120
Obviously you don't want to.

576
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,920
I want to kill you, Connie.

577
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,220
I want to kill you.

578
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,500
I'm so tired.

579
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,700
Get your hands off me.

580
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,660
How can we tell whether our friends are ready to walk the path of Dobbs?

581
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,000
Surely just not by the t-shirts they wear or the pipes in their mouths.

582
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,740
Acubating.

583
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,440
You know, tonight I thought we might talk about love and hate.

584
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,180
Ah, yea, verily the pastor speaks the holy word.

585
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,640
And I thought tonight we might discuss that much known but little observed phenomenon, unrequited hate.

586
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,000
Yes?

587
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,660
Yes, as it is known in the church.

588
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,740
Think of how many times you've been in love.

589
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,680
Think of how unpleasant you felt.

590
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,280
You're dragged out.

591
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,520
You're depressed.

592
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,200
You're uncertain.

593
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,540
You're stomach hurt.

594
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,480
Now, don't trust that.

595
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:26,800
Hello?

596
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,000
Hi.

597
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,100
Hi.

598
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,440
Listen, I'm tuned into your station.

599
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,820
I'm just wondering what the hell's going on.

600
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,600
Well, us too.

601
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,560
So you help us out.

602
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:39,720
I am the Pope of New York, flown out here especially to preach the gospel of Bob and the church of the subgenius to you, young lady.

603
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,900
Do you have enough slack in your life?

604
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Do I have a lot of slack?

605
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:42,900
What?

606
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,880
Do you have enough slack in your life?

607
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,940
Enough what?

608
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,640
Slack.

609
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:46,880
Slack.

610
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,820
Yes, the spazz, trisher, macho irony.

611
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,040
I am sure that on a car radio this probably sounds like vegetable soup.

612
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,060
Just put in here that half of the dolphin's sexual drive is released through the blowhole.

613
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,020
And the other half is released through the church of the subgenius.

614
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,440
Thank you for that testimonial.

615
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,180
Clean your own blowhole, would you please?

616
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,160
Yes.

617
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,640
We have a special brush here available for that church.

618
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,080
The brush and soap department of the church here.

619
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,780
Andy's using one of those brushes right now.

620
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,740
Yes, I can lay hands on you and drive the demons of Yucatan for a half-bottom brush.

621
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,140
I can drag you slack with the very touching of the tentacles of the Pope.

622
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,700
That's right.

623
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,620
Andy's using one of those brushes on Channel 5 right now.

624
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,820
Yes, it's tuned up in color.

625
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,080
And if you don't believe I can heal with my mere hands, just ask Andy about the hands of the Pope.

626
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,660
There's all around me.

627
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,360
And yet God asks that we worship him by...

628
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,780
Holy living.

629
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,460
Today?

630
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,400
Can he really mean that?

631
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,760
She thinks you can cure the world by kindness and rules.

632
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,480
But it's too small.

633
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,160
The Lord's prayer on a pinhead.

634
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:00,020
Some make rules, some obey, but the rules are for the fools is what I say.

635
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,700
Why do you suppose he did it?

636
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,500
I don't know.

637
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,500
But I'm beginning to suspect something so fantastic that I've got to find out about it.

638
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,940
Now I ask you.

639
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,180
I ask you, sir or lady.

640
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,920
Thank you.

641
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,220
What brand, what brand did Jesus smoke?

642
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,120
Now you didn't know that one either.

643
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,340
Did your preacher know that Jesus smoked Chesterfields?

644
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,360
Did you know that smoking was a sin unless it's Chesterfields?

645
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,660
Now Jesus, Jesus, Jesus smoked them.

646
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,240
Yet they did not exist 2,000 years ago.

647
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,640
We must accept this on faith.

648
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,080
There's no logical explanation for it.

649
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,980
There's no logical explanation for it.

650
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,180
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

651
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,540
So you must ask, so you must ask yourself.

652
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,160
Do you have slack?

653
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,880
Do you have slack?

654
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,920
Now Bob teaches the full gospel of slack.

655
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,660
The uncut, X-rated version of slack.

656
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,400
You have your book of the subgenius.

657
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,740
Would you please turn to Pre-Scripture 715?

658
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:28,980
The question, the question posed is, how do you know you have slack?

659
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,520
How do you know?

660
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:36,200
How do you know your eternal check balance is ready to meet Bob?

661
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,820
Why?

662
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,420
Why?

663
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,300
Can I get a testimony?

664
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,920
I used to hang around in airports and I used to sell books.

665
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,420
And I'd stand on a street corner with flowers.

666
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,360
And I would do anything that my religion asked me to do.

667
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,840
But now I've got more sense.

668
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,080
Now I've got Bob Dobbs.

669
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,300
Dobbs has saved me.

670
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,160
He showed me slack.

671
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:04,420
Slack, being able to edit your own memory and cut your attention span down to just three little minutes.

672
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,180
You can program your life.

673
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,800
Just like that TV guy.

674
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,080
SLACK!

675
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,620
I want you to witness now his psychosomatic healing influence.

676
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:21,060
If you're listening to me now, if you hear my voice on the radio, I want you to feel the inner power of your own slack center.

677
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:28,660
I want you to stand up from where you're sitting now and come over to the radio where you hear my voice reaching out to you.

678
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:35,040
I want to heal your lifeless slack center brothers and sisters and make your brain whole again.

679
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,780
You can hear me now brothers and sisters.

680
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,660
I want you to come close to the radio.

681
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,820
I want you to lean over and put your head on the radio.

682
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,820
That's right brothers and sisters.

683
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,240
I want you to put your head on the radio and feel the healing power from my voice.

684
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,720
I want to reach out to your slack center.

685
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:03,440
I want you to feel every brain cell in your slack center awaken and rise up reborn in the glorious light of the subgenius personality reorder.

686
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,020
I'm calling out to you.

687
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:14,540
I'm calling out to those chosen few brain cells that can lead you out of the darkness and misery if you only put your head on the radio and feel the power of my words.

688
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:29,980
I command the forces of the conspiracy to be cast out and your slack center to rise up and issue forth righteous nerve impulses so ye shall receive slack without end and thy nervous system shall be as one with the almighty Bob.

689
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,260
If now you'll only put your head on the radio.

690
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,360
Get upside down.

691
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,000
Get off the radio.

692
00:35:48,040 --> 00:36:05,000
All these God and karatjetoral dead couches

693
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,660
You've found a new and interesting way of earning extra income, right?

694
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,700
In fact, quite a bit of extra income, if that's your goal.

695
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,940
Even the chance for a whole new lifestyle.

696
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,580
Why not share it? It's certainly to your benefit

697
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,440
and to the benefit of those you sponsor.

698
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,860
Slack is dollar bills.

699
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,200
Slack is drugs. Slack is a warm home.

700
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,420
Slack is the car you drive.

701
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,000
Slack is the job you do for money.

702
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,780
Slack is that which the conspiracy stole from you.

703
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,260
They don't love you, Bob.

704
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,040
They don't love you, Bob.

705
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,360
They don't love you like I do.

706
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,620
I want to meet him.

707
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,760
Many have seen him.

708
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,640
You try to meet Bob and you never will.

709
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,920
So this is the closest I'm going to get to meeting Bob.

710
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,860
No, no, one day a man will come up to you and tell you something you don't really need

711
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,640
and when he does, you have been touched by Bob.

712
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,400
And you will have to have it.

713
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,600
And Slack is something so hard for people to understand,

714
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,920
especially in this country.

715
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,260
In a great deal of the rest of the world, it's very simple.

716
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,160
Slack is having enough food in your stomach.

717
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:18,600
Very simple. But in America, we are plagued with false Slack.

718
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,000
And false money. False sex.

719
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,160
False everything.

720
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,940
Bob delivers the real thing.

721
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,800
The real pills. The pills of revolution, my friend.

722
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,640
If it can only move, it can re-move.

723
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,240
I want one of you two to deliver me a rant.

724
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,400
What do you think we've been doing?

725
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,720
It's not enough to be done that way. You must also work.

726
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,740
The next rule of the church and the subgenius is if you act like a dumb

727
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,160
they'll treat you like an equal.

728
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,880
Like a what?

729
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,620
Like a what?

730
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,440
If you act like a what?

731
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,200
They'll treat you like an equal.

732
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,100
They will drown you in their mediocrity.

733
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,520
They will force you to kneel to their level.

734
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,120
But you will fight them. You will not be alone.

735
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,660
But you will fight them, children.

736
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,700
The next rule of the church and the subgenius is a rule that's only become necessary in the last 10 or 12 years.

737
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,840
Movements have appeared.

738
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,600
Vast ships, clippers upon the horizon to bring the rest of us to salvation.

739
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,820
Well, ships attract bollocks, mollusks, and barnacles, as you well know.

740
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,420
And here in the church of the subgenius, those bollocks and mollusks

741
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,320
are the form of hip wimps.

742
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,800
And the next rule of the church and the subgenius is no hip wimps.

743
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,320
No what?

744
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,580
No hip wimps.

745
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:35,700
What?

746
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,700
No hip wimps, children. No hip wimps.

747
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,520
Don't join this church looking to get cool off us.

748
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,360
Don't join this church looking to suck the slack out of Bob because he won't help you.

749
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,240
Kill me.

750
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,120
There are people beyond redemption.

751
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,420
Yes, there are even people who've been killed.

752
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,500
Those money will not let them into the church.

753
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,580
They might buy a membership, yes.

754
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,620
They might attend meetings.

755
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,780
They might even yell when the pope calls upon them,

756
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,760
but deep in their heart, they're hip wimps.

757
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,480
Another type of false compensation or over-assertiveness

758
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,840
is exemplified in the one who always comes late to every gathering

759
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,960
in order for everyone to notice him when he arrives

760
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,980
and who leaves early so that people will notice when he leaves

761
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,800
or who is constantly name-dropping.

762
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,360
After he said that, then he said,

763
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,120
Arise, take up your bed and go your way to your house.

764
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,420
Take up your bed and walk.

765
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,880
Then he stretched out on the floor.

766
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,980
Remember today.

767
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,280
Time out for fun.

768
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,920
Time out for fun.

769
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,800
We are out of here.

770
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,680
That is my favorite song for sure.

771
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,200
Oh, where?

772
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,680
Out of that Belfast battle zone.

773
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:08,120
Slave driver drove his tank into his reserved parking spot

774
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,900
and stepped out looking like Margaret Thatcher.

775
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,140
The war was on.

776
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,060
Ah, the keys on the typewriter had sharp points

777
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,780
that kept sticking into the keys.

778
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,620
They were pointing to our fingers.

779
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,580
The dictating equipment started asking us questions.

780
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,780
And our beepers sent electric shocks

781
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,240
just through our body like a cattle prod.

782
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,540
Out in the warehouse, the trucks kept banging into the docks,

783
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,680
not even thinking about stopping.

784
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,600
Oh, our frail bodies were strapped to the chairs,

785
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,200
and our chairs were chained to the desks.

786
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,160
Our pleas for justice were ignored,

787
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,020
and the end seemed near.

788
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:11,120
But we busted our Margaret Thatcher slave driver's little bitty . . .

789
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,160
We've charged out of their brick fortress.

790
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:21,340
The streets are ours because it's Friday.

791
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,280
Friday!

792
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,060
Friday!

793
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,680
But you see, it doesn't matter.

794
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,980
It doesn't matter how sinful you are.

795
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,960
It don't matter how much you've had to kiss

796
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,760
on some ignorant lout who happens to make more money than you.

797
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,980
You can still find slack!

798
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,700
Now, unfortunately,

799
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,080
unfortunately, that doesn't set well with many.

800
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,660
No siree.

801
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,360
Most of you, most of you,

802
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,440
most of you believe that you already have slack.

803
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,980
That ain't what Jesus said.

804
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,360
Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction.

805
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,320
Narrow is the way that leadeth to life.

806
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,740
And few there be that find it.

807
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,780
Few, he said.

808
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,300
So, you must ask yourself,

809
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,000
why do you think you're a subgenius?

810
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,600
How do you know you have slack?

811
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,460
As the prophet hyperclete said,

812
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,700
many hear the call,

813
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,400
but few have correct change for the pay toilets.

814
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,540
Now, this is harsh.

815
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,120
This is harsh.

816
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,440
It's blunt, but it's true.

817
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,780
Most of the churches in this country,

818
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,180
in Canada, and around the world,

819
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,700
they go by the name of subgenius,

820
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,600
or Christian, or Hindu, or Muslim.

821
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,400
Most of these churches do not teach a full gospel of slack

822
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,240
and are by and large useless.

823
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,240
Most of the preachers,

824
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,340
hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of preachers,

825
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,420
do not preach a full gospel of slack.

826
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,680
Most of them preach no slack at all.

827
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,120
But some do.

828
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,160
Some do.

829
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:03,920
Some do.

830
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,580
Thank God for the good churches.

831
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,980
And there are some, but they're precious few.

832
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,000
Most of the people,

833
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,760
millions upon millions of people,

834
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,020
all over the world,

835
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,300
do not know Bob,

836
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,560
do not have slack.

837
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,020
Have never been re-killed in Bob's mighty fire.

838
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,180
And unless they get slack,

839
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,420
they will die without Bob

840
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,860
and be lost forever.

841
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,500
They don't love you, Bob.

842
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,240
They don't love you, Bob.

843
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,560
They don't love you like I do.

844
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,720
This face,

845
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,060
this face,

846
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,840
I've given my life for this face.

847
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,440
Do you like pain?

848
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,440
No, pink.

849
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,140
Oh, pink.

850
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,700
No, I like pain.

851
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,860
He likes pink.

852
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,920
But the pain comes strictly through mind absorption,

853
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,680
through many teaching techniques.

854
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,620
Bob and the word of Bob teaches you to recapture the slack

855
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,860
that the conspiracy took away from you

856
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,280
the minute that doctor hit your butt when you were born.

857
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,260
Can you guys give the listeners a definition

858
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,160
or some definitions of slack?

859
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,900
Slack by definition is indefinable.

860
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,220
It's an essence that if you have to ask what it is,

861
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,820
you've probably never had it unless you think about it.

862
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,480
Those who say don't know and those who don't know.

863
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,920
The difference between slack and no slack

864
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,700
was the time you were 14 and finally called that girl up

865
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,160
and when she knew who you were

866
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,520
when you identified yourself on the phone,

867
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,300
that was the beginning of slack, you see.

868
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,720
But then again, getting the date or anything like that was not slack.

869
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,800
It was that moment when suddenly something went

870
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,000
the way you wanted it to go without you thinking about it.

871
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,000
It was something that was totally not involved

872
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
when your feet were involved rather than your head.

873
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,860
Slack is getting things to run smooth without trying.

874
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,720
You give up and you get everything.

875
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,880
It's like a submission of the self to the white overlighting in Buddhism.

876
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,200
The Atman surrenders to the holy oneness without thinking about it.

877
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,480
It's not give to get, it's give up and get anyway.

878
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,580
It's repent, quit your job and get rich.

879
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,200
Get rich, slack off, my friend.

880
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,000
Don't be embarrassed.

881
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,260
And Bob will give you slack.

882
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,380
Bob watches over drunkards, idiots, frop heads and all subgeniuses.

883
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,860
Slack is like going through that old wallet that you lost so long ago

884
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,220
and found it in a big dust ball in the corner of the room.

885
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,480
You go through it, you find a $100 bill in it.

886
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,320
Man, that's slack.

887
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:36,400
And Reverend Stang tries to remind us that we're born with slack

888
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,600
and if you don't have any, then someone else has got it.

889
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,180
Because you got your share and if you don't have it,

890
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,480
it's where it shouldn't be.

891
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,120
And that's the conspiracy.

892
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,240
It's that boss that treats workers like they were property.

893
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,960
But if you have lost it, it is possible to get it back.

894
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,760
Through Bob.

895
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,920
Withholding tax takes away the slack.

896
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,480
I mean, you know, people have to realize that they're spending incredible amounts of money

897
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,000
that isn't worth anything on short duration pleasures of the flesh.

898
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,260
False slack, my friend.

899
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,400
The money they pay for that Porsche, the money they pay for that Z car.

900
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,380
Not only false slack, but false sex.

901
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,100
False sex.

902
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,240
Massage, polis, yellow rose, topless bars in Austin Tech.

903
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,800
All of that stuff, you know, that's false.

904
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,240
For less than that, they could spend a paltry $20,

905
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,440
less than drinks for one person in one evening and achieve salvation.

906
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,500
True slack.

907
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,280
You can evolve through laziness.

908
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,840
It can be done.

909
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,460
You can get rich off procrastination.

910
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,720
That book is a powerful tool.

911
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,680
Test subjects with a high hostility index have been found to die earlier than the folks

912
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,900
who sit back and put their feet up on their desks and just relax.

913
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,800
Folks who never hurry or get upset that things are so screwed up.

914
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,280
The so-called type B personalities who just go along and take life as it comes,

915
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:58,780
never complaining, never worrying or fretting as the world crumbles around them.

916
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,880
Don't you hate people like that?

917
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,940
Don't they make you sick?

918
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,260
Get you mad with their cavalier, doesn't bother me attitude?

919
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,320
Researchers tell us that roughly half of the population is that way.

920
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,380
The other half is our way.

921
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,820
The type A personalities.

922
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,800
Now these who are ruining their health,

923
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,540
well the research is obviously incomplete as to why type A's die quicker, I have an idea.

924
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,320
It's having to do all the work and the worrying that the type B's leave us.

925
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,640
I'm Dick Alexander.

926
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,800
But this is a living dead I see and I have to bring reality.

927
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,140
Because the whole world knows that any jackass who would believe in a guy

928
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,820
that could really control the universe would have to be a good friend of mine.

929
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,180
Right?

930
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,800
But he had to be such a good friend of mine that he couldn't do anything.

931
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,400
He couldn't do anything at all.

932
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,900
Unless he related to the fact that I could control my own mind.

933
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,460
Now once the Yakutisma has been evocated

934
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,920
and once the energies have started to flow through you,

935
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,080
you've become to the centering of the seeing.

936
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,840
Not the being but the seeing.

937
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,320
And the visualization of the true work.

938
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,000
The one thing you want to do so badly.

939
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,720
Now with the injection of this age force that you have received

940
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,920
through the regulation of the cash flow and the invoking of the Yakutismic forces

941
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,000
and the true aesthetic beauty life death force of the universe is coursing through your veins.

942
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:31,160
We now look at our work and go through it.

943
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,220
Plan every step of it.

944
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,100
Every, every facet of it.

945
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,880
Until there it is.

946
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,400
Crafted.

947
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,040
Polished.

948
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,100
Completely, perfectly assembled.

949
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,460
The great jewel.

950
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,560
The great jewel of something.

951
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:50,260
Some great expression that we have wanted for so long.

952
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,840
And we focus it.

953
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,820
We examine it.

954
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,920
We look at it.

955
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,120
Holding it there with the energy from it feeding back to us, from us as it is us and we are it.

956
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,460
And then we blow it all off.

957
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,000
That's right friends.

958
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,020
At that moment.

959
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,160
We just blow it all off.

960
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:12,960
We snuff it out.

961
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,460
We throw it away.

962
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,080
We say, yeah well that could be done.

963
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,760
Could be done.

964
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,360
Could be done exactly that way.

965
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,220
I know I can.

966
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,480
And so what?

967
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,220
Why should I?

968
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,220
And when you blow something like that off.

969
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,480
Ah, the slack.

970
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,960
It doesn't trickle in friends.

971
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,320
It surges in.

972
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,740
It's a great injection of slack into you.

973
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,420
Yes.

974
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,840
Millions of people get confused about how we're saved.

975
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,640
Whether we're saved by works or by grace.

976
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,860
One says no we're saved by grace and works have nothing to do with it.

977
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,920
The other says no it's not enough to be done that way you must also work.

978
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,720
And if you don't work, then you do not have salvation.

979
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,880
Now that is a good point.

980
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,740
That is a good point.

981
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,960
Do you have slack?

982
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,360
If you display the trappings of slack.

983
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:11,900
If you give slack to others and yet do not experience the slack yourself.

984
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,540
Is that a slack for life in the manner of our Master Bob?

985
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:27,060
Or by the same token if you yourself have slack of quite a pungent odor on your body and in your spirit.

986
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,060
Your spirit.

987
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,060
But yet if you do not share of this slack.

988
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,540
And use because there's always a little extra.

989
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,700
If there's any slack at all.

990
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,920
There's a little extra.

991
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,820
To share.

992
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,620
To share.

993
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,320
That's right.

994
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,260
To share with those around you.

995
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,660
Those deserving ones.

996
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:54,480
Or else by the same token to use that slack to injure foes.

997
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,240
Because there is the curse.

998
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,600
Because once you have slack.

999
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:03,040
Now you can use it to sap an equal amount.

1000
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,560
An amount of slack.

1001
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,760
Or negate.

1002
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,740
You cannot take the slack of another subgenius exactly.

1003
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,860
But you can negate his slack.

1004
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,940
So that it does him no good.

1005
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,200
And so in other words what we're saying here is.

1006
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,580
If you have one without the other.

1007
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,120
If you have a grace of slack without the works of slack.

1008
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:25,820
And vice versa.

1009
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,040
Is it still salvation in the name of Bob?

1010
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,960
Now I think this is moot point.

1011
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,640
Because.

1012
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,140
Because if you do not have the fullness.

1013
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,660
The fullness of slack.

1014
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,460
Why?

1015
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,980
It'll make you forget what you're going to say.

1016
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,340
And so.

1017
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,340
That we would become adopted children of God in his great family.

1018
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,860
God knew who was going to be saved and who would not be saved.

1019
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,020
And the Holy Ghost commanded us to be saved.

1020
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,020


1021
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,640
And so in a way it was quickening those.

1022
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,720
The mind.

1023
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,440
I was able to think better.

1024
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,040
And I was able to learn easier.

1025
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,480
And it became a tremendous thing to me.

1026
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,620
And ladies and gentlemen.

1027
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,760
I know of one gentleman.

1028
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,320
You made my thing tremendous.

1029
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:12,980
Confess it.

1030
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,600
Confess your hell.

1031
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,960
Confess your.

1032
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,840
Your excrement.

1033
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:18,940
Confess it.

1034
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,440
Tell me about it.

1035
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,240
It is a way of life.

1036
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,200
You forget everything but Bob.

1037
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,980
You forget everything outside of the subgenius universe.

1038
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,140
And you can.

1039
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:30,580
Or.

1040
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,280
Or.

1041
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,860
When a child is fed this wonderful God.

1042
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,300
His personality is stamped.

1043
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Cemented in place.

1044
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,460
With a Bob.

1045
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,540
A righteous.

1046
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,020
Bobly.

1047
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:42,760
Way.

1048
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,160
Of thought.

1049
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:44,880
Oh.

1050
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,500
Great Bob.

1051
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,960
And I know that it has.

1052
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,260
We can see people rising.

1053
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,720
We can see the jewels of members rising.

1054
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:54,880
Yes.

1055
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,720
And friends.

1056
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,840
You can join us in that mighty.

1057
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,820
Arise.

1058
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:58,960
God.

1059
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:58,960


1060
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:58,960


1061
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:58,960


1062
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:58,960


1063
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:58,960


1064
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,280
By.

1065
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,000
Writing.

1066
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,840
For free information.

1067
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,120
That's all you have to do.

1068
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,120
Just.

1069
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,960
Just a little postcard saying.

1070
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:10,920
Oh.

1071
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,820
Please send me free information.

1072
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,040
Oh Bob.

1073
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,160
That's all you have to do.

1074
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,300
Easy isn't it.

1075
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,900
And that post office box number.

1076
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,200
Is.

1077
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,980
We'll just write to Bob.

1078
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,640
Friends.

1079
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:28,940
And.

1080
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1081
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1082
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1083
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1084
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1085
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1086
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1087
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1088
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1089
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1090
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1091
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1092
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,940


1093
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:34,120
We'll send you free information.

1094
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,240
That's all you have to do.

1095
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:36,240


1096
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:36,240


1097
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:36,460
Just a little postcard saying.

1098
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:36,460


1099
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,460
Great Bob.

1100
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:37,600
We can see the jewels of members rising.

1101
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:37,940
We can see the jewels of members rising.

1102
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,380
And.

1103
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,140
We'll just write to Bob.

1104
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:39,140


1105
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,240


1106
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,940
We'll just write to Bob.

1107
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:40,940


1108
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:40,940


1109
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:40,940


1110
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:40,940


1111
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,540
Free.

1112
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:43,540


1113
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,380
That's all.

1114
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:45,700
Just.

1115
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,480
Free.

1116
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,100
Information.

1117
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,420
It's not like you'll get.

1118
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,120
Wrapped.

1119
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:51,580
Up.

1120
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:51,960
In anything.

1121
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,380
Box.

1122
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:54,940
One.

1123
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,020
One.

1124
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,020


1125
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,020


1126
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,020


1127
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,020


1128
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,020


1129
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,020


1130
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,400
65214.

1131
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,340
Alright my involvement with the church of the subgenius has led to so much slack that

1132
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:09,600
I actually got winded getting out of bed and coming to the phone.

1133
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:20,520
Thank you Bob for cleansing my memory.

1134
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,720
Thank you Bob for helping me sleep.

1135
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:39,380
And Bob, I'll follow you all the way. That's right, Bob, until that next day.

1136
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:56,280
Thank you, Bob, for sending them pills. Thank you, Bob, for finding me willing, teenage girls.

1137
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:07,040
And Bob, I'll follow you all the way. That's right, Bob, until that next day.

1138
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,700
And now McGraw-Hill has printed 15,000 copies of the collected teachings of Bob.

1139
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,580
Over a century later, it became the phenomenon of the London and New York states.

1140
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,280
Perhaps we ought to clear up something about the book.

1141
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,060
You might find it in the humor section.

1142
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,440
This is just completely wrong.

1143
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,240
Proof of the conspiracy.

1144
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,180
It should be in the religion section.

1145
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:36,000
I found my copy in the religion section of Walden Books downtown.

1146
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,040
It should be in the cooking section.

1147
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,860
It should be in the home building section.

1148
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,920
It should be in the pet section.

1149
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,300
I mean, it's not to save your brain and your soul and your mental life for the next 10 million years.

1150
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,680
You should left him a spirit of your life.

1151
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,440
Yeah, right. It might just make you aware of the fact that you're a human being instead of a little meat machine.

1152
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,460
We don't even want to talk about that, right?

1153
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,780
We don't want to talk about expanding your imagination.

1154
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,020
You're thinking for yourself.

1155
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,120
God forbid.

1156
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,140
Yeah, you're not asleep.

1157
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,260
You're perfectly awake.

1158
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,580
No, you haven't been programmed.

1159
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,140
No.

1160
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,480
This whole stuff isn't confusing to you at all.

1161
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,120
Right.

1162
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,200
No, that's the way it goes.

1163
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,600
It's just a big joke.

1164
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,160
We don't understand all the super power that we have been given.

1165
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:17,960
Unlike any plant, animal, mineral, or anything else, we have the ability to transcend time in any of its dimensions.

1166
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,220
And instead of being afraid of time, we should use this power.

1167
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,020
There is a great deal of speculation about what is going to happen next.

1168
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,700
The tape is ready now.

1169
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,200
The lights have gone down just slightly.

1170
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,740
Choose Mars, buddy Bob.

1171
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,760
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

1172
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,900
This is it.

1173
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:44,420
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

1174
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,380
Bob is a way of life communion.

1175
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,980
Yet half of them don't even know it.

1176
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:56,000
He's the one true living slack master with the spiritual know-how to change the world.

1177
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,440
To help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven, he is the one real shortcut to slack.

1178
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:10,860
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

1179
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,040
My jungle is full of sex.

1180
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,520
Sex with only red.

1181
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,260
Sex with only black.

1182
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,980
Sex with only white.

1183
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,580
Ah!

1184
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:22,480
Mess with your bedroom, ah!

1185
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,780
Pick your own parts and be the pane,

1186
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,120
And your hair size is

1187
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,980
twenty eight.

1188
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:45,400
But the thought, his words, his us with what's ask is

1189
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,920
real doesn't demand progress.

1190
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,560
And he won't.

1191
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:59,440
We present it to ourselves so that we may realize just how important our task is.

1192
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,440
We must then open up the channels, but all at once.

1193
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:15,860
There must be no weeds to choke our careful immersed crops, and we must wait for the harvest.

1194
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:46,620
Let us begin this process immediately with a demonstration of what effects can be created with the simple use of electrical angle realization.

1195
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,620
Call now, won't you? For more of what you've come to expect from us.

1196
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:07,140
Sky, moon, a certain dependable kind of image. An image of the way you'd like people to be.

1197
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,820
Passive, pretty, white.

1198
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:19,320
As wide as the complexion of our finest women, grown right here by our special process.

1199
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,540
As wide as the complexion of our finest women, grown right here by our special process.

1200
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,540
As wide as the hair of God, white as it was in life.

1201
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,540
As wide as the blank sheet on which we write your mind.

1202
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,660
Who are we?

1203
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,680
We're the happy people.

1204
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,820
Happy to live in a world of images.

1205
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,140
Images of war, family, crime.

1206
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:49,860
Fun images that help rinse away unsightly self-images

1207
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,800
so you can get away from the privacy of your own home.

1208
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,800
After all, aren't you what everything's here for?

1209
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,900
You're what we're here for.

1210
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,680
That's why we made everything.

1211
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,540
And that's why everything made you.

1212
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,280
And that's why you made us.

1213
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,720
Who are we?

1214
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,260
We're the money people.

1215
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,640
The people who take your money.

1216
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,980
No more money hassling.

1217
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,260
But what about little Dicky, you say?

1218
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:39,280
What's little Dicky gonna do when you're working late and Wilma's minding the fort and Sis is in and out?

1219
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,380
Put away those straps and buckles. Dicky's safe with us.

1220
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,000
He's even learning to speak again. Our way.

1221
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:54,480
Best of all, he's safe with the people who know what it is you want from a world.

1222
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,400
Simplicity.

1223
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:58,660
Reliability.

1224
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:04,580
A world you can go to without worrying about whether your money is safe.

1225
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,240
You know, when we first got into this business, we didn't know much more than you.

1226
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,460
Like you, we thought there was a world out there.

1227
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,280
A world of value.

1228
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,820
A world that needed meaning.

1229
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:21,900
Beauty.

1230
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,140
Love.

1231
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,360
A world that needed a better future.

1232
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,100
Making the difference.

1233
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,520
The Fuze Machine.

1234
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,980
A world where money can save lives.

1235
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,180
Ê

1236
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:10,400
Jesús?

1237
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,380
Pares Desafios

1238
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:12,380


1239
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,700
To trash money we need now…

1240
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:16,700


1241
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,280
Not an option.

1242
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,520
Thank you.

1243
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:46,740
Thank you.
